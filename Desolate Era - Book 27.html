Chapter 1 – Swordlord
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Palace of the Sword
was incredibly large. It was like an enormous island-continent that
hovered in the air, filled with countless buildings and radiating a
sword-aura that caused Ji Ning to feel speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sword Palace had
numerous black-armored Daolords on patrol outside of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist.” A
black-armored Daolord sensed Ning’s medallion and immediately flew
towards him, then said in a fairly courteous and modest manner, “Is
this your first trip to the Sword Palace?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My name is Fudan.
Let me guide the way for you, fellow Daoist.” This black-armored
Daolord was courteous to the point of being obsequious. He glanced at
Su Youji. Seeing that Su Youji clearly wasn’t a member of the Sword
Palace, he didn’t say much to her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am Darknorth,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Darknorth, you come to us with an identity
medallion on your very first visit. Are you from the Astral Islands?”
The black-armored Daolord asked while leading the way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning
nodded.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A new entrant into
our Sword Palace from the Astral Islands. Junior apprentice-brother,
you are incredible!” The black-armored Daolord laughed. By now,
they had already reached a stone path that was three thousand meters
wide. This path led straight towards the main gates of the Sword
Palace. Right above the massive gates were two words that were
written in a vigorous, bold manner: ‘Sword’ ‘Palace’!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These two words were
overflying with so much sword-intent that it filled the entire Sword
Palace, then soared upwards into the skies. Even the multiple layers
of folded spacetime around the palace were unable to impede it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt stunned upon
seeing it. These two characters possessed such incredibly dense
sword-intent that they could be described as the most terrifying
example of calligraphy he had ever seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These two words were
left behind by the first Palace Lord of our Sword Palace, Emperor
Windsnow,” the black-armored Daolord said. “Junior
apprentice-brother Darknorth, have you been informed about the rules
one needs to follow in order to establish a new palace?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Establish a new
palace?” NIng was puzzled. He truly had never heard of such a
thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-armored
Daolord Fudan explained, “Long, long ago, the almighty Hegemon
established the Brightshore Kingdom and put tremendous time and
effort into cultivating his Daolords. Back then, the Twelve Palaces
didn’t exist. As the almighty Hegemon put it, one had to be strong
enough to be the equal of an Eternal Emperor before one could set up
a new palace of one’s own.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-armored
Daolord continued, “Emperor Windsnow was the earliest of the major
powers of the Brightshore Kingdom. Back when he was merely a Daolord,
he was already an utterly dazzling figure who was more than strong
enough to match an Eternal Emperor in might. He established the Sword
Palace and became its first Palace Lord. Later on, he succeeded in
his Daomerge and became an Eternal Emperor, at which point he rewrote
the words ‘Sword Palace’ that hung above the palace gates. As the
Emperor once said… those two characters contain the essence of the
Dao of the Sword which he used to gain eternity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As more time had
passed, more palaces had arisen. By now, the Brightshore Kingdom had
a total of twelve palaces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There eventually were
quite a few cultivators who were a match for Eternal Emperors or even
capable of slaying them! However, these current twelve palaces
encompassed the vast majority of cultivation paths, and thus it had
been an extremely long time since a new palace had been established.
Ning was a good example. His path was that of the Dao of the Sword,
and thus even if he became an Eternal Emperor in the future he would
belong to the Sword Palace. There was no need and no point to
establishing a new palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That is the Dao of
the Sword he used to gain eternity?” Ning raised his head to stare
at those characters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t understand
it,” Su Youji murmured softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Neither do I.”
Ning laughed. “The intent and will which this Dao of the Sword
embodies isn’t for people like us to comprehend. The difference
between it and us is simply too great. Perhaps when we become
Daolords of the Third Step or Daolords of the Fourth Step, we can
come back and scrutinize the secrets it holds.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three continued to
advance as they chatted and laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This wide stone path
had quite a few other cultivators traversing it as well, all of whom
were World-level cultivators. Although they were quite spread out,
the path was so long and so wide that Ning estimated that he had seen
at least ten thousand people.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why did I fail yet
again? A hundred chaos cycles, only to fail yet again… ahahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wild laughter rang out
from afar from a cultivator who seemed to be laughing with tears or
crying with laughter. He seemed utterly mad.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is this?” Ning
was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Fudan shook his
head. “These are all World-level cultivators who seek to pass the
trials for joining the Sword Palace. Aside from those like yourself
who are given formal invitations, junior apprentice-brother
Darknorth, cultivators who wish to join us generally have to undergo
multiple layers of trials. All of them are here training, and once
they reach a certain level of power they will try out the trials.
Alas! Ignore them. After enough time passes, most of them realize
that they have no hopes of entering and will leave on their own.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This path into the
palace is known as Sword Road,” Daolord Fudan said. “Aside from
those who are taking part in the various trials, most of the visiting
World-level cultivators spend their time here on Sword Road. They are
forbidden from entering any other part of the Sword Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They continued to walk
forwards through Sword Road. Sword Road was ten thousand kilometers
long, and they saw many World-level cultivators along the way. When
these cultivators saw Ning, many found it difficult to disguise the
envy they felt. For a black-armored Daolord to treat Ning with such
courtesy and deference meant that he had to be a formal member of the
Sword Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Explosions suddenly
rang out from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced over with
surprise. “Is that a duel?” Upon closer examination, he saw that
a red-haired man wielding a greatsword was battling an opponent with
six arms. The red-haired man had tousled hair and was standing there
in a relaxed fashion as he launched his attacks, while his opponent
was fighting back at maximum power with many magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas, it was like an
ant trying to shake a tree. The second person was completely unable
to do anything to the red-haired man, but with each strike the
red-haired man was able to cause the space around him to oscillate in
a manner reminiscent of a beautiful song. Although he was able to
force his opponent back repeatedly, his opponent wasn’t injured
either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face turned
pale as he watched. What terrifying sword-arts. These sword-arts…
they were definitely superior to his own! In the Astral Islands, most
likely only Bertulu was at a higher level of skill than this man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, senior
apprentice-brother Wildfire is dueling,” Daolord Fudan said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Wildfire?” Ning was puzzled. Fudan was a
Daolord. No matter how badass the red-haired man was, he was still
just at the World level. Fudan addressed Ning as ‘junior
apprentice-brother’, but addressed this man as ‘senior
apprentice-brother Wildfire’?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Wildfire is one of the six mighty Swordlords of
our Sword Palace,” Daolord Fudan immediately explained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Six Swordlords? They
are all World-level cultivators, right?” Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Sword Palace has
a total of more than a hundred Samsara Daolords and more than two
hundred World-level cultivators,” Daolord Fudan said. “The two
hundred-plus World-level cultivators were accumulated over the course
of many years. They represent the most powerful experts of the Dao of
the Sword which the Brightshore Kingdom has managed to recruit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Brightshore Kingdom
was a top-tier power that was on par with the Dao Alliance. Only the
most dazzlingly, outstandingly talented World-level sword
practitioners were able to join it, and only around two hundred had
been granted entry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of these two
hundred, only the ones who are acknowledged by the Sword Pagodas are
given the title of Swordlord,” Daolord Fudan said. “There are
more than two hundred World-level cultivators but just six
Swordlords. Although they are merely at the World level, the Sword
Palace treats them as they would Daolords. This is because they are
generally capable of killing some weaker Daolords of the First Step.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill Daolords of the
First Step?” Ning stared in amazement at the relaxed-looking
red-haired man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A World-level
cultivator who could kill a Daolord of the First Step?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Being ‘able to fight’
someone and being ‘able to kill’ someone… these were two
completely different concepts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Astral Islands,
perhaps only Bertulu in his true form would be capable of killing a
Daolord of the First Step. But the Sword Palace actually had six
individuals capable of this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They could’ve
broken through to become Samsara Daolords long ago, but they refused
to do so because their sword-arts are still improving.” Daolord
Fudan sighed. “Each of them are working on perfecting their
sword-arts. They wish to perfect those sword-arts to the absolute
maximum possible level before they become Daolords. After all, the
more perfect one’s Dao of the Sword is, the stronger one will be as
a Daolord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bertulu was a good
example of someone who was at such a high level of insight that even
without revealing his true form, he was capable of dominating Ning
with his two warhammers. Given his profound insights, once he became
a Daolord, he would probably be able to match Daolords of the Third
Step! Clearly, the six supremely talented Swordlords of the Sword
Palace were all people of great ambition.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My sword-arts are
not even enough for me to become a Daolord. This ‘senior
apprentice-brother Wildfire’, however, could’ve used his
sword-arts to become a Daolord long ago… and he’s only gotten
even better since then.” Ning was stunned. “No wonder his
sword-arts are so much better than mine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Next!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, the
red-haired man’s greatsword suddenly swept out. Boom! Even before
it had touched his opponent, invisible layers of spatial energy
crashed out and swept his opponent away, sending him flying multiple
kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you for your
guidance, senior apprentice-brother Wildfire.” His opponent
hurriedly spoke out to express his thanks. Actually, he had yet to
pass the trials of the Sword Palace; for him to address Wildfire as
‘senior apprentice-brother’ was a show of shamelessness, but that
was how most of the other World-level cultivators acted as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please give me some
guidance, senior apprentice-brother.” Yet another World-level
cultivator stepped forward, then began to use all the techniques he
had available to fight Wildfire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s able to
effortlessly crush them with a casual blow.” Ning couldn’t help
but sigh. “He is like an old man instructing children. They are all
at the World level, and his challengers are extraordinarily strong
cultivators who wield Eternal weapons and are comparable to supreme
World Gods, but they seem to be absolutely nothing before his might.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Sword Palace has
built up tremendous power over the years.” The nearby Daolord Fudan
laughed. “Once you enter the Sword Palace, you’ll need to start
improving your own skills as well. Still, to reach senior
apprentice-brother Wildfire’s level will be very difficult. After
all, there are over two hundred World-level cultivators in the Sword
Palace, but only six have been given the title of ‘Swordlord’.”

Chapter 2 – A Holy Place for Sword Cultivators
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning led Su Youji
forwards alongside him as Daolord Fudan continued to introduce the
people and places within the Sword Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-haired man sent
his opponent flying with a single sword-strike. His gaze then fell
upon Ji Ning, and his eyes instantly lit up. He laughed loudly, “Is
this a new junior apprentice-brother of ours?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am Darknorth.
Greetings, senior apprentice-brother Wildfire,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That explains it.
I’ve sparred with and recognize everyone in our Sword Palace.”
The red-haired man let out a loud, clear laugh. “Junior
apprentice-brother Darknorth, since you are a new arrival I won’t
disturb you, but in two days I’m going to go find you and have a
little competition with you. I trust you won’t decline?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’d be delighted
to accept,” Ning said modestly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. Go, go. We can
chat later,” the red-haired man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As they moved past the
red-haired man, Daolord Fudan said in a low voice, “Of the six
exalted Swordlords, senior apprentice-brother Wildfire is the most
heroic and straightforward. He loves to duel other cultivators and
won’t look down upon weak ones. He’s a person who is easy to make
friends with, and is much more approachable than many of the other
World-level cultivators of the Sword Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. He could
sense how friendly and relaxed this senior apprentice-brother
Wildfire was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sword cultivator who
was capable of breaking through to become a Samsara Daolord at any
time would have a clear understanding of his own nature, be it good
or bad, honorable or dishonorable. Wildfire clearly was an extremely
friendly and straightforward man, and his sword was similarly a sword
that crushed all before it in an open and aboveboard manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are going to go
to the Ancient Library next. It is right up ahead.” Daolord Fudan
pointed towards a large, ancient-looking hall that was made of wood
that was beginning to turn yellow with age. The entire ancient hall
took up many kilometers, and just by looking at it Ning could sense
the power of its aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ancient Library
was built alongside the Sword Palace itself. It has been around for
an extremely, extremely long period of time,” Daolord Fudan
explained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning stared
at it in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ancient Library had
quite a few black-armored Daolords around it. Some were seated in the
lotus position on the ground, some were relaxing and drinking wine,
some were training with their swords. There were over a hundred of
the present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Fudan.” Ning was puzzled. “On the way over, I
saw quite a few black-armored Daolords. If we include in the ones
before us, I’ve seen more than two hundred. But you told me that
the entire Sword Palace only has a hundred Samsara Daolords…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Fudan paused, a
mixed look appearing on his face. “Let me explain.” He let out a
sigh. “In the Sword Palace, all cultivators are like brothers.
There’s not much of a difference in terms of status between us.
World-level cultivators who run into Verge-level Daolords will simply
address them as ‘senior apprentice-brother’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sword Palace was a
place where elite sword cultivators gathered. Everyone treated
everyone else in a fairly equal manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But there’s still
some differences, despite the overall equality,” Daolord Fudan
said. “The cultivators in the Sword Palace are generally divided
into two different types.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first type
consists of those who relied on themselves and their own insights to
become Samsara Daolords! The six Swordlords are categorized along
with them, even though they aren’t actually Samsara Daolords,
because they can break through whenever they wish and possess
tremendous potential. Once they break through, they will be far
stronger than most Daolords of the First Step. This is why even
Samsara Daolords treat these Swordlords as equals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second type
consists of the other World-level cultivators as well as
black-armored Daolords like us.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the end,
World-level cultivators are still just cultivators who have a chance
of breaking through to become Daolords. They naturally have a
somewhat lower status. As for us black-armored Daolords, all of us
reached this level through using Pseudo Samsara Pills. We will
forever remain at the First Step and have no hope of improving any
further. There are even some freakishly strong World-level
cultivators who are even stronger than us.” Daolord Fudan shook his
head. “Some Samsara Daolords view us as the lowest of the low.
They’d rather show kindness to World-level cultivators with
potential than show us any real respect.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was silent. He
could sense the sadness emanating from Daolord Fudan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the Sword Palace,
there are actually a total of more than 2300 black-armored Daolords,”
Daolord Fudan said softly. “There are many more of them than there
are World-level cultivators. There were quite a few people in the
Brightshore Kingdom who become Daolords through using those pills,
after all, and the almighty Hegemon has ordered that all Daolords
must join the Twelve Palaces. This is why the Twelve Palaces has so
many black-armored Daolords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning finally
understood. The Sword Palace had more than two thousand black-armored
Daolords, but just two hundred World-level cultivators and around a
hundred ‘real’ Samsara Daolords. Given that they were fairly weak
and had no prospects for future advancement, it wasn’t surprising
that they had low statuses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Most of the
black-armored Daolords are outside the Sword Palace, with just over
five hundred staying inside of it,” Daolord Fudan said. “Although
they are treated with some disdain, they still choose to remain
within the Sword Palace because there, we will have a better chance
to improve than we would anywhere else. Power depends on more factors
than just enlightenment. Different sword-arts can also result in
different levels of power, as do divine abilities and secret arts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. The
[Novessence Thunder] was a great example of a very powerful secret
art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They have a chance
of earning those things in the Sword Palace, which is why so many
remain within it,” Daolord Fudan said. “Come. I’ll take you to
the Ancient Library for a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They arrived at the
Ancient Library.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is this a newcomer?
You can come in. The one behind you cannot.” The two black-armored
Daolords standing guard in front of the library looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned to glance
at Su Youji, who was following him from behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youji, wait for me
here,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Although
Su Youji was quite curious, she didn’t really care because the
Sword Palace was for those who walked the Dao of the Sword. For now,
her path was the path of Feixian the Exalted. She was focusing on the
path of charm and control, a completely different path from the Dao
of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the wooden
floor and walls were protected by powerful formations, the unfeeling
power of time had left its mark on them as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ancient hall was
incredibly large, and it was completely filled with bookshelves as
far as the eye could see. Every single bookshelf was filled with many
jade slips and scrolls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning casually
picked up a jade slip and sent his godsense into it. He immediately
realized that it was filled with a large amount of information, and
he accepted the information as it flowed into him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a powerful
sword-art.” Ning was rather shocked. This was a sword-art of
tremendous power. In fact, it was just as strong as the [Nameless]
sword-art. Alas, it was fragmentary and incomplete.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">NIng couldn’t help
but spend a bit of time reading through it before finally putting it
back down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be
impatient, junior apprentice-brother.” Only now did Daolord Fudan
speak. “These sword-arts have been passed down since the most
ancient of times. Some were left here by the almighty Hegemon while
some were accumulated or created by the Sword Palace’s members over
the course of countless years. In fact, when the other eleven palaces
acquire new sword-arts they will often send them to us. We have tens
of millions of sword-arts placed here, all of which are at least at
the Daolord level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tens of millions of
scrolls?” Ning was speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The problem is, 99%
of them are fragmentary and incomplete,” Daolord Fudan said. “The
ones on these bookshelves here are all fragmentary. The ones placed
on the tables at the very front are all complete, with teachings that
will guide you from the early stages to the late stages. That way,
you can slowly train in them step by step. The tables have over five
hundred thousand techniques.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tens of millions of
incomplete techniques?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than five hundred
thousand complete techniques?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Some of these
sword-arts are strong, some are weak. Some were left behind by
Eternal Emperors, while some were acquired by the almighty Hegemon by
happenstance and possess incalculable power.” Daolord Fudan smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are there any
limitations or restrictions on learning these sword-arts?” Ning was
worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“None.” Daolord
Fudan sighed with emotion. “Any member of the Sword Palace is
permitted to freely study any of the scrolls and slips here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sighed in
amazement as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he walked through
the Ancient Library and saw the many jade slips that had been placed
here for countless chaos cycles, he couldn’t help but occasionally
reach out to grab a scroll to take a look. Even the fragmentary ones
were incredibly profound. If he was to give them to the Fogstone
Dominion, they would be treated as supreme techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Any technique placed
within the Ancient Library of the Sword Palace had to be at least at
the Daolord level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Simply incredible.”
Ning sighed with amazement. He even saw a silver-armored Daolord
seated in the lotus position, silently meditating on a sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are simply too
many sword-arts here,” Daolord Fudan said. “Some of them,
especially profound ones such as the ones left behind by Eternal
Emperors, will take countless years to learn. There are so many
sword-arts here that no one can truly learn them all. They will at
most flip through some and try to gain some experience.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was incredibly
excited. His Dao of the Sword required him to understand the true
essence of the sword by analyzing and dissecting many different
sword-arts. This place was an absolute treasure trove for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ancient Library
is actually considered a fairly ‘ordinary’ place here in the
Sword Palace.” Daolord Fudan let out a secretive smile. “It
doesn’t even rank as one of the top three places here in the Sword
Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?!” Ning was
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning saw it, the
Ancient Library was already sacred grounds for those who trained in
the sword. And yet, it didn’t even rank as one of the top three
places in the Sword Palace?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come. I’ll take
you to another place,” Daolord Fudan said. “You’ll understand
once you get there.”

Chapter 3 – The Forest of Sword Pagodas
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Su Youji
followed Daolord Fudan in flying through a mountainous forest grove.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every so often, one
would be able to see the residences of cultivators spread out
throughout the mountains. Daolord Fudan suddenly pointed off into the
distance towards a distant valley. “That place is known as
Armaments Gorge. That’s another one of the very important places in
the Sword Palace. It is just as important as the Ancient Library.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Armaments Gorge?”
Ning stared off into the distance, as did the nearby Su Youji. None
of this really had anything to do with her, but it was a chance for
her to learn a few things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Distant buildings could
be seen hidden throughout the gorge, with some located deep in the
very bottom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Armaments Gorge is
filled with many weapons, magic treasures, and unique artifacts,”
Daolord Fudan said. “The weapons here are primarily swords of all
shapes and sizes, but there are also many types of other magic
treasures, including pills. All treasures are stored here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes lit up.
All treasures were stored here? Would perhaps Mirrorsnow Paintings be
stored here as well?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What must be done if
I wish to acquire some of those treasures?” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The treasures inside
Armaments Gorge were accumulated by the Sword Palace over the course
of countless years. They cannot be taken away without paying a cost,”
Daolord Fudan said. “If everyone just took away treasures as they
pleased, the gorge would soon be completely emptied. When you are
free, you can go and take a look. The Armaments Gorge has certain
rules that govern it. Still, in the outside world, many of these
treasures are completely unobtainable no matter what price you are
willing to pay. At least they are available in the Armaments Gorge.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. The more
valuable a treasure was, the harder it would be to acquire it.
Daolord Solesky had been willing to risk his own life and pay a heavy
price in order to get Daolord Badlands to help him in his quest to
obtain a certain treasure. It seemed as though the Armaments Gorge
had many priceless treasures within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ancient Library
is filled with sword-arts, while this place is filled with
treasures.” Ning nodded. These two places truly were on par with
each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Next, I shall take
you to the third-most important place we have.” Daolord Fudan
continued to fly forwards, leading Ning higher and higher into the
skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look over there.”
Daolord Fudan pointed at the tallest building in the entire Sword
Palace. It was a strangely shaped building that was shaped like a
towering pillar of cloud layers. Each layer was thirty thousand
meters tall. The first layer was formed of black clouds, the second
layer was formed of azure clouds, the third layer was formed of
silvery-white clouds, and the highest layer was formed from golden
clouds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four layers of
clouds came together to form this towering edifice that was at the
heart of the entire Sword Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the Daolord
Cloudworld.” Daolord Fudan sighed. “This is one of the most
important places in the entire Sword Palace, ranking within the top
three.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it for?”
Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Daolord
Cloudworld is filled with many powerful golem opponents, and more
than 90% of them wield swords. They will use different types of
sword-arts, with the strongest ones being comparable to the
sword-arts used by Daolords of the Third Step.” Daolord Fudan
sighed. “Sword cultivators need combat more than anything else, and
battles against other supremely skilled swordsmen help more than
anything else.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning absolutely agreed
with this comment. One of the reasons why his sword-arts had improved
so quickly was because he had been able to duel those three powerful
swordsmen within the three Mirrorsnow Paintings. That had been of
tremendous benefit to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When you battle
against other supremely skilled swordsmen, not only will you have a
chance to discover the flaws in your own sword-arts, you’ll also
learn from the sword-arts they used.” Daolord Fudan sighed.
“However, battling against such powerful swordsmen in the outside
world carries the risk of death. In the Daolord Cloudworld, however,
you won’t be at any risk of dying. The Daolord Cloudworld has many
golems because the entire Sword Palace has put tremendous resources
into it over the course of countless years. That’s why it has so
many golems of such incredible power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. There were
quite a few cultivators who had sword-arts on the level of most
Daolords of the Third Step, but creating a golem that possessed the
same level of sword-arts would carry a tremendous price that even
Eternal Emperors would feel pain upon paying. Generally speaking,
powerful golems relied on using overwhelming speed and power, with
their weakness being their insights into the Dao. This was even true
for golems who could battle Verge-level Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Golems weren’t
cultivators, after all. They were innately weak in this respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are many
powerful expert swordsmen there who all use different types of
sword-arts, some of which are comparable to Daolords of the Third
Step.” Daolord Fudan sighed. “Which cultivator of the sword
wouldn’t dream of gaining access to such a place as we have here in
the Palace of the Sword?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was growing even
more excited. No wonder the Sword Palace was able to give birth to
six freakishly strong World-level cultivators like the six
Swordlords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And there’s more!
Remember, the Daolord Cloudworld has a total of four layers,”
Daolord Fudan said. “The Blackcloud World is the first layer; if
you overcome it, you will be awarded a set of black armor. This black
armor is merely a top-grade Dao armor. The Azurecloud World is the
second layer, and if you overcome it you’ll be given azure armor.
The Silvercloud World is the third layer, and if you overcome it
you’ll be awarded silver armor. The highest layer is the Goldcloud
World, and if you overcome it you will be awarded golden armor. The
azure armor, silver armor, and gold armor are all Eternal treasures
of different levels of power. The suits of golden armor are top-grade
Eternal treasures, and they possess many marvelous properties.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Being able to
acquire the black armor means you have reached the threshold of a
Daolord of the First Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Being able to
acquire the azure armor means you have reached the threshold of a
Daolord of the Second Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Silver armor is for
those who have reached the threshold of Daolords of the Third Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Golden armor belongs
to those who have reached the threshold for Daolords of the Fourth
Step.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Fudan explained
the stages one by one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. ‘Reached
the threshold’ simply meant that you were at the minimum level of
power for that level. When Ning had first broken through to the
World-level, he had reached the threshold of a Daolord of the First
Step. As for right now? He was comparable to an average Daolord of
the First Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the Sword Palace,
we have eight World-level cultivators who have won azure armor,”
Daolord Fudan said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” Ning was
shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he was fairly
powerful, he didn’t think he had reached the threshold of a Daolord
of the Second Step. But the Sword Palace had eight such figures?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five of them are
special lifeforms while three of them were cultivators, but even the
cultivators have freakishly powerful divine abilities or secret
arts,” Daolord Fudan explained. “In challenging the Daolord
Cloudworld, you can use all abilities and techniques that you have
available, such as divine abilities and secret arts. But of course,
you can’t use certain single-use treasures, Dao-seals, bugbeasts,
golems, or other similar treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be too
surprised. Divine abilities and secrets are can be tremendously
powerful,” Daolord Fudan said. “I’ll take you to another place
now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Fudan led him
to a bamboo hall erected at the peak of a mountain which was wreathed
in clouds and mist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the Pavilion
of Mysteries.” Daolord Fudan pointed at the bamboo hall. “It is
filled with many divine abilities, secret arts, and a few legacies
left behind by ancient powers of the Dao of the Sword. Divine
abilities can increase your strength a hundredfold, while secret arts
are even more difficult to gauge. The strongest secret arts can
unleash utterly terrifying levels of power,” Daolord Fudan said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. His own
[Novessence Thunder] technique was classified as a secret art!
Certain incredibly powerful secret arts truly could allow the wielder
to challenge cultivators who were at a higher level of power. If some
of the freakishly strong World-level cultivators like Kilostar gained
access to some of the terrifyingly strong secret arts or treasures
the Twelve Palaces had to offer, it was entirely possible that he
would be able to battle his way through the second layer of the
Daolord Cloudworld and earn the azure armor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, if you had
merely reached the threshold of the Second Step as a Daolord, you
would probably be defeated in one blow by a true Daolord of the
Second Step. Still, you would probably be strong enough to kill most
Daolords of the First Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Many of the divine
abilities and secret arts stored in this place were left behind by
Daolords who were comparable to Eternal Emperors in might. Some were
left behind by actual Eternal Emperors. The same is true for the full
legacies,” Daolord Fudan said. “However, the full legacies are
fewer in number.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Legacies were
completely different from the sword-arts held within the Ancient
Library.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To have a legacy was to
essentially have a master. Not only did a legacy include many
sword-arts and detailed instructions on learning them, it would often
include a detailed analysis and explanation of every single stance
from the Daolord who had left the legacy behind. To have a Samsara
Daolord guide you step by step on your path… true legacies were
thousands of times more valuable than mere sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Take the [Nameless]
sword-art which World God Northrest had transmitted to Ning. Its
first five stances all had their own sword-intents, but Northrest
himself had never learned the sixth or seventh stance. All he had
been able to do was to leave behind a record of the stances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the flaw of
the Ancient Library. Its sword-arts consisted of nothing more than
movements and techniques; there was no sword-intent for the
cultivator to attune to.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Every newcomer is
permitted to choose a single thing from the Pavilion of Mysteries,”
Daolord Fudan said. “The Daolord Cloudworld and the Pavilion of
Mysteries are two of the top three sacred areas here in the Sword
Palace. Now… I am going to take you to the most important place of
all, the indisputably most sacred place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They continued to fly
forwards, moving towards the very rear of the Sword Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There. Right there.”
Daolord Fudan pointed off into the distance, towards a place which
was covered in darkness. The black earth was filled with erect
towers, and the towers filled the landscape like a forest or like a
sea. Every single tower emanated an aura of incredible sword-intent
which filled the entire region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A million chaos cycles
or even longer might go by… but the sword-intent here would never
dissipate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ever since the Sword
Palace was established, every single person whose sword-arts are
acknowledged by the Sword Pagodas shall leave behind a Sword Pagoda
of his own,” Daolord Fudan said softly. “To be acknowledged by
the Sword Pagodas, you have to at least reach the level of the six
Swordlords. Over the course of countless years, every single true
Samsara Daolord or Eternal Emperor has left behind a Sword Pagoda
that belongs to them. Every single Sword Pagoda holds the sword-arts
they learned and developed. They personally recorded those sword-arts
down and left them here, infusing their pagoda with their
sword-intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Countless Daolords
have died since the Sword Palace was founded, and even Eternal
Emperors have disappeared into the endless darkness as they went out
exploring parts unknown. Their Sword Pagodas, however, have been kept
safe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are a total of
83612 Sword Pagodas here!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place
represents the greatest wealth, the greatest fortune the Sword Palace
possesses. This is the most sacred place in the entire palace.” A
look of awe and veneration was in Daolord Fudan’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense that
the sword-intents here were incredibly ancient, having existed for
countless chaos cycles. In fact, some of the sword-intents were
absolutely lawless and dominating. These sword-intents had all been
left behind by some of the most supremely talented cultivators of the
Endless Territories, many of whom were capable of battling Eternal
Emperors or actually were Eternal Emperors. All of them had been
gathered here… and every single Sword Pagoda represented an ancient
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Samsara Daolords. With
each step they took, they walked the tightrope which existed between
life and death. Daolords had to eventually succeed in the Daomerge,
as they would otherwise die one day. Some of the earliest Daolords
had already perished, but their sword-arts and their sword-intents
had been left behind and would forever exist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The most sacred
place of the Sword Palace… the Forest of Sword Pagodas.” Daolord
Fudan’s voice was trembling slightly. He dreamed of one day being
able to leave behind a Sword Pagoda of his own… but alas, his
sword-arts were not good enough.

Chapter 4 – Palace Lord Woodflower
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning stared off into
the distance, where he could vaguely see quite a few figures seated
in the lotus position within those ancient, enormous Sword Pagodas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All members of the
Sword Palace are permitted to come here and meditate,” Daolord
Fudan said. “Even we black-armored Daolords are permitted.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going to take
a look.” Ning walked forwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sword Pagodas were
tall and erect, with each emanating a completely different
sword-intent. It was as though mighty sword practitioners were
standing right next to Ning! As Ning walked through the ancient
Forest of Sword Pagodas, he felt as though he was walking through a
sea of time. As Ning stared at the mighty sword-arts and
sword-intents which the ancient powers had left behind, he couldn’t
help but feel utterly stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were his
predecessors, ancient masters of the Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sword Pagodas had
more than just sword-arts. Many also had a few tiny words carved into
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s gaze turned
towards one particular Sword Pagoda. The sword-arts inscribed within
this Sword Pagoda were quite similar to his own [Nameless] sword-art.
They belonged to the same general style of swordsmanship, and they
were similarly exalted and profound. As for the sword-intent, it was
awe-inspiringly profound and seemed to encompass all things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Everstarter.
After joining our Sword Palace, he received the acknowledgment of the
Sword Pagodas while still at the World level and became one of our
Swordlords. He had a modest disposition and liked to teach his
juniors and those weaker than him. He treated the Sword Palace as his
home and rarely went out adventuring. Silently and without any
fanfare, he reached the Fourth Step as a Daolord. However, because
the Ancient cultivators went too far in their actions, Daolord
Everstarter ventured forth all by himself and unvealed his utterly
terrifying sword-arts, defeating three other Verge-level Daolords who
were Ancient cultivators. In fact, he even defeated an Ancient
cultivator who was an Eternal Emperor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This battle brought
him tremendous fame, and he became acknowledged as the number one
Daolord of the Endless Territories in his time. Afterwards, as he
prepared for his Daomerge, he began to travel to many different
places. Ever since then, we have received no word of him. We do not
know if he is alive or dead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This Daolord defeated
an Eternal Emperor who was an Ancient cultivator?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew very little
about the Ancient cultivators. All he knew was that they were
incredibly, terrifyingly powerful. Only the most supreme of special
lifeforms were comparable to Ancient cultivators. Eternal Emperors
who were Ancient cultivators were definitely far more powerful than
ordinary Eternal Emperors. A Daolord had actually defeated one of
them? No wonder he was publicly acclaimed as the number one Daolord
in his time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This feat was far more
impressive than Daolord Allgod’s feat of attacking and pursuing
Emperor Melobo.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No one knows if
Daolord Everstarter is still alive or not.” Suddenly, a voice rang
out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled.
Someone had appeared behind him without him even noticing?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He hurriedly turned and
looked backwards, only to see that a golden-armored, tousled-hair,
and rather decadent-looking man had appeared behind him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, senior
apprentice-brother.” Upon seeing the suit of golden armor, Ning
immediately addressed the man with respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were no ‘masters’
or ‘apprentices’ here in the Sword Palace, only brothers and
sisters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this moment, Daolord
Fudan hurriedly ran over and said with great respect, “Greetings,
Lord Woodflower.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lord?” Ning was
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Darknorth, Daolord Woodflower is a Vice Palace
Lord of our Sword Palace.” Daolord Fudan sent a hurried mental
message to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning didn’t
know the names of the various Daolords in the Sword Palace, he knew
the general rules of the Twelve Palaces. The strongest member in
every single palace was given the title of Palace Lord. Vice Palace
Lords were the next most powerful! But of course, there were
exceptions such as the Palace of Radiance, which had two powerful
Daolords who were roughly on par with each other, which was why both
were referred to as Palace Lord. Thus, the Radiant Palace had two
Palace Lords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
Palace Lords and Vice Palace Lords had the power to battle against
Eternal Emperors. This was especially true in a place like the Sword
Palace, which focused on combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, Palace
Lord,” Ning said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Simply address me as
senior apprentice-brother Woodflower.” The decadent-looking man
chuckled. “I watched the battle between you and Bertulu. You aren’t
bad at all. Actually, your sword-arts are quite similar to those of
Daolord Everstarter. If he is still alive, he should be an Eternal
Emperor by now. Given how strong he was as a Daolord, as an Eternal
Emperor he would probably be alive to this very day and might be
willing to give you some personal pointers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Daolord who was able
to defeat an Eternal Emperor of the Ancients and who was acknowledged
as the undisputed number one Daolord of the Endless Territories of
his time… if he was to become an Eternal Emperor, killing him would
be almost impossible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Woodflower,” Ning said hurriedly, “Can it be
that he doesn’t have an avatar here? Why is it that we don’t know
if he is alive or not?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning had entered
Undermoon Lake, he had been quite weak, but his clones in the outside
world could sense if he was alive or dead. Once his clones in
Undermoon Lake perished, he would be able to recreate the clones in
the outside world. This was an easy way to judge if he was dead or
not.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolords, however,
would generally leave avatars in their homes when they were entering
dangerous regions. If not, they would leave behind other special
techniques or spells. Generally speaking, it wasn’t too hard to
know what was happening or if they were still alive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The primordial chaos
is vast and endless. Even the almighty Hegemon, who is older than the
Twelve Palaces, wouldn’t dare claim that he knows everything which
happens within it,” Lord Woodflower explained. “In the endless
primordial chaos, there are indeed some places which will result in
you being completely cut off from the outside world once you enter.
There would be no way whatsoever to ascertain if you were alive or
not.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given that we have
heard no word from him in countless years, it is very likely that he
is dead. However, there’s no way to verify it, and so we generally
will list these elders as ‘status unknown’ rather than ‘deceased’
on their Sword Pagodas,” Lord Woodflower explained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After chatting a bit
about Daolord Everstarter, Lord Woodflower said, “Darknorth, as a
new member of the Sword Palace, you are able to choose a single
divine ability, secret art, or legacy from the Pavilion of Mysteries.
But of course, some Daolords restricted their legacies, only
permitting juniors who passed the trials they set down to make use of
those legacies. Generally speaking, the more valuable a legacy, the
more common this practice is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning naturally
understood this principle. His Mirrorsnow Paintings had trials as
well. Actually procuring all four paintings was a major trial in and
of itself, and of course he had to defeat the four experts within the
four paintings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go take a
look first,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll lead the
way.” Lord Woodflower waved his hand, sending a surge of Immortal
energy to surround Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light flickered
around them, resulting in them disappearing into the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Fudan raised
his head to watch them leave, a look of envy in his eyes. He murmured
softly, “Lord Woodflower is quite nice to him. It seems he views
Darknorth with great favor.” As he spoke, he walked back to the
outskirts of the Forest of Sword Pagodas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who was that person
who just flew away with my master?” Su Youji immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That was Lord
Woodflower of our Sword Palace. Although he behaves in a very casual,
laid-back manner, he’s a very discerning man. It isn’t easy to
attract his attention. It seems he quite likes your master,”
Daolord Fudan said. “Let us wait for him here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Su Youji
smiled. The better Ning’s live here was, the happier she would be.
She felt absolutely delighted by this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Pavilion of
Mysteries was located at the top of a mountain, surrounded by clouds
and mist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A streak of sword-light
flickered and descended in front of the pavilion. Daolord Woodflower
and Ji Ning both appeared once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That was fast.”
Ning was secretly shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, Vice
Palace Lord.” Suddenly, a fiery red golem at the entrance to the
pavilion rose to its feet and called out respectfully. Its entire
body was made from magic treasures; a simple glance was enough to
tell that it wasn’t an actual living creature.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swordthree, I’m
going to take this new arrival of ours, junior apprentice-brother
Darknorth, in for a look.” Daolord Woodflower smiled towards Ning.
“This is Swordthree, the overseer of the Pavilion of Mysteries.
He’s been guarding this place for an extremely long period of time,
much longer than any of our Daolords have been alive. He is ranked
the third most powerful golem in the Sword Palace, and so we just
call him Swordthree. You can call him the same.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swordthree,” Ning
said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.” The
fiery golem cracked a friendly smile towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Follow me inside.”
Lord Woodflower led Ning inwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within this bamboo
hall, there were a series of jade slips. There were also stone
steles, statues, books, paintings, leaves, wine gourds, and all sorts
of other items. They all looked quite ordinary, as though this was a
flea market filled with many miscellaneous objects.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place holds
many divine abilities and secret arts,” Lord Woodflower said. “All
Twelve Palaces share more or less the same divine abilities and
secret arts. Our legacies, however, belong to us alone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Woodflower
continued, “There are differences amongst the legacies. Some are
more profound, some are less. Some were left behind by fairly
ordinary Daolords, some were left behind by awe-inspiringly powerful
Daolords who were as strong as Eternal Emperors, and some were left
behind by actual Eternal Emperors. There’s no need to pass any
trials to use the divine abilities or secret arts; all you need to do
is choose one and you will be able to train in it. Legacies, however,
generally come attached with trials and conditions.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The legacies left
behind by Eternal Emperors are the most valuable. Here within this
bamboo hall, there are five legacies that were left behind by Eternal
Emperors.” Lord Woodflower explained, “Here in the Sword Palace,
we have an additional requirement. World-level cultivators have to
become acknowledged as ‘Swordlords’ by the Sword Pagodas before
they are qualified to select a legacy left behind by an Eternal
Emperor… but of course, they still need to pass the trials which
the Eternal Emperor set down.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said with
surprise, “Don’t some of those freakishly powerful Daolords
possess sword-arts that equal the sword-arts of Eternal Emperors? Why
is it that the legacies of the Eternal Emperors are so much harder to
obtain?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Anyone who was able
to become an Eternal Emperor had already perfected his Dao of the
Sword to a level where it could gain eternity,” Lord Woodflower
explained. “These legacies will give you experience that will help
guide you to eternity. Over the course of countless years, we have
seen several freakishly strong Daolords in every single generation.
However, very few of them are ever able to become actual Eternal
Emperors.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Woodflower
continued, “Based on the rough numbers we have for the Endless
Territories, less than one in a hundred thousand Daolords shall
become an Eternal Emperor. Although our Sword Palace is assisted by
the almighty Hegemon and selects only the cream of the crop, the
elites of the elites, we’ve only given birth to a total of three
Eternal Emperors since the establishment of the kingdom.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Woodflower shook
his head. “Of the three Eternal Emperors… one perished, while the
other two were solitary figures who went off wandering by
themselves.” Lord Woodflower let out a sigh. “Our ratio of
Daolords to Eternal Emperors is actually fairly high. The Dao
Alliance has a much lower ratio than the Twelve Palaces.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless. At
present, the Sword Palace didn’t even have a single Eternal
Emperor?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s simply too
hard for a new Eternal Emperor to be born. Even if one is born…
they live far too long and easily grow bored, and so they often
delight in exploring places which no one has ever been before.
Sometimes, they never come back.” Lord Woodflower continued, “As
for the freakishly strong Daolords… after they fail their Daomerge,
they know that they shall die and so they will often go out and try
to find chances to slay Eternal Emperors belonging to enemy
organizations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although there
aren’t that many freakishly strong Daolords, there’s usually a
few in every generation. Although Eternal Emperors are untouched by
the ravages of time, they can still perish through other means,”
Lord Woodflower explained. “But of course, there are always
differences. Take our almighty Hegemon. He’s actually an Eternal
Emperor, but he’s just far, far too powerful. As a result, he’s
still alive to this very day. Even though he occasionally abducts
World-level cultivators who belong to other organizations, they just
ignore it and pretend not to see it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What sad, sad fates
these Eternal Emperors had. They were incredibly rare in number, but
the freakishly strong Daolords who failed their Daomerge would often
target them in suicidal attacks. Daolord Allgod was a good example.
After he failed his Daomerge, he attempted to chase down and kill
Emperor Melobo.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Far too many Eternal
Emperors disappeared while adventuring, were slain by Daolords, or
went into hiding. Only truly almighty figures like the Hegemon were
capable of staying alive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As a result, there
are very few legacies that were left behind by Eternal Emperors. Even
the weakest Eternal Emperor’s sword-arts are comparable to the
sword-arts of supreme Daolords, and they contain a hint of eternity…”
Lord Woodflower looked at Ning. “I’m sure you know this, but
cultivators must find and walk their own paths. After becoming a
Daolord, you must develop a sword-art all your own. These so-called
‘legacies’ are mainly valuable because they will help guide you
in that.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“By now, you should
understand why the legacies left behind by Eternal Emperors are so
rare and valuable,” Lord Woodflower said. “I urge you to do your
best to acquire one of them if you can. But of course, it is up to
you. What do you want? A divine ability, a secret art, or a legacy?
What will you choose?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What will I choose?”
Ning began to ponder this question.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A divine ability? Ji
Ning’s greatest advantage was his azureflower mist energy, but
there was no way to use it to execute divine abilities. For now, his
[Golden Idol] and [Three Heads, Six Arms] were enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A legacy? He was still
missing the fourth Mirrorsnow Painting for the legacy of Emperor
Mirrorsnow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Woodflower,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have you made your
decision?” Lord Woodflower looked at Ning. “There’s no need to
choose right away. Think it over. You’ll only have one opportunity
to pick something of your choosing. After that, you’ll have to pay
a heavy price.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I actually want to
ask a question. Is it possible for the Twelve Palaces to acquire a
copy of the fourth Mirrorsnow Painting?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You already have the
first three?” Lord Woodflower was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
There was no need to hide this; the Sword Palace had many legacies,
and Lord Woodflower himself was a supremely strong Daolord who was
comparable to Eternal Emperors in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t think the
Sword Palace has a copy.” Lord Woodflower pondered for a moment,
then let out a laugh. “Later, you should go to the Armaments Gorge
and take a look for yourself. If they really don’t have a copy, you
can ask them to help out. They’ll help you find a fourth copy in
the Endless Territories. Given the might of the Twelve Palaces, I
trust that they shouldn’t find this to be an overly difficult task.
But of course, you’ll need to pay for it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
relaxed slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor Mirrorsnow
was an extremely powerful Eternal Emperor, and he’s still alive.”
Lord Woodflower let out a sigh. “His legacy is an excellent one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly gave
voice to something which had been puzzling him. “Senior
apprentice-brother Woodflower, there’s something which has been
bothering me. Advancing from the Samsara Daolord level to the Eternal
Emperor level should represent an incredible increase in power… and
I would imagine that anyone capable of becoming an Eternal Emperor
should be have been an extraordinary Daolord as well. Why, then, do I
often hear about Daolords slaying Emperors?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Woodflower was
startled, and a complicated look appeared on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You were going to be
told about this eventually.” Lord Woodflower looked at Ning.
“Samsara Daolords all have their own paths, and different paths
will result in different levels of difficulty in becoming Eternal
Emperors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you choose a
simple path, you will be fairly weak amongst your peers. As a Daolord
of the Fourth Step, you probably won’t be as strong as I was when I
was a Daolord of the Third Step. However… that will also make it
somewhat easier for you on your road to gaining eternity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you choose a
difficult path, you will be extremely powerful. As a Daolord of the
Fourth Step, you might even be able to slay some of the weaker
Eternal Emperors. However… to succeed in your Daomerge on this
difficult path and gain eternity will be even more difficult.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Woodflower looked
at Ning. “That is why there’s an old axiom that has rung true for
countless chaos cycles… the more powerful the Daolord, the less
likely he will be successful in his Daomerge.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The many freakishly
strong Daolords that have appeared over the course of countless years
have almost all failed in their Daomerge. Thus, junior
apprentice-brother Darknorth… you need to think over what path you
would like to take. Shall you choose a path that is a simple one? Or
a path that is a difficult one?” Lord Woodflower looked at Ning.
“The difficult path means that it is guaranteed that every single
step you take as a Daolord will be very dangerous, and your Daomerge
will be even more difficult! However, you’ll also be incredibly
powerful and will be a dazzling figure amongst your peers. The simple
path will be easier to walk, and in the end you will have a slightly
larger chance of completing your Daomerge and gaining eternity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned by
this revelation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still… it made sense.
He himself had already found the direction in which his Dao of the
Sword would lead. His path involved analyzing and dissecting all
sword-arts he encountered in order to better understand the
fundamental essence of the sword. His goal was to infuse all of the
mysteries of all sword-arts into his own Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This path was an
insanely ambitious one. To understand the fundamental essence of the
sword and to absorb all of its mysteries meant that in the end, he
would have developed what could be described as an ‘ultimate’,
perfect sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Perfection was not so
easily achieved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had chosen an
extremely difficult path. In truth, Ning could’ve chosen to walk a
simpler path. For example, right now Ning was extremely skilled in
defensive techniques. If he focused all his efforts on defense,
things would be much easier for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why should
cultivators fear difficulties?” Ning laughed. “Even if you choose
the simpler path, perhaps less than one in a hundred thousand Samsara
Daolords shall gain eternity. It is best to follow your own heart and
embark upon a path which is hard but glorious. That way, if you do
become an Eternal Emperor, you’ll be truly invincible and will have
nothing and no one to be afraid of.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right!” Lord
Woodflower laughed loudly. “In the Endless Territories, there are
three almighty Hegemons. All three were freakishly powerful Daolords
who were capable of slaying Eternal Emperors, and they eventually
were successful in breaking through to become Eternal Emperors. After
they made their breakthroughs, no one has ever been able to shake
them and their positions. To show our respect for them and in order
to differentiate them from ordinary Emperors, we revere with them the
title of ‘Hegemon’. The almighty Hegemony of our own Brightshore
Kingdom is one of the three, and he has been alive for far longer
than our Twelve Palaces have existed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. A thought
suddenly flashed through his mind, causing him to take a deep breath
before asking the question which he cared about more than all other
questions. “Senior apprentice-brother Woodflower… if a truesoul
is destroyed, is the almighty Hegemon capable of reversing time to
save it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of mastery
over spacetime, it was possible that the almighty Hegemon was second
to none in all the Endless Territories. Would it be possible for him
to reverse the flow of spacetime and rescue Yu Wei?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Woodflower was
startled. He gave Ning a hard look. “In the Endless Territories,
there is indeed a legend that says it is possible to invert spacetime
itself, allowing you to reach out into the distant past and bring
back to life a person whose truesoul has already been destroyed in
the present day. However, I’ve heard that the person who uses this
technique would have to pay an utterly ruinous price. I don’t know
if the almighty Hegemon can accomplish this task, but even if he
truly can he wouldn’t make it public. To invert spacetime and
rescue a truesoul from the distant past is something which would
probably cause him to suffer heavy injuries. There’s no way he
would make something like this public.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Woodflower
continued to look at Ning. “Still… it is indeed true that if you
can reach a profound enough level of insight, you can invert
spacetime and bring someone back to life. However, it will be so
difficult that very few of the ancient powers capable of doing it
would actually be willing to carry it out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
felt excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hope.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He finally saw some
hope!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had always clung
onto a dream which even he knew was unlikely. He had felt that
theoretically, someone who had reached certain incredible heights in
the manipulation of spacetime should be able to invert it and reach
into the past to save a deceased truesoul. However, there was no
proof backing up this theory of his… but today, Lord Woodflower had
personally verified that this was indeed possible. And in fact, the
almighty Hegemon might be someone who was capable of such a thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, if Ning
wasn’t able to offer enough of an incentive and pay enough of a
price, there was no way he would be able to convince the almighty
Hegemon to do such a thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister. We will definitely be able to meet each other once
again. I don’t care how long it takes. I’m going to work hard
until the day I see you again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning closed his eyes.
When he imagined that day in the distant future, he felt as though he
could see Yu Wei smiling at him from afar. Ning felt a warmth spread
into his heart, filling him with strength and resolve.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning opened his eyes.
“Thank you, senior apprentice-brother Woodflower.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Woodflower nodded.
“Take some time and consider your choices. If you have any
questions regarding the Dao of the Sword, you can go find me in my
estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, senior
apprentice-brother Woodflower.” Ning could sense Lord Woodflower’s
goodwill and felt quite grateful towards the man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Woodflower left,
allowing Ning to search through the Pavilion of Mysteries by himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Windsmoke secret
art. The normal price is five hundred thousand cubes of chaos nectar,
and it involves…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Endless Dark
divine ability. The normal price is three hundred thousand cubes of
chaos nectar…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These divine abilities
and secret arts all had a simple explanation regarding how much one
had to pay in chaos nectar in order to purchase them. The cheapest
started off at a hundred thousand cubes, while the most expensive was
as high as three million cubes. Even for Daolords, these techniques
were truly consummate, killer techniques. Only in a place like the
Sword Palace could one easily gain access to them. In the outside
world? Acquiring such techniques would be far more difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning was
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Novessence Fire, a
million cubes of chaos nectar. This secret art was developed by
Daolord Allgod…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Novessence Water, a
million cubes of chaos nectar…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning found five
consecutive secret arts which had been developed by Daolord Allgod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They even have
Daolord Allgod’s techniques?” Ning was rather surprised. The five
secret arts he found were the [Novessence Fire], [Novessence Water],
[Novessence Earth], [Novessence Wood], and [Novessence Metal]
techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning carefully read
through the other secrets arts following them, only to find nothing
else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Curious, Ning hurriedly
ran over to the entrance to the Pavilion of Mysteries.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have you chosen,
Darknorth?” The guardian golem, Swordthree, looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I saw five of the
secret arts left behind by Daolord Allgod,” Ning said. “But I
heard that Daolord Allgod actually had nine in total?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Daolord
Allgod was an astonishingly talented man who was skilled in alchemy,
artificing, rearing bugbeasts, and more. He was a master of many
different skills, and so he was an exceptional developer of secret
arts as well. He created nine mighty secret arts, and when those nine
secret arts came together they were able to unleash utterly shocking
levels of power. Unfortunately, the Dao Alliance completely refuses
to give us the entire thing.” Swordthree shook his head. “The
almighty Hegemon made a personal appearance and paid a considerable
price, but was still only able to convince the Dao Alliance to give
us five of the secret arts belonging to Daolord Allgod. The four
remaining secret arts were even more powerful, but we weren’t able
to acquire them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now Ning understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had already come
to a decision, but to be careful he still reviewed the basic
descriptions of all the divine abilities and secret arts in the
entire Pavilion of Mysteries.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each of the five secret
arts of Daolord Allgod cost a million cubes of chaos nectar, and
every single one of those secret arts was enough to slay weak
Daolords of the Fourth Step. These were terrifying killer techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aside from the Dao
of the Sword, I have some affinity for lightning, water, and space.
Lightning and water resonate with each other and can support each
other.” These were two naturally aligned elements.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The nine secret arts
of Daolord Allgod were meant to be used together in a combination. I
shall choose the [Novessence Water] secret art.” Ning quickly made
up his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you certain you
wish to choose the [Novessence Water] secret art?” Swordthree
looked at Ning. “To tell you the truth, legacies are more important
for World-level cultivators.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am certain.”
Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
Swordthree easily dispersed the restrictive spell covering the jade
slip. “Go ahead and learn it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sent his senses
into the slip, immediately swearing the relevant lifeblood oath and
beginning to study the technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the
[Novessence Water] was very powerful, it was more of a soft, subtle
technique. By contrast, the [Novessence Thunder] was a more
dominating, destructive technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the nine secret
arts, the five pertaining to metal, wood, water, fire, and earth were
slightly weaker, whereas the [Novessence Thunder], [Novessence
Light], and the other two were slightly stronger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go to the
Armaments Gorge.” After learning the secret art, Ning departed from
the Pavilion of Mysteries and headed towards the Armaments Gorge. He
had to acquire the fourth Mirrorsnow Painting as soon as possible.
</P>

Chapter 6 – Broken Sword?
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning hovered there
in midair, staring downwards at the Armaments Gorge. He then
immediately flew downwards and landed in front of an icy building
that was erected within the gorge. This was the true Armaments Gorge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were two golems
guarding the gates to the building.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth greets
you,” Ning said courteously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swordfive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swordsix.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two golems
introduced themselves. They both had stately, solemn auras of
tremendous power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning walked past the
gates, and the two golems let him enter unimpeded. Although there
were many weapons and treasures stored here, not even Eternal
Emperors were strong enough to seize them by force. The formations
surrounding the most important parts of the Twelve Palaces had been
personally established long ago by the almighty Hegemon himself, and
the successive generations of geniuses in the Twelve Palaces had
repeatedly strengthened them and reinforced them. By now, there were
few to none in all the Endless Territories capable of breaking
inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a treasure
trove.” As soon as Ning entered, he saw the divine swords that had
been firmly planted into the ground. They were clustered tightly next
to each other, and they all emanated auras of terrifying
sword-intent. Even the weakest sword was at least an Eternal weapon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a stone stele
next to every single sword, and each stone stele had a simple line of
characters on them: “Thirty thousand cubes.” “Ninety thousand
cubes.” “Fifty thousand cubes.” These were the prices of the
swords, and the prices were actually quite low. Still, it hadn’t
been easy for the Sword Palaces to collect these wondrous weapons,
and there was no way Ning and the others could simply take the swords
away without paying anything at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s gaze suddenly
turned towards the distance, where he sensed an incredibly terrifying
sword-intent radiating from afar. Although it was quite a distance
off, and although there were thousands of other swords there, Ning
could sense that none of them were able to shake that terrifying
sword-intent in the slightest. It was a broken sword that was
emanating that aura, and it was placed atop a table.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the only sword
in the entire Armaments Gorge which was placed on a table.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A broken sword?”
Puzzled, Ning walked towards it to give it a careful look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? It was broken in
such a clean, natural way. It seems as though it was actually forged
this way and meant to be this way.” Ning quickly was able to tell
that this sword wasn’t actually ‘broken’; it was created this
way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-intent billowed
out from the sword. Ning felt as though he was a tiny ship facing the
wild waves of the ocean, about to be capsized at any moment. The
incomparably ancient sword-intent… it was the most terrifying
sword-intent Ning had ever sensed. The [Nameless] sword-art,
Violetjewel, the Forest of Sword Pagodas… none of these things had
ever given Ning such a sensation before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was vast, it was
awe-inspiring, and it was unfathomably ancient. It made Ning feel
like he was back on Earth, staring into the endless sea of stars.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” When Ning
reached within thirty meters of the broken sword, a surge of
invisible force suddenly stopped him from moving any farther. No
matter how Ning tried, he was unable to take so much as a single
extra step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I actually can’t
go any closer to it?” By now, Ning realized that there were no
other swords within thirty meters of the broken sword. “And it
doesn’t have a price tag on it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other swords all
had clearly labeled prices on the stone steles. Only this broken
sword was different. There was nothing within thirty meters of it,
not even a stone stele.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gave it a long,
deep look, firmly engraving it into his memory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughly a third of the
Armaments Gorge was set aside for swords. The rest was used to hold
many other types of treasures and unique artifacts, and they too had
prices listed next to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fifty thousand
cubes.” “Two million cubes.” “Ten million cubes.” “A
hundred and ten thousand cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The treasures and
artifacts all had different prices.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wanted to acquire
Dao lightning. Things like Watersmoke Lightning, Firecloud Lightning,
or Azurewood Lightning represented the Five Elements and thus were
fairly cheap, requiring roughly two hundred thousand cubes. Other
types of Dao lightning, however, were much more expensive. The
‘Worldbury Lightning’ cost 1.9 million cubes, and it was the most
expensive of the nine types of Dao lightning which Ning needed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was able to
acquire all nine types of Dao lightning here in the Armaments Gorge,
but the price was quite steep.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Armaments Gorge
even had a tenth type of Dao lightning that was naturally formed.
This lightning was known as the ‘Allheaven Lightning’ and cost
ten million cubes, and it could only be used if one was willing to
swear a lifeblood oath! The Allheaven Lightning could only be
harvested by the almighty Hegemon himself, and it was unique to the
Brightshore Kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If any of the other
supreme organizations wished to acquire the Allheaven Lightning, they
would have to pay an utterly shocking fee to the Brightshore Kingdom.
Only for actual members of the Brightshore Kingdom would such a ‘low’
price of ten million cubes be accepted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Allgod
himself was only able to acquire nine suitable types of Dao
lightning, at which point he created his [Novessence Thunder].”
Ning couldn’t help but sigh. “But the Brightshore Kingdom
actually has ten types…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s horizons truly
were broadened after he spent some time wandering through the
Armaments Gorge. He finally began to realize how many treasures
existed in the primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, done
already?” Swordfive, one of the two golems guarding outside, asked
Ning curiously, “What treasure have you chosen?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was looking for
but unable to find nine types of divine water, including Netherstring
Water and Wormwind Water,” Ning said. He was going to train in the
[Novessence Water] secret art and needed nine types of water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fire could be
classified into Elder fire (such as Golden Solarfire), Chaos fire,
and Dao fire. The same was true for water. When Elder Gods or
Ancestral Immortals were touched by Wormwind Water, they would find
their bodies riddled with holes. Even their truesoul would begin to
collapse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, Chaos water?”
The nearby Swordsix said in a low voice, “The Sword Palace doesn’t
have low-level water like that. One of the other palaces, the Palace
of Kindwater, definitely has it. If you really need it, we can have
the Kindwater Palace deliver it to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need nine types of
Chaos water.” Ning carefully listed out the number types of Chaos
water he needed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Novessence Water]
was also divided into two parts. The upper part involved using nine
types of Chaos water, while the lower part involved using nine types
of Dao water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a technique
which was on par with the [Novessence Lightning]. However, because of
certain innate properties of lightning, the [Novessence Thunder] was
slightly more powerful. Once these two techniques were used in unison
then they would become much more powerful, especially considering
that water and lightning were mutually complimentary elements. It
must be understood that when Daolord Allgod used all nine secret arts
together, he had been able to suppress even Eternal Emperors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. In the
Armaments Gorge, I was only able to find a copy of the third
Mirrorsnow Painting?” Ning looked at Swordfive and Swordsix.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s the only
one we have,” Swordfive said. “Emperor Mirrorsnow was a rather
dissolute and wanton figure, but his sword-arts were exceedingly
profound. Countless World-level cultivators were driven mad with lust
for his paintings. If it wasn’t for the fact that only World-level
cultivators are permitted to study from his legacies, they would
probably be much more expensive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning agreed with this
assessment. Emperor Mirrorsnow’s legacies actually provided even
Daolords with good experience. If Daolords could learn from them, the
price would become astonishingly high.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only reason why the
price was fairly low was because Emperor Mirrorsnow had decreed that
only World-level cultivators could study his legacy. How much money
could a World-level cultivator possibly have? Still, every single
painting was usually worth around a hundred thousand cubes of chaos
nectar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need the fourth
Mirrorsnow Painting,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fourth?”
Swordfive and Swordsix exchanged a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It isn’t present
within the Brightshore Kingdom. We’ll need to rely on the strength
and reach of the Twelve Palaces in order to find it somewhere else in
the primordial chaos,” Swordfive said. “If you want us to do
that… before we begin, you’ll have to pay a certain amount of
chaos nectar as a deposit. Also, if you search for one specific
painting, it’ll probably end up costing you much more money.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can accept any
price under half a million cubes,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s fine,
then.” Swordfive nodded. “Generally speaking, it costs us around
two hundred thousand cubes when we purchase one from the outside
world. It’ll just take us a bit of time. Three hundred thousand
cubes is usually the maximum. Just wait for me to send word. Once the
Twelve Palaces find the fourth Mirrorsnow Painting, I’ll
immediately inform you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How long will it
take, roughly?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Anywhere from ten
years to a thousand years.” Swordfive was rather smug. “The
Twelve Palaces are quite influential in the Endless Territories.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many of the Daolords of
the Twelve Palaces had been abducted from other places when they were
at the World level. Ning himself was a good example of this. He had
been a member of Vastheaven Palace, which was under the Dao Alliance.
He was now here in the Brightshore Kingdom, but it was guaranteed
that there was no way he would separate himself from the Dao
Alliance. This was the reason why the Twelve Palaces had such
influence throughout the Endless Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Within the gorge, I
found a broken sword that I couldn’t even get close to,” Ning
suddenly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Couldn’t get close
to?” Swordfive was startled for a moment, then nodded. “That
means you two aren’t destined to be together.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not destined?”
Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What, did you think
that it was some sort of a formation preventing you from moving
closer to it?” Swordfive asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wasn’t it?” Ning
was even more puzzled now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Swordsix
said, “Of course not! The formations within the Armaments Gorge are
only there to prevent you from taking away the treasures without
paying the price. Generally speaking, you can get close to and touch
the weapons. You were able to do so with the other weapons, right?
But that broken sword is so innately powerful that it can actually
prevent you from going too close to it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only one with the
right karmic destiny will be permitted to move close to it. If it
refuses to acknowledge you, there is nothing you can do.” Swordfive
glanced at Ning. “Not even the two Palace Lords of our Sword Palace
were acknowledged by it. After its previous master perished, it has
stayed by itself in the Armaments Gorge. It has been silent for a
long, long time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning blinked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alright, then. If even
the Palace Lords, the Vice Palace Lords, and the countless
generations of Daolords had failed to receive its approval, it only
made sense that Ning himself was unable to receive its approval as
well.

Chapter 7 – The Blazing Beast
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning knew very well
that the Endless Territories was a place filled with countless
marvelous treasures. It wasn’t surprising for this particular
treasure to have no affinity for him. It was already lucky enough for
him to have gained the Nine Chaos Seals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” After
leaving Armaments Gorge, Ning once more reunited with Su Youji.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s find a place
to live first.” Ning and Su Youji flew through the skies. Suddenly,
they saw a solitary mountain peak that jutted high up into the skies,
surrounded by clouds and mist. This was one of the taller mountains
in the Sword Palace. There were only so many ‘formal’ members of
the Sword Palace, after all. Most people could easily find a place of
their choosing within the Sword Palace, so long as there was no one
else already there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved a finger
from afar. Whoosh! An estate suddenly appeared in midair, then
descended upon the top of the mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From this day forth,
this estate shall be our residence in the Sword Palace.” Ning
looked at Su Youji. “Right, Youji. The Twelve Palaces all have
spacetime transfer arrays connecting them together. You can give the
Palace of Fire a shot. Perhaps you’ll be granted entry into it.”
He wasn’t going to be able to give her much advice in the Dao of
Fire. She’d have to rely on herself for everything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to say, now
that I’ve wandered through the Sword Palace I do feel a bit
jealous.” Su Youji grinned. “Although I know my chances aren’t
that great, I’ll still give it a shot.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sword Pagodas
towered around everything around them. It was as though countless
ancient powers were standing there in front of Ning. As Ning walked
through the Forest of Sword Pagodas, his heart was filled with
amazement and regret. So many major powers who had been the dominant
forces of their time, who had been able to defeat even Eternal
Emperors, had all passed away. The number of Daolords in the Sword
Palace who were able to live for more than a hundred thousand chaos
cycles could be counted on two hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the
unstoppable, ruinous power of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I am to become an
Eternal Emperor, then I wish to become one who is akin to the
almighty Hegemon. Otherwise… I would rather become one of those
Daolords capable of slaying Emperors. I have to become powerful
enough to convince the almighty Hegemon or someone on his level to
rescue and revive my wife!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A dreamy look was in
Ning’s eyes. “If I could bring her back… me, her, and
Brightmoon would be together once more. Our family of three would be
together again. Even if I eventually fail my Daomerge and perish, it
will all have been worth it.” Although Daolords walked a fine line
between life and death with each step, even those who failed their
Daomerge would be able to live extremely long lives. If their family
of three was able to live together in peace for some time, Ning would
be satisfied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s greatest
regret was… his wife Yu Wei had perished shortly after giving birth
to Brightmoon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning waved his
hand, causing a thatched cottage to suddenly appear next to him. This
thatched cottage was actually Ning’s temporal acceleration
treasure. Ning had made a few cosmetic alterations to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning entered the
thatched cottage, then sat down in the lotus position. He set the
flow of time to a hundred times the normal rate, then turned his gaze
towards the distant Sword Pagodas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many supreme
sword-arts for me to analyze… and in fact, every single sword-art
is filled with the sword-intent of its creator.” Ning couldn’t
help but sigh at this. For most cultivators, greed was not a good
thing. In fact, if you learned too many techniques, you might end up
losing yourself or your own way. However, Ning’s path was a path
that began from understanding the fundamental essence of the sword,
and it was a path he would walk by analyzing and dissecting all other
sword-arts, absorbing their best parts into his own [Brightmoon]
sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Brightmoon]
sword-art was still quite young and incomplete, but Ning had chosen a
path where he would use it to embody all the mysteries of the Dao of
the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This path Ning had
chosen was a very difficult path. It had been a blurry, unclear path
for Ning back when he was in the Three Realms, but the guidance
Daolord Solesky had given Ning had made everything clear! He had
analyzed thousands of sword-arts in the Allgod Estate, and now he had
arrived in the most sacred part of the Sword Palace, the Forest of
Sword Pagodas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are 83612
Sword Pagodas here, many of which are comparable to my [Nameless]
sword-art. I have to treasure this opportunity.” Having come from
the Three Realms, Ning knew exactly how precious this opportunity
was. It must be understood that the reason why none of the others had
been able to reach the World level was because they had no access to
good techniques. This was true for Ning’s own master, Suhbuti, as
well as the martyrs such as Houyi or Three Purities. It was only in
recent years that Ning’s Primaltwin had begun to transmit more
information regarding the Dao back home.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, this
opportunity in the Sword Palace was truly priceless, and Ning valued
it immensely. He was the second person to leave the Three Realms,
with Mother Nuwa being the first. He didn’t know what had happened
to Mother Nuwa, but he was determined to seize this opportunity to
make himself as strong as he possibly could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji stood outside
the Forest of Sword Pagodas, staring at that distant form which was
seated in that thatched cottage. The white-robed youth was completely
absorbed with meditating on his sword-arts, and countless streams of
swordforce began to naturally manifest in the area around him,
followed by one sword-stance after another. These things manifested
whenever Ning had a new insight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master has never had
a truly excellent teacher who was able to give him any good guidance.
Now, after so long, he has finally reached a truly holy place for
cultivation. I imagine this will result in his power skyrocketing.
He’ll be even more dazzling than before,” Su Youji murmured
silently to herself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to work hard
as well. Now that I have the legacy of Feixian the Exalted, I should
be able to provide him with some assistance.” All this time, it had
been Ning helping Su Youji rather than vice versa. She felt grateful,
but she also wanted to be able to do something for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go to the
Palace of Fire.” Su Youji turned her head and departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Twelve Palaces were
all linked together by spacetime transfer arrays.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many World-level
cultivators here?” When Su Youji arrived at the Palace of Fire, she
saw numerous World-level cultivators on the path before her seated in
the lotus position. She walked forwards, quickly reaching the end of
the path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Halt!” Suddenly, a
black-armored Daolord barked out at Su Youji.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wish to join the
Palace of Fire,” Su Youji said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ll have to
wait. In about half a month, the next batch of World-level
cultivators will be permitted to take part in the trials.” The
black-armored Daolord gave her a cold look. “You World-level
cultivators are only permitted to remain on this path. You are not
permitted to go into other parts of the palace without prior
permission. If you do, the restrictive spells here will automatically
activate and burn you to a crisp.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Su
Youji immediately nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When she had entered
the Sword Palace, she had been alongside Ji Ning and so the
black-armored Daolord had been fairly courteous to her. Normally,
however, the black-armored Daolords were quite cold and indifferent
to these applicants. There were simply too many of them, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Another half month.”
Su Youji found an empty spot and sat down in the lotus position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Another newcomer.
There really are a lot of people who wish to join the Palace of
Fire.” Just a few hundred meters away from Su Youji was a chubby
youth dressed in fiery robes. The chubby youth mumbled to himself,
“I’m a venerable grandmaster of alchemy, but I not only was
rejected by the Palace of Spacetime, I even failed the trials of the
Palace of Fire. Ugh. What should I do? Why the hell isn’t there a
Palace of Alchemy?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The chubby youth shook
his head. “I’m skilled in alchemy, spacetime, and fire, but I
wasn’t able to pass the trials of either the Palace of Spacetime or
the Palace of Fire…” The chubby youth sighed. “It seems I’ll
have to seek out brother Darknorth and ask him to help. He definitely
entered one of the Twelve Palaces. If I follow him, things will be a
bit easier for me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This chubby youth was
World God Pillsaint.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He truly was an unlucky
fellow. He himself was an extremely skilled, grandmaster-level
alchemist and pillmaker. Why would a person like him be forced to
engage in combat? In the past, he had to simply wave his hand and
whatever he wished would be carried out, and his master would often
give him advice with regards to alchemy. Who would’ve thought that
he would suddenly be abducted to the Astral Islands. In the Astral
Islands, combat was all that mattered. Who cared about you being an
alchemist? He had started off with an Eternal weapon, but as soon as
he arrived he had been robbed of it. Thankfully, alchemy required
high levels of insight into both fire and spacetime, and he was quite
skilled in both. This was why he had been able to survive for so
long… but accumulating a complete legacy and being able to escape
was incredibly difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was all thanks to Ji
Ning’s assistance that he had been lucky enough to survive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His skill in alchemy
made his life in the Brightshore Kingdom an easy one, which was why
he was able to reach the Twelve Palaces. Alas, his skills weren’t
enough for him to enter the Twelve Palaces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll keep trying.
The trials for the Spacetime Palace were too difficult, but if I
improve a bit in the Dao of Fire I might be able to make it into the
Fire Palace.” World God Pillsaint gritted his teeth. He was
determined to make something of this.. He knew that entering the
Palace of Fire would be a tremendous boon, and he deeply desired to
succeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Su Youji and
Pillsaint were just a few hundred meters from each other, neither
knew each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial palace of
the Brightshore Kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A blazing beast of fire
was racing through the void of space. There were a few chaos stars in
this vast region, which was part of the Brightshore Kingdom’s even
vaster imperial palace. This was the place where the almighty Hegemon
usually rested and resided.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blazing beast was
racing happily through it. Ever since it had been captured, it had
been living a terrifying life of danger and adventure. Although a
powerful member of his race known as ‘King Wu’ had been keeping
eyes on it, it had still been worried that it might die at any
moment. Thus, it had never dared to relax in the slightest. But now,
it had finally survived and succeeded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Child.” An
enormous behemoth appeared within the emptiness of space. When the
behemoth stared at the blazing beast, its eyes were filled with
warmth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hegemon.” The
blazing beast was so frightened that it immediately came to a halt
and stood there obediently. It already knew that the almighty Hegemon
was the most powerful member of their race.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ever since you were
born, you have been training by yourself. You are still too young.
Most of your time has been spent in slumber. Although you didn’t
spend too much time in the abyss of the Astral Islands, you have
still improved significantly. You are now qualified to enter the
Archaeus region.” The giant behemoth’s head spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Archaeus
region?” The blazing beast was puzzled. “Where, exactly?”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 8 – The Archaeus Region
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the almighty Hegemon
used his true form to chat with the blazing beast, something else was
happening at another part of the imperial palace, a place where there
were thirteen royal thrones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the thrones was
as white as snow. The other twelve were golden in color.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-bearded,
snowy-robed old man with six horns was seated atop the snowy-white
throne. The other twelve golden thrones were occupied by twelve
golden-armored figures, and Daolord Woodflower was one of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have summoned you
all because there is something I wish to discuss with you.” The
six-horned, white-bearded old man smiled. “As you all know, my race
just gained a new member. This kid was born with exceptional innate
gifts, and in a thousand short years he’s managed to escape the
abyss below the Astral Islands. Even amongst my Imperials, he is a
rare breed who stands at the very top.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
Hegemon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am confident that
this child shall soon reach the ‘King’ level of power in your
clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Brightshore
Imperials have gained yet another expert.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twelve
golden-armored figures belonged to the Twelve Palaces, and they all
spoke some words of flattery. Still, these words were also words of
truth. The dark abyss below the Astral Islands was reserved for
tempering and training new members of the imperial race. Generally
speaking, the new members of the race had been wandering the outside
world alone and didn’t really have any good teachers. Most of them
needed to spend a long period of time in the abyss before overcoming
its trials. In addition, the Imperials were so few in number that
every new addition to their race was a cause for celebration. A new
Imperial who was exceptionally talented was even more precious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The almighty Hegemon
beamed merrily. Clearly, he was in an excellent mood. “This young
fellow is so talented that I wish to send him into one of the
alternate universes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alternate universe?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An alternate
universe?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of the twelve
golden-armored figures turned pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hegemon, none of us
have ever been to that place before.” They all began to worry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,”
the Hegemon said. “As you know, when I was meditating on the Dao of
Spacetime, I once discovered traces of a completely different
universe within the flows of spacetime and opened up a transversal
conduit to it. Our two universes have different essences, which has
an impact on my transversal conduit. Only those below the Daolord
level of power are able to enter… but I was able to let my will
slowly seep into that alternate universe and seduce some of its local
lifeforms to come to our universe. Quite a few World-level
cultivators from that universe have passed through my transversal
conduit to come to our universe. I’ve gone through their memories
and have learned quite a bit regarding that universe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Hegemon had
discovered an alternate universe, had opened a transversal conduit to
it, and then had been able to force his will through the conduit,
even though he himself wasn’t able to pass through it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The almighty Hegemon’s
powers truly were quite terrifying!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But… that’s
still an alternate universe.” The twelve golden-armored powers were
all quite wary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ‘Endless
Territories’…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was a place that was
so incredibly vast that it was still filled with many places which no
one had ever explored. Many who broke through to become Eternal
Emperors eventually left to wander the territories, only to never be
heard from again. However, in the eyes of the greatest powers this
infinitely vast region known as the ‘Endless Territories’ was
actually merely just a single ‘universe’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each universe had its
own prime essences. An ‘alternate universe’ referred to a region
which seemed similar but which had its own set of prime essences. For
example, the prime essence of the Dao of the Sword in this universe
would be different from that of the alternate universe. Thus, one
could easily sense when one was in an alternate universe, as even the
prime essences would be different.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When I sent my will
into that alternate universe, I was able to scan quite a few
chaosworlds close to the exit of my conduit,” the almighty Hegemon
said. “I’ve been watching this universe for many years, and now
know quite a few things about it. There aren’t that many
differences between our two universes. The main difference is that
cultivators in the Endless Territories are spread out across many
different organizations, but the alternate universe has a single
unified power ruling over it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Hegemon continued,
“In the alternate universe, there is a place known as the Archaeus
region. Countless cultivators in that universe deeply desire to enter
the Archaeus region, and even many Daolords dream of having a chance
to enter it. However, only a tiny number are able to enter it… but
those who enter and then come out alive again are all strengthened
dramatically.” The almighty Hegemon let out a sigh. “Although it
might be a bit dangerous, cultivators who live in perfect safety will
get soft. They won’t be able to make it far on their paths.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When you live on the
edge between life and death, you’ll encounter many dangers but also
encounter many miracles. The young fellow’s level of talent is so
great that it is rare even amongst members of my race. I’ve
prepared quite a few dangerous regions for him to test himself
against, and the Archaeus region of the alternate universe is the
first place and an extremely important place. If he can survive it,
he’ll definitely have undergone utterly earthshaking
transformations. In addition, once he is able to unify the mysteries
of both our universe and the alternate universe, his future potential
will be truly unlimited,” the almighty Hegemon said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twelve
golden-armored experts grew increasingly interested as they listened
to the Hegemon speak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was true that the
path of cultivation had to be a path filled with danger. Only by
experiencing more things and seeing more wonders would one be able to
walk farther along one’s path. For example, if Ji Ning had always
trained by himself without going out adventuring, how strong could he
possibly become? It was due to his adventures that he had first gone
to the Allgod Estate, then to the Brightshore Kingdom. This was why
he had grown so strong, so quickly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This alternate
universe… it was a place which most likely no one in all the
Endless Territories had ever visited!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the almighty
Hegemon had created his transversal conduit, it had been limited by
the differences in the laws between the two universes. As a result,
only those below the Daolord level of power could use it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hegemon, will
members of the Twelve Palaces also be permitted to go?” Daolord
Thousand Waves suddenly asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, Hegemon. The
Twelve Palaces have quite a few talented World-level cultivators as
well.” Daolord Puregood of the Palace of Fire was a man with a full
red beard, and his face was red with excitement right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the Hegemon was
going to send one of his own clansmen into that alternate universe,
it meant that he probably felt confident in his clansman’s chances.
It must be understood that the Hegemon was extremely protective of
his clansmen. The entire reason he had founded the Brightshore
Kingdom and developed the Twelve Palaces was so that there would be
more protectors for his race! Given that the blazing beast was an
incredibly talented member of his race… although the Daolords
didn’t know much about this ‘Archaeus region’, they felt
certain that it would be a good place. They naturally had to try and
win a chance for their people to enter it as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve invited you
all to come here precisely because of this matter. Over the course of
countless years, I’ve managed to seduce many World-level
cultivators into entering our universe, and I managed to acquire a
number of Archaeus medallions from them. You must have an Archaeus
medallion in order to enter the Archaeus region… but of course,
that’ll only be enough to gain entry. You will still have to face
and overcome all the dangers inside the region itself,” the
almighty Hegemon said. “I’m not completely confident in the young
fellow’s chances, which is why I’ve come to ask you for your
help. I would like for the Twelve Palaces to choose four other
World-level cultivators to accompany him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have five Archaeus
medallions. That means a total of five World-level cultivators,”
the almighty Hegemon said. “Choose four from the Twelve Palaces.
They shall work together with that young fellow of my race, and
they’ll all stand a better chance as a result.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Absolutely.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Brightshore Kingdom
was one of the supreme organizations of the Endless Territories,
after all. If they were only permitted to choose four World-level
cultivators, they would most assuredly choose freaks that were strong
enough to defeat ordinary Daolords of the First Step. If they went
into the alternate universe, they most likely would stand a good
chance of overcoming the Archaeus region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just four, Hegemon?
Can’t we bring a few more?” Daolord Thousand Waves immediately
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hegemon, just four…
it’ll be a bit hard to choose.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just four for all
twelve of our palaces? Our Palace of the Saber alone has more than
eight Saberlords at the World level.” Everyone present began to
feel a bit frustrated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The almighty Hegemon
simply said, “Bertulu and Eastcult are peerless geniuses, the likes
of which even our Brightshore Kingdom only sees once in countless
eons. In addition, both of them are most likely preparing to become
Daolords soon. There’s no need for them to go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twelve
golden-armored figures all nodded in agreement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bertulu and Eastcult
could be said to have reached the true apex of power for World-level
cultivators. There was no point to them tempering themselves at the
World level any longer, especially Bertulu. Even prior to joining the
Twelve Palaces, Bertulu had already reached the utmost peak of what
even geniuses could reach. Eastcult, at least, had only reached that
level after joining the Palace of the Saber and training in it for a
period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of them are
exempted. Aside from them, any member of the Twelve Palaces who have
been acknowledged by their respective pagodas shall be considered,”
the Hegemon said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Twelve Palaces each
had a forest of pagodas. The one in the Sword Palace was known as the
Forest of Sword Pagodas, whereas the one in the Fire Palace was known
as the Forest of Fire Pagodas. The names were all fairly similar, and
the concepts were the same; the World-level cultivators in the Twelve
Palaces had to reach extremely high levels of mastery in a relevant
Dao in order to be acknowledged by the pagodas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sword Palace only
had six Swordlords. As for the Saber Palace, it had eight Saberlords.
However, since Eastcult was excluded, it only had seven.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aside from Bertulu
and Eastcult, the Twelve Palaces have a total of sixty-six
World-level cultivators who have been acknowledged by their
respective pagodas,” Daolord Thousand Waves said. “How are we
supposed to choose? Four out of sixty-six! I imagine all of them
would badly desire to enter this Archaeus region.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A chance to enter an
alternate universe… it truly was a chance which, once missed, might
never come again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No rush. That young
fellow has just recently returned from the Astral Islands’ abyss. I
need to teach him quite a few techniques first,” the almighty
Hegemon said. “I’ll keep a close eye on him. When he is fully
prepared, I’ll choose the four strongest cultivators.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The almighty Hegemon
waved his hand, causing a series of images to appear in the empty air
around him. A total of sixty-six scenes appeared, with the sixty-six
candidates having appeared within them. These were all candidates who
had been acknowledged by their respective pagodas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And of course… Ji
Ning wasn’t one of them.
</P>

Chapter 9 – The Full Mirrorsnow Set
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Saber Palace
won’t push for too much. Two slots is enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yinwind, there’s
only four slots total. Your Saber Palace wishes to take half of
them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We might even take
three.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twelve
golden-armored powers began to chat amongst themselves while they
evaluated the sixty-six figures that had appeared in midair. They
were actually quite familiar with most of the stronger World-level
cultivators in every palace… and it was true that the Saber Palace
held the most outstanding World-level cultivators of this generation!
Prior to Bertulu’s arrival, Eastcult of the Saber Palace had been
the indisputably most powerful World-level cultivator in the Twelve
Palaces. As for the other Saberlords, they were all shockingly
powerful as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the Vice Palace
Lord of the Saber Palace, Daolord Yinwind, spoke of possibly taking
three slots… he wasn’t exaggerating!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a reason why
this generation of World-level cultivators in the Saber Palace were
all so strong. It was because the current Palace Lord of the Saber
Palace… was Palace Lord Dawnstar! Lord Dawnstar was indisputably
the most powerful expert amongst all the Daolords of the Twelve
Palaces. In fact, even if you looked at all of the Daolords belonging
to the various organizations of the Endless Territories, Lord
Dawnstar would rank in the top three.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was such a
freakishly strong figure that he had needed just three strokes of his
saber to slay an Eternal Emperor. He was also a Verge-level Daolord,
and one could imagine how difficult the Dao he had chosen was. To
successfully Daomerge would be incredibly difficult, and so he
focused almost all of his efforts on it. However, for a period of
time he had actually chosen to teach the World-level disciples of the
Saber Palace in an extremely earnest, diligent manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those World-level
cultivators had all received the personal, attentive guidance of Lord
Dawnstar! He had spent ten million years educating them, then had
left the Brightshore Kingdom and gone off to adventure through other
places.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To teach others was
also a form of training, in and of itself. To Lord Dawnstar, it was
just one of many things he was doing to prepare for his Daomerge, but
to those World-level cultivators it had been a stroke of tremendous
karmic fortune. Lord Dawnstar was definitely one of the top three
experts of the Dao of the Saber in all the Endless Territories, even
if one factored in the various Eternal Emperors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And thus…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This generation of
World-level experts in the Palace of the Saber all became incredibly
strong, and the geniuses among their ranks became even more dazzling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Palace of the
Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Palace Lord.”
Three World-level cultivators bowed respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Woodflower was
seated in the lotus position as he looked back at the three of them.
His true body was here in the Sword Palace; the one which had been in
the imperial palace was merely an incarnation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A great opportunity
has come before you,” Lord Woodflower said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Swordlord
Wildfire, Swordlord Yicheng, and Swordlord Graceless’s eyes all lit
up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The other three
Swordlords are returning from elsewhere in the Brightshore Kingdom.
The six of you will need to make some immediately preparations,”
Lord Woodflower said. “Bertulu and Eastcult aside, all of the
World-level cultivators acknowledged by the pagodas shall have a
chance to win this chance. However… in the end, only four will
succeed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swordlord Wildfire and
the others were all surprised upon hearing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those acknowledged by
the pagodas were all capable of breaking through to become Daolords
at any time… and they would all become extraordinary Daolords! If
only four were to be chosen… what sort of opportunity was this?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Make your
preparations. I hope that at least one of the four will be from our
Palace of the Sword.” Lord Woodflower sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
Palace Lord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We will all work
hard.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Swordlords
present were all filled with resolve and determination.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Lord
Woodflower knew that determination alone wasn’t enough. Everyone
acknowledged by the pagodas was filled with determination. In the
end, strength was what would matter. Alas, this generation of
World-level experts from the Palace of the Saber were simply too
strong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the following days,
those who had been acknowledged by the pagodas were all secretly
summoned back from throughout the adventuring areas within the
Brightshore Kingdom by the various leaders of the Twelve Palaces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Palace of the
Sword. The Daolord Cloudworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed youth
appeared out of nowhere within the skies of the Daolord Cloudword. He
looked quite bedraggled, and his body was covered with bloody scars.
However, he quickly became clean once more after a bit of light
flashed over his body. Ji Ning hadn’t even heard the news about
this exciting opportunity. As a result, he continued to live a
relaxed and happy life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Life really was quite
relaxed and exciting. The reason why Ning had focused on the Dao of
the Sword for so long was because he truly did love training with the
sword. This was a love that came from the bottom of his heart, and
the feeling of continuing to improve with the sword was absolutely
intoxicating for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Sword
Palace, it was a holy land for sword practitioners.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is absolutely
wonderful. I can spend a few hundred years meditating in the Forest
of Sword Pagodas and gain many new ideas, then enter the Daolord
Cloudworld and use them in actual battle to further verify and refine
my sword-arts.” Ning flew through the skies in a very pleased
manner. It had been twenty years since he had entered the Sword
Palace, but his temporal acceleration treasure made it so that he had
actually engaged in two thousand years of cultivation. He had already
tried out the Daolord Cloudworld on numerous occasions by now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youji still isn’t
back?” Ning glanced sideways at his distant estate at the peak of
the mountain. Su Youji still had yet to return. “It seems she has
completely set her mind upon entering the Palace of Fire.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Darknoth! Junior apprentice-brother Darknorth!”
Shouts rang out from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned his head,
only to see a tall, muscular, heavily-bearded Daolord dressed in
black armor fly towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, you are…?” Ning truly didn’t recognize this
person. The Sword Palace had quite a few black-armored Daolords, and
Ning had spent most of his time training and very little time in
making friends. He truly didn’t know many people in the Sword
Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My name is Jiwang,”
the black-armored Daolord said. “Swordfive of Armaments Gorge asked
me to send word for you to go meet him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swordfive?” Ning’s
eyes lit up. Swordfive was a golem. Golems focused exclusively on
their duty, which meant Swordfive wouldn’t summon him without a
reason. Ning had long ago purchased the [Novessence Water], which
meant the only thing still pending at the Armaments Gorge was his
request for them to help him purchase the fourth Mirrorsnow Painting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Daolord
Jiwang,” Ning said, then immediately flew away from his estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning descended upon the
Armaments Gorge, then immediately turned to look at Swordfive and
Swordsix. They each stood to one side of the entranceway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.”
Swordfive nodded at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is it the Mirrorsnow
Painting?” Ning couldn’t help but blurt out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aren’t you the
impatient one.” Swordfive chuckled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning grinned as well.
“How can I not be? When I joined the Sword Palace, I didn’t
choose a legacy.” Because Ning already had access to Emperor
Mirrorsnow’s legacy, the other legacies in the Sword Palace really
weren’t of interest to Ning. Although the Sword Palace did have
legacies left behind by Eternal Emperors, they could only be chosen
after Ning was acknowledged by the Sword Pagodas and passed the
trials the Eternal Emperors had left behind. Ning clearly didn’t
fulfill these requirements at present… and the other legacies were
clearly inferior to Emperor Mirrorsnow’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You were wise not to
choose,” Swordfive said. “Your luck wasn’t bad. We didn’t
need to spend too much effort in finding this fourth painting.
However… the other party probably was able to guess that you care
deeply about this painting, and so he gave a rather high price. You
have to pay three hundred thousand cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. The Twelve
Palaces had certain rules governing them. If you sent out word
through the Twelve Palaces that you wished for the Daolords to help
you find a certain item, there would be many Daolords who would help
out. However, only the person who successfully located the treasure
you wanted would be given a commission in thanks, as well as the
Daolord who helped escort the treasure back to the palaces. The total
commission given would be 10%. The other Daolords would have done all
their work for nothing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here are the three
hundred and thirty thousand cubes.” Ning handed a gourd over to
Swordfive, who accepted and inspected it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Swordfive waved
his hand, causing a painting which emanated sword-ki to fly out from
deep within the Armaments Gorge. This painting depicted an image of
an icy, snowy land.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take it.”
Swordfive handed it over to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t
disguise his excitement as he accepted this painting of an icy
snowland. Finally. He finally found it! Emperor Mirrorsnow had never
accepted any true disciples, and so before he decided to go off
adventuring he had produced these ten sets of paintings and spread
them out into the universe. Those World-level cultivators who
collected a full set of four and overcame his trials would become his
personal disciples!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A personal disciple
of an Eternal Emperor? Since he dared make the claim that those who
acquired a full set would become his personal disciple, I imagine I
won’t be disappointed by the legacy he left behind.” Ning was
filled with eagerness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some legacies merely
involved individual techniques or abilities. Others had more thought
put into them, such as World God Northrest who had worked hard to set
up those ninety-eight stone steles to guide Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the best ones…
they included divine abilities, treasures, secret arts, and more.
Daoist Threelives was a classic example. He had left behind
everything for his successor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder what
Emperor Mirrorsnow left behind. Now that I have the full set, all I
need to do is pass the fourth and final trial. I’ve already passed
the first three trials; only the last one remains.” Ning
immediately picked up the painting and put it away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you.” Ning
expressed his thanks to Swordfive and Swordsix, then transformed into
a streak of light and disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quickly returned
to his own Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! He flew into
his estate, then shut the gates with a loud bang! No one would be
able to bother him now. Even if Su Youji returned, she would have to
stay outside and wait for him. Ning absolutely would not let anyone
disturb him at all right now.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world within the
fourth painting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh. A cold wind
howled through as snow drifted through the skies. This was a world of
ice and snow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning appeared out of
nowhere. He swept the area with his gaze, then began to walk towards
a distant thatched hut. A white-haired, grim-looking man was seated
in the lotus position within the thatched hut. In front of him was a
flagon of wine that was surrounded by flames. Also on the table, next
to the wine, was an ordinary sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm?” Ning looked
at the white-haired man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What, has Daolord
Flylead gained yet another disciple in his Snowsword Sect?” The
white-haired man looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Flylead? I
don’t know him.” Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The
white-haired man glanced at Ning in surprise. “In this chaos cycle,
Daolord Flylead has sent more than ten World-level cultivators to
duel with me in swordplay. Although he himself isn’t that strong,
he’s still a Daolord of the Third Step. Are you actually strong
enough to seize the fourth painting from him by force?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly
understood. This painting had been in the hands of a Daolord, and one
who often sent different disciples into this place to duel in
swordplay. It made sense. The first Mirrorsnow Painting had been in
the hands of Daolord Windsource, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not currently
capable of seizing treasures from a Daolord of the Third Step. I
bought it,” Ning said. “I have already defeated the emperor, the
fisherman, and the assassin. Now, the only one left is you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve already
defeated the other three?” Light flashed through the eyes of the
previously calm-looking man, and a desire to do battle began to
radiate from him. He stretched his hand out, picking up the sword
from the table as he rose to his feet. He slowly walked out of his
thatched hut, his gaze focused on Ning. “You can address me as…
swordsman!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swordsman?” Ning
was stunned. The man asked him to address him as ‘swordsman’.
Ning had the sense that this person wasn’t going to be easy to deal
with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am the final trial
for you.” The white-haired man stood there atop the snow, staring
at Ning. “Draw your sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” With a
flash, a Frostice sword appeared in Ning’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two were merely
competing in swordplay, and so they would refrain from using divine
abilities or special treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was the first to
strike. His sword-light flashed, causing his power to condense so
tightly that it didn’t even have any impact at all on the
snowflakes falling around it. It wasn’t necessarily true that a
loud commotion and grand display of might meant that a person was
strong. Dao lightning was a good example of this. When its power was
unchained and flailed out randomly, its power was somewhat weakened.
Only by focusing it tightly and using it against a single opponent
would it unleash its maximum power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The same was true for
sword-arts!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! The white-haired
man struck out as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The swords of both
moved vastly faster than the limits of the Heavenly Daos, vastly
faster than the speed of light. If ordinary mortals were watching…
in fact, if Celestial Immortals or Empyrean Gods were watching…
they would only see two blurs flickering. They wouldn’t even see
any sword-light, because the swords were moving faster than they
could see.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two constantly
flashed and flickered through the falling snow, their sword-light
clashing repeatedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a powerful and
pure sword-art.” Ning was secretly shocked. This white-haired man’s
sword-arts definitely were strong enough for him to be addressed as
‘swordsman’, and he lived up to his reputation as the final
trial. If the emperor, the fisherman, and the assassin all belonged
to different schools of swordplay, then this swordsman’s sword-arts
encompassed all schools.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His sword-arts could be
explosive, could be ephemeral, but could also be cold and sharp…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Technically, his
sword-arts were ‘merely’ on the same level of unpredictability as
the assassin’s and the same level of ephemeralness as the
fisherman’s. However, because he had reached such a high level in
every aspect, his sword-arts became incredibly terrifying to deal
with. When a person reached a level where he had no flaws at all, his
attacks could easily transform into defensive movements, which could
easily translate into deceptive openings, which could easily
transform into such assassination strikes. All the changes and
transformations were very fluid and natural.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like an endless
cycle that had inexhaustible moves. Ning had reached a very high
level of sword-arts. His sword-arts were significantly better than
that of the emperor, the fisherman, and the assassin, making it easy
for him to defeat them, but for a time he was completely unable to do
anything to this ‘swordsman’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light continued
to clash repeatedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was filled with a
strong desire to win, causing him to constantly try new tactics for
gaining victory. Slowly, the insights he had gained in the Forest of
Sword Pagodas began to merge into his Unicorn’s Domain. In truth,
Ning had been steadily improving in the Unicorn’s Domain during his
years in the Sword Palace, as it represented a path in sword
cultivation to begin with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a path that
could be continuously perfected. It would even allow him to become a
Daolord of the First Step, a Daolord of the Second Step, or even a
Daolord of the Third Step…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, this path
wasn’t the most difficult path. It was merely a path on par with
the fisherman’s path, and it represented the sixth stance of the
[Nameless] sword-art. The seventh stance of the [Nameless] sword-art
represented a path that was even more difficult to take.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Without Ning even
realizing it, the two ended up battling for more than six hours. As
the fight progressed, Ning’s advantage became increasingly
apparent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It made sense. He had
already been able to defeat the first three trials while he had been
in the Astral Islands. Although he hadn’t spent too much time in
the Sword Palace, two thousand years of accelerated time had resulted
in him improving significantly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An emphemeral streak of
sword-light brushed past the white-haired man’s sword, then stabbed
him in the throat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning then withdrew his
sword and stepped back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You won.” The
white-haired man smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, had a
rather distant look in his gaze. Victory in this battle had taught
Ning what choosing a path truly meant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Unicorn’s Domain
was a comparatively easier path. The white-haired man’s path was a
path that perfectly fused together multiple different paths of the
sword. This was a path that was more than ten times harder to
traverse, but it was also more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Daolord of the Fourth
Step could easily defeat the white-haired man’s sword-arts using
the Unicorn’s Domain. Ji Ning had similarly reached an incredibly
high level of expertise in the Unicorn’s Domain, and he could sense
that he was just a hair away from becoming a Daolord. If he made some
more breakthroughs, he would probably be able to reach the Daolord
level whenever he wished… but that would mean that he would have
become a Daolord through the Unicorn’s Domain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However… in the
end, the Unicorn’s Domain is not my path. Nor is the white-haired
man’s sword-art my path.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s path was a
path that would lead him to the very essence of the sword itself. He
would infuse all of the essence of the sword and countless sword-arts
into his own [Brightmoon] sword-art, which represented his truest
path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-haired man
had merely fused a few different sword-arts in a perfect manner. It
was more profound than the Unicorn’s Domain, but it couldn’t
really be said to point to the true essence of the sword itself. The
latter path was the purest and most difficult path to take… but
this was what Ning wished to obtain from his sword cultivation. He
had to take this path. Only by taking the path you wished to take
would you be on the most suitable path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was seated in the
lotus position within his Immortal estate. It had merely been a
divine power clone which he had sent into the fourth world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After defeating the
overseer of the fourth painting, Ning called out with his will and
summoned all four Mirrorsnow Paintings. The four paintings hung there
in the air, slowly drawing closer to each other before they
completely merged into one. After the four paintings completely
merged together, they actually transformed into a single painting.
This painting looked quite ordinary, and it didn’t have any
sword-intent within it. It did, however, depict a man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This man carried a
sword on his back and was staring off into the distance. He looked
extremely handsome and suave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciple, this is
the painting of myself, your master. Kowtow three times first.” A
voice rang out from within the painting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was badly startled
by this. In the next moment, he felt completely speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jeeze, Emperor
Mirrorsnow… why are you such a narcissist? After the four paintings
merged together, they actually formed a self-portrait of yourself?
And you actually drew yourself in such a perfect, flawless manner?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other paintings
were all quite terrible, but his portrait was quite well-done. The
strange thing was, there was almost no sword-intent radiating from
this image. Ning strongly suspected that this probably wasn’t
actually drawn by Emperor Mirrorsnow himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no way the
man could paint such a nice portrait.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder what this
master of mine has left behind. I had best kowtow first.” Ning
immediately knelt down, kowtowing three times to the levitating
painting of Emperor Mirrorsnow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as he finished
kowtowing, the painting emanated a blinding light that completely
surrounded Ning. Ning didn’t resist, and with a swoosh he was drawn
directly inside of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Eternal
Emperor’s painting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an incredibly
vast and ancient world. A man carrying a sword on his back was
standing there atop the desolate earth, and there were four retainers
who were standing by his side in a respectful manner. These four
retainers were the emperor, the assassin, the fisherman, and the
swordsman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning appeared out of
nowhere next to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciple.” The man
carrying the longsword on his back looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
understood that this person was most likely Emperor Mirrorsnow.
Still… it most likely wasn’t the Eternal Emperor’s true form.
Actually, the Eternal Emperor really did look quite handsome. The
painting apparently had been an accurate one, and the sword-intent
which naturally radiated from his eyes caused Ning to feel a sense of
alarm in his heart. Although this sword-intent seemed quite calm, it
had a hidden sharpness that was far more terrifying than the
sensation which Daolord Woodflower had emanated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master,” Ning
called out respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a world
which will only appear after all four paintings merge together.”
The Eternal Emperor looked at Ning. “I’ve left a strand of my
will in this place, all for the sake of waiting for you, my dear
apprentice.”

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eternal Emperor
looked at Ji Ning, extremely moved. “I delight in exploring, in
visiting one beautiful new world after another. I truly don’t have
the patience necessary to teach a disciple. However… if I keep
adventuring like this, I’ll probably die one day. If I die, I die,
but I’m afraid that after enough years pass, even my name shall be
forgotten by the vast majority of cultivators.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It will be you, my
dear disciples, who shall ensure that my name and reputation shall
exist unto perpetuity. Once you become my personal disciple, you must
accept ten more disciples on my behalf before you attempt your
Daomerge. They can be considered honorary disciples of mine,” the
Eternal Emperor said. “The skills I impart unto you, you can only
impart unto those ten honorary disciples.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple
understands.” Ning nodded.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Accept ten disciples
before his Daomerge? This was a fairly easy oath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then swear the
oath,” the Eternal Emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately swore
a lifeblood oath. If he wanted to transmit certain legacies to his
future disciples or to Subhuti and the others in the Three Realms, he
could simply transmit his own insights. He would have a Dao that was
completely his own, after all! The Eternal Emperor’s legacy
primarily served as a guidepost for him, a way to show him how he
should walk his future path and avoid certain wrong choices.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If a person walked
forward blindly without any guideposts, it would be easy to get lost
and make the wrong decisions. Ever step taken by a Samsara Daolord
was a step which straddled the line between life and death. There
were no ways to take back a misstep! Once you made that misstep, you
would die and your Dao would dissipate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The Eternal
Emperor watched Ning swear the oath, nodding in satisfaction. He
transformed into a streak of light that flew straight into Ning’s
body. Ning wasn’t able to resist him in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just stood there
in the middle of the wilderness, surrounded by the four retainers of
the Emperor. The swordsman, the fisherman, the assassin, and the
emperor all stared at him as ripples of power began to emanate from
the area around him. Clearly, the many memories and abilities which
the Eternal Emperor’s strand of will contained were merging into
Ning’s own memories. That strand of divine will held simply too
much power and memories, making it physically painful for even
someone as mighty as Ning to absorb.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Ning’s sea of
consciousness. A large amount of information was flooding into this
place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Before I succeeded
in my Daomerge, I obtained an Eternal sword-art known as the
[Heartseal] sword-art. This sword-art has a total of fifteen stances.
This is the first stance, the Flysword stance…” A memory fragment
entered Ning’s mind. The speaker was Emperor Mirrorsnow, and in the
memory he wielded a single sword and began to display the first
stance of the [Heartseal] sword-art.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Mirrorsnow’s
will was in complete control of these many memory fragments. He made
it so that Ning was able to personally watch his memories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is second
stance, the Mountainsword stance.” Emperor Mirrorsnow put this
stance on display as well. This was a far more effective method than
simply meditating on sword-intent, as the Eternal Emperor was putting
on a personal display. Not only was his sword-intent clear and
obvious, he executed every movement in perfect detail and clarity.
For the sake of being able to teach better, the Emperor Mirrorsnow
displayed every single stance three times. The first time, he went
through every single movement extremely slowly. The second time, he
would display it without using any divine power or Immortal energy.
The third time, he would use it with true, full power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the
fifteenth stance, the Heartseal stance. Once the Heartseal forms,
eternity shall be gained.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This final memory
fragment was of Emperor Mirrorsnow executing sword-arts in a vast
region of primordial chaos. When his sword struck out, an utterly
titanic seal suddenly manifested which completely extinguished
everything in the primordial chaos in the area. One chaos star after
another was wiped out by the force of this strike. Ning was able to
count over a hundred million chaos stars that were shattered and
splintered by the force of this strike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was truly
speechless when he saw this. When Emperor Mirrorsnow had unleashed a
full-strength attack with this stance, just how wide an area had it
covered? His sword was so fast that it had surpassed the concept of
speed itself. In fact, it had surpassed even the very concept of
spacetime itself. Otherwise, how could it have wiped out that many
chaos stars? Even if his sword moved thousands of times faster than
the speed of light, how could it possibly fly out that far, that
fast?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And yet, it was an
undisputable fact that Emperor Mirrorsnow’s sword had wiped out
everything in an infinitely vast region, leaving nothing behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, the region
which Emperor Mirrorsnow had chosen to display this stance was a
region that was completely devoid of life. Otherwise, the number of
casualties that would’ve been caused would be incalculable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve completely
displayed the [Heartseal] sword-art for you. This was the sword-art I
trained in as I progressed, step by step, to gain eternity for
myself. It is extremely difficult to train in this sword-art, but it
can be separated into four different sets of sword-arts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Mirrorsnow
began to display a new set of sword-arts, and Ning instantly
understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These four separate
sword-arts could be described as the fisherman’s sword, the
assassin’s sword, the emperor’s sword, and the killer’s sword.
The fisherman, the assassin, and the emperor each used one of these
three sets of sword-arts, while the final challenger, the swordsman,
used a sword-art that could be considered the most basic, elementary
version of the [Heartseal] sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These four sets of
sword-arts each represent a separate path. Although they seem quite
ordinary, it won’t be hard for you to become a Daolord of the
Fourth Step through using one of these sword-arts. However, even if
you do reach that level, your accomplishments will be mediocre,”
Emperor Mirrorsnow said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now, these four
sword-arts can actually be separated into ninety-six sword-arts.”
Emperor Mirrorsnow once again began to carefully display and describe
every single sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why this
transmission had been such a painful and arduous one to accept was
primarily because each and every memory fragment contained scenes of
the Eternel Emperor personally displaying his sword-arts. A large
amount of stances were included, as were various types of
sword-intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Heartseal]
sword-art can be separated into four fairly average sword-arts, which
can then be separated into ninety-six low-class sword-arts. If you
have sufficiently high insights into the sword, it will be easy for
you to learn them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have finished
transmitting my sword-arts to you. Now, I shall transmit a divine
ability to you, an extremely powerful divine ability that will allow
your attacks to explode with power. You will be able to instantly
unleash a extreme level of power with it. This divine ability is
known as the [Five Seals Sword Dao]…” The transmission of a
divine ability was much simpler. It mainly included basic information
in how to train in that divine ability, and Ning was able to
instantly memorize it all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, right. I left
behind four golem servants. They shall follow you, my personal
disciple, and protect you. That way, I can guarantee you won’t die
too quickly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. I’ve taught
you everything I should teach, and I’ve said everything that needs
to be said. Train hard and make sure you don’t besmirch my mighty
name, dear disciple. If fate wills it, perhaps we shall truly meet in
the flesh one day.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The transmission came
to an end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Back within the
desolate wilderness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four retainers
continued to watch Ning. While Ning had been accepting the
transmission, he had been rippling with waves of power. This state
had persisted for two full days before he came to a halt and took a
rest. The main reason it had taken this long was because it truly was
difficult for Ning to completely absorb all of the information in the
memory fragments.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ning had personally
watched Emperor Mirrorsnow display his sword-arts, he wouldn’t have
been able to understand or memorize the truly profound parts.
However, Emperor Mirrorsnow had completely transmitted his memories
directly into Ning’s mind. Once the process was complete, Ning
would never forget those memories unless he personally wiped them
away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? Why hasn’t
Darknorth woken up yet?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. There are no
more ripples; the transmission should’ve concluded.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s probably
training.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four retainers
chatted amongst themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their guesses were
correct. Ning was indeed training. In the Forest of Sword Pagodas, he
had only been able to visualize and sense the sword-intents radiating
from the pagodas. There was obviously no way he could see or
visualize those ancient powers actually displaying their various
sword-arts, much less have their memories be directly infused into
his mind! The [Heartseal] sword-art was also an incredibly profound
sword-art, and one which could be broken down into multiple different
sword-arts. This made it extremely easy for Ning to train in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many of the questions
he had regarding the Dao of the Sword were wiped clean. He was
continuously gaining a deeper and deeper understanding as his
sword-arts dramatically improved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This explosively
effective training session persisted for more than half a month
before it finally came to an end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Ning opened
his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Having a master
versus not having one… it really is completely different.” Ning
glanced at the world around him in a jubilant mood. He knew that he
had just completely changed compared to a month ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now knew how he
should advance from the World level all the way to the Eternal
Emperor level. In the past, he knew nothing. Now, he knew.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder who is
stronger? My master Emperor Mirrorsnow, Violetjewel creator Emperor
Violetmount, or the creator of the [Nameless] sword-art,” Ning
mused. “Still… the Violetjewels are merely middle-grade Eternal
weapons. Once I become a Daolord of the First Step, I’ll probably
need to switch them out for something else. As for the [Nameless]
sword-art, I only have the first seven stances to them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood that in
the future, he would spend much of his time meditating on the
[Heartseal] sword-art and learning from it, infusing its mysteries
into his own Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I could gain the
complete [Nameless] sword-art legacy and the complete legacy of
Emperor Violetmount, then I would now have three complete legacies. I
could simultaneously absorb the teachings and mysteries of all three
legacies, then go learn from the Forest of Sword Pagodas. I’ll
definitely improve even more quickly then.” When this thought
flickered through Ning’s mind, he couldn’t help but grin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, was that
helpful to you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems you’ve
gained quite a bit from it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given how strong
Darknorth is already, he’ll soon be able to break through to become
a Daolord whenever he wishes.” The four retainers all spoke out
when Ning woke up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled and nodded.
“I indeed can break through to become a Daolord. However, that path
is not my path.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Unicorn’s Domain
had indeed been dramatically improved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Unicorn’s Domain
was a path akin to the fisherman’s path. Emperor Mirrorsnow’s
[Heartseal] sword-art could be divided into four sword-arts, one of
which was the [Fisherman’s Sword]. Ning’s highest level of
attainment in recent years was in the Unicorn’s Domain, which was
his Unicorn’s Domain had dramatically improved just half a month
after Ning had received the legacy. Ning could already sense that his
accomplishments in the Unicorn’s Domain were enough for him to use
it as his core foundation to rebuild his divine body and become a
Daolord of the First Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Samsara Daolords. Each
step they took resulted in their divine bodies being completely
reconstituted! If you took a single wrong step, you would cause your
body to crumble. You would die and your Dao would vanish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just as Emperor
Mirrorsnow said, although all four sword-arts which make up the
[Heartseal] sword-art can allow a person to become a Daolord of the
Fourth Step, they will result in mediocrity.” Ning secretly shook
his head. Just becoming a Daolord was not enough.

Chapter 12 – The Twelve Scrolls of the Sutra of Eternity
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The four of you.”
Ji Ning looked at the four surrounding him. “According to what my
master told me, you four shall follow me in the future, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The four
all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Might I ask how
strong the four of you are?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The four of us are
roughly comparable to peak-level Daolords of the Third Step. But of
course, the swordsman’s sword-arts are a bit better, making him
slightly more powerful,” the golden-robed emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but feel stunned. All four golems were comparable to peak Daolords of
the Third Step?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the legacy
which his master had left behind for him? The more masters like this,
the better!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Golems comparable to
Verge-level Daolords are too expensive. The Eternal Emperor did have
one such golem, but he ended up selling it to procure forty golems
comparable to peak Daolords of the Third Step for his personal
disciples like you,” the golden-robed emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alright, fine. Maybe he
had gone a bit too far in mentally praising his master. Still, Ning
did know that golems with the strength of Verge-level Daolords were
indeed quite expensive, and forging them was no easy task. After all,
true Verge-level Daolords not only had considerable Immortal energy
and divine power, they also had mighty magic treasures and high
insights into the Dao. To have a mere golem be a match for one of
them was extremely difficult. Daolord Allgod was an incredibly
skilled artificer, but even he had been only able to painstakingly
forge a single Verge-level golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sword Palace had
collected many golems over the course of countless years, but even it
had only acquire a total of nine Verge-level golems. Those golems
were the ones titled Swordone through Swordnine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the Daolord
Cloudworld had many golems within it, those were all fairly weak. The
strongest were probably just on par with the four standing right in
front of Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you are to follow
me, should I bind you all?” Ning asked. He was too weak right now;
there was no way for him to forcibly bind them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unacceptable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Per the Eternal
Emperor’s instructions, we can each only help you out a single time
prior to you defeating us in battle. Once you are able to defeat us,
we’ll permit you to bind us and be your eternal servants.” The
emperor, the swordsman, the fisherman, and the assassin all refused
in solemn fashion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was instantly
speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most likely, Emperor
Mirrorsnow was afraid that he would rely on the golems too much and
so had restricted him to using them a single time. He probably just
wanted to ensure that his disciples wouldn’t be killed while they
were weak if they were unlucky enough to be trapped in a dangerous
situation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just one time each.
Still, that’ll keep me alive in dangerous situations.” Ning was
in quite a good mood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The divine ability
my master taught me makes it so that someone with the body of a
half-step Daolord is able to match a full Daolord of the First Step.
Unfortunately, my azureflower mist energy ensures that I already am
comparable to a Daolord of the First Step, and it lasts for a very
long period of time.” Ning shook his head. This divine ability
really was somewhat useless to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he used it, his
divine power would probably run dry after a short battle. How could
it possibly last as long as the azureflower mist energy in battle?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The most valuable
part of the legacy were those memory fragments which Master
transmitted to me.” Ning couldn’t help but feel excited. Although
there had been legacies in the Astral Islands, those legacies
consisted of simple information which any cultivator could learn and
make use of. Those legacies within the Astral Islands would be
transmitted to countless cultivators over the course of aeons, and
they weren’t truly valuable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These memory fragments
of Emperor Mirrorsnow could only be transmitted a single time, and
their creation had involved the Eternal Emperor infusing his own
divine will into them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Brightshore
Kingdom. The imperial palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blazing beast stood
there in a region of empty stace, staring at the distant, towering
behemoth. Golden light began to radiate from the behemoth’s giant
eyes, and the light completely swallowed the blazing beast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within that barrier of
golden light, many mysteries and secrets were being transmitted to
the blazing beast in an endless stream.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“GRWAAAR!” The
blazing beast’s body trembled from the pain. Every so often, flames
would flicker and burst out in the area around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, the golden
light dissipated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hegemon.” The
blazing beast revealed a look of delight as he stared at the distant,
towering behemoth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After twelve
separate transmissions, you have completely memorized the twelve
scrolls of the [Sutra of Eternity]. Our race has very few members,
and those who are suitable for my legacies are even fewer. Long, long
ago, our race was forcibly enslaved by the Ancient cultivators. The
Ancients are on par with us in terms of innate gifts, but they have
many legacies. I was once fortunate enough to acquire a legacy left
behind by a senior of our race, a set of ten scrolls called the [Ten
Scrolls of Eternity]. It was thanks to that legacy that I was able to
train to my present level, and I perfected them and supplemented
them, transforming them into the [Twelve Scrolls of Eternity].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In this era, our
race is on an equal footing with the Ancients, precisely because of
the [Twelve Scrolls of Eternity]. These twelve scrolls include all
things with them. No matter what path you choose, it will be of
assistance to you, which is why I will transmit this legacy to every
single member of our race.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Child… as of right
now, I am the only member of our race who has broken through to
become an Eternal Emperor. I hope you will be the second one of our
race,” the towering behemoth concluded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Hegemon.” The
blazing beast was incomparably excited. In recent years, he had come
to learn much of the history of his race from the time he had spent
in the imperial palace. He naturally now felt a tremendous sense of
kinship and belonging! As for these [Twelve Scrolls of Eternity],
they included virtually all Daos. This caused him to feel even more
awe towards the almighty Hegemon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Choose an imperial
name for yourself,” the towering behemoth instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When I was born and
gained consciousness, I gave myself a name, ‘God of Sky and Fire’.
Let my name be Skyfire of the Brightshore Imperials,” the blazing
beast said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A look of amusement
appeared in the towering behemoth’s eyes. ‘God of Sky and Fire’?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The members of his race
were only born from the primordial chaos under certain, very unique
situations. They were incredibly few in number, and if it wasn’t
for the fact that the Hegemon went out of his way to hunt for them,
many would probably wander the primordial chaos for countless years
by themselves. Generally speaking, they would choose rather odd names
for themselves. ‘God of Sky and Fire’ was a fairly amusing one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spend some time
training in the [Twelve Scrolls of Eternity]. I will give you a
thousand years. A thousand years later, I’ll send you into an
alternate universe, which will be your first training grounds,” the
towering behemoth said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Hegemon.” The
blazing beast was very excited, and he knew he neded time to study
the [Twelve Scrolls of Eternity]. Actually, after he learnt this
precious technique he would continue to rise in power even as he
roamed the outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was how the
Brightshore Kingdom worked. After the most powerful World-level
cultivators were selected and recruited, they would receive endless
legacies and secret arts from the Twelve Palaces. The same was true
for the imperial clan. New entrants to the imperial clan would also
be forced to undergo certain tempering experiences, after which they
would be transmitted the [Twelve Scrolls of Eternity].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial palace.
There were thirteen royal thrones here hanging high in the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-haired,
six-horned old man dressed in snowy robes spoke out. “A thousand
years from now, I will select the four most powerful World-level
cultivators and have them accompany Skyfire Brightshore to the
alternate universe. It will be up to them to make the most out of
it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A thousand years?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So we have another
thousand years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that the twelve
golden-armored powers knew exactly how long they had, they began to
be filled with anticipation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on. More
and more of the cultivators who had been acknowledged by the pagodas
and who had been out adventuring within the Brightshore Kingdom began
to return, responding to the summons of the Twelve Palaces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Wildfire, I heard from Lord Woodflower that a
great opportunity awaits us?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. Everyone
acknowledged by the pagodas will have a chance at it. However, only
the four most powerful members of the Twelve Palaces will be granted
it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just four?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Palace of the
Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two youngsters were
striding within it. One was the red-haired Wildfire, whereas the
other was an icy-faced child who was wielding a shortspear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We don’t have much
time left, just nine hundred years,” Wildfire warned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I plan to spend the
next nine hundred years in the Forest of Sword Pagodas,” the icy
child said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m planning to do
the same. I’m going to spend my time in meditation.” Wildfire
agreed with this idea. The Forest of Sword Pagodas was the most
sacred place within the entire Sword Palace. It had many sword-arts
which had been personally left behind by the mighty Daolords from a
previous era. If you chose to learn from sword-arts that were similar
to your own, you would benefit greatly from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The icy child swept the
area with his gaze. He saw a distant thatched cottage, and within
that cottage sat the white-robed Ji NIng.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is that?” The
icy child asked curiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His name is
Darknorth. He’s a newly arrived junior apprentice-brother,”
Wildfire said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why is he using a
temporal acceleration treasure? Has he been acknowledged by the Sword
Pagodas as well? Is he also trying to seize every moment to train?”
The icy child asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” Wildfire
shook his head. “He’s new, and as soon as he came here he began
to use a temporal acceleration treasure. He’s probably trying to
finish something as fast as he can.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The icy child nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Normally, cultivators
wouldn’t go out of their way to use temporal acceleration
treasures, as they didn’t make much of a difference. The more one
trained, the more those moments of epiphany mattered. Only when there
was a pressing need would people use temporal acceleration treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our opponents shall
be all the World-level cultivators who were acknowledged by their
respective pagodas. Senior apprentice-brother Wildfire, you’ll be
one of my opponents as well.” The icy child looked at Wildfire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I won’t take it
easy on you.” Wildfire chuckled as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two didn’t care
about Ji Ning at all. Right now, all of the talented geniuses of the
Twelve Palaces who had been acknowledged by their pagodas were trying
to seize every moment to strengthen themselves as much as they could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, knew of
none of this. He was still completely absorbed in his cultivation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had the memories of
his master, Emperor Mirrorsnow, providing him with careful and
detailed guidance. He also had the opportunity to analyze the Eternal
Emperor’s sword-arts and compare them to the many sword-arts of the
Forest of Sword Pagodas. His level of insight was continuously rising
at a pace that was unspeakably faster than before he had acquired the
Eternal Emperor’s legacy. Ning enjoyed this process very much, and
was completely intoxicated by it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, in the blink of
an eye, more than eight hundred years passed with Ning consumed by
his quiet meditations.

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_13___The_Seventh_Stance"></A>
Chapter 13 – The Seventh Stance of [Nameless]
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Forest of Sword
Pagodas was filled with tens of thousands of towering Sword Pagodas
which stood silently erect. Numerous cultivators were scattered
throughout the Forest of Sword Pagodas, quietly training with no one
disturbing them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a thatched
cottage in the forest as well, and within the thatched cottage was a
white-robed youth. Streams of sword-ki surged in the area around him,
occasionally flicking out as sword-stances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, the youth
opened his eyes. A look of delight could be seen in his gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve finished
mastering the seventh stance of the [Heartseal] sword-art, the
‘Reincarnation’ stance.” Ning was in a superb mood. “My
master, Emperor Mirrorsnow, used the Reincarnation stance to break
through to become a Samsara Daolord, and now I myself have learned
this stance as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light began to
flood the area around Ning. Some of the sword-light was filled with
an aura of murder, some of it was fluctuating and unpredictable,
while the rest was dominating and savage. The different types of
sword-arts cycled through in a perfect manner, and no flaws could be
seen at all from any of the attacks. It truly was like the perfect
cycle of reincarnation itself, and when any enemies made even the
slightest of mistakes the Reincarnation stance would ensure that they
would be trapped and buried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor Mirrorsnow
was a dissolute, adventurous man, but his sword-arts were extremely
cautious and tight.” Ning sighed in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. Given my current
level of insight into sword-arts, I should be able to train in the
seventh stance of the [Nameless] sword-art.” Ning immediately began
to ponder the [Nameless] sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thanks to the Eternal
Emperor’s legacy, Ning was able to learn the [Heartseal] sword-art
incredibly fast! By comparison, training in the [Nameless] sword-art
was considerably more taxing… and Ning had the feeling that the
seventh stance of the [Nameless] sword-art was actually more
difficult than the seventh stance of the [Heartseal] sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The spacetime
acceleration cottage maintained a rate of a hundred times the normal
flow of time. Ning’s mastery of his sword-arts had already
skyrocketed, making the seventh stance of the [Nameless] sword-art
much easier to understand as he continuously meditated upon it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seventh stance of
the [Nameless] sword-art was named ‘Cosmic Heart’. It was far
more complicated than the Unicorn’s Domain, and it was even more
profound than the Reincarnation stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than thirty years
went by.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning opened
his eyes. A distant look was in his gaze, as though everyone around
him including the thatched cottage no longer existed. It was as
though he was surrounded by an absolutely pristine, illusory world…
and a single tear had appeared within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This single tear seemed
to be a tear of love… but it also appeared to be the very heart of
this world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning flicked out with
his fingernail as if he was stabbing forward with a sword, piercing
that tear with it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this moment, Ning’s
heartforce burst out and completely meshed together with his finger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A shocking aura of
sword-intent billowed out of the thatched cottage and into the
surrounding area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was completely
stunned and absorbed by the perfect beauty of this strike. He
couldn’t help but close his eyes and savor the marvelousness of
that sword-art. He had naturally, unconsciously infused his
sword-arts with his heartforce, but he didn’t force it as other
cultivators did. Rather, it had all happened in a very natural
manner. He hadn’t even intentionally tried to add heartforce into
the mix. He had purely wished to execute this sword-art to its full
potential. His subconscious mind merged his heartforce into it,
causing him to unleash an utterly mystical and utterly terrifying
strike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a loud sound
rang out from outside. The entire Forest of Sword Pagodas began to
tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Puzzled, Ning
opened his eyes to stare outside. The ground outside was trembling as
that enormous sound boomed from far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?
The Forest of Sword Pagodas is the most sacred place of the Sword
Palace. Who would dare cause trouble here?” Puzzled, Ning walked
out of his thatched cottage and stared off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What was that?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Was that…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dozens of cultivators
within the Forest of Sword Pagodas rose to their feet. Some were at
the World level, some were Daolords. In this moment, all of them
stared at the area from where the disturbance was coming. At a
distant part of the Forest of Sword Pagodas, the ground was booming
loudly as it began to split apart. The tip of a pagoda was slowly
emerging from underground and climbing higher and higher.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Sword Pagoda.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A new Sword Pagoda.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A new pagoda? We
just gained yet another pagoda? Who was just acknowledged by the
Sword Pagodas?” Everyone was excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all understood
what was going on. Only once you were acknowledged by the Sword
Pagodas would the Forest of Sword Pagodas give birth to a brand new
pagoda of your own. Countless eons had gone by, but only around
eighty thousand cultivators had ever been acknowledged by the Sword
Pagodas, and in this day and age only six World-level cultivators had
been been acknowledged. They were, of course, the six exalted
Swordlords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared in
astonishment as well. Although he had seen quite a few Sword Pagodas
in the past, this was his first time seeing a new one rising.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That distant, newborn
sword pagoda continued to rise upwards as the booming sounds rang out
unabated. The entire Forest of Sword Pagodas was shuddering! Finally,
the new Sword Pagoda came to a halt when it reached the same height
as the other Sword Pagodas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, countless
sword-shadows began to fly out from throughout the Forest of Sword
Pagodas. There had to be trillions of the things, and they all began
to bow down in a certain direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh?!” Ning was
rather flabbergasted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless
sword-shadows from throughout the Forest were all bowing down towards
Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of this had caused
a great commotion, attracting the attention of quite a few Daolords
and World-level cultivators of the Sword Palace, all of whom came
flying over. As a result, many of the cultivators of the Sword Palace
were able to personally bear witness as all of this happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Isn’t that junior
apprentice-brother Darknorth?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His name is
Darknorth?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, he’s a
newcomer. He joined us less than a thousand years ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s still just at
the World level, but he’s already received the acknowledgment of
the Sword Pagodas?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This stunning sight
caused many of the cultivators present to begin to quietly chat
amongst themselves. For a Daolord to be acknowledged by the Sword
Pagodas was one thing, but for a World-level cultivator? This was
extremely, extremely rare. The entire Sword Palace only had six
Swordlords. Now, Ji Ning had become the seventh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Darknorth, congratulations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
senior apprentice-brother Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Darknorth, congratulations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many cultivators came
over to offer their congratulations. In the Sword Palace, there was a
huge dividing line between those who were acknowledged by the Sword
Pagodas and those who were not! If you weren’t acknowledged by the
Sword Pagodas, you would always be viewed as slightly inferior, even
if you were a Daolord. As for those who were acknowledged? All of
them were venerated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning finally realized
what was happening. His sword-stance just now had been acknowledged
by the Forest of Sword Pagodas!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.” A deep
voice rumbled out in Ning’s mind. “That new Sword Pagoda belongs
to you. Only you are permitted to leave behind your sword-arts within
it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are…?” Ning
asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am the spirit of
the Sword Palace,” the deep voice said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood. Even
the Starseizing Manor had given birth to a manor-spirit such as the
giant yellow bear. It made sense that the Sword Palace had given
birth to a sentient spirit as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Brightshore
Kingdom’s imperial palace. The thirteen royal thrones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A trace of emotion
suddenly flickered through the face of the snowy-robed Hegemon. He
smiled slightly, then looked at the nearby Lord Woodflower.
“Woodflower, congratulations are in order for your Sword Palace.
You just gained a new Swordlord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, it seems as
though I was right about him.” Lord Woodflower laughed merrily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A new Swordlord? Did
yet another World-level cultivator of the Sword Palace receive the
acknowledgment of the pagodas? Who is it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other eleven
golden-armored powers were all quite surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Woodflower said in
a very smug manner, “It is Darknorth!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth? That kid
who sparred against Bertulu?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When he battled
against Bertulu, he specialized in defensive techniques and was quite
good in that regard. However, he was quite a ways off from being at
the level he would need to be to receive the acknowledgement of the
Sword Pagodas.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This rate of
improvement is crazy. Even if he was accelerating time to train a
thousand times faster than normal… it has been less than a million
years!” There had been many major powers who had witnessed Ning’s
battle against Bertulu. Even the Hegemon had gone to watch! Although
they had all been focusing on Bertulu, they naturally had also paid
some attention to Bertulu’s opponent, Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stronger one was,
the more difficult it would be to accelerate the rate of time for
one’s self. A thousand times the normal rate of time was already a
ridiculously fast pace… but Ning had entered the Sword Palace less
than a thousand years ago. That meant that even at a thousand times
the normal rate of time, he would’ve been training for less than a
million years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In reality, Ning had
only maintained a pace of a hundred times the normal rate of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I said long ago that
I had a good feeling about him. He truly is quite talented in
sword-arts.” Lord Woodflower said in a very smug manner, “My
Sword Palace has gained yet another Swordlord, which means we’ve
gained yet another chance to be the ones to go to the alternate
universe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, another
candidate has appeared.” The almighty Hegemon nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone acknowledged
by the ancient pagodas were qualified to take part in the trials.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s see what
sort of sword-arts he came up with to be acknowledged by those
ancient pagodas.” The almighty Hegemon waved his finger. There had
been sixty-six images in the air, and now a sixty-seventh image
joined them. This image displayed the scene of a white-robed Ji Ning
standing in front of a Sword Pagoda, staring at it curiosity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rewind.” The
almighty Hegemon smiled as he watched, and the other twelve
golden-armored figures watched closely as well. All of them were
curious as to what type of sword-art this World-level cultivator had
used to receive the acknowledgement of the Sword Pagodas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time began to reverse
at high speed until the image returned to the time when Ning had just
executed his sword-stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The image showed Ning
seated in the lotus position within his thatched cottage. Ning gently
flicked out a single finger in a seemingly simple manner, but the
strike was indescribably profound. Slash! The strike shot out into
the distant skies above him.

Chapter 14 – The Eternal Emperor Closest to the Hegemons
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrm?” The almighty
Hegemon sat amongst the thirteen thrones, and both his face and the
faces of the twelve golden-armored powers around him tightened. The
almighty Hegemon actually once more took control over the flows of
time to cause the earlier scene to replay once more. Ji Ning once
more flicked out his finger…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No mistaking it.
That’s the [Heartsword] sword-art.” The almighty Hegemon nodded
slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth actually
trains in the [Heartsword]?” Daolord Thousand Waves was somewhat
speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impressive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I thought he must’ve
created a new sword-stance that received the acknowledgement of the
pagodas. I didn’t expect that it was actually due to him executing
the [Heartsword].” The golden-armored major powers present were all
rather surprised. It must be understood that there was a difference
between using your own sword-arts and using someone else’s. A
self-created sword-art would generally be a bit more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ji Ning had
mastered the Reincarnation stance of the [Heartseal], he could’ve
chosen to develop a sword-stance of his own that would also be
acknowledged by the Sword Pagodas. However, he was in no rush to do
so. Instead, he had decided to meditate on the even more difficult
and profound [Nameless] sword-art. The seventh stance of the
[Nameless] sword-art had an extremely powerful sword-intent, and so
when Ning executed it his burst of sword-intent was acknowledged by
the pagodas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He has merely
learned the sword-arts of another.” The almighty Hegemon shook his
head slightly. “Only if he reaches this level through his own power
and own skills would he be considered a truly dazzling figure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-armored
powers all nodded. Long ago, a person had been able to use the
[Heartsword] to reach the apex of power and become an Eternal
Emperor, but that didn’t mean that Ji Ning would be able to walk
the same path. In addition, Ji Ning had only gained an elementary
understanding of this sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Woodflower.” The
almighty Hegemon looked at the nearby Lord Woodflower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hegemon.” Lord
Woodflower nodded respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go give that young
fellow a gentle reminder,” the almighty Hegemon instructed. “In
the future, when he finds his own Dao and his own path, he should
merge his heartforce and his sword-arts together and pour them both
into his Dao! But of course, that’s just a suggestion. His own path
will of course be up to him to choose.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Lord
Woodflower nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A distant look appeared
in the Hegemon’s eyes, and he murmured softly, “When Emperor
Heartsword suddenly descended upon the world, he challenged all three
of us Hegemons, then wandered off into parts unknown…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twelve
golden-armored figures all listened attentively.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Heartsword was
indeed a legendary figure. He was a legend who was roughly comparable
in power to the three mighty Hegemons! However, his rise to
prominence was just as sudden as his disappearance. Prior to him
becoming a Verge-level Daolord, he didn’t really have much of a
reputation. He was a very low-key figure, and it was said that he
lived the life of an ordinary commoner in a distant chaosworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, once he became
a Daolord of the Fourth Step, a feud resulted in him slaying more
than twenty Daolords in a row, and he even completely crushed and
wiped out a large enemy sect. This action had shocked the Endless
Territories, resulting in his rise to fame. Shortly afterwards, he
succeeded in his Daomerge and gained eternity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After gaining eternity,
he immediately went and challenged each of the other Eternal
Emperors. He won every single battle! However, he didn’t kill a
single one one of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After that, he
challenged the three ancient Hegemons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since the most
ancient of days, the three ancient Hegemons had stood at the very
apex of the Endless Territories. No one had ever been able to shake
their positions. No one knew what the results of those duels had
been. When asked, Emperor Heartsword simply said one thing: “I
lost.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, one of the
three ancient Hegemons, the one belonging to the Ancient cultivators,
had said something else: “His power is comparable to ours.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This phrase guaranteed
that Emperor Heartsword would become a legend! However, despite his
quick rise to prominence and the many waves he had caused, he
disappeared just as quickly. Despite that, most later cultivators
acclaimed him as being the Eternal Emperor who was closest to the
level of the three Hegemons, and his [Heartsword] style was venerated
by many. Alas, he had never transmitted his [Heartsword] sword-art to
any disciples. The only thing he did was leave behind a complete copy
of the [Heartsword] sword-art to the Dao Alliance before he
disappeared on his journey.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Heartsword] tome
became a precious treasure of the Dao Alliance. All the copies of
this tome circulating in the outside world were all fragmentary, with
only the tome in the possession of the Dao Alliance being genuine.
Other organizations such as the Brightshore Kingdom would never be
given access to a complete [Heartsword] manual, no matter what price
they offered to pay.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His sword-arts…
although he reached an extremely high level of proficiency in the Dao
of the Sword, some of the most freakishly talented Daolords, the ones
capable of slaying Eternal Emperors, were superior to him in that
regard.” The almighty Hegemon sighed. “His strength lay in the
fact that he was actually able to almost perfectly merge his power as
a Heartforce Cultivator and as a Fiendgod Body Refiner. That is why
he had such tremendous power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The twelve
golden-armored figures all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Logically speaking,
Heartforce Cultivation, Fiendgod Body Refining, and Ki Refining were
three completely separate paths that couldn’t merge together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Take Bertulu as an
example. In battle, he could use some illusions or use his heartworld
to pressure his foes. In short, he would use heartforce as a
supportive skill as he engaged in close combat!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Heartsword was
different. When he used his divine abilities and struck out with his
sword, he was able to unleash tremendous power. As for his
heartforce, he was able to use its illusions to affect reality
itself. Most importantly, he was somehow able to cause his heartforce
to naturally join together with his sword. This made it so that he
was able to perfectly meld his power as a Heartforce Cultivator and
as a Fiendgod Refiner, causing his power to skyrocket to a terrifying
level. This was why he was acclaimed by so many as the Eternal
Emperor who was closest to the three Hegemons in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sword Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
senior apprentice-brother Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Darknorth, now that you’ve been acknowledged by
the Sword Pagodas, you are the seventh Swordlord of our palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was in a superb
mood as he entertained his fellow disciples. Suddenly, he saw a
figure appear at the margins of the Forest of Sword Pagodas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Woodflower?” Ning immediately recognized him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Follow me,
Darknorth.” Lord Woodflower sent him a mental message.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, the Palace
Lord has summoned me. Pardon me.” Ning said a few words of farewell
to the cultivators nearby. They, too, had seen Lord Woodflower
appear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
Ning and Lord Woodflower were walking side by side through a
mountainous forest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, you have
received the acknowledgement of the Sword Pagodas and become a
Swordlord. Per our rules, you are permitted to go to Armaments Gorge
and choose a single treasure that doesn’t cost more than a million
cubes of chaos nectar,” Lord Woodflower said. “This is a special
rule the Sword Palace created for the benefit of our Swordlords. Only
Swordlords are given this benefit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes lit up.
No more than a million cubes? What an enormously generous offer!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It made sense.
Swordlords were capable of becoming Daolords at any time, and they
would be extraordinary Daolords once they made their breakthrough.
They were worth the cost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, right. Now that
you are a Swordlord, there is something I must tell you.” Lord
Woodflower smiled. “All of the World-level cultivators in the
Twelve Palaces who have been acknowledged by their respective pagodas
are preparing for a very special opportunity which has come before
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A special
opportunity?” Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. In the end,
only four World-level cultivators in the Twelve Palaces will be given
this special opportunity.” Lord Woodflower looked at Ning. “This
truly is a stroke of tremendous fortune for you. None of the Twelve
Palaces have access to this. In all the Endless Territories, most
likely only the exalted Hegemon is capable of bringing this
opportunity before you. If it wasn’t for the sake of a newcomer who
recently joined his clan, the almighty Hegemon definitely wouldn’t
give us this chance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Woodflower knew
very well that in the Hegemon’s heart, what mattered the most was
his imperial clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only for the sake of
his Brightshore Imperials was the almighty Hegemon was willing to
make use of this opportunity! The reason why he was giving the Twelve
Palaces four of the medallions was partially because they were
subordinates, but also for the sake of giving that young Imperial
four assistants! Although the chance to enter the Archaeus region of
the alternate universe was an incredible opportunity, it was also
extremely dangerous. Tremendous opportunity always came with
tremendous danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There should be many
in the Twelve Palaces who have been acknowledged by their pagodas.
Only four will have a chance?” NIng was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just four.” Lord
Woodflower sighed. “I’m worried that our Sword Palace won’t be
able to get so much as a single slot.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve just
recently been acknowledged and haven’t spent much time in our Sword
Palace, so it wouldn’t really matter if you fail. However, you
should still do your best. According to what the Hegemon said, the
strongest four shall be given this tremendous opportunity,” Lord
Woodflower said. Frankly speaking, he really didn’t have much faith
in Ning. Although Ning had been acknowledged by the Sword Pagodas, so
had the other six Swordlords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In roughly one
century, the almighty Hegemon will select the four strongest
candidates,” Lord Woodflower finished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A century?” Ning
nodded secretly. It seemed as though it was indeed time for him to
make some preparations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, right. Do you
know the name of the sword-art you used to gain acknowledgement from
the Sword Pagodas?” Lord Woodflower looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head. “I
do not. I obtained this sword-art by accident. Because I don’t know
what its true name was, I’ve been calling it the [Nameless]
sword-art this entire time. Do you know its true name, senior
apprentice-brother Woodflower?” Ning’s eyes became filled with an
eager blaze. When Ning had executed the seventh stance, the Cosmic
Heart stance, he had noticed that although it was harder to use than
Emperor Mirrorsnow’s Reincarnation stance, the two were actually on
the same level when it came to the profundity of their insights into
the Dao of the Sword. The tough part of the Cosmic Heart stance lay
in how ephemeral and unpredictable it was. One had to follow one’s
own heart, allowing one’s heartforce to perfectly merge into one’s
sword-stances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was quite talented
in heartforce. Although his heartforce wasn’t at a very strong
level, he was still able to execute the stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he had been more
skilled in heartforce, the power of this stance would’ve been much
greater. This would have been especially true if he had reached the
sixth stage of heartforce and established his own Heartworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a sword-art
which perfectly combines Heartforce Cultivation with the Dao of the
Sword.” After executing this stance, Ning immediately understood
what made this sword-art so valuable. He instantly grew eager to
learn more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I do indeed know its
name.” Lord Woodflower nodded. “This sword-art was created and
passed down by a powerful Eternal Emperor who was nearly as strong as
the Hegemon.”
</P>

Chapter 15 – Preparations
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was delighted
to hear this. Finally, he was going to learn about the history of the
[Nameless] sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Woodflower
continued, “This Eternal Emperor was known as Emperor Heartsword.
His rise to power was sudden, and for a brief period of time he was
the most dazzling, celebrated figure of the Endless Territories.
However, shortly after he revealed his brilliance he elected to
disappear as he adventured through parts unknown. He was so strong
that he was most likely the Eternal Emperor who was closest to the
three Hegemons in power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After mastering the
seventh stance of the [Nameless] sword-art, he realized that although
the sword-art itself was on the same level of profundity as Emperor
Mirrorsnow’s, Emperor Heartsword’s strength lay in the fact that
he was able to perfectly fuse his heartforce into his sword-arts. It
made the power of his sword-arts increase dramatically to a point
where he was unquestionably much more powerful than Emperor
Mirrorsnow had been. It made sense for him to be comparable to the
three almighty Hegemons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It wasn’t that
Emperor Mirrorsnow was weak. He had developed the Reincarnation
stance at the World level and used it to break through to become a
Daolord. If he had been at the Forest of Sword Pagodas, his
self-created Reincarnation stance would’ve been acknowledged by the
Sword Pagodas! Someone who relied on this sword-art as the base of
his breakthrough to Daolord would be able to immediately battle
ordinary Daolords of the Second Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, Bertulu
and Eastcult were even more freakishly talented. Once they broke
through, they would be able to match Daolords of the Third Step!
However, the harder one’s path was, the more difficult it would be
for one to become an Eternal Emperor! The more freakishly talented
you were, the harder it would be for you to become an Eternal
Emperor. This was why, despite the passage of countless years, there
were only three Hegemons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What were his
sword-arts named?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prior to
disappearing, he left behind a complete copy of his sword-arts with
the Dao Alliance. He named it the [Heartsword].” Lord Woodflower
continued, “Only the Dao Alliance has a complete copy of this
sword-art.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only the Dao
Alliance?” Ning was rather disappointed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, because this is
the one and only sword-art which allows Heartforce Cultivators to
completely merge their power with Fiendgod Body Refiners and Ki
Refiners and then gain eternity,” Lord Woodflower said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fiendgod Refiners would
be able to perfectly merge the heartforce into their sword-arts and
then enter close combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ki Refiners would be
able to perfectly merge the heartforce into their flying swords as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A sword-art which
can rival Hegemons, with only one complete copy… its only natural
that the Dao Alliance would never transmit it to outsiders. No matter
what price our Brightshore Kingdom offered to pay, they refused to
let us have a copy. Something like this sword-art isn’t something
which mere treasures can be used to trade for. A sword-art like that
is one of the fundamental pillars on which entire organizations
rest.” Lord Woodflower continued, “The outside world only has
incomplete, fragmentary records. How many stances do you have?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just seven,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Woodflower looked
rather disappointed. “The first seven stances were created by
Eternal Emperor Heartsword before he was a Daolord, and they are the
seven most commonly known stances. I was hoping that you might’ve
encountered something special. Oh, right. Have you gone to the
Ancient Library? The library holds a fragmentary record that includes
the first ten stances of the [Heartsword] manual.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ancient Library
has it?” Ning was instantly delighted. The Ancient Library simply
had far too many sword-arts within it, including tens of millions of
fragmentary sword-arts. Each one could only be read through the usage
of godsense. Even if you could fully review a thousand scrolls a day,
it would still take over a hundred years for you to go through
everything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Brightshore
Kingdom had to pay a hefty price in order to purchase these ten
stances, and we’re allowed to teach them to others,” Lord
Woodflower said. “You are a cultivator, after all. I’m sure
you’ll have some connections to the Dao Alliance and eventually be
able to gain entry into it. At that point in time, if you spent a bit
of chaos nectar you’ll be able to purchase the complete
[Heartsword] sutra.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He was a
member of Vastheaven Palace, which meant that he actually had quite a
deep connection to the Dao Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Make your
preparations. You have a hundred years, at which point the Twelve
Palaces will choose select just the four strongest World-level
experts for this opportunity.” Lord Woodflower smiled as he
delivered this message.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After parting with Lord
Woodflower, Ning immediately headed towards the Ancient Library. The
Ancient Library was filled with tens of millions of sword-arts. Ning
scanned the place with his godsense and was quickly able to discover
a jade slip that had the words ‘Heartsword Sutra’ atop it. In the
past, Ning didn’t realize what it was, but now he realized that
this [Heartsword] tome contained the ‘nameless’ sword-art he
trained in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It really is the
same.” As Ning picked up the jade slip and sent his godsense into
it, a large amount of information flooded into his memories. This
really did contain the first ten stances, as well as some
explanations regarding this sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The complete version of
this sword-art contained fifteen stances. The first seven stances had
been created by Emperor Heartsword prior to becoming a Daolord, and
he used the seventh stance to reach the Samsara Daolord level.
Afterwards, he used his fifteenth stance to become an Eternal
Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is even more
profound than I believed it to be.” After Ning viewed the ‘final’
three stances, he couldn’t help but sigh. Actually, anyone could
tell that they were the same technique. The very first stance of this
sword-art was named the Heartsword stance, after all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heartsword stance
had exceedingly high requirements with regard’s to one’s mind and
heart. The user had to make his mind one with both the sword and the
world around it, gaining absolute mastery over the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The various later
stances also had very high requirements with regards to both the
sword and the heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixth stance,
‘Unicorn’s Heart’, was even more profound and abstruse than the
Heartsword stance. One had to find that ephemeral feeling which was
so difficult to grasp.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seventh stance was
even better. The Cosmic Heart allowed for one to perfectly activate
and infuse one’s heartforce into the sword-art. When the sword
struck out, it was like a tear shed for a person you loved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His sword-arts
actually aren’t that profound, compared to the most supreme major
powers of the Dao of the Sword.” Ning had seen many things in the
Forest of Sword Pagodas, and his horizons had been correspondingly
expanded. “However, the mysteries of how he merged his heartforce
with his sword-arts are worthy of further exploration.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Twelve Palaces. The
Palace of Fire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have you heard? Just
today, a World God in the Sword Palace named Ji Ning was acknowledged
by the pagodas.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah? A World-level
cultivator was acknowledged? What a freak.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He would be the
seventh Swordlord of the Sword Palace, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the
black-armored Daolords who were on patrol were chatting with each
other. News spread throughout the Twelve Palaces quite quickly. It
must be understood that there were only around sixty World-level
cultivators who had been acknowledged by the ancient pagodas.
Generally speaking, only one such cultivator would appear every
trillion years. Anyone acknowledged by the pagodas was destined to be
a truly extraordinary Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a freak. I
can’t even get into the Fire Palace, but those freaks are actually
able to receive the acknowledgment of the ancient pagodas.” Some of
the World-level cultivators in front of the Fire Palace began to
discuss this matter as well, and many of them sighed with frustration
and envy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist, what
do you mean by ‘acknowledgment of the pagodas’?” A tall,
skinny, jade-haired youth spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me explain.
Joining the Twelve Palaces isn’t that impressive, as some of their
members aren’t even able to become Daolords! Even if your insights
into the Dao are so profound that you can become a Daolord whenever
you wish, you still aren’t that impressive! Only those who reach
truly incredible heights are acknowledged by the resonance of the
pagodas. From what I’ve heard, those World-level cultivators who
are acknowledged by the pagodas can not only break through whenever
they wish, once they do so they will immediately be comparable to
Daolords of the Second Step in power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? They are able
to break through whenever they wish, and will immediately be
comparable to Daolords of the Second Step?” Quite a few World-level
cultivators were stunned by this, and they all began to chat amongst
themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the Fire Palace
was a large group of cultivators who wished to take the trials to
join the Fire Palace, and two of them were individuals who Ning was
quite familiar with. One was Su Youji the Flamefairy while the other
was World God Pillsaint. They had tried many times in recent years
but were still unable to enter the Palace of Fire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master was
acknowledged by the ancient pagodas?” Su Youji was instantly
overjoyed to hear this. “Incredible. Master is simply incredible.”
All other thoughts flew out of Su Youji’s mind as she immediately
turned and ran towards the Fire Palace’s spacetime transfer array.
She was going to go back to the Sword Palace. Her master had achieved
such a great thing. How could she, his retainer, not be there to
congratulate him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that brother
Darknorth?” The chubby World God Pillsaint was stunned. “The
Sword Palace? It has to be the Darknorth that I know. He once told me
that he is going to join the Sword Palace. The Sword Palace doesn’t
have that many World-level cultivators in it. There’s no way
someone else will have the same Daoist title as him. Ugh, I’ve been
training for years but still am not able to enter the Fire Palace. I
might as well join brother Darknorth instead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Pillsaint
quickly made up his mind, then turned and began to hasten towards the
spacetime transfer array. Even assuming he didn’t wish to become Ji
Ning’s retainer, he still would’ve gone to congratulate Ning on
his success. Ning had shown him kindness, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A few hours
later Su Youji and World God Pillsaint, along with a few other
cultivators, rode the spacetime transfer array from the Fire Palace
to the Sword Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji rushed
straight into the Sword Palace. As Ji Ning’s retainer, she was
permitted to go straight into the Sword Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for World God
Pillsaint, he informed the black-armored Daolord who sought to bar
his path, “Senior, I wish to meet with Swordlord Darknorth. I am
his good friend.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He wishes to meet
Swordlord Darknorth?” Su Youji, who had rushed on ahead, couldn’t
help but turn back and glance at the chubby World God Pillsaint.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within an Immortal
estate located at the peak of a mountain. Ji Ning, Su Youji, and
Pillsaint were all seated facing each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youji, this
gentleman is the World God Pillsaint who I mentioned to you before.”
Ning laughed. “In the Astral Islands, he was my very first
competitor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Pillsaint
looked rather embarrassed. He hurriedly said, “I really didn’t
know my own limits. Thankfully, you showed mercy to me, Daoist
brother Darknorth. Otherwise, I’d be dead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled. “It
was a sign that destiny binds the two of us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, right. Bound
by destiny!” World God Pillsaint grinned at Ning. “Daoist brother
Darknorth, I have nowhere to go in the Brightshore Kingdom. I’ve
tried a few times to enter the Palace of Fire, but I’ve failed each
time. And so, I’m planning to give up and join you instead. Am I
lucky enough to be accepted?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Follow me?” Ning
was startled, but he then said with a laugh, “If you don’t mind
joining me, I’d naturally be willing to welcome you. Others would
beg for the chance to take such a master alchemist as a retainer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then it is settled!”
World God Pillsaint immediately and straightforwardly swore a
lifeblood oath. His oath was one of the fairly common retainer oaths
that were sworn in the Endless Territories. Generally speaking,
retainer oaths were fairly relaxed. Ning was able to break through to
become a Daolord whenever he wished, and would be an extraordinary
Daolord at that. Someone like him was definitely qualified to take on
World God Pillsaint as a retainer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pillsaint greets
you, Master.” World God Pillsaint bowed respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough, enough.
There’s no need for the two of you to go through these pointless
courtesies.” Ning smiled. The very first time he saw World God
Pillsaint, he had a good feeling about the man. Now, the
chubby-cheeked, rosy-faced youth who wore all his feelings on his
sleeve had become his retainer. Quite frankly, World-level
cultivators who were so genuine and guieleless were quite rare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew. I finally have
a backer now. Life in the Brightshore Kingdom really has pissed me
off lately.” World God Pillsaint let out a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flamefairy, we
didn’t know each other when we first met, but now we follow and
serve the same master.” World God Pillsaint glanced towards the
nearby Su Youji as he spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh huh.” The
Flamefairy nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can’t you be a bit
more talkative?” World God Pillsaint felt speechless. The
Flamefairy glanced at him and chuckled, but she didn’t say anything
else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he said,
“Right. There’s something I need you two to do for me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please instruct us,
Master.” World God Pillsaint and Su Youji both spoke out at the
same time. Su Youji felt rather excited. It was quite rare for Ning
to assign her any tasks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A great opportunity
is coming, and I have a small shot at getting it. I have to do
everything I can to prepare for it,” Ning said. “I’m planning
to sell a treasure known as the Bloodfire Cloudfruit. It’ll be up
to you to help me sell it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Bloodfire
Cloudfruit was the most valuable treasure he had on him.

Chapter 16 – Treasure Selling
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bloodfire
Cloudfruit?” Su Youji was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bloodfire
Cloudfruit!” World God Pillsaint’s eyes bulged out as he called
out in shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You know of it?”
Su Youji turned to look at World God Pillsaint.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Pillsaint
hurriedly nodded, too excited to act smug. “That’s one hell of a
treasure. It is a unique fruit which can only be formed under very
special conditions. It has marvelous properties, and cultivators who
walk the Dao of Fire all dream of possessing something like it. But
of course, it wouldn’t work for you. You Ki Refiners are too
physically weak; there’s no way your bodies could possibly
withstand the enormous amounts of energy the Bloodfire Cloudfruit
contains. Only Fiendgod Body Refiners are able to endure its energy,
which they can then use to forcibly convert their bodies into
fire-attribute bodies. By then, they would be able to easily take
control over Chaos fire and ride it to escape. Most likely, even
Daolords would not be able to catch up to them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s that
amazing?” Su Youji was rather shocked. Not even Daolords would be
able to catch up?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I sold it to
Armaments Gorge, I’d be able to sell it for a million cubes of
chaos nectar,” Ning said. “However, I’m hoping for a higher
price. That’s why I’d like for you to help me spread the news of
this treasure to the black-armored Daolords. They’ll definitely
discuss it amongst themselves and with many others. Soon, everyone in
the Twelve Palcaes will know, and I’m sure there will be some who
would be willing to pay a high price for the Bloodfire Cloudfruit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Selling for a high
price? Easy! Leave it ot me.” Pillsaint was quite confident.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just spread the news
as widely as you can. Even if a Daolord wishes to speak to me
personally, just have them give you the bid,” Ning said. “A
hundred years from now, I will leave the Forest of Sword Pagodas and
choose the highest bidder, giving the Bloodfire Cloudfruit to him or
her.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pillsaint and Su Youji
were both a bit excited. Although this was a simple task, it was
still a task that involved a million cubes of chaos nectar. They
couldn’t help but be filled with enthusiasm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. I’m
heading to the Forest of Sword Pagodas.” Ning rose to his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Am I now allowed to
enter and exit the Sword Palace freely?” Pillsaint was a bit
worried about this. Just now, Ning had personally guided him through
the palace, which was why the Sword Palace’s defenses had not
automatically attacked him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. The
spirit of the Sword Palace was able to see you becoming my retainer,”
Ning said. The rules of the Sword Palace were that each formal
disciple was permitted to grant two retainers free entry to and from
the Sword Palace. Su Youji and Pillsaint were now both able to enter
and leave freely, but Ning wouldn’t be able to grant this
permission to a third retainer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning transformed into a
streak of light and flew out the gates of Immortal estate and towards
the Forest of Sword Pagodas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pillsaint and Su Youji
watched as Ning left. Both of them felt a sense of pressure. Although
this was a simple task, it still involved a great deal of wealth!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As his new retainer,
I need to make sure I handle this well,” Pillsaint mused silently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve never been
able to help out Master much. I can’t let him down.” Su Youji
felt the same sense of pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Forest of Sword
Pagodas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning set out his
temporal acceleration cottage, then sat down in the lotus position
and began to cultivate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope I’ll be
able to garner a high price for it. I don’t really have many
valuable treasures on me right now,” Ning mused. Although he did
have a few Eternal weapons, there was nothing special about them. The
only other item he owned which was worth over a hundred thousand
cubes of chaos nectar was the spare Mirrorsnow Painting. When Ning
left the Astral Islands and headed towards the Sword Palace, he had
acquired a spare from the underwater creatures. However, Ning was in
no rush to sell if. If he really did need money, he could sell it
then. If he waited for a good opportunity, he might be able to sell
it for a better price.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, the truth was
that Ning really didn’t have many items he could sell for a high
price.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Bloodfire
Cloudfruit…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Twelve Palaces
actually weren’t the best place to sell it, because almost all of
its major powers were wandering the outside world. The Sword Palace
theoretically had over a hundred Daolords, not including the
black-armored ones, but almost all of them were out adventuring. Only
ten or so were here at the Sword Palace. This was simply how the
Twelve Palaces worked. As a result, there would be less competition
resulting in lower prices for Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If this was one of the
places where many major powers of the Dao Alliance congregated, the
price would probably be much better.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas, by the time Ning
reached such a place he would probably have already become a Daolord.
By then, even if he did sell the Bloodfire Cloudfruit for a high
price it wouldn’t be of much use to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pillsaint and Su Youji
spread the word, causing the news that Swordlord Darknorth of the
Sword Palace wished to sell a Bloodfire Cloudfruit to spread
throughout the Twelve Palaces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bloodfire
Cloudfruit?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The people most excited
to hear this naturally all belonged to the World-level cultivators
and Daolords of the Palace of Fire, although virtually all of the
World-level cultivators could do nothing more dream about it. These
individuals all walked the Dao of Fire. If they had fire-attribute
bodies, they would be able to cultivate much more quickly. They were
thus the most suitable candidates for purchasing this item.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bloodfire
Cloudfruit?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Saber Palace,
Heartforce Palace, Sword Palace, Spacetime Palace, and other palaces
also held Daolords and World-level cultivators who were interested.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, for example, was
a member of the Sword Palace who had a body that was
lightning-attribute in nature.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, those
who walked the Dao of Water or the Dao of Metal would never procure
fire-attribute bodies. That would make it twice as hard to cultivate,
with half the effect. The fire-attribute body would disrupt their
affinity to those Daos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That kid, Swordlord
Darknorth, plans to sell it off within a hundred years? He’s
probably doing this to prepare for the upcoming opportunity. Heh heh…
fellow Daoists, there’s no need for us to bid up the price too
much. He’s definitely going to sell it no matter what. Let’s keep
the price low.” Instantly, some Daolords came up with this idea.
There were some Daolords in the Twelve Palaces who walked the path of
evil. In fact, some had committed tremendous sins and atrocities.
Although the lifeblood oath prevented them from acting against Ning,
they were still able to do something like lowball him for his
treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The highest bid
stands at 1.3 million cubes!” Pillsaint made this claim within an
Immortal estate within the Sword Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” The old man
frowned, his entire body emanating an aura of explosive, ruinous
energy. “Who made such a high bid?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t reveal
that,” Pillsaint said placidly. “If your bid isn’t any higher
than this, there’s no point in even bidding.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You punk.” The old
man was irritated. He turned away and departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pillsaint.” Su
Youji watched the old man walk away, then sent Pillsaint a stealthy
mental message. “You lied to him. What if no one ends up bidding a
higher price? We’ll be in trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry.”
Pillsaint was quite confident.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pillsaint and Su Youji
had both noticed that the Daolords were in no rush to place any bids.
Ning had given a limit of a hundred years, after all; they didn’t
want to get the price too high, too early. In fact, some of the
Daolords were colluding in secret to keep the price low.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Half a year later, the
old man returned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m willing to bid
1.31 million cubes,” the old man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The highest price is
now 1.33 million cubes,” Pillsaint said, his eyes wide and
innocent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?!” The old man
was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pillsaint continued to
raise the price. 1.33 million cubes, 1.35 million cubes, 1.36 million
cubes, 1.37 million cubes… every half a year or year, the price
would rise slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Faced with the
continuously rising price, some of the Daolords that were colluding
began to grow a bit impatient.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who the hell keeps
upping their bids?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why are the bids
continuing to rise?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were able to keep
calm when the price was steady, but this constant rise made some of
them a bit impatient.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pillsaint secretly felt
quite smug about this. “You have no idea who you are dealing with.
I’m a grandmaster alchemist! I’m not just skilled in making
pills, I’m also an expert in selling them.” There was a certain
art to selling pills and treasures as well, and there was always a
bit of artifice built into the prices. Many of the ‘bids’ for the
fruit were false, but Pillsaint did manage to lure in a few real bids
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hundred years passed
in the blink of an eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The highest price is
now 1.46 million cubes! This is the final year,” Pillsaint
declared. “My master will return from the Forest of Sword Pagodas
anytime now. When he does return, the auction will come to an end.
The highest bidder will win the Bloodfire Cloudfruit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? The auction
will end as soon as his master leaves the Forest?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the final
year. Swordlord Darknorth might return at any moment.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the most patient
of Daolords were no longer able to hold on. Once Ji Ning returned,
they would have missed this opportunity for good. They didn’t
believe that Pillsaint was lying, because no one would dare lie to so
many Daolords at the closing time of an auction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m willing to
offer 1.47 million cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll offer 1.48
million.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“1.5 million.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the final year, the
bids increased very rapidly. Some of the Daolords had truly grown
impatient. Once they gained this treasure, more than 99% of the other
Daolords would be unable to catch up to them in speed. Generally
speaking, not even Verge-level Daolords would be able to fly as
quickly as Chaos fire or Chaos lightning! Only those who had
techniques allowing them to control Chaos fire or Chaos lightning
would the exceptions. Once this opportunity went past, who knew how
long it would be before the next opportunity? Even if another
opportunity did arise, it was entirely possible that they wouldn’t
even have a chance to bid on it. The Endless Territories were simply
too vast; by the time they heard the news, the thing probably
would’ve been sold already.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pillsaint went so far
as to run over to the Forest of Sword Pagodas to send Ning a secret
message. “Master, don’t be in a rush to return. Give me another
half year. Come back then.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
trusted them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the Daolords
truly did need this treasure, and time was running out. Once this
sort of naturally-occurring treasure was gone, it would be eons
before anothing one appeared. The bidding process became noticeably
fiercer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning finally emerged
from the Forest of Sword Pagodas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How did it go?”
Ning descended from the skies into the Immortal estate where Su Youji
and Pillsaint were located.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“1.8 million cubes,”
Pillsaint said proudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning was
quite surprised. If he sold it to a major organization, the price
would’ve been roughly a million cubes. If he was lucky and many
Daolords desperately bid against each other, the price could be
several times higher. However, there weren’t many Daolords in the
Twelve Palaces right now. To be able to sell it for 1.8 million cubes
already vastly exceeded Ning’s expectations. He had thought that a
price of 1.5 million cubes would already be quite high.

Chapter 17 – A Thousand Years
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial palace of
the Brightshore Kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The almighty Hegemon
stared at the sixty-seven images hovering in the air next to the
thirteen thrones. He said softly, “A thousand years has concluded.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twelve
golden-armored powers who had been chatting idly, meditating with
eyes closed, or silently drinking wine all came alert.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hegemon, how shall
you choose the most powerful ones?” The twelve golden-armored
powers all looked at the almighty Hegemon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These World-level
cultivators who had been acknowledged by the ancient pagodas were all
incredible figures who possessed varied skills. What was the fairest
way to choose the ‘best’ four?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The almighty Hegemon
gently stroked his snow-white beard, then smiled. “Let them
challenge the Daolord Cloudworld. They will have three days! The four
who make it the farthest in the Daolord Cloudworld shall gain this
opportunity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Challenge the
Daolord Cloudworld?” The twelve instantly understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was seated in
the lotus position within his spacetime acceleration cottage, still
located in the ancient Forest of Sword Pagodas within the Sword
Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, come to
me right away.” A voice rang out in Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning opened
his eyes. Dim flickers of sharp light could be seen within them. “A
thousand years has concluded. It seems it is time for the actual
challenge.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword-arts
were now far more formidable than when he had first developed the
Reincarnation stance or the Cosmic Heart stance. His sword-arts were
actually still continuing to improve, and he hadn’t encountered any
bottlenecks yet. Alas, he simply didn’t have enough time! The
almighty Hegemon had only given him a thousand years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning put away
his spacetime acceleration treasure, then flew out of the Forest of
Sword Pagodas and towards Lord Woodflower’s palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Woodflower was
seated in the lotus position atop a golden-red prayer mat. In front
of him were seven similarly seated cultivators. There was one who
looked like a child, one who looked like a youngster, one who looked
like a youth, and even an old man. They all had completely different
auras of the Sword Dao. A cultivator’s age or mentality couldn’t
be judged by their appearances. At this level, there were some
cultivators who reached an elderly age before suddenly shining with
brilliance and embarking upon the path of cultivation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A thousand years has
concluded.” Lord Woodflower swept Ning and the others with his
gaze. “The seven of you are the only ones within our Sword Palace
have been acknowledged by our ancient pagodas. Right now, in the
Twelve Palaces there are a total of sixty-seven individuals on your
level, yourselves included. All of you will be fighting for this
opportunity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sixty-seven
challengers, only four spots.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The almighty Hegemon
has already sent word for you to go and challenge the Daolord
Cloudworld. You must complete your attempt within three days, and the
final four who make it farthest into the Cloudworld shall be the ones
to win this opportunity,” Lord Woodflower said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Swordlord
Wildfire, Swordlord Graceless, and the others all became more alert.
They were all going to do their absolute best, and indeed training in
the Dao of the Sword itself was training in a path of no return.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the Twelve
Palaces, the World-level cultivators of the Saber Palace are the
strongest, while the Heartforce Palace and the Spacetime Palace also
have immeasurably deep roots.” Lord Woodflower’s gaze fell upon
the seven Swordlords once more. “I hope that our Sword Palace can
gain at least one of the slots. It would be a damn shame if we gained
nothing at all from this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
and the others were all very solemn. They weren’t angered or
offended by Lord Woodflower’s words. Given their achievements, all
of them were extraordinary figures who knew the importance of
respecting their opponents. The other competitors had all been
acknowledged by the ancient pagodas as well. Some were special
lifeforms, and some had experienced tremendous strokes of karmic
luck. None could be belittled or underestimated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can only do my
best.” Ning’s heart was firm with the resolve to do battle and
test himself against these other acknowledged World-level opponents.
Although the battle hadn’t started yet, Ning was already beginning
to feel excitement and energy coursing through his veins.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Palace Lord Dawnstar
is the undisputed most powerful Daolord of the Twelve Palaces. Even
if we factor in all the other organizations of the Endless
Territories, he would be ranked the second most powerful Daolord. He
personally tutored all of you for many years. If only one of you
gains a slot, even I will feel ashamed on your behalf.” Daolord
Yinwind’s voice was filled with icy arrogance. This was his
natural, innate disposition.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he was a young
mortal, he had been kidnapped and dragged into an incredibly powerful
but evil sect, filled with all sorts of viledoers and evil men. But
of course, this was something that happened long ago, and by now a
simple breath from him would be enough to wipe out that evil sect. He
was now a Deputy Palace Lord of the Saber Palace, and his name and
reputation held tremendous influence within the Endless Territories.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry, Lord
Yinwind.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forget two, let’s
try for all four!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Saberlords of the
Saber Palace were brimming with confidence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixty-seven waiting
World-level challengers all received word from their respective
elders. Some headed for the Daolord Cloudworld immediately, while
some calmed themselves and planned on making the challenge on the
final day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The trials of the
Daolord Cloudworld could actually be completed quite quickly.
Generally speaking, half a day was enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heartforce Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Palace of the Heart
was extremely quiet. There were pitifully few cultivators at either
the World level or the Daolord level, and only one of them had been
acknowledged by the Heart Pagodas: Heartlord Solewind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m the only one
taking part in the Heart Palace. How lonely.” A bald, red-vested
youth whose face was covered with strange, crimson divine tattoos
smiled as he murmured to himself, “Little sister, just watch and
see how your big brother takes on the Daolord Cloudworld.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He strolled forward in
a relaxed manner, and with each step he took a fiery divine crow
would manifest beneath his feet. The line between reality and
illusions was blurred around him. Clearly, he was training even when
he was just walking. He was an incredibly famous figure in the Twelve
Palaces, not because he had accomplished any special feats, simply
because he was a member of the Palace of the Heart! Although the
Heart Palace had pitifully few members, every single member was
frighteningly strong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bertulu focused on the
Dao of Light, using heartforce as a support skill. Heartlord
Solewind, however, had truly focused all of his efforts on his skills
as a Heartforce Cultivator. His accomplishments in this area vastly
outstripped Bertulu’s, who had only reached the utter apex of power
at the World level in the Dao of Light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The almighty Hegemon
personally gave me pointers in the past. As for this opportunity he
is offering… I, Greatjoy, shall definitely grasp it.” This was a
youth who was dressed in strange black imperial robes and who wore a
crown on his head. He was the most powerful World-level expert in the
Palace of Spacetime, and he referred to himself as Prince Greatjoy.
Although on the surface he was rather calm and stately when
interacting with others, he was actually an extremely wild, berserk
man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Daolord
Cloudworld, eh? Hmph.” Prince Greatjoy flew out of the Spacetime
Palace and headed straight towards the Daolord Cloudworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than half of the
World-level experts immediately flew towards their Daolord Cloudworld
as soon as they received the news. Every single one of the Twelve
Palaces had their own Daolord Cloudworld, and the difficulty level in
each was identical.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning descended into the
Armaments Gorge of the Sword Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.” The
two guardians of the gorge, Swordfive and Swordsix, both looked at
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swordfive.
Swordsix.” Ning said in a rather humble manner, “I’ve been
acknowledged by the Sword Pagodas. I believe I now have the chance to
choose a single treasure from the Armaments Gorge, so long as it
doesn’t cost more than a million cubes of chaos nectar. Right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Swordfive
nodded. “The Sword Palace has always been very generous towards
World-level cultivators who are acknowledged by the Sword Pagodas.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swordfive, can you
follow me inside?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can.” Swordfive
nodded. He surmised that Ning probably wanted to carry out a major
business transaction. There was no other reason for Ning to ask him
to go in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Armaments Gorge was
filled with countless treasures, but Ning went straight towards one
of the corners in the far back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a seemingly
ordinary black bottle placed atop one of the tables in the back. This
black bottle, however, was priced at 1.5 million cubes of chaos
nectar! This bottle was a magic treasure known as the ‘Godwater
Flagon of the Seven Flags’, and it contained seven different types
of Dao water. These seven types of Dao water could be used to form an
enormous formation known as the Seven Flags Formation which could
easily annihilate almost any opponent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can I take this
flagon?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swordfive slowly shook
his head. “You aren’t permitted to choose anything worth more
than a million cubes. If you insist on choosing this item, you have
to pay an extra five hundred thousand cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Done.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were quite a few
treasures in the Armaments Gorge which involved Dao water, and most
of them were treasures which were forged out of Dao water. The
Godwater Flagon of the Seven Flags was the most suitable choice for
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Need anything else?”
Swordfive had heard that Ning had sold off a Bloodfire Cloudfruit for
1.8 million cubes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need some Dao
lightning as well.” Ning grinned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning departed from the
Armaments Gorge, then transformed into a streak of light that flew
back towards his own Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Su Youji
and World God Pillsaint both came out to greet him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No one is allowed to
disturb me. No matter who comes, they are not permitted to see me.”
Ning gave them some instructions, then went into his private room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat down in the
lotus position within this private room, then placed a black bottle,
an azure cauldron, and a grey gourd next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time, he had
purchased seven types of Dao water and five types of Dao lightning.
He had paid 2.1 million cubes of chaos nectar for them! Factoring in
the million cubes of credit which the Sword Palace had bestowed upon
him, he actually had used up more than three million cubes!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With these items, I
should now be able to make myself much more powerful.” Ning was
quite calm as he summoned the technique for creating the [Novessence
Thunder] and the [Novessence Water] into his mind.

Chapter 18 – Training
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning willed the
ethereal lightning to fly out of the gray gourd. It seemed
unremarkable, but in reality it was terrifyingly powerful. Under
Ning’s control, it swirled around Ning’s body and then seeped
into it. For someone with a weaker divine body, such an act was akin
to suicide. It must be understood that this was Dao lightning!
Someone with a weak body would have it instantly reduced to ashes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Long ago, when Ning was
still an Empyrean God, his body was incapable of enduring the power
of the Ninehorn Lightning Serpents. In order to tame and control one
of them, Ning had to first use Elder-level lightning serpents to
repeatedly enter his body and completely transform it into a
lightning-attribute body. Ning died multiple times before being able
to successfully complete the transformation process. Only then was he
able to survive alongside the Ninehorn Lightning Serpent and draw it
into his body, storing it in the divine rune of a lightning serpent
egg.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And now?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had completely
mastered the [Golden Idol], making his divine body comparable to
top-grade Dao treasures! This Dao lightning was completely incapable
of harming Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the ethereal
lightning entered Ning’s body, it seemed to be affected by a
powerful gravitational force. With a swoosh, it was drawn towards
Ning’s Jindan chaosworld, towards the location where one of nine
lightning essences was located. This lightning essence was similarly
ethereal, and the two seemed to have come from the same source. The
Dao lightning voluntarily merged into the lightning essence, rapidly
surging into it and drawing upon the Chaos lightning energy which had
previously been present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve finished
absorbing the first Dao lightning.” Ning nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why Daolord
Allgod had separated the [Novessence Thunder] into the upper part and
the lower part, despite the fact that he created the technique as a
Daolord who didn’t need Chaos lightning, was because he needed to
establish the nine lightning essence foundations. The lightning
foundations were similar to the ‘lightning serpent egg’ which
Ning once used to store and transform the Ninehorn Lightning Serpent.
The lightning foundations were the places where the lightning would
stay and ‘live’. This was their home!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lightning
foundations which Daolord Allgod had created were countless times
more profound than the ‘lightning serpent egg’. They were
tremendously attractive towards Dao lightning, and Dao lightning
naturally ‘liked’ to live within them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Next.” Ning willed
the next one to enter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Four streams of Dao
lightning instantly began to surge out from the four handles on the
azure cauldron in front of Ning. Under Ning’s control, the four
streams of lightning surged into his body. These four streams of Dao
lightning were similarly drawn into four different lightning essence
foundations and were quickly swallowed up. They now had their own
foundations where they belonged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And the Elementum
Waterflame Gourd.” Finally, Ning produced the gourd which he had
been using for quite some time. He used the exact same technique to
draw those two streams of Dao lightning into the foundations inside
his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were a total of
nine lightning essence foundations! These nine foundations were meant
to hold nine streaks of Dao lightning or nine streaks of Chaos
lightning which belonged to the same ‘type’. Right now, Ning had
seven of those streaks of Dao lightning! These seven Dao lightnings
were the seven cheapest ones he could find, but they had still cost
Ning a total of 2.1 million cubes of chaos nectar! As for the seven
types of Dao water, they had cost Ning a total of 1.5 million cubes
of chaos nectar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao lightning was
more powerful and thus preferred by cultivators, resulting in a
slightly higher price than the Dao water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had purchased nine
types of Chaos water shortly after arriving at the Sword Palace. As a
result, his body already had nine types of water essence foundations
within it, and he used them to absorb those streams of Dao water,
completely drawing them inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The transfer is
complete.” Ning was a bit excited. “I wonder if I’ll be able to
start training in the lower part now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To actually absorb the
Dao lightning didn’t really signify anything, as Ning could control
them regardless of whether they were inside his body or inside a
magic treasure! In this sense, the location didn’t matter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to the
notes regarding the lower part of the [Novessence Thunder], only a
Samsara Daolord can train in the technique because Dao lightning is
thousands of times more explosive and unruly than Chaos lightning.
The Immortal energy of World-level cultivators simply cannot cope
with it, preventing them from training in this technique.” Ning’s
eyes were shining. When he had first started on the [Novessence
Thunder] using Chaos lightning, he had failed numerous types in his
attempts to master it. In the end, he had to rely on his azureflower
mist energy to succeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Using the azureflower
mist energy to control the Chaos lightning had been hundreds of times
easier than using his own Immortal energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The reason why only
Daolords can train in the lower part is because the Immortal energy
of World-level cultivators is too weak. However, I can use the
azureflower mist energy instead. That energy should be comparable to
the energy of a Daolord of the First Step’s. According to the
manual, a Daolord of the First Step has a chance to complete the
second stage of the technique. In fact, he even has a shot at the
third stage!” Ning felt quite eager.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second stage
referred to the secret art needed to completely merge two of the
streaks of Dao lightning together. This would instantly cause the
power of the Dao lightning to skyrocket!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon reaching the
second stage, those two streaks of Dao lightning would probably be
even more powerful than seven streaks of Dao lightning and seven
streams of Dao water combined! Right now, Ning was relying on
superior numbers in order to achieve victory. And yet, all his Dao
lightning and Dao water combined was merely on par with the second
stage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I can master at
least the second stage for the Dao lightning, then do the same for
the Dao water, then use them along with the rest of my lightning and
water… the power should be quite extraordinary.” Ning was filled
with eagerness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to begin.”
Using the azureflower mist energy to reinforce his physical strength
in battle was the most basic way of using it. Using it to train in
secret arts? That was far more impressive! This was a form of energy
comparable to a Daolord’s energy, after all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azureflower mist
energy spread out in accordance with the [Novessence Thunder],
streatching out like an invisible hand that quickly latched onto the
Watersmoke Lightning and the Firecloud Lightning. These were the two
types of Dao lightning that were the easiest to control.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha… I’m
completely able to control them! My suspicions were correct! My
azureflower mist energy can be used to control Dao lightning as if it
was Daolord energy.” Ning began to grow excited. This meant that he
would be able to realize his ambitions! The two streaks of Dao
lightning were innately explosive, but the power of the azureflower
mist energy was still able to control them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They followed Ning’s
will and began to transform nonstop as the secret art began to take
shape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the later
parts of this process grew increasingly complicated. The [Novessence
Thunder] and the [Novessence Water] techniques were techniques that
were akin to applying alchemy and pill-forging principles to
lightning and water. The lightning would be constantly adjusted and
harmonized, causing its power to eventually be completely transformed
in nature! Pill-makers needed to have complete control over their
pills, and Ning needed to have similarly exquisite control over his
lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The process grew more
and more difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had been just the
slightest slip-up, but the entire secret art broke apart and the two
streaks of Dao lightning instantly split apart, each returning to its
own lightning essence foundation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My azureflower mist
energy is clearly far more powerful than the Immortal energy of a
World-level cultivator. I trust that it is no weaker than a
Daolord’s, and my soul is also comparable to a Daolord’s soul. I
refuse to believe I can’t do this!” Ning tried again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thrice…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning tried twenty times
in a row, only to fail each time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me try the Dao
water. Maybe I’ll be able to succeed with the Dao water.” Ning
once more gave it a try, this time using the Dao water. It was
clearly much easier to control Dao water than Dao lightning, as water
was less explosive and wild, but as the process went on it failed
once more at the very end. Multiple, repeated failures resulted in
Ning giving up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why do I keep
failing?” Ning carefully went through his memories regarding these
two techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These two techniques…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Novessence
Thunder] and the [Novessence Water] were created based on Daolord
Allgod’s insights into the process of alchemy and artificing. The
process allowed him to take exquisite control over lightning and
water, using them to form tremendously powerful secret arts. After
one became a Daolord of the Fourth Step, it would be possible for one
to master the ninth stage and complete the process. Daolords of the
First Step generally could master the second stage, and they even had
a chance at mastering the third stage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why can’t I even
master the second stage? Controlling them feels incredibly taxing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly stared
blankly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand!
Daolord Allgod was a Verge-level Daolord when he mastered the ninth
stage for the lightning and water… but who was he? He was a master
of alchemy and artificing, a true grandmaster of countless Daos. He
was incredibly skilled in this respect! I, however, know nothing
about alchemy or artificing whatsoever. I’m completely relying on
the strength of the azureflower mist energy to brute-force the
lightning and water into cooperating. It only makes sense that this
sort of brute-force method will result in repeated failures.” Ning
finally understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alchemy and artificing
were not simple tasks. They were arts that required tremendous levels
of skill and expertise. World God Pillsaint was an incredibly skilled
grandmaster in alchemy, but how many other World-level cultivators
were similarly talented in this regard? Alchemy truly was an art
filled with countless mysteries, but Ning knew nothing of it at all.
All he could do was rely on his azureflower mist energy to
brute-force things…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh…” Ning shook
his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he could master the
second stage for the lightning and the water, then when he used them
as well as his other types of Dao lightning and Dao water in a
formation to attack an opponent, he would probably be able to slay an
ordinary Daolord of the First Step in one blow! Even if that person
didn’t die, he would be heavily injured. A few successive blows
would ensure that the Daolord would definitely perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was why the
azureflower mist energy was so incredible and special. It gave
World-level cultivators a chance to master techniques they simply
shouldn’t be able to… but alas, Ning didn’t understand enough
about alchemy or artificing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too late to start
training in these areas now. There’s no time. I have to try out the
Daolord Cloudworld soon,” Ning mused. “But I just so happen to
have an expert alchemist by my side. After the challenge is
completed, I’ll ask Pillsaint for some advice! If I learn some
basic alchemy skills, I’ll probably be able to rely on the
experience I gained to make some progress in mastering the second
stage of these two techniques.”

Chapter 19 – Challenging the Daolord Cloudworld
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning tested out
using the seven types of Dao water and Dao lightning in the privacy
of his study, using them to form a Heptastar Duality Formation.
Cultivators would often use lightning and water in joint formations.
The treasures which Ning had purchased previously all had formations
built into them, such as the Godwater Flagon of the Seven Flags which
held a Seven Flags Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After familiarizing
himself with the formation, Ning calmed himself down and started to
think back to the insights regarding the sword which he had gained in
recent years. Slowly, his heart grew peaceful, calm, and empty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A full day passed in
the blink of an eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning opened his eyes, a
hint of eagerness in them. “Time to try out the Daolord
Cloudworld.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning left the study,
then glanced at World God Pillsaint and Flamefairy Su Youji. The two
were seated outside, drinking some wine, but when they saw Ning they
immediately rose to their feet. Su Youji immediately said, “Master,
are you going to the Daolord Cloudworld?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Pillsaint
hurriedly said, “I’ve heard that quite a few of the acknowledged
World-level cultivators of the Twelve Palaces went to the Daolord
Cloudworld on the very first day. It seems the competition will be
quite fierce… but I know that you will definitely succeed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You both know about
it?” Ning was surprised. It seemed as though everyone knew about
the Daolord Cloudworld trials.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although you didn’t
tell us about it, even an idiot would be able to figure it out. The
Twelve Palaces don’t exactly have that many acknowledged
World-level cultivators! For so many of them to enter the Daolord
Cloudworld on the exact same day is far too bizarre.” World God
Pillsaint looked towards Ning. “As I see it… you’ll definitely
succeed, Master. In fact, you might be number one. Those other
fellows are nothing more than ‘dirt chickens and clay dogs’, of
no worth whatsoever.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pillsaint was such an
adorable-looking figure that these words didn’t seem offensive at
all. Instead, he made them sound amusing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope you are
right.” Ning laughed. “Alright, time for me to go to the Daolord
Cloudworld.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji and Pillsaint
watched as Ning flew into the air towards the distant Daolord
Cloudworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daolord Cloudworld
was the tallest building in the entire Palace of the Sword, and its
outer surface was that of four enormous layers of clouds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll do everything
I can. Let’s see how far I’ll be able to make it.” Ning craned
his neck, staring upwards at the Daolord Cloudworld. Even though he
had tried it out several times in recent years, those had all been
merely for the sake of testing out some new sword-arts. He had never
really gone all out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning took a single step
forwards, moving deep into the layer of black mist and inside the
Daolord Cloudworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swordlord Darknorth
just went in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now, all of our
qualified Swordlords have entered.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder what’s
going on? All of the geniuses of the Twelve Palaces have gone inside
recently.” The black-armored Daolords patrolling off in the
distance were all watching. News spread quite quickly within the
Twelve Palaces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daolord Cloudworld
was split up into four levels. These levels were known as the
Blackcloud World, the Azurecloud World, the Silvercloud World, and
the Goldcloud World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cultivators of the
Sword Palace would have to start from the Blackcloud World each time,
because the main point of the Daolord Cloudworld was to help
cultivators find suitable opponents.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azurecloud World.
The white-robed Ji Ning was striding atop a long path formed from
azure clouds, wielding a longsword in one hand. Right in front of him
was a golem barring a path. The golem was shaped like a strange beast
with four legs and was roughly as strong as a Daolord of the First
Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light swept
against the golem’s chest in a seemingly casual manner, but the
golem was knocked flying backwards off its feet. This was Ning’s
‘Heavenbreaker stance’ of the [Brightmoon] sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light flashed
again in a mysterious manner, causing many sword-shadows to appear in
the air. There was no way to tell which attack was real and which
attack was illusory. The edge of the sword sheared against the neck
of a spider-shaped golem, and it couldn’t help but crumple as it
was sent flying backwards by Ning’s sword-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning defeated opponent
after opponent on the azure cloud path, but the more he defeated the
stronger the new opponents became. In fact, even the total number of
opponents began to increase as well. Ning, however, continued to
merely use a single sword, and the only sword-art he used was his own
[Brightmoon] sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve never
finished going through the entire second level before.” Ning’s
sword-arts had truly reached a profound level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each of the five
stances of [Brightmoon] were actually stronger than the seventh
stances of the [Heartsword] or the [Heartseal] sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems that at my
current level of sword-arts, a single sword is enough to easily
overcome this level.” Ning was already able to see the distant end
to this azure cloud path. He had distilled some of the essence of
[Heartseal] and [Heartsword] sword-arts, then raised them to a higher
level. When he used his own sword-arts, they carried an aura of
cyclical reincarnation as well, making the five stances of
[Brightmoon] naturally become illusory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A dazzling streak of
sword-light split the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword was like
a comet that sped through the skies. It was the most beautiful thing
in this world, and it seemed almost dreamlike. Ning’s sword had
reached an incredible level of speed! With a slash, it cut deep into
the body of a golem. Generally speaking, most people would stay far
away from golems and fight them from ad istance, but this was the
final opponent which Ning had to deal with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! The sword-light
stabbed through the golem’s throat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning was
rather surprised. “It went through? I usually wasn’t able to cut
or pierce through the other golems.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The stabbed
golem quickly retreated backwards, and a strange liquid began to flow
out of its throat. The wound quickly disappeared, and the golem left
the azure cloud path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve finally
reached the end of the path.” Ning flew out of the azure cloud
path. In front of him was a small island that was only a few square
kilometers in size, and there was a suit of azure armor placed on the
island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled when he
saw the suit of azure armor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Azure armor? It
seems as though it is time for me to upgrade my outfit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first time one
passed the Blackcloud World, a suit of black armor would be awarded.
The first time a person overcame the Azurecloud World, a suit of
azure cloud would be awarded. Ning had acquired his black armor long
ago, which was a top-grade Dao armor. It wasn’t even as useful as
the aquaflect armor he had purchased during the treasure auction. The
azure armor, however, was an Eternal-level treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“C’mere.” Ning
stepped forward and accepted the azure armor, then sat down in the
lotus position and began to slowly bind it while mentally preparing
himself for the third level, the Silvercloud World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Silvercloud World…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World-level cultivators
had absolutely no chance of making it to the end of this level! To
make it past this level meant that you had reached the threshold of
power of a Daolord of the Third Step. This was completely impossible.
Even if Ning reached the third stage in the [Novessence Thunder] and
[Novessence Water] and was thus able to slay a Daolord of the First
Step, he would merely be equivalent to a fairly formidable Daolord of
the Second Step. There was no way he’d be able to overcome the
Silvercloud World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bertulu… Eastcult…
none of them, not even the most talented of geniuses, could
accomplish this task!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, more than 90%
of the geniuses acknowledged by the ancient pagodas were able to
reach the threshold of Daolords of the Second Step. Ning, for
example, was already equivalent to a Daolord of the First Step with
his azureflower mist energy alone. Given that his sword-arts were
even more profound than the Reincarnation stance and the Cosmic Heart
stance, his skill in this area was actually somewhat higher than that
of many actual Daolords of the Second Step! This was why he had been
able to make it through the Azurecloud World with just as ingle
sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The azure armor is a
low-grade Eternal treasure. It has no special properties other than
its ability to absorb some degree of energy.” Ning couldn’t help
but shake his head. At least his aquaflect armor was able to reflect
damage. “Still, the more powerful my future opponents are, the less
useful my current armor will be. As for my opponents on the
Silvercloud World, they will all be at least at the threshold of the
Daolord of the Second Step level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning switched armors,
but he still elected to make it look like a set of white clothes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning then sat down in
the lotus position again and began to breathe quietly as he started
to work on replenishing the azurelower mist energy he had used up
during the first two levels. At the same time, he also thought back
to some of the mistakes he had made in his earlier battle. This was
the first time in the hundred years he been trying out in the
Cloudworld that he had made it all the way through the second level.
He had gained quite a few insights from this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He thought back to the
previous battles he had fought as he pondered on his sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“On the final day, I
will test myself against the Silvercloud World.” Ning came to a
decision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was actually one
of the slowest ones, as most of the World-level cultivators
acknowledged by the ancient pagodas had already finished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial palace.
The thirteen thrones levitating within the void of space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha, Heartforce
Cultivators truly are impressive. Solewind’s heartforce is becoming
more and more frightening.” Daolord Yinwind laughed merrily. “Our
Saber Palace won’t say a single begrudging word if he is ranked
number one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At present, aside from
Heartlord Solewind of the Heartforce Palace being ranked as number
one, the rest of the top four had been completely dominated by the
Palace of the Saber!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The nearby
Lord Woodflower just let out a cold snort.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sword Palace and
the Saber Palace had always been somewhat at loggerheads, because the
Dao of the Sword and the Dao of the Saber had always been the two
most offensive, combative Daos in the Endless Territories. Generally
speaking, more cultivators trained in the Dao of the Sword! Slightly
fewer trained in the Dao of the Saber.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Woodflower.”
Daolord Yinwind glanced sideways at Lord Woodflower, then let out an
odd chuckle. “Five members of your Sword Palace have already
finished their attempts, yes? The highest ranking member is merely
ranked seventh. You have no chance at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Lord
Woodflower had an ugly look on his face. He did not, however, try to
argue. The Saber Palace’s performance truly had been dominating,
while the Sword Palace’s performance truly had been lackluster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These Palace Lords and
Vice Palace Lords had all reached the end of the line. If they
succeeded in their Daomerge, they would gain eternity. If they
failed, they would die and their Dao would vanish. At their level,
face mattered more than almost anything else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll see about
that,” Lord Woodflower said flatly.

the challengers had arrived. Ji Ning and quite a few others had spent
the previous day recuperating in the Azurecloud World, so as to be in

people like Ning were able to fight for so long, after all; the

upset each time I see Greatjoy. I really feel regretful that I wasn’t
able to recruit him into our Skymetal Palace.” A handsome youth
dressed in beautiful golden robes let out a sigh. “I could tell all
those years ago that he had excellent potential, even though he was
very weak starting off. In the end, the Spacetime Palace managed to
lure him in… and then he somehow became one of your honorary
disciples, Hegemon! Judging from how he is blasting through the
Silvercloud World, he’s clearly become much more powerful once
again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha, Severtrip,
jealousy won’t get you anything. Greatjoy is now a member of our
Spacetime Palace.” A jade-eyed man with tousled hair let out a loud
laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is true that
Greatjoy has improved quite rapidly.” The almighty Hegemon stroked
his pristine white beard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The almighty Hegemon’s
accomplishments in the Dao of Spacetime allowed him to look down upon
all others in the Endless Territories. In the Twelve Palaces, he was
particularly close to the Spacetime Palace, and some of its dazzling
geniuses would be given a chance to earn one of his legacies and
become an honorary disciples! Prince Greatjoy was one of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Hegemon and the
twelve golden-armored lords continued to stare at the many scenes
playing out in midair. Prince Greatjoy was moving farther and farther
up the stairs to the altar, defeating one golem after another along
the way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prince Greatjoy’s
body shone with golden light as he manifested six arms and began to
sweep forward with even greater power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His palm-arts,
fist-arts, finger-arts… they were all unfathomably profound and
ridiculously powerful. Sometimes he moved quickly, sometimes he moved
slowly, but the region of spacetime surrounding him was in a
perpetual state of flux. It was extremely difficult for the golems
attacking him to unleash their true power, but every single strike of
Prince Greatjoy’s contained tremendous might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He devastated his way
through the golems, his entire body have transformed into a golden
color. He looked like a golden god of war, but a look of absolute,
glacial calm was in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s already
reached six hundred!” Daolord Thousand Waves let out a startled
cry. “Given how he’s cruised his way to the six hundredth level,
he might have a shot at giving Solewind a run for his money.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Silvercloud World
was actually one enormous altar that had nine hundred levels that
served as the ‘steps’ to the top of the altar. The farther up you
went, the more powerful your foes would be. The distance you were
able to travel was a testament to your strength!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, Heartlord
Solewind was ranked number one. He had made it to the 692nd step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ranked in second place
was Saberlord Redsnow of the Saber Palace. He had made it to the
680th step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ranked third and fourth
were members of the Saber Palace who had made it past the 600th step
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">600 steps… this
represented a certain level of power. Most of the acknowledged
cultivators had already completed their attempts, but only eight had
made it past the 600th step!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given how easy it
was for him to make it past the six hundredth level, he does indeed
have a shot at matching Solewind.” Lord Woodflower nodded slowly as
he gave his appraisal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hard to say. He
makes it look easy, but he might’ve already unleashed his full
power,” the nearby Daolord Yinwind retorted coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just keep watching.”
Lord Woodflower glanced sideways at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Daolord
Yinwind stared hard at the scene playing out before him. Prince
Greatjoy was still steadily advancing. Starting from the six
hundredth level, the golems became much more powerful and and much
more numerous. In fact, there could be as many as twenty or thirty of
them attacking you at the same time. However, Prince Greatjoy’s
mastery over spacetime allowed him to tower over almost all
World-level cultivators of the Twelve Palaces. He was able find
unconceivable openings and positions, allowing him to never have to
face more than three golems at one time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Six hundred fifty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Six hundred sixty.
Six hundred seventy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Yinwind’s
face grew uglier and uglier to behold, because Prince Greatjoy had
just caused a member of the Saber Palace to be eliminated from this
competition.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Six hundred eighty!
He’s still advancing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Six hundred ninety!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prince Greatjoy’s
face was starting to turn solemn, but a look of madness was in his
eyes. His entire body radiated that blinding golden light, and each
of his attacks contained utterly earth-shaking power. The golems were
able to land an occasional attack against him, but were completely
unable to harm him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He must have reached
at least the eighth stage in the [Illusory Jade] secret art.” The
youth dressed in the beautiful golden robes, Daolord Severtrip, let
out a sigh when he saw this. “This secret art isn’t all that
profound, but he still was able to reach the level of near-perfection
in it. This is a secret art of our Dao of Metal… he really
should’ve entered our Skymetal Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He beat him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He moved past
Solewind.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The farther one
advanced, the more difficult each level became. Prince Greatjoy’s
face was extremely solemn now. He was finding it extremely difficult
to advance, with the golems doing everything they could to oppose
him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Six hundred
ninety-nine… seven hundred! He made it to level seven hundred.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Previously, the only
members of the Twelve Palaces who made it past level seven hundred at
the World level were Bertulu and Eastcult. Now, Greatjoy has joined
their ranks.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ancient powers
sighed in amazement as they saw this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Prince Greatjoy,
he gritted his teeth and fought like a madman. By nature, he wasn’t
the type of person to easily admit defeat, and he still stubbornly
fought and clawed his way forwards. He had reached exceedingly great
heights in both the Dao of Spacetime and the Dao of Metal, and had
also received personal guidance from the almighty Hegemon himself.
Now, faced with such tremendous pressure, he actually began to slowly
grow stronger and stronger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas, with each step he
took the golems became increasingly terrifying as well, and even more
of them were appearing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One missed strike and
he was almost instantly knocked flying. Moments later, ropes
tightened around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Defeat!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had been defeated at
the 719th step!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ancient powers
seated within the thirteen thrones couldn’t help but sigh in
amazement. When they met and spoke with the most talented geniuses
like Prince Greatjoy, they virtually treated those geniuses as
equals, because once these geniuses made their breakthroughs they
would quickly become comparable to Daolords of the Third Step. Once
they engaged in a bit of training, they would quickly be able to
compare to Daolords of the Fourth Step. It would be very easy for
them to become major figures within the Endless Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, Prince
Greatjoy was ranked number one after having made it to the 719th
level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartlord Solewind was
ranked second after having made it to the 692nd level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ranked third was
Saberlord Redsnow, level 680.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Number four was
Saberlord Grief, level 668.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azurecloud World of
the Daolord Cloudworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning rose to his
feet and walked directly towards the highest position on the island
he was in. When he reached it, a spacetime vortex formed around him.
Ning disappeared from the Azurecloud World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Silvercloud
World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a world shaped
like an utterly enormous altar that had nine hundred steps to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What an enormous
altar.” Ning craned his neck as he stared upwards, seeing the many
golems roving about. He could also hear faint booms ringing out from
far ahead. “There are other cultivators here right now as well? I
wonder which member of the Sword Palace is here… or perhaps it is
one of the other Swordlords?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were so many
golems within the altar that ten cultivators could challenge this
world at the same time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning held a pair of
Eternal swords in his hands as he advanced forwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“GWAAAAR!”
Instantly, a pitch-black golem shaped like a three-headed,
four-legged beast let out a roar as it pounced towards Ning like a
streak of light, moving roughly three times as fast as the speed of
light! This single level was roughly as long as the entire Azurecloud
World had been, but it was merely a million kilometers wide. A
million kilometers might seem like a long distance, but major powers
were able to traverse it with just a single step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning looked
at the golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Instantly, Ning’s
body radiated with lightning, water, and many other types of light.
Some were dazzling, some were ruinous, some were subdued. The seven
types of Dao lightning all had different auras, as did the same types
of Dao water. Still, Ning was able to fully control all of them, and
with but a thought Ning caused them to join together into a Heptastar
Duality Formation. An enormous, dazzling, bizarre formation appeared
in the air which completely covered the four-legged beast which was
charging towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Although the
beast-golem let out a furious howl, it was still forced several steps
backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was able to
advance to the second level with ease. As he continued his advance,
the golems became increasingly powerful. In fact, there were even a
few golems that attacked from afar using magic treasures, and the
effectiveness of Ning’s Hepastar Duality Formation began to lessen.
Ning had to unleash his sword-arts to fight as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword-arts
were quite mighty, allowing him to sweep through all obstacles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two hundred steps.
Three hundred steps.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s ears
suddenly pricked up. “It seems everything went silent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There had been another
cultivator fighting on the other side of the altar. Moments ago,
explosions had been ringing out unabated. Now, nothing could be heard
at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Woodflower, your
Swordlord Wildfire has been defeated as well. He lost on the 597th
step. He almost made it to the 600th!” Daolord Yinwind glanced
sideways at Daolord Woodflower. “Right now, the only remaining
member in your Sword Palace is that kid who just became a Swordlord a
short while ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Woodflower
ignored Daolord Yinwind’s mockery. Instead, he stared at the scene
of Ji Ning forging his way ahead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, Ji Ning was
the only member of the Sword Palace who was still taking part in the
challenge. All the others had already failed.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_21___Tenacity"></A>
Chapter 21 – Tenacity
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Sword
Palace’s Silvercloud World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rest of the altar
was now completely silent. Still, Ning merely made a note of it as he
then continued to fight all-out against the golems on each level of
the altar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Explosions rang out
unabated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His Dao water and Dao
lightning were combined into a formation of tremendous power, but at
this point they were having a limited amount of impact on the
increasingly powerful golems. Still, for someone at Ning’s level,
even a limited impact would make things much simpler.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Level four hundred!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Level five hundred!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
advance. His most powerful technique was the [Brightmoon] sword-art,
and it was guaranteed that in the long run it would always be his
most powerful technique! Once he became a Daolord, he would have his
own path and that path would always allow him to unleash the most
power possible. By then, the other sword-arts would merely provide
him with guidance and experience, helping him enhance his
understanding of the Dao of the Sword. However, his greatest power
would forever lie within the [Brightmoon] sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The same was true for
other experts of the Dao of the Sword. Their strongest sword-arts
would be the ones they created!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heavenbreaker stance.
Shadowless stance. Soleheart stance. Yin-Yang stance. Blood Drop
stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five stances of
[Brightmoon]! And Ning had now infused them with the sword-intent of
reincarnation, making his five stances into a continuous cycle that
flowed with no weaknesses or flaws whatsoever, allowing him to
unleash even more power in battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the five
[Brightmoon] stances, Ning’s strongest stances were the Yin-Yang
stance and the Soleheart stance. These two were both defensive
techniques. Ning had put a tremendous amount of effort into his
Unicorn’s Domain, making him somewhat stronger in the area of
defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hey, Woodflower.
That’s the kid who just became a Swordlord in your palace, right?
He actually made it to the 500th level.” Daolord Severtrip suddenly
called out in surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mmhmm.” Lord
Woodflower nodded, revealing a smile as he watched Ning advance
nonstop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is pretty
impressive for him to have even made it past five hundred. It seems
this ‘Darknorth’ kid has some talent. A pity that he entered the
Sword Palace a bit too late,” Daolord Yinwind said, attempting to
pour some cold water on their excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Woodflower
didn’t argue. Even he could tell that although Ning’s sword-arts
were profound, they also had noticeable flaws compared to the skills
of Prince Greatjoy or Saberlord Redsnow! Ji Ning’s sword-arts were
average amongst the Swordlords who had been acknowledged by the
ancient pagodas. It must be understood that he had only been
acknowledged a mere century ago. For him to be considered ‘average’
amongst the sixty-seven most talented World-level cultivators in the
kingdom was already quite impressive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The 500th level was a
fairly ‘average’ level. Many geniuses were unable to make it much
farther past this level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had three heads
and six arms, and he wielded a Violetjewel in each of his six arms as
he fought with all his might. Lightning and torrents of water
exploded through the air unabated, doing their best to slow down and
affect the impending golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A golem suddenly
transformed into an enormous wave of water that came crashing down
towards Ning. Ning hurriedly used his Dao lightning and Dao water to
defend, but they were quickly submerged within the enormous wave, and
it continued its crashing assault.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yin-Yang stance.”
Ning’s six swords simultaneously struck out. This was a stance
meant to deal with group attacks. Ning was often forced to use the
Yin-Yang stance in the Silvercloud World, because the golems would
often attack in groups.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh. Yin and Yang
spun as Ning’s sword-light flew. The surrounding area seemed to
have been transformed into a black hole which completely blocked all
the waters of the wave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” After
pushing through the wave, Ning continued to advance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five hundred fifty.
Five hundred sixty. Five hundred seventy…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was incredibly
tenacious and durable. There was no way for him to use any divine
abilities with his azureflower mist energy, but because of how steady
he was he was able to stay at maximum power for a very long period of
time. Other Daolord-equivalents, even ones like Prince Greatjoy, had
to conserve their divine power and thus would often engage in normal
combat while only occasionally exploding forth with their full power.
Thus, they even brought spirit-pills, chaos jewels, and chaos nectar
to replenish their depleting energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, was
simply too stable!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His sword-arts were
similarly stable. The five stances of [Brightmoon] included all
aspects of swordplay. Some swordsmen were skilled in one area and
weaker in other areas; in short, they had their areas of specialties
and their deficiencies. Ning, however, was skilled in every single
area. He was slightly stronger in defense, but that was just in
comparison. The Reincarnation sword-intent filling his sword-arts
made it so that all five stances were merged together perfectly. This
naturally made him even stabler.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Mirrorsnow was
legendary for his tenacity. Even those who were stronger than him
would find it difficult to defeat him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Advance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Over the course of
countless years, numerous major powers have perished. None of those
Daolords who had failed their Daomerge have been able to come back to
life! An enormous price must be paid in order to bring back someone
whose truesoul has already been extinguished. If I’m not strong
enough, I won’t be able to beseech the almighty Hegemon and experts
on his level to help me. I won’t be able to convince them that the
price will be worth it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I want to
accomplish my goals, I have to seize every opportunity I can.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning would never give
up. He knew that many members of even the Brightshore Imperials had
perished over the course of years, with none being brought back to
life. Clearly, even if the almighty Hegemon was capable of
resurrecting the dead the price would be so terrifying that he
wouldn’t be willing to do it lightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve just started.
I can’t give up so soon.” Ning’s sword-arts were slowly, subtly
improving during this process. He wasn’t at a bottleneck, after
all, and this sort of furious, high-pressure combat would naturally
result in his sword-arts being perfected nonstop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Keep going. I can
take at least another step forwards.” Ning could feel that the
pressure was growing greater and greater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? Is he actually…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that kid from the
Sword Palace actually…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ancient powers
seated on the thirteen thrones all stared curiously at this scene.
Ning was currently battling against six golems, and it was difficult
for him to advance. Every single one of the six golems possessed
tremendous levels of power, and by now Ning’s Dao lightning and Dao
water were of very little help to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Six hundred. He
actually made it to level six hundred.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His sword-arts
actually enabled him to make it to level six hundred?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ancient powers were
all shocked. Daolord Thousand Waves cried out in surprise, “His
sword-arts are clearly quite ordinary compared to the other
acknowledged World-level geniuses, but he actually managed to make it
to the six hundredth level! Ji Ning already ranks in the top ten.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As time passed, the
total number who made it past level six hundred continued to grow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the very first day,
only five had made it past that level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By the time Prince
Greatjoy made it past, more than eight had already reached this
level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And now, Ji Ning was
the tenth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that this contest was a contest involving all the World-level
geniuses of the Twelve Palaces. For Ning to be only the tenth to make
it through this level meant that he was one of the elites within his
group. In fact, his performance was better than that of any other
member of the Sword Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Six hundred and two.
Mm, that should be it.” The white-bearded Hegemon nodded slowly.
“Don’t underestimate this Darknorth kid. His sword-arts might
seem to be inferior to that of Greatjoy and the others, making him
look ordinary, but they are extremely balanced. He’s skilled in
every single aspect, and from what I understand he has gained the
legacy of Mirrorsnow. Look, you can see the sword-intent of
Reincarnation permeating through his sword-arts. He’s managed to
link everything together perfectly, making him very strong… and
with those seven types of Dao lightning and Dao water supporting him,
it makes sense that he can make it past level six hundred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still, he’s at his
limit. He’s only persisting out of sheer tenacity and stubborness.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The almighty Hegemon
watched the scenes being displayed. Ji Ning had made it to the 602nd
level, but he was clearly at a complete disadvantage when facing the
eight golems on this level. Still, he continued to stubbornly hang
on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To make it to the
602nd level is not,” the almighty Hegemon evaluated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, not bad at
all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the future, this
kid just might be a match for Greatjoy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all agreed with
the Hegemon’s appraisal. Even Daolord Woodflower nodded in
agreement, but he couldn’t help but sigh to himself. Alas, the
seven Swordlords of the Sword Palace had all failed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No one rebutted the
almighty Hegemon, because they all knew how astute his vision and
judgment was. He was able to completely see and understand how strong
Ning was right now. If he said that this level was as far as Ning
could go, that would definitely be the case.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Silvercloud World.
Level six hundred and two of the altar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tired.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was so tired.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These eight golems
launched combined attacks against him. Terrifying flowers of fire and
water continuously rained down upon him, and some of the golems
repeatedly charged into close combat against him. Every single one
was just as strong as Ning, and when the six joined forces they were
able to completely suppress Ning! Ning had indeed only been able to
just barely hang on for this long thanks to his extremely balanced
sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He wouldn’t admit
defeat lightly. Once he gave up, he would have lost. Only by
persevering would there be hope.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning strove to learn as
much as he could from this very battle, pondering on his sword-arts
flaws in real time as he continuously perfected them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Attacks rained down
from every direction, and Ning was like a little boat that was being
rocked within a stormy sea that would capsize at any moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had no idea that
the almighty Hegemon and twelve golden-armored powers were watching
him. Although they had a rather good opinion of him, they felt
certain that this level was Ning’s limit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Their attacks really
are endless and omnipresent…” Although Ning’s sword-arts were
slowly improving, he still felt a sense of despair. Defeat would come
at any moment.

Chapter 22 – A Dao Belonging to Ji Ning
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Omnipresent?”
Surrounded and exhausted by the endless attacks from these many
golems, the light of inspiration suddenly flickered in Ji Ning’s
mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Their attacks
are omnipresent. Some cast spells from afar, others close in on me
and attack in melee using claws and palms. I only have six arms after
using [Three Heads, Six Arms]; how can I possibly withstand so many
attacks?” Ning was mumbling to himself as many different sword-arts
went through his mind, with many insights regarding the Yin-Yang
stance in particular coming to the forefront.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was as though a
thread was linking many small beads together, forming a true
collective whole.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Omnipresent…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The true Yin-Yang
stance shouldn’t result in me defending in such an exhausting
manner. So what if I have six arms? Even if I had ten or eighteen
arms, so what? There’s still a limit to what I can do!” Ning was
beginning to awaken to the truth. “The true Yin-Yang stance should
allow me to defend against all oncoming attacks, which means it needs
to be omnipresent as well. It should envelope everything in its path,
and any attacks that come forth should be blocked by it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That means… for
the Yin-Yang stance to be truly powerful, it should be a domain! I
need to transform this stance into a domain!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single cultivator
had a path that was most suited to them. Over the course of countless
years, many major powers had chosen many different paths. At their
level, there was no way they could imitate others any longer. If they
did, it would actually have a negative influence on their own future
insights. If you wished to draw a painting, it was best to start with
a fresh, blank scroll of paper. The path of cultivation was best
expressed through following one’s own heart, through slowly
understanding and upgrading one’s insights to the point of
fundamentally transforming them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let my seven Dao
lightnings and my seven Dao waters be my sword,” Ning murmured
softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao water and Dao
lightning that had been in the surrounding area constricting the foes
suddenly began to rumble. Although they were elemental lightning and
water by nature, true experts of the Dao of the Sword could use
anything as a sword. Flower petals, water drops, a single water drop…
they could all be used as a sword. Now, Ning was using Dao water and
Dao lightning as his blade.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dao lightning and
Dao water, form my Yin-Yang stance and create my Yin-Yang Sword
Domain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In recent years, Ning’s
greatest achievements lay in the field of defense. All of his
insights into the Yin-Yang stance, including some which he had
previously felt to be rather unimportant, all came together in this
stance as he generated a domain of sword-intent. He infused it with
all of his insights, causing the power of this stance to instantly
transform.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single streak of
Dao lightning transformed into a sword! The ‘insides’ of the
swords were made of lightning, but on the outside they had already
been shaped and condensed into the form of a sword! The powerful
sword-intent controlling the lightning was naturally giving birth to
swordforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single stream of
Dao water had also transformed into the shape of a sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They began to circle
around Ning like an enormous whirlpool, but if one looked closely one
would see that some of the streaks were swirling clockwise while
others were swirling counter-clockwise. The mighty sword-intent
controlling this technique caused parts of it to flow forwards and
parts of it to flow backwards, creating an incredibly powerful
tearing force!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What made white stand
out? Only when the rest of a piece of parchment was completely
covered in black ink would a spot of blank whiteness in the center be
dazzling to behold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword-intent
was strong to begin with. Now that he had formed this technique with
forward and reverse flows, the ripping, tearing power of his domain
grew exponentially greater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yin-Yang Polarity!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The concept of Yin and
Yang was reinforcing this technique as well! The Yang-attribute Dao
lightning and the Yin-attribute Dao water mutually reinforced each
other, resulting in both being strengthened. Every so often,
compatible streaks of lightning or water would brush against each
other, resulting in even more terrifying force.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both forwards and
backwards, both gentle and violent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous domain had
formed around Ning, covering an area of ten thousand kilometers. This
domain was formed of sword-shaped lightning and water, but what made
it truly terrifying was the sword-intent which Ning’s Yin-Yang
stance had manifested.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-intent of the
Yin-Yang stance had already undergone a fundamental transformation.
Lightning and water flowed together, sometimes calm and sometimes
explosive as it blasted at any foes which dared trespass!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From this day forth,
my Yin-Yang stance shall be the Yin-Yang Sword Domain.” Ning
smiled. Finally, one of his five stances of [Brightmoon] had truly
transformed. In this moment, Ning clearly understood that the
Yin-Yang Sword Domain was a path he would absolutely have to take in
the region of defense as he became a Samsara Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These golems were
sentient. Once Ning formed that enormous Yin-Yang Sword Domain, the
golems who were fighting within the reach of that domain instantly
sensed multiple layers of force appear in the area. Sometimes, the
force simply followed their movements; other times, the force
exploded against them with great violence. There was even the
occasional sensation of being brutally ripped apart by layers of
power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire domain was
filled with countless attacks that alternated between Yin and Yang.
The attacks constantly changed and transformed, making it harder and
harder for them to defend. The golems had to use roughly 90% of their
power in defending against the Yin-Yang Sword Domain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Ning charged
forwards, sweeping out with his sword-light and sending a golem
flying. The golems were so focused on defending against the domain
that they were now extremely vulnerable to Ning. He was able to
defeat them all with one strike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
advance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">603. 604. 605…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning slowly advanced,
wielding six swords while keeping [Three Heads, Six Arms] active. His
enormous Yin-Yang Sword Domain covered an area of ten thousand
kilometers around him, but in truth its size was variable. He could
easily expand it to make it a hundred million kilometers in size, but
the ten thousand kilometer range was the range at which he could
maintain peak levels of power. Beyond that range, the power of the
domain would slowly begin to decay.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Yin-Yang Sword
Domain could also be used through flying swords and other magic
treasures, or even Dao fire. Anything could be used to generate it.
However, Ning had access to incredibly powerful Dao lightning and Dao
water, which was why he used them to generate the domain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A simple tree branch
controlled by Ning’s mighty sword-intent was now able to slay a
Daolord of the First Step. The Dao lightning and Dao water were
extraordinary elemental powers, and when they were used by the
Yin-Yang Sword Domain they were able to produce truly enormous
amounts of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial palace.
The almighty Hegemon and the twelve golden-armored powers were seated
on their thirteen thrones, staring at this sight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Ning’s Yin-Yang
stance transformed into the Yin-Yang Sword Domain, Ning was able to
easily advance through the upcoming stages. However, none of the
golden-armored powers cared about the fact that the almighty
Hegemon’s evaluation had been wrong! Instead, they simply watched
in astonishment as Ning unleashed his sword-intent domain because
they knew what this portended.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He… has finally
taken that first step,” the almighty Hegemon said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swordlord Darknorth
is guaranteed to become one of the most supreme members of our Twelve
Palaces.” Daolord Thousand Waves nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For someone like him
to end up in the Sword Palace instead of mine… what a pity, what a
pity!” Daolord Yinwind shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Woodflower
glanced sideways at him, then began to laugh in a very contented
manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although Swordlord
Darknorth’s sword-intent domain is defensive in nature, every part
of it is infused with terrifyingly strong attacks. If any enemies
enter his domain, they will suffer attacks nonstop. Even the most
powerful of foes will eventually be whittled down, making it so that
they will be greatly weakened before even drawing close to him. A
domain like this is guaranteed to be a terrifying thing to face. If
he can become a Daolord of the Fourth Step… this sword-intent
domain is powerful enough to allow him to suppress Eternal Emperors.”
A golden-armored power whose eyes were like two black vortices of
darkness let out a soft sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The almighty Hegemon
nodded. “He’ll be able to suppress ordinary Eternal Emperors! For
Swordlord Darknorth to take this step forward means that he has
already discovered an Supreme Dao of defense for himself!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is guaranteed
that he will be a monster of a Daolord.” Everyone present nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were differences
in personal Daos. Some Samsara Daolords walked a path of simple Daos
and would be very weak. As Daolords of the First Step, they would
merely have ordinary levels of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Mirrorsnow’s
Dao and his seventh stance, the Reincarnation stance, would have been
enough for him to be acknowledged by the ancient pagodas. He used
this path to become a Samsara Daolord, and his Dao was fairly
formidable. As a Daolord of the First Step, he could match Daolords
of the Second Step. However, a Dao like this just barely cleared the
threshold of the ancient pagodas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prince Greatjoy,
Heartlord Solewind, Ji Ning… their Daos were on a higher level!
Ning had just created his Yin-Yang Sword Domain, but it was a level
of power above the Reincarnation stance and much more profound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An Supreme Dao of
defense.” Daolord Thousand Waves let out a sigh. “The Sword
Palace really hasn’t had many individuals who have ever been able
to come up with an Supreme Dao.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Absolutely true.”
Lord Woodflower nodded. Every single major power would have an
individual Dao that was best suited to them. Ning was able to develop
his Yin-Yang Sword Domain, but others might come up with similarly
strong sword-arts. So long as they were at the same general level,
they would all be classified as an ‘Ultimate’-class defensive
Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If he follows this
Dao to its conclusion, he definitely will be able to trample over
Eternal Emperors once he becomes a Daolord of the Fourth Step.”
Daolord Thousand Waves laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s still a bit
lacking compared to Palace Lord Dawnstar,” Daolord Yinwind said.
“Lord Dawnstar, at the World level, developed three Supreme Daos
and then merged them together perfectly! After he became a Daolord of
the Fourth Step, he was able to slay an Eternal Emperor with just
three strokes of his blade. Although Swordlord Darknorth is
impressive, he will only be able to suppress Eternal Emperors.
Killing them will be a matter of luck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True.” Everyone
present agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But Bertulu and
Eastcult do have a chance of reaching Lord Dawnstar’s level.” The
almighty Hegemon agreed with this assessment as well. “Still…
given that Darknorth has come up with an Ultimate-class defensive
Dao, he’ll still be able to withstand them in an actual battle. He
should be classified as someone on the same level as them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eastcult had come up
with Supreme Daos for both offense and defense, and had been able to
merge them perfectly. This was why he was a match for Bertulu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True. Him having
taken this step means he is guaranteed to be a monster of a Daolord.”
Lord Woodflower was in a splendid mood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, these
golden-armored figures had all referred to Ji Ning as ‘this kid’.
Now that Ning had taken this step, they all referred to him as
‘Darknorth’ or ‘Swordlord Darknorth’, because in their hearts
they viewed Ning as someone who would be a true equal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However… Supreme
Daos are also the most difficult Daos for gaining eternity.” The
almighty Hegemon let out a soft sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are indeed
hard, but to choose this path means he will definitely be an
extraordinary figure,” Daolord Thousand Waves said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Allgod, Daolord
Featherdress, Palace Lord Dawnstar… they had all chosen the path of
an Ultimate-class Dao. As a result, becoming an Eternal Empero would
be incredibly difficult. Still… while they were alive, they were
amongst the most illustrious, distinguished figures of all the
Endless Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The almighty Hegemon
and the others were sighing in amazement over Ning’s prowess, but
they had no idea that this was merely the evolution of the Yin-Yang
stance, one of five stances in Ning’s [Brightmoon] sword-art.
Ning’s plan was to reach the apex with his other four stances as
well! He was going to find suitable Daos for his other four stances,
then infuse all of their mysteries into his own sword-arts. This was
Ning’s true goal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, he had
developed an Supreme Dao of defense, the Yin-Yang Sword Domain… but
this was just the beginning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Six hundred sixty.
Six hundred seventy. Six hundred eighty…” Daolord Woodflower
watched as Ning continuously advanced up the steps of the altar, and
the smile on his face continued to widen.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 23 – The Dust Settles
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Daolord Yinwind
watched Ji Ning advanced past level six hundred and eighty, he
couldn’t help but feel resigned. Even the best performing member of
his Saber Palace, Saberlord Redsnow, had only made it to level 680.
“For Heartlord Solewind to give such an impressive performance was
expected, but Greatjoy’s improvements were truly shocking. He was
even better than Solewind! And now, this Darknorth fellow has
appeared as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
advance past multiple floors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The attacks of the
ancient golems were strong enough to sunder Heaven and Earth, and
they came at Ning from all directions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning walked
forwards, his Yin-Yang Sword Domain formed a region of wild, dark
chaos around him. One could vaguely see the flickering of lightning
and water within this region, and the region itself stretched out to
be more than ten thousand kilometers wide. All enemies who sought to
move close to Ning had to be able to first withstand the assaults of
the Yin-Yang Sword Domain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s swords were
sometimes ephemeral and unpredictable, sometimes as heavy and weighty
as a mountain. However, the speed at which he walked began to slow
down. Clearly, the pressure was starting to increase.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Six hundred ninety.
Six hundred ninety-five. Six hundred ninety-six…” Daolord
Woodflower had a look of delight on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He broke through
level seven hundred!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
advance, albeit with great difficulty as he began to move slower and
slower. Even though the Yin-Yang Sword Domain was helping him out, he
was finding it harder and harder to deal with the increasingly
powerful golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword-arts
were finally breached on level 705. Although they came out in a
perfect, flawless cycle, they still crumbled when faced with the
overwhelming power that had been brought to bear upon them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the Daolord
Cloudworld. A white-robed, rather bedraggled-looking Ning suddenly
appeared, a look of worry in his eyes. “I wonder if I made it into
the top four.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However… I have to
say that my performance was better than I expected. I actually ended
up developing a defensive Dao.” Ning felt both content and worried.
His sword-arts had reached an extremely high level, but his opponents
were the greatest World-level geniuses of the Twelve Palaces. He
couldn’t help but think back to that time when he had sparred
against Bertulu. Only now did realize what a truly profound level
Bertulu had reached!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because…
Bertulu was at a level of insight that was most likely one level
higher than the current Ji Ning’s! Only when Ning himself improved
did he truly understand how great the distance had been between the
two of them. Back when he had been at the Astral Islands, Ning only
had the vague sense that the man had a higher level of understanding
than he did. As to how much higher, exactly? He couldn’t say for
sure. Bertulu hadn’t even used his true form, after all; he had
merely used his human form to spar against Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However… now, even
if Bertulu was to attack me with all his power, I would not need to
be afraid of him,” Ning mused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His Yin-Yang Sword
Domain was an extremely defensive skill! Even if Ning faced opponents
who were stronger than him, he would still be able to defend against
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.”
Suddenly, a voice rang out within Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning turned
to look towards the direction of Lord Woodflower’s estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come here
immediately,” Lord Woodflower sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning
immediately transformed into a streak of light and flew towards the
estate. Soon, he reached Lord Woodflower’s estate, and Lord
Woodflower himself was standing at the entrance, a smile on his face
as he looked at Ning. “Come in, Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it, senior
apprentice-brother?” Ning was a bit nervous. He didn’t know if he
had made it into the top four or not.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damned impressive.
The almighty Hegemon and the others all saw you use that sword-intent
domain of yours.” Lord Woodflower was in such a delightful mood
that he was positively beaming. For his Sword Palace to completely
crush the Saber Palace in such a way was absolutely wonderful!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two palaces had
been at loggerheads and competing against each other since time
immemorial.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That was something I
just came up with it. I call it the Yin-Yang Sword Domain.” Ning
laughed. “I was just lucky. I had already prepared seven types of
Dao lightning and Dao water, and I was able to use them to create my
Yin-Yang Sword Domain. If I had been using any other types of
treasures, the power of my domain would’ve been much weaker.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dao lightning
and the Dao water aren’t that impressive. It is your sword-intent
which truly impresses.” Lord Woodflower couldn’t help but praise
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if he merely used
a single, ordinary flying sword, his Yin-Yang Sword Domain would
still cause it to naturally emanate an aura of swordforce. The power
of the domain would still have twenty to thirty percent of the power
of a domain formed through using Dao lightning and Dao water. At this
level, even if he merely used his Immortal energy to manifest a sword
and swordforce, he would still be able to create an extremely
powerful domain with it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Without the Dao
water and the Dao lightning, I probably wouldn’t have been able to
make it much farther past level six hundred and ninety,” Ning said.
He couldn’t help but ask, “Senior apprentice-brother, do I have a
shot at the top four?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only the top four would
be granted the ‘opportunity’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You do.” Lord
Woodflower nodded. “A very good shot, in fact. But of course, the
three days haven’t ended and there are still World-level
cultivators challenging the Daolord Cloudworld. Nothing is certain
until the final cultivator concludes his attempts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Ning nodded.
“Then how is my ranking?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right now, you are
ranked second,” Lord Woodflower said. “Prince Greatjoy is ranked
first, and he made it to floor seven hundred and nineteen. Heartlord
Solewind is ranked third, and he made it to floor six hundred and
ninety-two. Fourth is Saberlord Redsnow, who stopped on floor six
hundred and eighty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Redsnow?” Ning
stared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Something wrong?”
Lord Woodflower asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing, nothing.”
Ning immediately shook his head. “I just thought of an old friend,
that’s all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Threelives’
most powerful general had been Redsnow. Redsnow had eventually chosen
to follow Ning as well, then had become apprenticed to Subhuti as
well. He shared the exact same Daoist title as this Saberlord
Redsnow. Still, it was quite common to encounter cultivators with the
same or similar nicknames. There were countless people in every
chaosworld who shared the same name, and for a few of the more
powerful cultivators to also share the same Daoist title wasn’t
that surprising.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wasn’t the Saber
Palace bragging a lot about how well they would do?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha, their
boasting skills were quite profound, yes.” Lord Woodflower let out
a laugh, but then he couldn’t help but sigh as well. “To be
honest, they were qualified to boast. The fourth, fifth, and
sixth-ranked experts all belong to the Saber Palace. We all knew that
Heartlord Solewind would be formidable, but you and Prince Greatjoy
caught everyone offguard.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prince Greatjoy?”
Ning listened attentively. He was quite curious about this man who
had made it even farther within the Silvercloud World than he himself
had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s also been
improving quite rapidly. He actually managed to come up with two
Supreme Daos.” Lord Woodflower let out a sigh. “If he can link
his two Supreme Daos, he’ll probably be on par with Eastcult and
Bertulu.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. It was
necessary to fuse Supreme Daos together in some manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, the five
stances of Ning’s [Brightmoon[ sword-art were all linked together
thanks to his Reincarnation sword-intent. If you weren’t able to
perfectly join your sword-arts together, you would have flaws when
you fought in battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True experts had to
have powerful defenses. Only then would they be able to survive for a
long time. But of course, their attacks had to be strong as well;
only then would they be able to slay foes! If Ning’s attacks had
been just a bit stronger, he would’ve been able to advance quite a
bit further up the altar within the Silvercloud World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah!” A look of
shock suddenly appeared on Lord Woodflower’s face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s wrong?”
Ning looked at Lord Woodflower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll tell you in a
moment.” Lord Woodflower didn’t explain in detail. Clearly, his
incarnation was watching something happen within the imperial palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was incredibly
curious as to what Lord Woodflower was watching, but he had no choice
but to tamp down his curiosity. A long while later, Lord Woodflower
suddenly began to laugh. “Ahaha. Pride really does cometh before a
fall.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother?” Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A World-level
cultivator belonging to the Palace of Kindwater, a fellow named
Waterlord Firesurge, actually made it all the way to level six
hundred and eighty-seven,” Lord Woodflower said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In other words, even
farther than Saberlord Redsnow?” Ning stared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. The Saber
Palace didn’t get a single slot in the top four!” Lord Woodflower
roared with laughter. “Oh, this is just wonderful! When I saw that
ugly look on Yinwind’s ugly face… oh, that was simply delightful.
Hah! That fellow usually loves to strut about and put on airs in
front of me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt amazed as
well. In the end, the most famous Saber Palace had actually been
completely defeated. Then again… the geniuses of the Twelve Palaces
couldn’t be evaluated using common measures. Greatjoy, Darknorth,
and Firesurge… these three had only displayed their true brilliance
during this competition.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s a member of
the Kindwater Palace. Why is his Daoist title ‘Firesurge’?”
Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s another
person who started off as a mortal cultivator. I heard that he
originally was primarily a cultivator in the Dao of Fire. However,
due to some trouble he apparently ran into within the sect he was in
as a mortal, he ended up choosing the Dao of Water instead. However,
by then his Daoist title had already been chosen, and so he simply
continued to use it,” Lord Woodflower explained. The Twelve Palaces
didn’t have that many World-level cultivators, and so he obviously
was familiar with the vast majority of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some cultivators would
change their Daoist titles once they reached a certain level of
power. Ning was another example of a person who had chosen his Daoist
title, ‘Darknorth’, a long time ago. He had never changed it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s wait for
just another moment. There is one final World-level cultivator
attempting the trials,” Lord Woodflower said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright, all done.
The results are in. Prince Greatjoy, yourself, Heartlord Solewind,
and Waterlord Firesurge will be the ones to partake in this
opportunity,” Lord Woodflower said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And what opportunity
is this, exactly?” Although Ning felt quite excited, he also felt
quite curious as to what this was all about. All he knew was that
this was an ‘incredible’ opportunity, one which no one seemed to
know much about.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t ask. When
you meet the almighty Hegemon, you’ll know,” Lord Woodflower
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Meet the almighty
Hegemon?” Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. The almighty
Hegemon has already issued a summons to the four of you. Hurry over
to the place where the Imperials reside,” Lord Woodflower said.

Chapter 24 – The First Meeting
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Twelve Palaces were
tightly connected to the Brightshore Imperials, and so there were
spacetime transfer arrays linking the palaces to the territory of the
Imperials.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Spacetime twisted
around Ji Ning. Once everything went still, he swept the area with
his gaze. “So this is the imperial palace?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although all twelve of
the palaces of the Brightshore Kingdom were extremely large and
covered with many formations, the true center of the kingdom remained
the imperial palace! Before Ning was an utterly, breathtakingly large
palace that was as white as snow, with gold, black, and blue accents
covering parts of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just looking at the
imperial palace, Ning sensed an aura of incredible presence and
might. He felt as though he was looking up at the stars themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard that the
Imperials generally live here in the imperial palace. I wonder how
many defenses the almighty Hegemon had placed around his
headquarters,” Ning mused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning emerged from the
array and began to walk towards the palace gates of the enormous
imperial palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were no people
before the palace at all, just two gray statues. One was of a
humanoid wielding a spear, the second was of a dragon-like creature
that was coiled around itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Halt.” The
humanoid statue suddenly spoke out in a grating voice as it stared at
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whaaaat?!” Ning
was badly startled. “Its alive?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could now be
considered a powerful expert. After unleashing his Yin-Yang Sword
Domain, he was a match for most Daolords of the Second Step, and thus
he had extremely keen senses towards life and the aura of life. He
would be able to easily detect the aura of a tiny mosquito from a
million kilometers away! However, his senses were clearly telling him
that this statue before him was nothing more than an ordinary statue,
an inert hunk of rock. How, then, was it speaking?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have you come to see
the Hegemon?” The gray humanoid statue was almost as tall as the
palace gates, and it stared down at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
Although his senses were still telling him that this statue was an
inert hunk of rock, he couldn’t help but feel an inexplicable hint
of fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enter after all four
have arrived,” the gray humanoid statue said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had no choice but
to stand there and wait quietly. After enough time passed to brew a
kettle of tea, the nearby spacetime transfer array once more lit up.
Once the light subsided, a skinny bald youth dressed in loose red
robes had appeared within it. The youth’s face was covered with
strange divine red tattoos that seemed to extrude an aura of special
charm. Ning only had to glance at them to feel that they were
exerting an effect upon him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am Solewind.”
The bald, red-robed youth strolled forwards, then smiled. “Greetings,
Swordlord Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heartlord Solewind.”
Ning greeted the man. The Heartforce Palace had very few cultivators,
and the only World-level cultivator acknowledged by the ancient
pagodas was Heartlord Solewind. Ning had heard of this man long ago.
This was no dabbler like Bertulu; this was a man who had truly poured
all of his effort into being a Heartforce Cultivator, and his
abilities were truly unfathomable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swordlord Darknorth,
you actually made it farther into the Silvercloud World’s great
altar than I did.” Heartlord Solewind smiled in a gentle, warm
fashion. “I heard that you were abducted by the almighty Hegemon to
our Brightshore Kingdom roughly two thousand years ago. For you to
reach such a level of power in such a short period of time…
Solewind truly admires you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was instantly
speechless. The man even knew about him having been abducted by the
almighty Hegemon two thousand years ago? News had certainly spread
quite fast!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to feel
surprised, Swordlord Darknorth. It was one of my elder brothers in
the Heartforce Palace who informed me of this,” Heartlord Solewind
said with a laugh. “The Heartforce Palace has very few cultivators
within it, and we all treat each other as we would our actual
siblings. We hold nothing back from each other.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly
remembered that the entire Heartforce Palace held less than ten
Samsara Daolords! Most of those Samsara Daolords were out wandering
the primordial chaos, leaving no more than two or three who actually
resided within the palace itself. Compared to the other eleven
palaces, the Heartforce Palace really did have pitifully few members.
Ning could fully understand how this would result in them treating
each other as they would actual siblings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swordlord Darknorth,
if you wish you can simply address me as Solewind.” Heartlord
Solewind smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then you can address
me as Darknorth, brother Solewind,” Ning said. In his heart, he
couldn’t help but feel astonished. Why was it that a simple smile
from Solewind caused Ning to have such a good impression of him? His
voice alone was enough to make it impossible for others to hate him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The spacetime transfer
array once more lit up, and momens later a youth dressed in deep blue
robes emerged. He had a cold, forbidding face, and he emanated an
aura of baleful energy. As soon as he emerged he saw Ning and
Solewind, and he immediately called out, “Greetings, Heartlord
Solewind and Swordlord Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you Waterlord
Firesurge? No need to stand on such ceremony. You can simply address
us as Solewind and Darknorth,” Heartlord Solewind said, and Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was lucky enough
to be ranked number four, but I fear I’ll need your help in the
future.” Although the blue-robed youth had a cold and forboding
aura, his words were quite courteous and respectful. Both Solewind
and Ning felt quite kindly disposed towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No matter what, they
were all members of the Twelve Palaces who had sworn lifeblood oaths
not to attack each other. Given that they were ranked in the top
four, all of them would clearly be extraordinary figures in the
future. So long as they were able to survive, they would all become
major powers who would shock the rest of the primordial chaos. It was
natural for them to wish to befriend each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three chatted idly
for a time, slowly growing more familiar with each other’s
personalities and traits.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, the last
member arrived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a man dressed
in black imperial robes who wore a royal crown. His skin was as clear
as jade, and his eyes were as deep as the abyss between the stars.
Even the likes of Ji Ning, Firesurge, and Solewind couldn’t help
but mentally sigh in amazement. In terms of appearance and aura, at
least, this ‘Prince Greatjoy’ was definitely number one amongst
the four.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So the three of you
have already arrived? Please pardon me for having arrived late.
Greatjoy feels quite ashamed at having made you wait.” Prince
Greatjoy was as courteous as the stories said he was… but of course
the stories also said that deep down, he was actually quite a berserk
fellow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We just arrived a
short while ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Greatjoy,
you ranked number one in this trial. I imagine that you are probably
on par with Bertulu and Eastcult.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four began to
casually chat amongst themselves. Although they were all quite
relaxed, none of them dared to underestimate any of the other three,
as they were all quite close in power. They belonged to the same
general level of strength, even though there were differences with
regards to how far they had made it in the Silvercloud World. If they
were to get into an actual fight, it was hard to say who would win.
In addition, the trial of the Silvercloud World was a trial where
many sources of outside help were banned, such as Dao-seals or
golems. Given how extraordinary they all were, all of them had
clearly experienced tremendous strokes of karmic luck in the past!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Hegemon has
summoned the four of you. Go on inside.” The giant humanoid statue
stared down at the four tiny dots below it as it spoke in a cold
voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two statues
standing in front of the imperial palace are the two great guardians
of the imperial palace,” Heartlord Solewind sent mentally. “I
heard that long ago, during the era when the almighty Hegemon was
first establishing his reputation, he led these two great guardians
into battle and slew countless major powers with them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning,
Greatjoy, and Firesurge both listened attentively.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The members of the
Heartforce Palace shared a particularly close relationship with each
other, and so Heartlord Solewind knew many more secrets than most
members of the other palaces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning was quite
intrigued about the history of these two giant statues, he didn’t
pay them too much mind as he entered the imperial palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once they stepped past
the gates and saw the towering palace, the four of them could sense
spacetime twisting around them as they were teleported away once
more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had been brought
to a region filled with empty space with a few chaos stars sprinkled
throughout it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
stared at their surroundings as they appeared in this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is this place?”
All four of them were rather puzzled. This region was simply too
silent, as still as a pool of water. The primordial chaos should
generally be filled with many types of voidstorms and chaos waves,
and it would generally be filled with boundless amounts of chaos
energy! However, the empty region they were in was utterly enormous
and completely devoid of primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The void before them
suddenly parted like a curtain of water as an incomparably massive
behemoth suddenly appeared. This behemoth had two enormous eyes that
were like blazing stars, but it gazed towards Ning and the other
three in a very gentle manner. When it spoke, its voice was similarly
gentle, but it echoed throughout every single inch of this region.
“Greetings, my four young fellows.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Greatjoy, Solewind,
Firesurge, and Ning were all shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but think back to the scene of him and the other World-level
cultivators being swallowed up by the head of an enormous behemoth,
then being teleported to the Brightshore Kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, Hegemon.”
Ning and the other three all bowed respectfully. There was no need to
kneel or kowtow; the Hegemon generally treated the members of the
Twelve Palaces quite well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You four young
fellows have earned a rare opportunity for yourselves,” the
towering behemoth said. “You shall head out alongside a member of
my Imperials known as Skyfire Brightshore, and then you shall enter
the Archaeus region of an alternate universe. This region is one of
the most legendary locations of this alternate universe, and it is
filled with many dangers. It is also, however, filled with many
opportunities. I’ve chosen the four of you because I hope that you
will help my young clansman, Skyfire Brightshore, as much as you can
and give him a better chance at surviving. But of course, I will
reward you heavily for the services you have rendered to myself and
Skyfire.”
</P>

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_25___Following_Master"></A>
Chapter 25 – Following Master
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the others
were all intrigued. In truth, they had all suspected long ago that
the reason why the almighty Hegemon had chosen the four of them from
the Twelve Palaces was to have them assist Skyfire Brightshore.
However, the reason why the Twelve Palaces had been on such good
terms with the Brightshore Imperials for so long was precisely
because they treated each other as equals. Ning and the others were
all extraordinary figures, and they wouldn’t be expected to risk
their lives for the Imperials without being compensated at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once you return from
the alternate universe, I’ll speak with Skyfire Brightshore. The
more assistance you provided to him, the greater our gratitude shall
be,” the towering behemoth said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do not worry,
Hegemon. We will definitely do everything we can.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since we are
travelling together, we shall definitely do our best to support each
other.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them spoke out
in unison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all knew that
since the Hegemon said he would ‘reward them heavily’, the
rewards for this mission would definitely be extraordinary. The
Hegemon was someone who had stood at the very top of the Endless
Territories for countless years, after all. He had existed for even
longer than the Brightshore Kingdom itself had existed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A ‘heavy reward’
from someone like him was indeed more than enough to convince Ning
and the others to do their absolute utmost in protecting Skyfire
Brightshore in his journey to the alternate universe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” The
towering behemoth nodded slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yet another spacetime
vortex appeared next to Ning’s group. Moments later, a strange
beast bathed in blazing flames suddenly emerged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Skyfire.” The
towering behemoth nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hegemon.” The
blazing beast immediately transformed into the shape of a
fiery-haired youth who wore a suit of azure armor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It shall be the five
of you who will travel to the alternate universe,” the towering
behemoth said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fiery-haired youth
swept the four with his gaze, closely scrutinizing them. He then
cracked a smile. “My name is Skyfire Brightshore, but you can just
call me Skyfire. I heard from the Hegemon that none of the four
chosen ones are weaker than I am. Once we go to the alternate
universe, I’ll have to trouble you to help me out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Skyfire
Brightshore was an incredibly talented member of the race of
Brightshore Imperials, he was still just a new member who had been
brought back just a short while ago. Ning and the others had all
developed at least one Supreme Dao and were comparable to Daolords of
the Second Step. Indeed, all of them were somewhat more powerful than
Skyfire Brightshore. But of course, this was only true if they
factored in their ‘normal’ combat power. There was no way to
calculate the power of any trump cards or single-use items which they
were keeping hidden up their sleeves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hegemon, where is
this ‘Archaeus region’ and what is this ‘alternate universe’?”
Prince Greatjoy asked. He was nothing more than an honorary disciple
of the almighty Hegemon, and he wasn’t truly qualified to address
the Hegemon as ‘Master’. According to the almighty Hegemon’s
rules, only his personal disciples were qualified to call him
‘Master’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The alternate
universe?” The towering behemoth smiled as it saw the looks of
eagerness appear on the faces of Ning and the others. “By now, all
of you should have sensed that the Endless Territories have certain
prime essences within it. There is a prime essence of fire, a prime
essence of water, a prime essence of the sword, a prime essence of
space, a prime essence of time…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
nodded. Everyone could sense the prime essences. However, attuning to
the prime essences was only able to help one advance to the level of
full mastery as a World-level cultivator. As for the more profound
mysteries, the prime essences kept them bottled up internally and
emanated none of them at all. Supposedly, not even Eternal Emperors
could enter the prime essences and train in those mysteries. Thus,
Samsara Daolords had to find and develop a Dao which suited
themselves, one slow step at a time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The vast region
which is covered by the power of the prime essences is known as a
‘universe’,” the almighty Hegemon said. “An ‘alternate
universe’ naturally refers to a place which has completely
different prime essences.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning and
the others were all stunned. Different prime essences?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms, the
Badlands Territory, the Brightshore Kingdom… Ning had been able to
sense the prime essence of the sword in all these places. The prime
essence of the sword was unchanging, and the vast Endless Territories
were nothing more than a part of an enormous universe! But now, it
seemed as though he was going to head off into a completely different
universe?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do not worry. The
outermost layers of the prime essences of this alternate universe,
such as the prime essence of water, the prime essence of time, the
prime essence of the sword, etc., are all the same as ours. Only the
inner layers differ,” the almighty Hegemon said. “Thus, your
power shall not be impacted whatsoever.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Has anyone ever been
to this place?” Waterlord Firesurge couldn’t help but ask.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“None.” The
almighty Hegemon shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were instantly rendered speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Long ago, as I
attuned myself to the nature of spacetime, I was able to dimly sense
the traces of an alternate universe that was quite close to our own
universe, and so I opened a transversal conduit between our two
universe,” the towering behemoth said. “However, the transversal
conduit is rather weak, because it is constantly being disrupted by
the differing laws of our two universes. Thus, only those below the
Daolord level of power are able to enter it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus, once you head
off into this alternate universe, you absolutely must not allow
yourselves to break through to the Daolord level. If you do break
through, you will never be able to return. You will have to forever
stay within that alternate universe,” the towering behemoth
instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
nodded. So due to the different laws of the two universes, there was
no way for Daolords to pass through this transversal conduit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, World-level
cultivators can pass through this conduit with no danger whatsoever,”
the towering behemoth said. “Just a few days ago, I sent one of my
World-level servants through the dimension conduit to do some
exploring, then brought him back safely. Over the course of countless
years, I’ve also managed to capture quite a few World-level
cultivators of the alternate universe and bring them to ours.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Capture?” Ning and
the others were secretly speechless. The almighty Hegemon was unable
to go personally, but was still able to capture people?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus, this
transversal conduit is completely safe,” the towering behemoth
said. “Given how strong you are, I trust that you will not
encounter much danger when you journey through the territories of the
alternate universe. The true trial will begin once you reach their
Archaeus region!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the other four
listened attentively. Not even Skyfire Brightshore knew much about
this ‘Archaeus region’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Archaeus region
is the most mysterious region in this alternate universe. It takes up
an extremely vast region of space, so vast that I imagine there are
very few cultivators who even know how large it truly is. Supposedly,
there are many Daolords and even Eternal Emperors who seclude
themselves throughout the Archaeus region.” The towering behemoth
laughed. “This Archaeus region is so vast that it is most likely as
large as our entire Endless Territories.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning and
the others were all speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had originally
thought that this Archaeus region would be some sort of secret world
or location. Now, it seemed, it was a place that was almost as vast
as their entire Endless Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That place is the
core of that entire alternate universe, the place where the alternate
universe sprang from. Countless cultivators in that universe dream of
entering the Archaeus region, because everyone who manages to survive
their journey through it will return completely transformed,” the
towering behemoth said. “However… if you barge into the Archaeus
region, you will immediately be assaulted and annihilated by the full
force of the entire Archaeus region itself. You’ll be instantly
reduced to dust and your truesoul vaporized.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were truly at a loss for words. If the entire region was the size of
the Endless Territories… how terrifying would an attack launched
with the full might of that region be?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That place is the
core of the entire alternate universe, after all.” The towering
behemoth continued, “Everyone who wishes to enter the place has to
first bind an Archaeus medallion. After doing so, you’ll be able to
enter it safely and won’t be expelled by the power of the region.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Archaeus medallions
are extremely rare. I sent my will into the alternate universe and
spread it across an extremely wide area, then kidnapped the
World-level cultivators who passed through the area. It took me
countless years to accumulate just a few Archaeus medallions,” the
towering behemoth said. “Here are the five Archaeus medallions.
Take them and bind them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Swoosh. Swoosh.
Swoosh. Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five streaks of light
appeared out of nowhere and flew towards Ning and the other four.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Archaeus medallions
were dark-red disc-shaped medallions that were covered with ancient,
complicated runes. Ning and the others didn’t understand the runes,
but could sense that they came from a long time ago, in a universe
that was far, far away. They all bound the medallions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hegemon.” Ning
spoke out. “Will we be permitted to bring our retainers and
servants into the alternate universe? Are they allowed to enter the
Archaeus region?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The others all looked
at the Hegemon, because they all had retainers and servants as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Anyone below the
Daolord level can make use of the transversal conduit,” the
almighty Hegemon said. “As for the Archaeus region… they will
have to perpetually hide within your estate-world treasures, and they
can’t let any of their auras leak out at all. If they reveal
themselves within the Archaeus region, they’ll suffer an immediate
attack from the power of the region. However, if they continuously
hide without coming out they will be safe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others now
understood. They would not be able to leave the estate-worlds or even
sent out their aura or godsense. If that was the case, there was no
real point to bringing them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But of course, if
you were able to acquire more Archaeus medallions, you could gift
them to your retainers and servants. They would then be qualified to
enter the Archaeus region as well,” the almighty Hegemon suddenly
said. “Still, I urge you to be more low-key when you enter the
Archaeus region, as it holds quite a few truly powerful Daolords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here is a star map
of the alternate universe. It includes all the markers you need to
travel from the transversal conduit’s exit to the Archaeus region,
as well as some information regarding this universe. Remember, you
are not to reveal this to others.” As the almighty Hegemon spoke,
he bestowed five sets of star maps upon them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
and the other four accepted the maps.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Make your
preparations. Three days from now, we shall meet again outside the
imperial palace,” the almighty Hegemon instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning returned to the
Sword Palace, then met with World God Pillsaint and Su Youji.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A tremendous
opportunity has been made available to me. I’ll be heading to an
extremely dangerous place. If you follow me, there’s a slim chance
that you’ll gain some karmic fortune from it as well. But of
course, when I die you will die as well,” Ning said. “Shall you
follow me or will you remain here in the Sword Palace?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll follow you,
Master.” Su Youji didn’t hesitate at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not allowed to
learn any of the techniques or secret arts of the Twelve Palaces. Of
course I’ll follow you, Master!” Pillsaint agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly upon
seeing this. He couldn’t promise them anything. He hadn’t even
visited this alternate universe before, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three days later, Ji
Ning, Solewind, Firesurge, Greatjoy, and Skyfire Brightjoy all
gathered together before the gates of the imperial palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone.” The
gray humanoid statue suddenly walked towards Ning and the other four.
“I shall escort the five of you to the transversal conduit.”
</P>

Chapter 26 – Entering the Alternate Universe
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The grayish humanoid
statue first made some slight alterations to the spacetime transfer
array in front of the imperial palace, then activated it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Solewind,
Firesurge, Greatjoy, and Skyfire could sense spacetime twisting
around them. Soon, everything went silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning and the
others stared at their new surroundings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were at the peak
of a towering mountain that was levitating in empty space. At the
very apex of the mountain peak sat a white-bearded old man dressed in
snowy robes who had six curved horns on his head. Ning and the others
had seen the almighty Hegemon’s true form before, and they
immediately recognized the old man’s aura as that of the Hegemon’s.
They immediately bowed respectfully. “Hegemon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place here is
the transversal conduit.” The white-bearded old man pointed at a
place halfway up the mountain. At first glance it seemed quite
ordinary, but a more careful examination revealed a series of faint,
concentric spacetime ripples emanating an aura of incredible power.
If the transversal conduit was to collapse with them inside, they
would probably all perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once you enter the
alternate universe, even items like ‘truesoul towers’ and ‘heart
lamps’ will no longer be able to detect whether or not you are
still alive, to say nothing of ordinary life tablets,” the
white-bearded elder said. “These are two completely separate
universes, after all. But of course, if you have trained in some sort
of cloning technique, you can leave a clone behind in this universe.
If the other clones all perish, you can rebuild them with your backup
clone. That’s one way to tell if you are alive or not.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning and
the others all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heart lamps and
truesoul towers were attuned directly to one’s truesoul. Even if
one entered the most deadly of locations, they would still be able to
sense the presence of your truesoul. Alas, if you entered an
alternate universe they would be useless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Life tablets were the
most simple and common items used to determine if someone was alive
or not. Many special locations were able to completely block the
effect of life tablets. In fact, a sufficiently great distance would
also be enough to make it impossible for a life tablet to function.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No one will be able
to assist you on this journey to this alternate universe. Everything
will all be up to yourselves,” the white-bearded elder said. “Go
in. After you enter the conduit, make sure you remember to only go
forwards and follow the flow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,” Ning
and the other four acknowledged. They then all turned to walk towards
those the seemingly ordinary, concentric spacetime ripples. As the
five moved closer to the ripples, they quickly began to feel as
though they had been dragged into a powerful spacetime whirlpool.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The journey through the
transversal conduit started off quite calm and peaceful. Soon,
however, Ning and the others could sense how space and time were
twisting and distorting around them, as were many of the laws they
had taken for granted. This was quite a miserable feeling; even their
truesouls felt stifled and choked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s move
faster,” Prince Greatjoy growled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forwards!” Ning
urged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all suppressed the
nauseous feelings they had as they hurriedly flew forwards. In front
of them was a dark tunnel which had been formed by rings of spacetime
vortices. The black tunnel seemingly had no exit, and the laws of
both universes were in force throughout the tunnel. Thankfully, Ning
and the others had not yet reached the Daolord level, and so the
disturbance they created was fairly minor. If a true Daolord had
dared to make use of this transversal conduit, it was very likely
that the two differing laws of the two universes would’ve crushed
him to death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning and the
others continued to fly forwards at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why is this tunnel
so long?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How long is this
transversal conduit? There seems to be no end to it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others had
been flying for more than two hours by now, but they were still stuck
within that tunnel of darkness. They all felt quite nauseous, but at
least they weren’t at risk of losing their lives. They were all
able to resist the uncomfortable feelings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartlord Solewind sent
mentally to the others, “The Hegemon told us to just keep pressing
onwards after we enter the tunnel. Let’s just keep flying like
this. Sooner or later, we’ll reach the exit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Waterlord
Firesurge nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A transversal
conduit which links two universes. Today, I’ve finally seen such a
thing with my own eyes.” Prince Greatjoy laughed loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five of them
chatted as they continued to fly forwards, but they soon ran out of
topics to talk about and so just continued to fly in silence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One day. Two days.
Three days…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had never imagined
that this transversal conduit would be so long. If this was ‘normal’
flying, he wouldn’t have minded, but this was a place where the
laws of two universes were clashing against each other. Every second
here felt like an entire miserable year. Why hadn’t the almighty
Hegemon warned them about this? Most likely, he wanted to use it to
temper their hearts and wills.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
three full years went by.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait, what’s
that?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that the exit?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I think that’s the
exit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others had
been flying silently when suddenly, they all revealed looks of great
joy. They saw some light sparkling up ahead, breaking up the
monotonous darkness of the transversal conduit. It didn’t seem as
though there was anything past those sparkles of light. It seemed as
though they had reached the end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Keep flying.” They
had no other options but to fly straight towards the light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.
Whoosh. Whoosh. The five of them all flew out of the darkness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is this place?”
The five of them found themselves within a region of drifting
primordial chaos. In front of them was an enormous chaos star that
blazed like a giant ball of fire. Due to its close proximity the
surrounding area was illuminated quite brightly by this chaos star.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
turned to look behind them, only to see an enormous spatial vortex.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine there
aren’t many who would dare to enter this spatial vortex,”
Heartlord Solewind laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He himself had arrived
in the Badlands Territory by leaving the Three Realms through a
spatial vortex. There were quite a few such vortices in the Endless
Territories, but because most were naturally formed they often
contained unknown dangers. Generally speaking, cultivators wouldn’t
dare to risk their lives within one of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, there
were always those like ‘Old Man Yuan’ or Godfiend Witherspike who
would enter the vortices because they were being chased and had
nowhere else to flee. They had no choice but to flee into the most
dangerous of places.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if they made it
through and were lucky enough to survive… on the other side is the
Hegemon himself.” Prince Greatjoy sent a mental chuckle as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can you sense it,
everyone?” Skyfire Brightshore’s eyes were closed as he sent out
his senses. “It is true. Many of the prime essences in this place
are different from ours.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was attuning
himself to the local prime essences as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This place was similar
to the Endless Territories in that both had a prime essence of the
sword, a prince essence of fire, a prime essence of water, a prime
essence of lightning, a prime essence of space, and many other types
of prime essence. These prime essences were like giant stone pillars
that were holding up the entire universe they were in, and the
outermost ripples of these prime essences could be sensed and attuned
to by cultivators. In this respect, things were exactly the same as
they were in the Endless Territories!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, cultivation was a
similar process as well. However, ‘inside’ the prime essences
things were very different.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the Endless
Territories, the prime essence of the sword is more all-encompassing
and massive. In this alternate universe, the prime essence of the
sword seems to be more reserved but also more savage,” Ning mused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five of them were
all curiously attuning themselves to the local prime essences.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to our
star maps, our current location is quite a long ways off from the
Archaeus region. Let us head off, gentlemen,” Waterlord Firesurge
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, time to head
off.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our journey is a
long one. Our most important mission right now is to reach the
Archaeus region safely.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the five were
all very confident, and although their chances of reaching the
Archaeus region were quite high, they didn’t dare to be reckless.
The distance between their location and the Archaeus region truly was
quite great, as the Archaeus region was the core of this entire
alternate universe and was truly, indescribably vast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to their star
maps, it would take Ning’s group at least 1500 years to go from the
transversal conduit to the Archaeus region. They would have go to
through more than three thousand territories! World-level cultivators
would almost never be willing to take on a journey of such distances,
as it would be simply far too dangerous. Who knew when they would
perish?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It took them two months
to go to the nearest spacetime transfer array. The spacetime transfer
arrays here were quite similar to the ones in the Endless
Territories. Clearly, the two universes had very similar systems of
cultivation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Be it by flying,
teleporting, or using spacetime transfer arrays, the group advanced
through the alternate universe for more than a hundred years.
Finally, they reached a specific chaos planet that was the core of a
spacetime transfer array they had to pass through.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within a gorge on
this planet, there were a series of estates where other World-level
cultivators resided.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crackle. Pop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A figure was seated in
the lotus position by the banks of a lake, his entire body wreathed
in flames that didn’t cause any damage to the nearby mud or grass
at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A streak of light flew
towards him from afar. It was a green-haired World God who was
carrying a greataxe on his back and radiated an aura of great
strength.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five World-level
cultivators arrived,” the green-haired World God growled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? Five dared to
trespass in our territory? Do they have extraordinary backgrounds?”
The flaming figure asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They should be
outsiders. I’ve never seen them before,” the green-haired World
God said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Never seen them
before? Mm. We should know all of the World-level cultivators in the
ten or so territories around us. If we don’t know them… they must
have come from very far away.” The flaming figure let out a hoarse
chuckle. “Inform the other leaders. Begin our preparations for
killing these outsiders. We discovered them, so I insist on getting a
full share.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,” the
green-haired World God said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“By now, we’ve
killed more than three hundred World-level cultivators. Still…
that’s not enough. We aren’t even close to our quota of a
thousand,” the flaming figure mused softly.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s squad of
five descended upon this chaos planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were able to see
the heart of the spacetime transfer array far off in the distance.
Here in this alternate universe, cultivators also used chaos nectar
and chaos jewels for bartering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Halt!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An Elder God standing
in front of a beautiful palace suddenly bellowed at them. Although
the five before him were all World-level cultivators, and although he
was merely an Elder God, he was a representative of a universe-wide
organization which dominated this entire universe, the Church of
Annihilation. Every single spacetime transfer array in this alternate
universe was governed by the Church of Annihilation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No major powers would
dare to challenge the might and prestige of the Church of
Annihilation! In this universe, the Church of Annihilation was an
utterly exalted and supreme organization!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are going to the
star of Cricket,” Heartlord Solewind said with a smile. Here in the
alternate universe, it was usually Solewind’s responsibility to
meet and speak with the locals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The spacetime
transfer array is currently under maintenance. It’ll be half a
month before it can be activated,” the Elder God said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Half a month?”
Ning and the others looked at each other, feeling quite helpless.
Spacetime transfer arrays did indeed require maintenance and repairs.
If they were not given the proper maintenance, these ancient devices
would slowly begin to break down. Ning’s group had no choice but to
leave for now. They travelled a few hundred kilometers away and
landed within a beautiful mountain valley.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s wait here
for half a month,” Heartlord solewind said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Church of
Annihilation truly is incredible. It was actually able to take
complete control over this entire alternate universe. The Endless
Territories is just one part of our own universe, but it’s still
divided up into many different organizations,” Prince Greatjoy sent
mentally. He couldn’t help but sigh. “In the Endless Territories,
more than 99% of the people belong to the Dao Alliance, but the Dao
Alliance is dispersed into many different locations. Everyone
operates independently, with some training and some fighting. As for
the spacetime transfer arrays, the local schools and sects are
allowed to run them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled as well.
The Dao Alliance was quite relaxed… but that was why Ning liked it.
It granted freedom and governed on a principle of non-governance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cultivators, by our
very nature, wish for freedom,” Solewind said. “The reason why
the Brightshore Kingdom is so unified is because the almighty Hegemon
is so strong as to completely overpower everyone else! The reason why
the Aeonians are so unified is because if they aren’t unified,
they’ll be wiped out as a race! The Dao Alliance is simply too
strong, forcing them to be unified if they wish to survive. The
reason why those other top-tier organizations are unified is also
because they are few in number. They can’t not be unified.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And this alternate
universe?” Firesurge asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was curious as
well. “For this universe to be completely unified is truly
inconceivable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Absolutely.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five of them were
all extraordinary figures. In the future, if they worked hard in
their cultivation, they would become truly monstrous Daolords. They
were all very proud individuals, but they felt the utmost of
admiration and awe towards this organization which had dominated and
unified an entire universe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five of them
continued to wait there quietly, drinking while chatting. But of
course, when they discussed sensitive matters they sent mental
messages to each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Their faces
tightened at the exact same instant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world around them
changed as countless roaring waves came crashing out towards them in
an apocalyptic scene. The waves swept straight towards the five of
them, and at the edges of the endless waves there were a number of
World-level cultivators who were riding the waves forward. They
stared at Ning’s group of five, their eyes filled with murderous
intentions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve just been
waylaid.” Ning’s group knew what was happening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder brothers, let
me handle these waves.” Firesurge was dressed in deep blue robes
and his face was grim and cold. He was quite humble when speaking to
Ning and the other three, but he was filled with nothing besides icy
contempt towards these attacking cultivators. He waved his hand.
BOOM! A ring of seemingly ordinary black water began to spread out in
every direction around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ring of black water
was able to easily defend against the roaring waves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ‘Empyrean
Divine Water Formation’ we set up using 109 World-level cultivators
was blocked with such ease?” The attackers were all horrified and
shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” Firesurge
let out a cold snort, and the roaring waves of water suddenly were
pushed backwards, causing the entire formation to collapse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was only meant to
bind and capture them anyhow. If we can’t capture them, we will
just kill them.” A golden-winged World God issued mental orders to
the others. Although he could tell that Firesurge wasn’t an easy
person to deal with, he was very confident in his groups abilities.
Given their overwhelming advantage in numbers, he truly felt no
concern whatsoever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The awe-inspiring horde
of World-level cultivators suddenly switched to a different
formation, causing blurry light to spread out amongst their ranks.
All of them were now reinforced by the formation they were using, and
they charged towards Ning’s group.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They really are
courting death.” Prince Greatjoy let out a cold laugh as he slapped
out with his left hand. His left palm instantly expanded to become
thirty thousand meters in size, and it emanated an aura of dazzling
golden light. This dazzling golden palm moved terrifyingly fast as
spacetime twisted and distorted in front of it. It was clearly quite
far away from the attackers, but it somehow appeared directly in
front of them in an instant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Every
single World-level cultivator touched by the golden palm was reduced
to dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that a Daolord?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That has to be a
Daolord!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What the hell is
going on? He clearly has the aura of a World God.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s actually a
Daolord pretending to be a World God!” The attackers were instantly
scared silly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skyfire Brightshore let
out a laugh. “There are quite a few attackers. Let me handle them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“GWAAAR!” Skyfire
opened his mouth and let out a loud, furious roar as flames began to
belch forth. The flames instantly covered the entire area and began
blasting out in every direction. It must be understood that although
Prince Greatjoy was very strong, each of his palm-strikes was only
able to kill roughly ten or so World-level cultivators at once. This
ring of fire, however, spread out in every direction. There was no
way for anyone to run at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahhhhh!” Some of
the weaker Chaos Immortals were instantly burnt into dust. Even the
World Gods with weaker bodies were burnt to ashes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Run away
immediately!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These five
World-level cultivators are way too strong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are probably
all transcendent World Gods!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why is our luck such
shit?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the strongest
World Gods, along with ones who had access to decent protective
divine abilities, were able to endure the roaring flames. Just over
twenty of them were able to survive and quickly began to flee in
every direction. Although some of them were incredibly strong, they
no longer wished to continue this fight against Ning’s group.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded as he
watched. The flames which Skyfire Brightshore had unleashed seemed to
be slightly more powerful than his Chaos-level [Novessence Thunder]
technique had been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Skyfire, let me give
you a hand.” Ning let out a chuckle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seven streaks of Dao
lightning and seven streams of Dao water instantly spread out to
cover an area of a million kilometers, catching all of the fleeing
World Gods within their area of effect. The Dao lightning and the Dao
water were simply too fast; there was no way for them to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lightning and water
all transformed into enormous greatswords that danced through the
skies. The entire region of a million kilometers became transformed
into an enormous domain of chaotic might. The terrifyingly powerful
sword-intent filling this domain tore at the bodies of every single
World God, resulting in many of them ground to dust by the clashing
and grinding power of the lightning sword-intent and water
sword-intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like an enormous
millstone had ground them to bits!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Yin-Yang Sword
Domain, at maximum power, was something which quickly cause even
Daolords of the First Step to perish! Even if Ning expanded the zone
to cover an area of a million kilometers, Daolords of the First Step
would still suffer very heavy injuries, to say nothing of these
World-level cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth,
your domain truly is formidable. Let me finish the stragglers.”
Heartlord Solewind let out a laugh, then turned his gaze to the two
World Gods who had made it very far away and were still struggling to
flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why are they this
powerful?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even our
transcendent World Gods were wiped out?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“B-but…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where the hell did
these five come from?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two World Gods who
had managed to survive the Yin-Yang Sword Domain were terrified
senseless by now. Of the two, one was a transcendent World God while
the other was merely a supreme World God. The one thing they shared
in common was that both had incredibly powerful protective divine
abilities. There was no way for them to actually escape the domain
itself, but their bodies were tough enough to let them survive for a
moment longer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is going-….”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha… death,
sweet death! Once I die, I’ll have no more worries.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two World Gods
simultaneously fell to the ground, completely lifeless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartlord Solewind’s
lips curved upwards slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those two were both
elite World Gods, but you were able to make them both commit suicide,
Solewind. Admirable, admirable.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They were utterly
terrified and driven to the brink of despair by your attacks, my
friends. That’s why it was so easy for me to deal with them.”
Heartlord Solewind smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the other
three, however, were still shocked by what had happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ability to force a
World God to commit suicide? Although the four of them were
impressive, none of them were capable of such a thing. True
Heartforce Cultivators really were terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five of them
quickly cleaned up the battlefield, getting rid of the corpses and
dividing up the spoils.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These World-level
cultivators weren’t bad. They were fairly strong.” Prince
Greatjoy frowned. “There were actually more than ten supreme World
Gods and three or four transcendent World Gods! It doesn’t really
make sense for there to have been that many transcendent World Gods,
does it?”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 28 – The Reason
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The alternate
universe is fairly similar to our own.” Ji Ning also felt that
something was off. “Logically speaking, less than one in a thousand
World Gods would have reached a transcendent level of power. For this
group of a hundred World-level cultivators to have so many supreme
World Gods and three or four transcendent World Gods doesn’t make
sense. Where the hell did they come from?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the other four
had effortlessly dominated the group, not giving them any chance to
fight back before perishing. Thus, Ning’s group was only able to
come to a general approximation regarding how strong they were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me take a look.”
Skyfire Brightshore immediately soared into the skies, then cast his
gaze down upon the entire chaos planet as his eyes blazed with fire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm. Let me take a
look on the other side of the chaos planet.” The chaos planet was a
sphere, and on the other side of the planet they ended up finding a
large number of estates.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They should be
residing in that place.” Solewind cast his gaze downwards. “And…
I see quite a few restrictive formations. There’s no way to use
godsense to scan the place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We killed 126
World-level cultivators, but there are nearly 150 estates there.”
Ning frowned. “Are there still others?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if there are,
they would’ve fled,” Prince Greatjoy said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This guess was correct.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A group of nineteen
World-level cultivators were hiding within an empty part of the
primordial chaos. All of them had ugly looks on their faces as they
traded glances. In their eyes could be seen both terror and joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank goodness we
were responsible for keeping watch over the headquarters.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That was
terrifying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All those life
tablets went poof in an instant. None of them survived!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When they thought back
to the sight of all those life tablets shattering at the same
instant, they couldn’t help but be seized by terror once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The World-level
cultivators had all left behind life tablets so that the others would
know if they were alive or not. Just now, when this group had been
convening in their headquarters, they realized to their astonishment
that a total of 126 life tablets had shattered apart in the same
instant. Even the life tablets of the terrifyingly strong
transcendent World Gods who they had dreaded were quickly shattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had been a complete
massacre!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they didn’t
personally witness the battle, the wholesale annihilation of the life
tablets was enough for them to guess at what had happened. They had
been so terrified that they immediately fled from their headquarters
and used a spatial teleportation to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Some of them had
extremely powerful protective divine abilities. Logically speaking,
even if they were attacked by Daolords they would’ve merely been
captured and drawn into magic treasures to be slowly ground down.
But… all those life tablets shattered in almost the blink of an
eye.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What the hell did
they run into?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those five
World-level cultivators… was a major power hiding amongst their
ranks?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lucky survivors
speculated wildly, but were unable to go beyond speculation. They
would never dare to return to that place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, just like that
this formidable local organization disappeared, never to be heard of
again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This group of
World-level cultivators truly had been quite powerful. Unfortunately,
they had run into Ning’s group of five. These five were the most
freakishly talented of the freakishly talented. Anyone besides the
five of them would’ve found it extremely difficult to deal with
this group.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For fear that this
matter might have unexpected repercussions, Ning’s group decided to
temporarily hide within a vacant region of primordial chaos as Prince
Greatjoy stealthily investigated the matter. “Given my abilities,
not even Daolords would be able to detect my actions unless they are
even stronger than I am in the Dao of Spacetime.” In terms of
mastery over spacetime, Prince Greatjoy’s level of expertise was
superior to even that of many Daolords of the Second Step who
specialized in the Dao of Spacetime.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for those who
weren’t particularly skilled? Not even Daolords of the Fourth Step
would be able to discover any traces of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was why the Dao of
Spacetime was such a terrifying Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing seems to be
happening whatsoever. It seems as though that was nothing more than
an ordinary robbery attempt.” Bandits were common in every
universe, and there were many within the Brightshore Kingdom as well.
Even in the Endless Territories, there were World-level cultivators
who delighted in waylaying and robbing others. This was the fastest
way of acquiring treasures, a way far faster and safer than
adventuring in ruins left behind by Daolords. A sufficiently prepared
ambush was far safer than adventuring in unexplored regions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time slowly flowed on.
Ning’s group continued to advance, behaving even more cautiously
than before as they moved through one territory after another.
Despite that, they still suffered yet another ambush.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even though they were
moving with extreme caution, they had suffered two consecutive
ambushes in a row. As for the results were… there were no surprises
whatsoever. Anyone who dared to ambush Ning’s group was absolutely
courting death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three World Gods were
swept away by an enormous wave of water and smashed violently upon
the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The earth shuddered and
split apart from the force of the collision. The three World Gods
hurriedly rose to their feet, then stared in terror at the five
World-level cultivators who were slowly descending upon them from the
skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are
terrifyingly strong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“W-way too strong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can World Gods
be this strong?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eyes of the three
World Gods were filled with terror. They would never forget what they
had just seen. That terrifying finger-art… every single wave of the
finger had caused World-level cultivators to perish. That terrifying
wave… it had crushed more than half of them to death in an instant.
As for the ones who wanted to flee, they were slain by crashing bolts
of lightning. In the end, only the three of them had managed to
survive, and only because their foes let them live.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did they
realize that it was possible for World-level cultivators to reach
such a level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can continue to
live,” Prince Greatjoy said coldly, “But you have to do as I
say.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Y-y-yes.” The
three World Gods hurriedly nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swear a lifeblood
oath that you will never divulge what happened today to anyone. In
addition, swear that you will honestly answer any questions we ask
you,” Prince Greatjoy ordered grimly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The three
World Gods didn’t even think about fighting back or arguing as they
all obediently swore the lifeblood oaths. All three of them were
dressed in gray armored robes. Normally, these gray-robed cultivators
were viewed as nightmares by other cultivators, but today they were
filled with the utmost of reverence towards their captors. They put
away their gray armored robes and lowered their heads, for fear of
offending the five before them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why did you attempt
to waylay us?” Prince Greatjoy asked as Ning and the others
watched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There were only five
of you, and all of you were World-level cultivators. We thought you’d
be easy to deal with.” A skinny man with a long beard hurried to be
the first to respond.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No other reasons?
You were going to kill us just because we were easy targets?”
Prince Greatjoy was puzzled, and he swept his gaze across the other
two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That is the case.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three all
immediately nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
exchanged a glance. This was the third time they had been ambushed in
the past month. It must be understood that it would take them roughly
a thousand years to travel from the transversal conduit to the
Archaeus region. It would make sense for them to be ambushed once
every decade, but for them to be ambushed three times in one month
made no sense. And yet… apparently this was nothing more than a
normal attempt at highway robbery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We were ambushed
three times in one month.” Prince Greatjoy frowned. “Do you know
why?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You don’t know?”
The skinny, bearded World God looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak!” Prince
Greatjoy’s eyes lit up, as did the eyes of Ning and the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Because of Nine
Godstars,” the prisoner said hurriedly. “Nine Godstars has
already formally announced its criteria for accepting new disciples.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
exchanged a glance. Nine Godstars was an extremely large
organization.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They only accept
World-level cultivators as new members, and you have to have
personally slain at least a thousand other World-level cultivators
before you are qualified to join them,” the bearded man said. “Once
news of this spread, not only did this cause an enormous stir in the
eighteen territories next to Nine Godstars, it also caused a stir in
hundreds of nearby territories! Many extremely powerful World-level
cultivators began to furiously hunt down and kill down other
World-level cultivators. It has been an absolute massacre. Weaker
cultivators like us have nowhere to hide, and so we have to join
together in large numbers to stay safe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? You have to
kill a thousand World-level cultivators in order to become a member
of the sect?” Skyfire Brightshore was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s a bit
crazy.” Heartlord Solewind frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This entrance
requirement…” Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To kill a thousand
World-level cultivators was an extremely difficult. Even enslaved,
oathbound World-level slaves were only willing to serve because it
gave them a chance to stay alive! If a master insisted on slaying his
slaves, the slave would probably go all-out in fighting back. If the
slave was going to die no matter what, he would generally prefer to
die fighting. When Daolord Windsource was about to die, his slaves
would often curse and berate him as they no longer had anything to
fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if you were an
extremely powerful cultivator… after many battles, some unexpected
variables might occur. You might’ve worked hard to kill several
hundred cultivators, only to end up dead in ditch for some reason.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To actually kill a
thousand would be very, very difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nine Godstars is the
number one sect within hundreds of territories, after all.” Next to
the bearded man was an extremely muscular World God dressed in scale
armor. He said hurriedly, “Nine Godstars has nine major branches,
and each branch is led by a major power who is at the Verge of the
Daomerge. As for its most powerful expert, that person is ranked as
one of the elite Paladins of the Church of Annihilation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group knew all
this. The Church of Annihilation was in control of this entire
alternate universe and was an utterly enormous organization. The
‘Paladins’ of the Church of Annihilation held high positions and
were extremely respected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nine Godstars will
only be accepting eighteen disciples this time,” the scaled World
God said hurriedly. “They’ll stop once the final slot is taken! I
hear that the top three will be given Archaeus medallions and be sent
to the legendary Archaeus region.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Archaeus
medallions?” Ning and the others were all intrigued.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Archaeus medallions
were extremely valuable. The almighty Hegemon had sent his will
through the transversal conduit and used many schemes but had only
been able to accumulate a few of those medallions over the course of
countless years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s why
everyone in the surrounding territories has gone mad. Not only will
they have a chance of becoming a disciple, they’ll even have a
chance of gaining a legendary Archaeus medallion. All of the
transcendent World-level cultivators in the nearby territories have
all hastened over here. There’s nowhere for weaker World Gods like
us to run.” The bearded man shook his head. “That’s why you’ll
encounter ambushes throughout these territories. Most likely, it’ll
only come to an end after Nine Godstars accepts its eighteenth and
final disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, Ning’s group
had an answer as to why there was such a high concentration of
powerful cultivators. It was because the weaker ones had all been
killed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ones still alive
were fairly strong, and some had actually hastened to this place from
other territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If they knew that
all five of us each hold an Archaeus medallion… I can’t even
imagine how many World Gods would come to surround and attack us.
There might even be Daolords coming for us.” Skyfire Brightshore
sent an amused mental message to the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, we definitely
can’t let them find out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that they knew the
reason behind this… they still felt some pressure, but they also
felt much more relaxed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though
we will often be attacked over the next century or so,” Prince
Greatjoy sent. “Everyone, let’s not be too reckless. The mighty
Nine Godstars sect is behind this matter. If we attract the attention
of their experts, we will be doomed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning and
the others all nodded.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 29 – Adventures
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the others
were very careful. However, the Nine Godstars sect had sent out
dozens of Daolords of the First Step to keep watch over the place,
with the goal of preventing some truly dazzlingly talented
World-level cultivators from being surrounded, trapped, and killed.
These Daolords had all broken through via usage of Pseudo Samsara
Pills.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These Daolords of the
First Step were scattered across the local territories, keeping a
secret look out for particularly dazzling and talented World-level
cultivators. If they found one, they would be permitted to return to
the sect in advance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When roaming, they
would actively emanate their Samsara Daolord auras, making it so that
the World-level cultivators would not dare to act against them. There
was a significant difference in power between them and Samsara
Daolords, after all! Ji Ning, for example, would probably be merely a
match for Daolords of the First Step if he was relying solely on his
sword-arts. It was thanks to the azureflower mist energy
strengthening his body and making it comparable to a Daolord’s that
he was able to rise above them in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Firesurge, Greatjoy,
and the others had their own divine abilities and secret arts as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking, it
was very difficult to rely on mere divine abilities to defeat those
at a completely different level. The [Fogstone Apocalypse] was a very
good example of a divine ability that didn’t qualify! Only some
truly, devastatingly powerful divine abilities would do the trick,
such as the [Five Seals Sword Dao] of Emperor Mirrorsnow. Alas, there
was no way for Ning to use it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mighty divine
abilities, secret arts, powerful innate gifts like Skyfire’s,
supportive techniques like Ning’s azureflower mist energy… this
was what was needed, along with ridiculously profound insights into
the Dao, for a World-level cultivator to be able to slay a Daolord of
the First Step! And of course, not even the likes of Bertulu would be
able to slay a Daolord of the Second Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, it was generally
quite safe for Daolords of the First Step to be used to patrol most
territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, the Nine
Godstars sect naturally would keep this type of mission a secret.
Those World-level cultivators all believed that the only way to
succeed was by killing a thousand of their peers, which was why they
remained as berserk as ever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sixteen years after
they entered the sphere of influence of the Nine Godstars sect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were in an empty part of space. They exchanged glances with each
other, their faces grim.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greatjoy, you were a
bit rash this time.” Heartlord Solewind had a rather ugly look on
his face as he stared at the magic treasures and suits of armor
floating in front of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We had no other
options! When we refused to follow that Daolord of the First Step, he
tried to abduct us by force. You know that we cannot reveal our true
identities.” Prince Greatjoy had an ugly look on his face as well
as he spoke mentally to the other four. “We lied to him and told
him that we are members of other sects, but he completely ignored us.
We had no choice but to kill him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We killed a Daolord
of the Nine Godstars sect. Even though he was merely a Daolord of the
First Step… I’m sure that the Nine Godstars sect has already
found out and is sending people to investigate.” Firesurge was
worried as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Skyfire both
had solemn looks on their faces as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What were they to do?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The actual killing had
been quite enjoyable. That Daolord of the First Step had been
courting death, acting and speaking in such a dominating manner
towards them. Any of the five were capable of slaughtering that
Daolord! But in the end, it had been Prince Greatjoy who punched out
with a fist and completely crushed him to death!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We had no other
options, but don’t worry,” Prince Greatjoy sent. “Although the
Nine Godstars sect would immediately be notified of his death, it’ll
take them some time for their investigators to be sent out and to
arrive at this place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And… they can
forget about discovering anything.” Prince Greatjoy’s eyes were
as cold as ice. “Give me one hour. I will completely scramble
spacetime here and make it impossible for them to invert the flow of
time, unless they bring someone who is ten times more skilled than
myself in the Dao of Spacetime.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning and
the others felt stunned. Right. Greatjoy had reached a tremendously
high level of skill in the Dao of Spacetime. If he was to scramble
spacetime in the surrounding area, it would be difficult for even the
Nine Godstars sect to find out what had happened here. At the very
least, it would buy them some time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ugh. They had been
doing their best to be low-key, but it was impossible for them to
completely avoid showing at least part of their true power when they
had to deal with so many ambushes. In addition, they had no idea that
there were Daolords patrolling about in secret. In the end, one of
them actually chased the five of them down. The five didn’t dare to
actually go visit the Nine Godstars sect, as once their identities
were revealed they would quite possibly face annihilation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group
destroyed all the evidence at the scene and scrambled spacetime, then
transformed into different appearances. They even summoned quite a
few World-level retainers and servants from their estate-worlds, then
continued to venture forth in a nine-cultivator squad.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Things happened just as
they had predicted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughly two years
later, a Daolord of the Third Step from the Nine Godstars sect
arrived in the place where they had slain the first Daolord. Given
how powerful the Nine Godstars sect was, for them to calculate where
their Daolord had died was an easy task! But of course, to actually
divine the identity of the killer was virtually impossible. When
World God Northrest had died, there had been no way for Vastheaven
Palace to divine who had done it. They had to have more variables to
work with in order to lower the difficulty of the Numerancy
divination.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spacetime has been
scrambled here.” When the Daolord of the Third Step sought to
reverse the flow of time and see what had happened, all he saw was a
field of completely distorted and chaotic spacetime. There was no way
to investigate at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Did that servant of
mine offend a major power who was skilled in the Dao of Spacetime?”
The Daolord murmured to himself, “Perhaps my servant offended him,
resulting in my servant being killed… and yet, that major power did
not wish to become an enemy of our Nine Godstars sect… and so he
scrambled spacetime here?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolords who walked the
Dao of Spacetime were notoriously tough to deal with. When this
Daolord of the Third Step realized that spacetime had been completely
scrambled here, he couldn’t help but feel sour about this matter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, the Nine
Godstars sect was still the most dominating force in the hundreds of
nearby territories. How could they possibly just let this matter come
to an end?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, if they wanted
to get to the bottom of this matter they would have to invite a true
master of the Dao of Spacetime to head out from their headquarters
and investigate in person. The entire sect, however, only had two
Daolords who were skilled in the Dao of Spacetime. One was a Daolord
of the Second Step, while the other was a venerable figure who had
reached the Verge of the Daomerge and was the third most respected
figure of the entire sect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daolord of the
Second Step wasn’t willing to take the risk, whereas there was no
one capable of giving orders to the Verge-level Daolord. Thus, more
than a hundred years passed before the latter finally decided to head
out and take a look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s this?!”
When this mighty Daolord unscrambled spacetime, he was immediately
shocked and stunned by what he discovered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five World-level
cultivators? One of them attacked and slew a Daolord of the First
Step with a single blow?” This Daolord was stunned. “Where the
hell did these freaks come from? Although I wasn’t able to see how
strong the other four were, this one is incredibly strong. And…
judging from how he scrambled spacetime, he has to be an extremely
skilled master of the Dao of Spacetime.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where the hell did
they come from?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not even the entire
Nine Godstars sect had a single disciple who was this freakishly
talented!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no way for
him to know, of course, that this man was an honorary disciple of an
almighty Hegemon in a different universe and one of the most elite
members of the Brightshore Kingdom. The Nine Godstars sect was
nothing compared to the Brightshore Kingdom! It must be understood
that the Brightshore Kingdom had entire squads of freakishly strong
Daolords who were comparable to Eternal Emperors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have to find and
recruit this person into our Nine Godstars sect. I’ll chase him
down!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He gave the order, and
the entire Nine Godstars sect sprang into action. He truly would have
loved to take on such a freakishly talented disciple. He himself
walked the Dao of Spacetime, and it was incredibly rare for him to
encounter someone of such talent who walked his Dao. Alas, by this
point in time Ning’s group of five had long ago escaped from the
Nine Godstars sect’s sphere of influence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nine Godstars sect
was extremely influential in their local cluster of several hundred
territories, but beyond that their influence and power dropped
rapidly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aside from their
slaying of that Daolord of the First Step, Ning’s group encountered
another extremely dangerous situation during their journey. Ning’s
group accidentally ran into a nation of special lifeforms that was
wandering the primordial chaos. That nation of special lifeforms was
actually established atop the shell of an utterly enormous turtle,
and the turtle-like creature was clearly in a state of hibernation,
slumbering as it drifted through the void of space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This part of the
journey should’ve been a safe one. Who would’ve thought that
they’d run into such an unusual nation? Ning’s group ran into
this nation by accident, and they were immediately attacked by one of
those special lifeforms which sought to eat them alive. Ning’s
group was forced to fight back, which only attracted the attention of
even more of those special lifeforms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, that giant
slumbering turtle did not wake up. Ning and the others all had the
feeling that the turtle’s aura was utterly terrifying. Once it woke
up, it would be incredibly easy for it to kill all five of them. No
matter what they would’ve tried, they still probably wouldn’t
have been able to survive the slumbering turtle’s attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, Ning and
the others joined forces and managed to just barely escape. From
start to finish, they didn’t dare to actually kill so much as a
single one of those special lifeforms, for fear of stirring the
hornet’s nest and waking that giant turtle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aside from the Nine
Godstars sect and the titanic turtle, the other problems they
encountered were largely irrelevant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Archaeus region.
We’ve finally arrived.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group of five
stood in the air, staring off into the distance. In front of them was
a region filled with countless roiling clouds that flickered with
violet light. This gigantic region covered by clouds was the Archaeus
region! But of course, this was nothing more than the tip of the
iceberg, a miniscule part of the massive, actual region. None of them
even knew exactly how far off the Archaeus region stretched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After journeying for
1605 years, Ning’s group had finally reached the Archaeus region.
