Chapter 1 - The Senior Apprentice of the Daofather
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Distorted rainbow light
could be seen coming from within the torn-open void corridor. The
white-robed Lord Jiang led Ji Ning, the Whitewater Hound, and Little
Qing in moving through this void corridor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning suddenly
revealed a look of surprise, and the nearby Whitewater Hound and
Little Qing stared in shock as well. This was because this void
corridor’s colors were fluctuating from fiery red that made it look
like a tunnel of fire to a watery blue that made it seem as though
they were moving through a tunnel of water…and despite flying
through this corridor for enough time to boil a kettle of tea, they
were still flying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Jiang,”
Ning immediately asked, “Why have we been flying through this void
corridor for so long? Can it be that it normally takes this long to
fly through a torn open void tunnel?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” The
white-robed Lord Jiang shook his head. “Normally, to leave a major
world, after you rip open the fabric of space you can easily leave
the world and enter the infinite void, then use a Greater Teleport
and easily arrive at your destination. But the place we are headed to
is Master’s Tristar Crescent Abode, the most mysterious place in
the entire Three Realms. Ordinary techniques are completely useless
in going to Master’s place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Ning nodded
slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not the person
controlling this void tunnel right now; it is Master who is guiding
us in,” the white-robed Lord Jiang said. “Through this void
tunnel, we can directly access the Tristar Crescent Abode.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How much longer?”
Ning look at the void tunnel surrounding him; it had just turned into
a completely pitch-black color. The pitch-black tunnel was twisted
and distorted as it spiraled forward, causing Ning to feel a vague
sense of fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He felt as though if he
were to be wrapped up into the distorted space, he would be ground to
death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Soon, soon,” Lord
Jiang said with a laugh. Just as his words came out…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! A misty world
suddenly appeared in front of the void tunnel. The white-robed Lord
Jiang, Ji Ning, and the others flew out into the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here we are!” Lord
Jiang stood there in midair, a look of delight on his face. He smiled
as he swept the misty world with his gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…this is the
Tristar Crescent Abode?” Ji Ning stared downwards. What he saw was
an infinitely vast world with many cities. He could tell just by
looking downwards how vast this world was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Jiang said, “This
is the world which Master established. In terms of size, it’s
comparable to the world of the Grand Xia.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Comparable to the
Grand Xia?” Ning, the Whitewater Hound, and Little Qing all nodded
to themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning asked, “So the
Patriarch personally established this world? According to the
legends, formidable figures of the Three Realms are able to establish
some smaller worlds of a few tens of thousands of kilometers…but
it’s actually possible to establish a world comparable to the world
of the Grand Xia in size as well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…the world of
the Primordial Era was established by Pangu. Compared to the various
‘major worlds’, it was unfathomably larger,” the white-robed
Lord Jiang said, shaking his head and laughing. “Although Master
cannot do as Pangu did, he’s still able to establish an
estate-world that is comparable to the Grand Xia in size.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This estate-world is
completely separate from the outside world. It has its own cycle of
reincarnation, and a miniature Netherworld Kingdom. After dying, the
souls of the world will be reborn into this world anew,” Lord Jiang
said with a laugh. “This estate world is actually a miniature
version of the Primordial World of Pangu; it is completely outside
the structure of the Three Realms. Thus, not even other major powers
can enter it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, the Whitewater
Hound, and Little Qing were all secretly stunned. Completely outside
the structure of the Three Realms…a completely stand-alone cycle of
reincarnation…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Major powers truly were
incredible!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mount Innerheart is
at the very center of this estate-world.” Lord Jiang pointed
towards the distance. “Right over there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, the Whitewater
Hound, and Little Qing all raised their heads to look. Indeed, they
could vaguely make out the outlines of a mountain that was hovering
in the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” The
white-robed Lord Jiang led Ning and the others to fly out. The
hovering mountains grew closer and closer, and one could even make
out the fairy cranes and running beasts around it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Lord Jiang, Ji
Ning, and the others flew to the very top of the mountain, landing
atop a mountain path. “If we follow this path to the very top, we
shall reach the place where Master trains in the Dao and teaches his
disciples,” the white-robed Lord Jiang said. Ning and the others
followed him upwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The mountain path
winded up the mountain, but fortunately there were stone steps to
walk on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After walking a short
while, the white-robed Lord Jiang turned and moved onto a
well-trodden pathway that led into a mountain forest. “Ji Ning,
come with me to meet our eldest apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eldest
apprentice-brother?” Ning felt slightly puzzled, but he followed
the white-robed Lord Jiang deep into the forest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was the very
first to follow Master. You absolutely must not be disrespectful to
him,” the white-robed Lord Jiang said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded. As he walked forward, he could just barely make out a voice
speaking out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A one, a two, a
three and a four. A five and a six, a seven and an eight, a nine and
a ten…now fall down!” As the bright voice rang out, a ‘crunch’
sound could be heard, followed by a rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Lord
Jiang and Ning moved quite quickly. As they moved closer to the sound
of the voice, they saw an enormous tree fall down. Through the other
trees, Ning could just barely make out the figure of a woodcutter
dressed in grass shoes and a grass hat. The woodcutter’s skin was
swarthy and dark, but he was dressed quite simply.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Lord
Jiang walked over. “Eldest-apprentice brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eldest
apprentice-brother?” Ning was flabbergasted. This woodcutter? He
was their eldest apprentice-brother?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woodcutter in front
of him appeared very ordinary and was dressed in a very ordinary
manner as well. Ning’s judgment was quite astute by now, but no
matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t see anything special about
the tattered grass shoes or raggedy clothes; they seemed to be
ordinary clothes, not magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And…no matter how
hard he tried, he couldn’t sense any presence or aura stemming from
this woodcutter at all. In fact, Ning didn’t even feel the
slightest hint of danger emanating from him. No matter from what
angle Ning inspected him, this woodcutter seemed like an ordinary
mortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” The
woodcutter rested his hatchet over his shoulder, straightened his
waist, then turned and said with a laugh, “Haha, so it’s Lord
Jiang. Why have you come to my place?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Per Master’s
orders, I went to the world of the Grand Xia to bring our junior
apprentice-brother. I’m back now, and I thought I’d bring him
over to see you, senior apprentice-brother,” the white-robed Lord
Jiang said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother?” The woodcutter looked at Ning, looked at him
quite carefully. His gaze, however, seemed quite ordinary. It didn’t
seem to be the slightest bit penetrating.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s our junior
apprentice-brother. His name is Ji Ning, and he is currently just a
Wanxiang Adept,” the white-robed Lord Jiang said. “Ji Ning, hurry
up and pay your respects to our eldest apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, eldest
apprentice-brother,” Ning said while bowing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woodcutter laughed.
“I’m just a chopper of firewood. Still, for you to be accepted by
Master at such a young age means that Master must value you highly.
Master is very good-natured, but you still need to work hard and not
disappoint him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright, you can go
now, Lord Jiang. Take this Ji Ning to meet Master,” the woodcutter
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The
white-robed Lord Jiang immediately led Ning away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Back on the main
mountain road.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said, puzzled,
“Eldest apprentice-brother…he isn’t a mortal, is he?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he saw the likes
of Lu Dongbin and the Xia Emperor, he could clearly tell how
incredible they were. But of course, it was also possible that this
was because Lu Dongbin and the others hadn’t retracted their auras!
But this woodcutter…no matter how hard Ning tried, he couldn’t
sense even the slightest hint of cultivation about him. In fact, the
woodcutter even had calluses on his hands, and there was some white
hair on his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course not,”
Lord Jiang said. “From the Primordial Era to the present day,
Master has taken in many disciples, and there are even quite a few
True Immortals and Empyrean Gods. But in terms of power, eldest
apprentice-brother is the undisputed number one! He’s far more
powerful than the rest of us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The undisputed
number one?” Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Only, ever
since the destruction of the Primordial World, eldest
apprentice-brother has never left this world of the Tristar Crescent
Abode,” Lord Jiang said. “This is why there are very, very few
people in the Three Realms who know of him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but feel stunned. It was only after the destruction of the Primordial
World that the three thousand major worlds and the trillion minor
worlds were born. An unfathomably long period of time had passed
since the creation of the three thousand major worlds, but this
eldest apprentice-brother actually had the patience and temperament
to never roam the Three Realms? Generally speaking, powerful experts
would like to stroll about many of the places of the Three Realms.
After all, each of the trillion minor worlds had their own unique
aspects, and were quite exciting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin, for
example, liked to play around in the mortal world. He had left behind
his legacy in countless worlds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The names of many
formidable figures had been spread throughout the Three Realms. But
eldest apprentice-brother had never left after the destruction of the
Primordial World?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is his name?”
Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Woodcutter,” Lord
Jiang said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I meant his real
name. Or his Daoist title,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Real name, Daoist
title…all I know is that eldest apprentice-brother is referred to
as the woodcutter.” Lord Jiang shook his head. “I don’t know
anything else. When you are training in the Dao on the mountain, you
can come to this mountain forest to train. Perhaps he will see you
and be willing to guide you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. So the
senior disciple under Patriarch Subhuti’s tutelage was actually
such a mysterious figure. Ning was quite curious as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, Lord Jiang
brought Ning to the entrance to the cavern. The entrance had a large
stone in front of it, which had three words on it: Tristar Crescent
Abode!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By each side of the
entrance, there were two azure-robed Dao novitiates. For these two to
be assigned to Mount Innerheart meant that they were monstrously
talented figures themselves. However, here at Mount Innerheart, they
were only viewed as ordinary figures. They were already quite
delighted to be chosen as entrance guards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two novices
respectfully bowed towards Lord Jiang. Lord Jiang was a Pure Yang
True Immortal. His rank was extremely high!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Lord Jiang
nodded, then brought Ning, the Whitewater Hound, and Little Qing
through the entrance. The two novices naturally did not bar his way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They continued to walk
forward into the cavern.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The insides of this
Tristar Crescent Abode was quite beautiful and graceful. It had all
sorts of fairy cranes and animals. Their auras were all retracted and
hidden, but despite that Ning could still sense a tremendous degree
of threat and power emanating from them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The aura of the Tristar
Crescent Abode itself was quite calm and peaceful. The various beasts
and Diremonsters didn’t have even a hint of a baleful, savage aura
at all. They seemed extraordinary docile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When the Patriarch
takes on disciples, he doesn’t care about their birth or lineage.
Thus, aside from humans, even many monsters and Fiendgods have come
to learn the Dao from him,” Lord Jiang said with a laugh. “The
Patriarch has a particular rule; anyone who comes to Mount Innerheart
is forbidden from fighting with the other disciples. If any disciple
dares to assault another, the Patriarch will immediately intervene to
suppress the fight and shatter his soul!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter who! Even
I am not permitted to act against those various younger generation
disciples. If I do, then Master will kill me as well,” Lord Jiang
said. “This is an iron rule that no one can violate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. No wonder
the aura here was so peaceful. So all types of battle were completely
forbidden. The Patriarch himself was at the top of the mountain. Who
would dare act wildly?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They continued to walk
forward. On the path upwards, they heard various greetings, such as
‘Patriarch’, ‘uncle-master’, ‘uncle-master’, ‘Patriarch’,
and more. Clearly, Lord Jiang’s status was very high.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master is inside.”
Lord Jiang pointed to an ordinary-looking Daoist monastery up ahead.
There were two more Dao novitiates standing in front of the
monastery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle-master, the
Patriarch instructed us long ago that Ji Ning can be brought straight
to him. There’s no need for any report to be made,” one of the
novitiates said with a smile.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 2 - The Status of Daoist Threelives
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two
spirit-beasts should wait here for now,” the Dao novitiate
instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Little
Qing and Uncle White both obediently stood to one side, waiting
silently. Both of them knew quite well that the person within this
Daoist monastery was an awe-inspiringly famous supreme power of the
Three Realms, Patriarch Subhuti.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” The
white-robed Lord Jiang led Ning directly into the monastery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White, Master
is going to go meet a Daofather. I feel like I’m dreaming.”
Little Qing’s eyes were filled with excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
nodded gently as well. He, too, was still in a state of shock. That
little child who had trained in the sword and in archery by his
side…he was actually about to become an apprentice to a major
power, Patriarch Subhuti. “A person’s fate truly is
unfathomable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the monastery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was an empty
region filled with many prayer mats. In front of this empty region,
there was an elevated platform, atop which there was another prayer
mat. On this elevated prayer mat, there was a skinny, white-bearded
elder. This skinny elder was dressed in loose robes. He was seated in
the lotus position, and he emanated an aura that caused others to
feel at peace in their heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He is Patriarch
Subhuti?” Upon seeing this white-bearded elder, Ning couldn’t
help but secretly feel nervous. This was a truly major power, a power
that had even killed other Fiendgod Daofathers, a power that was
acclaimed as the most mysterious Daofather of the Three Realms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How could Ning not feel
nervous in front of such a person?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, I’ve
brought Ji Ning over,” Lord Jiang said with great respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I bow in respect to
you, Daofather,” Ning said with great respect as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Subhuti
opened his eyes, looking at Ning. A hint of a smile appeared on his
face as he nodded gently. He then instructed Lord Jiang, “You can
leave for now. Ji Ning can stay by himself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The
white-robed Lord Jiang respectfully departed, leaving behind only
Ning and Patriarch Subhuti.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Subhuti said
with a calm smile, “No need to be nervous. Pick any prayer mat and
sit down first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning chose a
prayer mat, then sat down in the lotus position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I watched the
Conclave of Immortal Destiny of the world of the Grand Xia. Of the
participants, you, Woodpass, and the Sloppy Daoist were the most
outstanding,” Patriarch Subhuti evaluated. “Crimsonbright ended
up choosing Woodpass…and this was as I expected. In choosing
disciples, Crimsonbright cares about mindset and temperament the
most. The temperament of that Woodpass truly is most suited to him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but sigh in secret. The spirit of the underwater estate had said that
Patriarch Subhuti was very good at teaching students. Comparatively
speaking, Daofather Crimsonbright and Grand Emperor Xuanwu’s
teaching abilities were significantly lower. For even Patriarch
Subhuti to praise both Woodpass and Sloppy as excellent meant that
they truly did have potential.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But in my eyes, you
have even more potential than the other two,” Patriarch Subhuti
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt a surge of
joy in his heart. This was the very first time someone had said that
he had more potential than Sloppy and Woodpass…and the speaker was
Patriarch Subhuti!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The path of Immortal
cultivation is filled with many dangers and obstacles. Thus, with
each step, you need to leave a firm footprint as you walk forward in
a stable manner. Your heart must be stable as well. This is indeed
true,” Patriarch Subhuti said. “From this perspective, Woodpass
and Sloppy are both excellent disciples. Their foundations were the
most stable amongst the contestants in the Conclave, and their hearts
were also the most stable and calm as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…everything
in this world is divided into yin and yang,” Patriarch Subhuti
said. “Although it is important to be stable and solid, it is also
important to be sharp.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You need to be
stable, but you also need sharpness.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stability is yin,
while sharpness is yang! When yin and yang support each other, one
can walk farther on one’s path.” Patriarch Subhuti laughed. “Ji
Ning, you are far ‘sharper’ than the other two, and your
foundation is quite solid as well. Only…a disciple like you is
harder to guide and teach. It is very easy to teach disciples like
Sloppy and Woodpass. So long as you let them slowly train and slowly
adventure, they will slowly rise in power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for you…your
rate of improvement will be faster, but things will also be more
risky. Your future potential might be higher than theirs, but you
might also perish midway.” Patriarch Subhuti looked at Ning.
“Today, I shall impart a few words to you. You need to memorize
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The path of Immortal
cultivation… your goals should be distant and grand, with Pangu and
Nuwa as your models.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The path of Immortal
cultivation…it requires you to lower your head and watch the road,
for you to remember to maintain a solid foundation. Do not merely
think about soaring into the skies; when a bird soars too far, its
eggs might be stolen and destroyed. It will perish, its Dao gone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The path of Immortal
cultivation…it requires caution. It is a boat that will sail for
ten thousand years that you must control with care.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The path of Immortal
cultivation…it requires sharpness. Only with a heart that is filled
with a desire to charge into the heavens can you walk even farther on
this path.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Subhuti’s
words were simple, but they struck at the very foundation of an
Immortal cultivator’s heart and mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone summoned
before Patriarch Subhuti as a student had superb talent and
comprehensive abilities. What determined one’s accomplishments
after that…was the heart!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning shall firmly
memorize these words,” Ning said seriously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How to make your
goals grand but not too high…how to be cautious and yet have the
desire to charge into the heavens…you will need to handle this
yourself. The world is divided into yin and yang, and between yin and
yang lies the heart,” Patriarch Subhuti said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as the
Patriarch had met him, he had imparted these words. Ning understood
how important these words were, and also the principles which the
Patriarch spoke of. However…some things were easy to ‘understand’
but hard to ‘carry out’. On the path of Immortal cultivation, one
would need to constantly remind one’s self, so as to prevent one’s
self from embarking on a wrong path. These four things the Pariarch
had advised him regarding was like four signposts on the Immortal
path that would constantly remind him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Subhuti
continued to speak. “I watched the Conclave of Immortal Destiny.
You should have learned the divine ability, [Starseizing Hand].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning
admitted it. Since the Patriarch himself had said the words
[Starseizing Hand], how could he even think about hiding it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My fellow Daoist
Threelives…he finally has a true successor. His divine ability has
once more reappeared in the Three Realms!” Patriarch Subhuti let
out an emotional sigh. “Little bear, why haven’t you come out
yet?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A figure
suddenly appeared out of nowhere next to Ning. It was the giant
yellow bear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?!” Ning
realized to his astonishment that the giant yellow bear next to him
was quite solid and seemingly real, as though he were a living
creature. He didn’t seem as illusory and dreamlike as he did when
he was the spirit within the underwater estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This little bear
pays his respects to the Daofather.” The giant yellow bear fell to
his knees, pressing his forehead against the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So indeed, Ji Ning,
you managed to enter the Starseizing Manor and learned the divine
ability within it.” Patriarch Subhuti nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning revealed a
surprised look. “Patriarch, the Starseizing Manor…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby giant yellow
bear explained, “The ‘Starseizing Manor’ is the true, original
name of this underwater estate. Although the estate was left behind
by Master for his successors, it was also the estate which Master
lived in. In the past, Master would often receive his guests within
the Starseizing Manor, and even invite some Fiendgods to listen to
him expound upon the Dao.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly thought
back to the many giant prayer mats in the middle of the underwater
estate. Indeed, many people must have come to listen to lectures on
the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Subhuti said,
“The relationship between Threelives and the Starseizing Manor was
similar to the relationship between myself and the Tristar Crescent
Abode. In the past, when Threelives knew that the upcoming
tribulation would be a hard one to overcome, he made careful
preparations, adding a vast quantity of treasures into his estate. He
even melted down and extracted the essence of multiple Protocosmic
spirit-treasures and invited multiple major powers over in order to
forge it. Afterwards, he gave it up and had this little bear search
for a successor for him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I ask for your
guidance, Daofather.” The giant yellow bear pressed his head
repeatedly against the ground, his eyes brimming with tears. “Tell
this little bear…where is Master? Is he alive or is he dead?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sound of his
kowtowing rang out as he pressed his head against the ground
repeatedly. Clearly, he desperately wanted to know this answer. He
had waited countless ages for this day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thud. Thud. Thud.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing this, a
complicated look appeared on Patriarch Subhuti’s face. He was
silent for a moment, then said, “Threelives was my very best
friend…my lifelong bosom friend! We met each other in the
primordial chaos and adventured together. I was a bit more reserved,
whereas brother Threelives had a sharpness that couldn’t be hidden!
I enjoyed comprehending the cosmos and the various mysteries of the
Heavenly Daos; I didn’t involve myself in the various power
struggles of the Primordial Era. Brother Threelives, however, desired
to do battle against the heavens and the earth. He loved combat, and
he had many Fiendgods who followed his command. He carved out an
enormous territory within the Primordial World for himself, and was
referred to within it as the Godking.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Because very early
on in his training, his arm had been severed, he trained
painstakingly until he finally developed the utterly astonishing
divine ability, the [Starseizing Hand]!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True Gods of
Primordial Chaos are innately predisposed to enjoy battle. Even many
Ki Refining Daofathers are unwilling to engage in life-and-death
battles against True Gods of Primordial Chaos. After brother
Threelives developed his [Starseizing Hand] divine ability,
especially the Sixth Cycle of it, he reached an unfathomable level of
power. He was extremely famous for his power even in the Primordial
Era, and was ranked as one of the top True Gods.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Subhuti’s
gaze was rather dreamy as he slowly spoke. “However…he was unable
to comprehend a Heavenly Dao, and so his danger sense was
comparatively weaker. That great tribulation that came…it was the
greatest tribulation which had occurred ever since Pangu had
established the universe. Threelives insisted on participating in it.
I tried to stop him, but he was filled with a desire to fight; he
wasn’t willing to shrink back. He knew that it would be incredibly
dangerous…but his hot-blooded nature made him decide on going.
Before leaving, he wanted to ensure that his [Starseizing Hand]
wouldn’t be lost with him, and so he asked many friends to help him
out. With their help, with his original estate as a raw material, and
with many melted down treasures, he managed to create this new
Starseizing Manor, meant to pass down his legacy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After he created the
new Starseizing Manor, the tribulation came…and without any
hesitation, he went to welcome the battle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That battle…I
shrank back from it.” Patriarch Subhuti’s gaze was misty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, hearing this,
couldn’t help but feel his heart shake. Patriarch Subhuti had
shrank back? The greatest tribulation to occur ever since Pangu had
created the universe?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That tribulation,
the greatest tribulation since Pangu had created the universe…the
very first parts of it caused the Primordial World to shatter.
Countless experts and Fiendgods fell. Figures that were even more
powerful than Threelives fell as well.” Patriarch Subhuti sighed
and shook his head. “Miserable. It was miserable. Threelives loved
battle, and so of course he took part. His divine ability, the
[Starseizing Hand], truly was one of the most supreme of grand divine
abilities; even Nuwa herself praised its power. Threelives fought
like a man possessed, and multiple Fiendgod Daofathers perished by
his hand. As for myself, I relied on the [Dream of the Three Realms]
to watch the battle; I didn’t participate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This divine ability
was forged from Threelives’ innate love for battle, as well as some
guidance from both Pangu and Nuwa. Only then was this divine ability
developed. The creation of a divine ability requires talent. Although
I have created far more divine abilities than Threelives, I’ve
never been able to create one that was comparable to the [Starseizing
Hand].” Patriarch Subhuti looked towards Ning. “For such a divine
ability to have passed down to you…no matter what, you cannot let
it sink into the dust and disappear.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded repeatedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So Daoist Threelives
had relied on the [Starseizing Hand] to kill multiple Fiendgod
Daofathers. From what Patriarch Subhuti was saying, this divine
ability truly was incredibly terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear,
however, felt his heart shake upon hearing these words. “Daofather,
my master, he…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked towards
Patriarch Subhuti as well. Was Daoist Threelives alive or dead? This
was a question that he had wanted to know for a long time as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little bear…”
Patriarch Subhuti looked at the giant yellow bear. He let out a soft
sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear’s
heart instantly trembled. His face changed, and he repeatedly pressed
his head against the ground, kowtowing so hard that deep thudding
sounds could be heard. “Please inform me, Daofather. Is Master dead
or is he alive?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little
bear…actually, in your heart, you’ve known the answer all along.
Why must you ask?” Patriarch Subhuti shook his head.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 3 - The Patriarch Accepts a Disciple
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I…” The giant
yellow bear looked at the Patriarch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He died. He died
long ago. He died within that tribulation.” The Patriarch shook his
head. “Given Threelives’ temperament, if he was still alive, how
could he not come back for you? How could he have let you drift
through countless ages by yourself? Little bear, you clearly knew the
truth…you just weren’t willing to believe it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Drip! Drip!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One teardrop after
another fell onto the ground. The giant yellow bear’s kneeling body
was shaking. He let out an agonized moan. “Nnnrragh…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The agonized cry caused
Ning’s own heart to feel sour as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master…master…master…”
The giant yellow bear raised his head, howling madly. Daoist
Threelives was like his father. Only a long time later did the
kneeling bear say, “Forgive this little bear for his earlier
outburst.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright,” the
Patriarch said, “You can go back to the Starseizing Manor. You
cannot break away from the Starseizing Manor for now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The giant
yellow bear responded respectfully, then disappeared, having once
more returned to the underwater estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning felt
moved by the depths of the feelings the spirit of the underwater
estate had for Daoist Threelives, he had noticed a few puzzling
points. Since the giant yellow bear was the spirit of the estate…why
did he seem like he was a living creature? He even shed tears? And
the Patriarch had even said that he couldn’t break away from the
Starseizing Manor yet? Could it be that he could in the future?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, given that the
spirit of the estate had already been within it for countless years
without breaking free, it probably would take it a very, very long
time before succeeding.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” The
Patriarch looked at Ning. “Threelives is dead. I will teach you the
Dao in his place. Are you willing to take me as your teacher?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately fell
to his knees. “Your disciple greets you, Master!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The Patriarch
revealed a hint of a smile. “From today onwards, you shall be one
of the honorary disciples of my school. Once you become a Celestial
Immortal after your tribulation, you shall become my personal
disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” Ning said
respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There aren’t too
many rules in my school. Just two.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One: You must not be
disobedient and unfilial.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two: Without my
permission, in the outside world you cannot say that I am your
master,” the Patriarch said. “If you violate these rules…for a
lesser infraction, I will kill you, wipe your memory, and return you
to the cycle of reincarnation. For a severe infraction, I will
destroy your soul. For an extremely severe infraction…I will make
your soul suffer an eternity of pain through truefire.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said respectfully,
“Your disciple understands. Then…when can I say that I am your
disciple?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When the time comes,
you shall naturally be permitted,” the Patriarch said with a laugh.
“Alternately, if you can reach your eldest apprentice-brother’s
level of power, you can also tell whoever you please.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
speechless. Eldest apprentice-brother? He was the number one expert
amongst the many disciples. Even the white-robed Lord Jiang sighed at
his own inferiority. How could it possibly be easy for him to reach
such a level of power?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for whether or
not you act virtuously or evilly in the future, I won’t interfere.
I only ask that you act in accordance with your true nature,” the
Patriarch said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Step forward. Come
to stand in front of me,” the Patriarch instructed. Ning was
startled, but he moved forward, moving up the steps and walking to
the Patriarch’s side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Patriarch stretched
a finger out, tapping Ning on the center of his forehead. This was a
simple tap, but it caught Ning completely off-guard. The tap landed
directly on his forehead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s entire body
turned soft. He sat down on the ground, then shut his eyes. He just
sat there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Patriarch smiled as
he looked at Ning. He then closed his own eyes as well, no longer
paying any attention.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A lonely corridor. The
two sides of the corridor were covered with paintings of various
sword-art techniques. The sword-arts in the paintings were even
moving, displaying the profound mysteries within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning walked forward
through the corridor, staring at the endless sword-arts lining the
two sides.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These sword-arts are
fairly ordinary; they aren’t even comparable to the first level of
the [Three-Foot Sword].” Ning walked forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He forgot why he had
come here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He forgot about the
past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All he knew was that he
was walking deeper and deeper through this corridor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-arts on the
two sides continuously moved about. They even managed to separate
from the walls, swirling around Ning and allowing him to understand
the mysteries within them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place…has
reached the power of the second stance of the [Three-Foot Sword].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to walk
forward. After walking for a short period of time, the sword-arts
lining the halls began to demonstrate themselves in front of Ning, as
though displaying the Dao of the Sword in fine detail. Ning had
originally thought that he had a high level of comprehension of the
Dao of the Sword, but he now realized that his insights were
insufficiently detailed! Evil…dominating…arrogant…lonely…savage…all
sorts of sword-arts were being displayed before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place…has
reached the level of the third stance of the [Three-Foot Sword].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had no idea how long
he had been walking for.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place…has
already reached the level of the seventh stance of the [Three-Foot
Sword].” Ning continued to walk forward, constantly interacting
with large amounts of marvelous sword-arts. Ning’s foundation
became increasingly solid and stable. Although he had long ago
reached the level of the seventh stance, his insights into the Dao of
the Sword were now significantly greater than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After yet another long
period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is now at the
level of the eighth stance of the [Three-Foot Sword].” Ning felt
that walking forward was becoming increasingly difficult. The
countless sword-arts around him were constantly transmitting all
sorts of profound mysteries to Ning. Ning was constantly being
buffeted by them. This made his walking pace through the corridor to
grow slower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The level of the
ninth stance of the [Three-Foot Sword].” The sword-arts became
increasingly unfathomable. Every single sword-art surrounding him was
comparable to the ninth stance of the [Three-Foot Sword], and
countless sword-arts were on display. Although Ning couldn’t
comprehend them, the fundamental mysteries of these sword-arts were
firmly imprinted onto Ning’s soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he walked forward,
the techniques vastly surpassed the [Three-Foot Sword].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If there were more
stances to the [Three-Foot Sword], then the later sword-arts were
comparable to the tenth and the eleventh stance…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was completely
submerged in the sea of swords. As he walked through the corridor,
his heart and soul was completely filled with all sorts of
sword-arts, and the increasingly unfathomable sword-arts brushed past
his heart. Although he didn’t understand them, this baptism by
countless sword-arts caused Ning to become extremely familiar with
the profound mysteries.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long, long time
passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It felt as though
thousands of years had passed. Ning finally saw the end of this
corridor. The end was an enormous, glowing streak of sword-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t know why
he was walking towards it. He didn’t know whether or not he should
stop. And so, just like that…he walked to the end of the corridor.
His body became submerged into that giant sword-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A vast flood of
mysteries flooded his soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vastness of the Dao
of the Sword…all of its mysteries…Ning was touching it all right
now. The countless sword-arts he had interacted with earlier in the
corridor also flashed through Ning’s mind, causing his heart to
become even closer to the Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly opened
his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was still seated on
the dais. Before him, seated on a prayer mat, was the loose-robed
Patriarch. The Patriarch opened his eyes, smiling as he looked at
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I…this…” Ning
stared at his surroundings. Everything felt so fake and illusory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only after a long
period of time did his three decades of memories completely recover.
The marvelous sword-arts that he had seen were now suppressed and
hidden deep in Ning’s soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, I, I…”
Ning nervously looked at the Patriarch. He felt as though thousands
of years had passed. It had taken him so long to recover his decades
of memories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s wrong?
Didn’t you just doze off?” The Patriarch laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, how long did
I sleep for?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not too long. The
amount of time for a stick of incense to burn down,” the Patriarch
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But I…I feel as
though thousands of years passed,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Patriarch said,
“All I did was apply the [Thousand Year Dream] technique to let you
truly experience the complete Dao of the Sword for once. From the
very start of the Dao of the Sword…to the very end, the completion
of the Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right. The [Thousand
Year Dream]. It truly did feel as though he had been in a dream. He
had lost almost all of his cognitive abilities; all he could do was
walk forward along the corridor in a daze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All I did was let
you sense the complete Dao of the Sword for once. Your own Dao of the
Sword hasn’t risen in level that much,” the Patriarch said. Ning,
however, knew very well that this [Thousand Year Dream] had been
tremendously beneficial to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he was still
only able to execute the seventh stance of the [Three-Foot Sword],
his understanding of the sword was now far more stable and solid than
it had been before. And as he continued to move forward on the Dao of
the Sword…he would feel a vague sense of recognition of what to do
next. In fact, he would even have a vague sense of what it felt like
to completely master the Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The path of Immortal
cultivation was akin to a blind man using his sense of touch to
search for rocks which would allow him to ford a river. Now that he
had vague understanding of the path forward…he would be able to
move through it much more quickly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Master.”
Ning immediately fell to his knees.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I just gave you a
single helping hand. How much you can make of it is up to you.” The
Patriarch pointed gently, and a streak of light flew directly into
Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense a
large amount of information pouring into his brain. Only after a long
period of time did he become clear-minded again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Darknorth
Sutra]? The four scrolls of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine
Heavens]?” Ning could sense the cultivation techniques that were
now within his soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first scroll of the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] was divided into the
Houtian, Xiantian, and Zifu levels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second scroll of
the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] was divided into the
Wanxiang, Primal, and Void levels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third scroll was
the Empyrean God scroll!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fourth scroll was
the True God scroll!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Crimsonbright
Diagram of the Nine Heavens] was created by Crimsonbright. Even Nuwa
praised this technique, and it truly is an exquisite specimen that
allows you to train all the way to the True God level,” the
Patriarch said. “As for the [Darknorth Sutra], it is a
water-element Ki Refining method that was created by Daofather
Carefree; it will allow you to train all the way to the level of
Daofathers of the Great Firmament.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One is Body
Refining, the other is Ki Refining. In the future, they shall serve
as your foundation,” the Patriarch said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning was
absolutely delighted. [Darknorth Sutra]? Something which Daofather
Carefree had created? Just from this alone, he could tell that this
was one of the most supreme Ki Refining techniques of the Three
Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the Three Realms,
Ki Refining Techniques and Body Refining Techniques aren’t that
valuable,” the Patriarch said calmly. “Divine abilities and
secret arts are much more valuable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, not even the
Grand Xia Emperor possessed techniques like the [Darknorth Sutra].
Only someone on Patriarch Subhuti’s level would dare describe it as
‘not that valuable’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Mount Innerheart
has two Dao-Palaces which contain all things within them. Formation
techniques, construct techniques, the Dao of the Sword, the Dao of
the Saber, Taiji, lightning arts, lotus arts…it includes all types
of techniques, as well as many divine abilities and secret arts. It
will be up to you to acquire them, if you can,” the Patriarch said
calmly. “The Dao cannot be casually transmitted. If you wish to
learn, then you must show the ability to learn.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple
understands,” Ning said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go, then. Calmly
focus on studying the Dao, here in my Mount Innerheart. Only when
your power is sufficient shall you be permitted to leave the mountain
and return to your world of the Grand Xia,” the Daofather said.
“And when you leave my tutelage and leave the mountain, I shall
give you two great gifts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master…at what
level will my power be ‘enough’?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When you reach it, I
will tell you,” the Patriarch said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was instantly
speechless. He was being told to study the Dao…but he didn’t even
know when he would be allowed to leave his master’s tutelage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go now,” the
Patriarch said, calmly closing his eyes. “Without my permission,
you are not to come here and disturb me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
immediately left obediently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only after Ning left
did the Patriarch open his eyes again. He gently shook his head. “How
long has it been? This is the first time I’ve ever been so
talkative in front of a disciple. When I thought of Threelives, of
that tremendous calamity we faced…my heart ended up being
disturbed.”

Chapter 4 - Divinity Palace, Three Realms Palace
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning walked out of
the Daoist monastery. Outside of it was the white-robed Lord Jiang,
Little Qing, and Uncle White.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Little
Qing had already transformed into an azure-robed maiden. She
immediately called out in delight upon seeing him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Lord
Jiang smiled as he looked at Ning. “I should now address you as
junior apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother,” Ning called out in response.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two novitiates
outside the Daoist monastery all revealed looks of surprise. The
white-robed Lord Jiang said with a laugh, “Clearwater and
Whiteriver, Master has just accepted junior apprentice-brother Ji
Ning as his disciple. The two of you need to remember this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings,
uncle-master,” the two novices both said towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning,” Lord Jiang said with a laugh,
“Clearwater and Whiteriver are the personifications of two
Protocosmic spirit-treasures who always serve him. Normally, even if
I wish to meet with Master, I must first notify him and receive his
permission, but the two of them are always by his side. They are able
to see Master far more often than disciples like ourselves.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, the Whitewater
Hound, and Little Qing were all greatly shocked. Protocosmic
spirit-treasures?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings,
apprentice-nephews.” Ning naturally didn’t dare to show any hint
of arrogance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to be so
courteous, uncle-master. We are merely two Protocosmic
spirit-treasures; it is incomparably difficult for us to even train
in cultivation. How can we possibly compare to the two of you? Your
training speed far surpasses us,” the novitiate named Clearwater
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Protocosmic Fiendgods
were the Fiendgods who had been born by the heavens and the earths
after Pangu had created the universe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Protocosmic
spirit-treasures were the magic treasures that were born by the
heavens and the earths after Pangu had created the universe!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal cultivators
were generally only capable of making Mortal-ranked, Earth-ranked,
Heaven-ranked, Immortal-ranked, and Pure Yang magic treasures! Even
major powers were only capable of creating Pure Yang magic treasures;
this was the limit for manufactured treasures. However, Pure Yang
magic treasures possess souls; they could absorb energy from the
natural world, comprehend the profound mysteries of the universe, and
have a very tiny chance of breaking through to become a Protocosmic
spirit-treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, the scenery here is quite beautiful, and it is
also quite secluded. This can be your home, here at Mount Innerheart.
Junior apprentice-brother, you can place your Immortal estate here.”
The white-robed Lord Jiang looked at Ning as they arrived within a
secluded region. Creeks could be seen nearby, as well as ripe red
spirit-fruit hanging from the branches of trees, as well as some
fairy birds flying past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “Fine.
Here it is, then.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had come to the
Tristar Crescent Abode in order to study the Dao. It didn’t really
matter where he lived. In addition, this place which Lord Jiang had
helped him choose was indeed worthy of being an abode for an
Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The Immortal
estate descended, landing upon the grassy region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mount Innerheart has
spirit-fruit and wells. You can eat and drink from them as you
please,” Lord Jiang said. “There are many Diremonsters in this
mountain, but you must remember that they cannot be killed. Those
ordinary animals that are merely at the Houtian level, however, can
be hunted, cooked, and eaten.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can only eat
ordinary animals?” Little Qing was mumbling by herself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, Master told me earlier that Mount Innerheart has
two Dao-Palaces that include everything within them,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Lord Jiang
nodded. “I’ll take you three over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The place in the entire
Tristar Crescent Abode with the most Fiendgods and Diremonsters was
the Divinities Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s the
Divinities Palace, one of the two Dao-Palaces.” Lord Jiang pointed
to a nine-layered palace in the distance. “The Divinities Palace is
divided into nine levels, each one containing all sorts of
techniques, including those for formations, golems, the Dao of the
Sword, evasion, lightning, magnetism…all sorts of divine abilities
and secrets arts are within it. The higher up you go, the more
profound the mysteries are. The ninth floor naturally has the most
profound techniques.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Anyone can come to
the Divinities Palace. All living creatures within Mount Innerheart
can enter and learn. However, the Dao cannot be casually taught;
there is a simple test that must be taken before studying a technique
or secret art. Only after passing the test can you learn it,” Lord
Jiang said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded and
immediately asked, “Then my two spirit-beasts can study here as
well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course.” Lord
Jiang nodded. “The techniques and arts within the Divinities Palace
might not be the most profound and arcane ones possessed by the
Tristar Crescent Abode, but they vastly surpass the Dao-Repositories
of your Grand Xia world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you have
techniques and secret arts of the Grand Dao of Qiankun1?” Little
Qing was extremely delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you have many
formations here?” The Whitewater Hound was excited as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Far more than exist
in your entire world of the Grand Xia,” Lord Jiang said
confidently. “Even Daofather Crimsonbright is inferior to my master
in terms of how many techniques he possesses. If you want to learn Ki
Refining, Body Refining, formations, the Grand Dao of Qiankun, the
Grand Dao of Taiji…you can learn all these things. All you need to
do is pass that simple test.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Little Qing and the
Whitewater Hound instantly realized that their chance had come.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, everyone
within Mount Innerheart had some sort of connection to Daofather
Subhuti. Some were his disciples or grand-disciples, while others
were his disciples’ servants, spirit-beasts, etc. In short, they
were generally all under Patriarch Subhuti’s command, which was why
it made sense that everyone here within Mount Innerheart was
permitted to learn these techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are many
humans here, but even more Diremonsters and Fiendgods.” Ning saw
many figures on the ground outside the Divinities Palace. There were
even avian Diremonsters flying about, as well as some Fiendgods that
had extremely strange appearances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, what’s the other Dao-Palace?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two Dao-Palaces -
the Divinities Palace, and the Three Realms Palace. All living
creatures within Mount Innerheart are permitted to enter the
Divinities Palace, but only personal disciples of the Patriarch or
those with special dispensation from the Patriarch are allowed to
enter the Three Realms Palace!” Lord Jiang continued, “Junior
apprentice-brother, since you are still weak, you are technically
only an honorary disciple for now. However, Master treats you as he
does his other personal disciples, and so you can enter the Three
Realms Palace. Your two spirit-beasts, however, cannot.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded in
understanding.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three Realms
Palace holds some of the most truly supreme divine abilities of the
Three Realms, as well as some terrifying secret arts. These things
cannot be casually taught. Even personal disciples are only permitted
to learn a few, at which point Master forbids them from learning any
more,” Lord Jiang said. “To be able to learn a few is already a
tremendous fortune; after all, for normal Empyrean Gods, being able
to learn even one of these techniques is already enough to allow them
to roam the Three Realms fearlessly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This caused Ning’s
heart to be filled with a blazing fire. The power to roam the Three
Realms without fear!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And generally, when
a student leaves his tutelage, Master will bestow a divine ability or
secret art that is very suited to him,” Lord Jiang said with a
laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now
remembered…that his master had said that when he left, he would be
given two great gifts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Divinities Palace,
Three Realms Palace.” Lord Jiang sighed, “Junior
apprentice-brother, you must remember that you must have the ability
to acquire one of the techniques or secret arts from the ninth level
of the Divinities Palace before you can enter the Three Realms
Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you can’t even
acquire the ninth level techniques, then you naturally aren’t
qualified to enter the Three Realms Palace,” Lord Jiang said. “As
for the other living creatures of Mount Innerheart, generally
speaking, after they have the ability to learn ninth level
techniques, they will eventually be shooed off the mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. This was
something that was different for personal disciples! And although
Ning was only an honorary disciple, his treatment was completely in
line with that given to personal disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three Realms
Palace.” Ning felt an itchiness in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, spend some time and look around. If there’s
anything you need, just come find me. I live just up the mountain;
you can ask anyone and they’ll tell you where I am,” Lord Jiang
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, senior
apprentice-brother,” Ning said with gratitude.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A minor matter.”
Lord Jiang left gracefully. He had long ago ascended past his
apprenticeship and had reached the Pure Yang True Immortal level. The
main reason he continued to live at Mount Innerheart was because he
liked the peaceful quiet of this place, and because he could
occasionally listen to Patriarch Subhuti expound on the Dao. After
all…at his level, everyone’s main goal was to become a Daofather.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofathers were truly
the most supreme figures of the Three Realms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three Realms
Palace is so tiny,” Little Qing mumbled. “It looks completely
unremarkable. It’s a place that holds the most supreme divine
abilities and most terrifying secret arts of the Three Realms; this
Dao-Palace should be built to look a bit more imposing and have at
least a bit of Immortal majesty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning blinked as well.
The distant ‘Three Realms Palace’ was just an ordinary little
building, just ten or so meters high. Outside the building, there was
a skinny old man that was lying down taking a nap, a fan across his
chest. His slumbering snores were quite loud; even at this distance,
Ning could hear everything clearly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Divinities Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Little Qing, and
the Whitewater Hound arrived at the Divinities Palace. The humans,
Diremonsters, and Fiendgods outside the Divinities Palace all looked
at the three with curiosity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who are these three?
Why haven’t I seen them before?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve never seen
them either. They must’ve just come to the mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I saw Patriarch
Jiang leading them around earlier. Perhaps that fur-clad youth is a
disciple which Patriarch Jiang accepted as a disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Their auras are very
weak. It seems these three are at the Wanxiang level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Quite weak.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The humans, monsters,
and Fiendgods chatted amongst themselves, clearly not recognizing
this group.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In front of the
entrance to the Divinities Palace, there was a handsome man in a
white robe and who held a white fan in his hands. The handsome man
languidly barked, “Hush.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, everyone
fell silent. All the humans, Diremonsters, and Fiendgods all fell
silent. This handsome man was in charge of the Divinities Palace; of
course they respected him! In addition, he was also an incredibly,
terrifyingly powerful Primordial Fiendgod. His power was incomparably
great, far greater than any of theirs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning.” The handsome man smiled and nodded
towards Ning. “My name is Silvermoon. You may simply refer to me as
senior apprentice-brother Silvermoon. I already know of your
affairs.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning greets you,
senior apprentice-brother.” Ning could sense an incomparably
terrifying aura emanating from this handsome man’s body, an aura
comparable to the one which Empyrean God Seatopple had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the humans,
Diremonsters, and Fiendgods were completely stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Junior
apprentice-brother? That old demon Silvermoon had actually addressed
the fur-clad kid as junior apprentice-brother? That meant…this
fur-clad kid was Patriarch Subhuti’s disciple! For a mere Wanxiang
Adept to become Patriarch Subhuti’s disciple…there was no
question that the Patriarch viewed him with great favor. If he was to
become a Celestial Immortal, he would definitely become a personal
disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
white-robed, fan-holding man glanced at the many distant humans,
Diremonsters, and Fiendgods. He said calmly, “All of you, listen
up. This Ji Ning is the new disciple the Patriarch has just accepted.
All of you need to be respectful. Those of you who should address him
as uncle-master, do so. Those of you who should address him as
Patriarch, do so as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Respectful
greetings, uncle-master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Respectful
greetings, Patriarch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of these mighty
humans, Diremonsters, and Fiendgods were all calling out to him with
respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at these
figures. There were all at least at the Primal or Void levels. There
were even quite a few Void-level Fiendgods and Godbeasts. Void-level
Fiendgods…these were figures on the level of that Fiendgod he had
met in the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains. For all of them to be
obediently calling out to him as ‘uncle-master’ and
‘Patriarch’…Ning felt this was quite bizarre.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come in, junior
apprentice-brother,” the white-robed man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately turned
and entered the Divinities Palace. The very first floor was filled
with bookshelves and countless books. Atop one of the bookshelves,
there was a line of large characters: “If you clean the mountain
path of Mount Innerheart once, you can choose a technique at will.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_5___Trials"></A>
Chapter 5 - Trials
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s the
requirement for learning these techniques and secret arts?” Ning
stared in amazement at the line of characters above the bookshelf.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Patriarch had told
him previously as well that a simple trial would have to be passed
before one could train in these techniques. Ning had already been
prepared for this, and had the feeling that the trial would be easy,
but…this was too easy. Just clean the mountain path once? It must
be understood that everyone with access to the Divinities Palace was
extraordinary; most likely, they’d be able to clean the mountain
path in the amount of time needed to boil a kettle of tea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning pulled out a
sword-arts manual and flipped through it. He was instantly
astonished. This was definitely at the level of the [Lesser Five
Elements Sword] manual.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wow, this is an
Immortal-ranked Ki Refining Technique!” Little Qing called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This book on
formations is definitely not inferior to the [Nine Scrolls on
Formations]!” The Whitewater Hound grew excited as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning swept his gaze
forward. The enormous bookshelves were simply brimming with books,
and above all of them were the same line of characters - “If you
clean the mountain path of Mount Innerheart once, you can choose a
technique at will.” Clearly, the requirement for choosing any book
on this first floor of the Divinities Palace was the same.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The handsome
white-robed man shook his head and laughed. “In Mount Innerheart,
there is an old saying…the techniques and secret arts of the
Divinities Palace, when learned, shall allow you to become a
Celestial Immortal or Empyrean God. The divine abilities and secret
arts of the Three Realms Palace, however, shall allow you to be able
to roam and dominate the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master learns of the
affairs of the Three Realms through his dreaming, and so he is
naturally incredible in collecting divine abilities and secret arts.
The number of techniques and arts he has collected here in the
Divinities Palace from ancient times til now is simply uncountable.
Even at the lowest level here on this first floor, the techniques
present are considered quite excellent in ordinary worlds,” the
white-robed Silvermoon said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded gently.
Indeed. Through the [Dream of the Three Realms], his master was
indeed quite astonishingly good at collecting various sorts of
techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, so this is the trial for learning first level
techniques?” Ning pointed at the line of characters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. When cleaning
the mountain paths, you have to personally sweep it using a broom.
Most likely even Immortal cultivators will need half a day to clean
the many levels and layers,” Silvermoon said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. If one
could use techniques it would be much faster, but if one had to use a
broomstick, it would indeed take considerably more time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first level is
too simple. Junior apprentice-brother, follow me,” Silvermoon said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, the Whitewater
Hound, and Little Qing all followed Silvermoon, the manager of the
Divinities Palace, up the stairs and to the second floor of the
palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bookshelves of the
Divinities Palace also all had a line of characters above them. The
line said: “ Wipe down every single table within the entire
Divinities Palace and you can choose a technique at will.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…so easy.” Ning
blinked, lowering his head to stare at the sword-arts manuals. “These
are already comparable to some of the supreme manuals the Black-White
College has.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a precious
place.” The Whitewater Hound was completely stunned as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And this is just the
second level? I’ve never even seen such deep and profound
techniques!” Little Qing’s eyes were completely crimson.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, come, let’s
go see the third level,” Silvermoon laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They arrived at the
third level. Above the bookcases were a line of characters: “Get
rid of the weeds within a hundred kilometers and you can choose a
technique at will.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Silvermoon
said, “You have to pull up every single weed manually. To pull up
all the weed within a hundred kilometers, one weed at a time…that
should take at least a month or so.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Getting harder.”
Ning nodded. He was beginning to notice that each progressing level
had a higher level of difficulty. Although it was all just manual
labor, it took up time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pulling up a hundred
kilometers of weed for a single technique…then pulling ten or a
hundred would need…” Little Qing muttered to herself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s look at the
fourth floor.” Ning led them upwards once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bookshelves here
had a new line of characters above them: “Personally plant ten
thousand fruit trees, and you can choose a technique at will.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This seems a bit
easier than the weeding,” Little Qing said in a puzzled manner.
Ning nodded as well. Weeding had to be done within a hundred
kilometers; there would definitely be far more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah, you don’t
understand. These fruit trees are not the fruit trees of the mortal
worlds. These are fruit trees that bear Immortal fruit or
spirit-fruit; they naturally require tremendous care when planting.
Even though Immortal cultivators have incredible abilities, for them
to carefully plant one tree at a time by hand…ten thousand will
take at least half a year,” Silvermoon said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Half a year?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So much hard work
for half a year, just to learn a single technique? And this is just
the fourth level, right?” Little Qing stared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was quite calm; he
continued to the fifth floor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One floor after
another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The trial of the first
floor only required half a day’s worth of work.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The trial for the
second floor required three days.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The trial for the third
floor required a month.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The trial for the
fourth floor required half a year.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The trial for the fifth
floor required three years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The trial for the sixth
floor required twenty full years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The trial for the
seventh floor required a century.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And here is the
eighth floor.” Although Ning was filled with questions, he still
looked calm on the surface as he arrived on the eighth floor of the
Divinities Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The number of books on
this floor was clearly much lower. The Ki Refining techniques here
had already surpassed the Pure Yang level and were at the Daofather
level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The divine abilities
and secret arts here…any one of them could serve as a foundational
treasure for the likes of the imperial Xiamang clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, the Whitewater
Hound, and Little Qing simultaneously turned their gazes towards the
line of characters above the bookshelves. The line of words read:
“Serve as novitiate guards for the Tristar Crescent Abode for a
thousand years and you can choose a technique at will.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The seventh floor
only required a hundred years, but this one requires a thousand.”
Little Qing couldn’t help but say, “How long are we going to have
to stay here at the Tristar Crescent Abode before we can leave it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But the techniques
and secret arts here…I imagine that not even the most treasured
techniques of the Youngflame clan or the Northmont clan are so deep
and profound.” Ning was still quite calm. “Come. Let us go to the
ninth floor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ninth floor was the
final floor of the Divinities Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On this floor, there
were only three bookshelves, and they didn’t have that many books
on them. Clearly, however…these were truly standouts. Any book here
would allow the practitioner to become a powerful expert of the Three
Realms. They could absolutely serve as pinnacle techniques…and for
normal disciples here at Mount Innerheart, these were the ultimate
techniques available!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only personal disciples
and those with special permission from Patriarch Subhuti could go to
the Three Realms Palace!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning
discovered to his astonishment that the bookshelves were completely
black, with no characters above them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why aren’t there
any characters? Can it be that the techniques here on the ninth floor
cannot be taught?” Little Qing was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned his head to
look towards the nearby Silvermoon. “Senior apprentice-brother, the
trials for the first eight floors of the Divinities Palace require
increasingly longer periods of time to complete…can it be that
there is no trial for the ninth floor? And…can it be that the only
way to learn the techniques of the Divinities Palace is to engage in
manual labor? The eighth floor requires one to be a novitiate for a
thousand years to learn a technique…does that mean if you want to
learn ten techniques, you would have to spend ten thousand years?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been planning
to train for just a few decades or a century and then return to the
world of the Grand Xia. This was his agreement with Yu Wei! To spend
ten thousand years here at Mount Innerheart? He would be arriving far
too late!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…you are quite
clever, junior apprentice-brother.” Silvermoon waved his feather
fan, then said leisurely, “The Divinities Palace actually has two
types of trials. The first type consists of manual labors which
naturally are not difficult at all; all one needs to do is spend some
time. For those slightly dumber cultivators with poorer comprehension
abilities, this is usually the type of trial they will choose. A
thousand years as a novitiate to learn the powerful techniques of the
eighth floor? It is worth it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. After one
became a Primal, one’s lifespan became limitless; all one had to do
was be able to overcome the Three Calamities and Nine Tribulations.
To spend a thousand years on a single technique was indeed worth it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can view this as
a gift which Master gave to Mount Innerheart. Although it is said
that the Dao cannot be casually taught, Master only required these
simple ‘trials’ be passed,” Silvermoon said. “But of course,
for truly peerless geniuses who have superior comprehension there is
naturally no need to engage in all this manual labor. There are other
trials for such individuals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What trials?” Ning
asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Silvermoon laughed.
“Junior apprentice-brother, didn’t you notice that in the empty
region outside the Divinities Palace, where all those humans,
monsters, and Fiendgods were congregating, there were some
restrictive formations and spells?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning thought back to
what he had seen, then nodded. “Right. That region was indeed
marked with some formations and restrictive runes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That place is the
place for battling,” Silvermoon said. “Master created nine golems
at nine different of power. Anyone who is capable of defeating the
first golem is allowed to pick a technique from the first level of
the Divinities Palace at will.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you defeat the
second golem once, you can choose a technique from the second floor
at will. If you beat it twice, you can choose two techniques. Three
times, pick three…and so on.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you beat the
third golem, you can choose from the third floor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The principles are
the same for the ninth golem; if you defeat it, you can naturally
choose a technique from the ninth floor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Silvermoon smiled as he
looked at Ning. “Understand, junior apprentice-brother?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This trial is quite
simple as well. Understood.” Ning nodded, then asked with
suspicion, “If you beat it once you will gain one technique, if you
beat it twice you will gain two…can it be that the more times you
fight, the more powerful the golem will become?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When you actually go
fight them, you’ll know the answer.” Silvermoon no longer gave
any more information on this. “But remember; these fights are meant
to test your insights into the Dao! Thus, all divine abilities are
forbidden, as well as any formations, forbidden arts, etc. I hear you
are a Sword Immortal. If so, then you are only permitted to use your
sword and sword-arts. Unleash the full power and sharpness of your
sword-arts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“By doing manual
labor, one can learn techniques up to the eighth floor. Only by
defeating the ninth golem, however, can the ninth floor techniques be
learned.” Silvermoon looked at Ning. “Junior apprentice-brother,
once you defeat the ninth golem and learn a ninth floor technique,
you can go to the Three Realms Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded, then asked, “Senior apprentice-brother, which golem should
I test myself against for now?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There isn’t much
point in acquiring those weaker sword-arts manuals; it’s best to
start from a higher place! Since Master was willing to accept you as
his disciple, I imagine that you are a rare, peerless genius as
well…how about this? Why don’t you give the sixth golem a try?”
This was Silvermoon’s best guess, as he didn’t know anything
about Ning’s level of power. Still, he could guess that Ning was
most likely a supreme genius.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The sixth golem? The
sixth floor?” Ning thought back to the sixth floor; the sword-arts
manuals there were already even more profound than the full nine
stances of the [Three-Foot Sword]! Every sword-arts manual there
surpassed the best that the Black-White College had to offer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But I’m only at
the Wanxiang level,” Ning said, a bit worried. “Isn’t that a
bit…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. The
nine golems which Master created are extraordinary. They will release
different levels of power, based on the strength of their foes. Since
you are at the Wanxiang level, the elemental ki these golems will use
shall also be at the Wanxiang level. If you were a Void-level Earth
Immortal, then the elemental ki these golems would use would also be
Void-level. This is why I said this is a test of your comprehension
of the Dao! It doesn’t matter if you are a Wanxiang Adept, a Primal
Daoist, or a Void-level Earth Immortal,” Silvermoon said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly felt
reassured. “Good. Then I’ll give the sixth golem a try.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, let’s go to
the testing ground.” Silvermoon immediately lead Ning down from the
ninth floor of the Divinities Palace to the empty field outside.
</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the Divinities
Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you, step
back,” Silvermoon instructed. All of the disciples of Mount
Innerheart present all hurriedly departed from the empty region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Silvermoon waved his
arm, and a golem that was more than three meters tall appeared out of
nowhere. The golem’s body seemed completely metallic, and its arm
had six hoops around it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, this is the sixth golem,” Silvermoon said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, senior
apprentice-brother.” Ning was filled with anticipation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Silvermoon, the
Whitewater Hound, and Little Qing immediately left the dueling
grounds. As for the other Mount Innerheart disciples, they all
revealed looks of amazement and curiosity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle-master is
going to duel a golem.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Patriarch is
about to show his power!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Little Patriarch
is immediately challenging the sixth golem upon arriving at the
power. I imagine that he’s pretty confident in being able to defeat
it. He’s only a Wanxiang Adept, but he actually dares to fight the
sixth golem. What level of insight into the Dao must the Little
Patriarch have reached?! No wonder Patriarch Subhuti took him as a
disciple. He truly is a peerless monster.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve been on the
mountain for thousands of years, but I’m still unable to defeat the
sixth golem. I had to serve as a novitiate in order to acquire an
eighth level Divinities Palace technique,” an old Void-level
Diremonster growled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Challenging the
sixth golem as soon as he comes up the mountain? Formidable,
formidable indeed. Even in the major world from whence I come, it is
rare for such a peerless genius to come in countless lifetimes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These humans, monsters,
and Fiendgods all spoke out in praise. As they saw it, since Ning had
been chosen by Patriarch Subhuti as his disciple, he was assuredly
extraordinary. In addition, that old demon Silvermoon, the manager of
this Divinities Palace, was also a personal disciple of Patriarch
Subhuti. Since he chose the sixth golem for Ning, he probably felt
confident that Ning could beat it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A peerless genius.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Incredible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The disciples of Mount
Innerheart were all filled with eagerness as they waited to watch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The trial grounds. Ning
was exchanging stares with the distant sixth golem. From far away,
Little Qing was cheering, “Master, master, beat the snot out of
that golem!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Wanxiang kid,
if you want to beat me, bring out your power.” The three meter tall
golem growled, then waved his hand as a longsword suddenly appeared
within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” A Darknorth
sword appeared in each of Ning’s hands as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Ning
instantly charged forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the disciples of
Mount Innerheart present, as well as the old demon Silvermoon, were
watching this battle carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having mastered
the Dao-Path of the Gale, Ning’s speed had become incredibly fast;
he blew forward like a gust of wind and arrived before the sixth
golem, and his Darknorth swords instantly struck out like two streaks
of dazzling sword-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After experiencing the
[Thousand Year Dream], Ning’s sword-arts had clearly become firmer
and more stable, and his movements were more pure and exquisite as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golem struck out
with its longsword, and the earth itself seemed to tremble. The
longsword actually came smashing down with the weight of a mountain,
and Ning could even see with his naked eyes the vague illusion of
massive mountains appearing around it. The might and aura of this
sword stance caused Ning to feel completely awestruck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good. The
difference in power is too great!” Ning, upon seeing the illusion
of massive mountains which had manifested around the golem’s
sword-chop, instantly felt completely unable to resist. The
profoundness of the attack’s formless Dao…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His own two chopping
streaks of sword-light became as thin as silken, becoming
incomparably soft.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golem’s longsword
smashed down upon Ning’s twin Darknorth swords. A surge of
invincible power crushed downwards, and Ning was sent flying through
the air like a meteor. He only stopped when he arrived at the edge of
the trial grounds, where a nearly invisible barrier hovered in the
air. The barrier blocked Ning’s fall, but his two Darknorth swords
were also sent flying into the air, and they then smashed against the
restrictive barrier and fell to the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I admit defeat,”
Ning hurriedly called out. The flesh on his two hands had been
completely split open, and blood was leaking everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just a single exchange
of blows…but his sword had actually been knocked flying. This
difference in power was simply too enormous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Um…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many disciples of
Mount Innerheart who were watching outside the trial grounds, be they
human, monster, or Fiendgod, all were completely flabbergasted at
what they had just seen. They blinked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As they saw it, Ning
was the chosen of Patriarch Subhuti, and so he surely must be
extraordinary! Even when these other disciples had first arrived on
the mountain, they were generally able to defeat the second or third
golem. Some of the more powerful ones were able to defeat the fourth
or even the fifth golem. None of the ones present had been able to
defeat the sixth golem right away, but over the course of Mount
Innerheart’s many years of history there had been some who had
defeated the sixth golem upon arriving.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The statuses of these
disciples were far lower than Ning’s. Ning was the Patriarch’s
disciple! All of the other disciples believed that Ning was going to
make a miracle happen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But unfortunately…this
‘exceptionally extraordinary’ Ji Ning was actually defeated in
one blow. He wasn’t even able to fight back!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master!” Little
Qing looked towards Ning, tight feelings appearing in her chest. Her
master was the number one figure in his Conclave, and she had thought
for certain that her master was going to dazzle everyone with his
power upon arriving at Mount Innerheart. But he had actually been
defeated so miserably. “Master must be feeling horrible right now!
And there were so many Mount Innerheart disciples watching! That
despicable old bastard, Silvermoon…he’s the one who told Master
to fight against the sixth golem!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, child…”
The Whitewater Hound had not expected this either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh.” The
fan-wielding Silvermoon hastily waved his arm, collecting up the
sixth golem. He hurriedly ran over. “Junior apprentice-brother,
this, uh, I didn’t, I…I didn’t know exactly how strong you
were, but since Master took you on as a new disciple, I…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Silvermoon hadn’t
done this on purpose. He knew exactly how stringent and exacting
Patriarch Subhuti’s requirements for accepting new disciples were.
Those who were accepted as disciples before becoming Celestial
Immortals or Empyrean Gods were all incredible talented, so
monstrously skilled as to cause utter terror! Thus, he had guessed
that this new junior apprentice-brother of his, Ji Ning, should be
able to give the sixth golem a good fight. Even if he were to be
defeated, he should have been able to fight for quite a long time
before losing. He hadn’t expected at all that Ning would be
defeated with a single blow and that he wouldn’t be able to fight
back at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It isn’t your
fault, senior apprentice-brother.” Ning shook his head. He could
tell that the spectating humans, monsters, and Fiendgods all had a
look of surprise, puzzlement, and even hidden disdain in their eyes.
Clearly, these Immortal cultivators cared about strength the most;
even though his status was high, if he wasn’t strong enough, others
would still look down on him in their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was simply that I
was not strong enough,” Ning said. “The sixth golem truly does
vastly surpass my current limits.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was my fault,”
Silvermoon said hurriedly. This junior apprentice-brother had
suffered such a huge defeat in his first trial upon coming up the
mountain…and he had been the one who had chosen the opponent. He
naturally felt extremely ashamed. He hurriedly said, “Given the
sword techniques you displayed, you definitely would have no problems
defeating the third golem, and as for the fourth golem…you have a
chance as well. Which one would you like to choose?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fourth golem,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How about you take a
break, then fight?” Silvermoon asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head and
chuckled. “I was instantly defeated in that earlier battle. I used
up almost no divine power at all, as a result. There’s no need to
rest.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Silvermoon, seeing the
smile on Ning’s face, couldn’t help but nod mentally to himself.
This junior apprentice-brother had an impressive mentality; he had
been defeated in front of so many watchers during his very first
trial, but he remained quite calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
Silvermoon nodded, then waved his arm. Yet another golem, a fiery red
golem, appeared within the battlefield. This golem had four circlets
around its arm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This uncle-master,
Ji Ning, seems to be ordinary in power. He was actually completely
unable to fight back against the sixth golem.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. He’s quite
puny.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Puny my ass. When
you came up the mountain, you probably would’ve been defeated by
the sixth golem in one blow as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m just my
Master’s spirit-beast, while Ji Ning is the Old Patriarch’s
disciple. I even have to address him as Patriarch! How can you
compare the two of us? When I first arrived, I was also able to
defeat the fourth golem.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look, it is
starting.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Patriarch is
starting to fight against the fourth golem.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The disciples of Mount
Innerheart had all originally been filled with admiration towards
Ning, but now they found out…that this Ji Ning was rather so-so! In
fact, compared to the rest of them when they had first arrived in the
mountain, Ning’s performance was average at best. He was completely
unremarkable!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually…many of
these other disciples were the personal disciples that had been
accepted by True Immortals or Empyrean Gods! They, too, were truly
first-rate geniuses which the True Immortals and Empyrean Gods had
chosen from throughout the Three Realms. Not even the likes of Adept
Blackstone or Adept Ninedeaths would necessarily be chosen by True
Immortals or Empyrean Gods; from this, one could imagine how much
talent and comprehension ability these disciples possessed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some disciples were
disciples of Celestial Immortals!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some were
spirit-beasts!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Others were Fiendgod
servants!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of them had merely
been at the Wanxiang level when arriving at the mountain. Some had
already reached the Primal level. Some had even reached the Void
level!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some Void-level
Fiendgods had lived for an incredibly long time, and were born with a
very high level of insight into the Dao. It was normal for them to be
able to defeat the fifth golem or sixth golem. As for the disciples
of Celestial Immortals, they were also quite extraordinarily
talented, and could absolutely compare to the likes of Cangwu Jiu or
Adept Blackstone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus…the vast
majority of these disciples who had to refer to Ning as
‘uncle-master’ or ‘Patriarch’ were, in reality, the peerless
geniuses of the major worlds they came from! Some were even more
monstrously formidable than that!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But this Patriarch’s
sword-arts aren’t bad. It seems he should be able to defeat the
fourth golem.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. He should be
able to beat the fourth golem…but just barely.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Just barely.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The disciples of Mount
Innerheart all gave their evaluation. Towards this Ji Ning, the
disciple of the Old Patriarch who had an incredibly high status…they
no longer felt too much reverence for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A streak of sword-light
plunged into the golem’s chest. It didn’t even sink in a single
inch before it became unable to go in any deeper.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golem came to a
complete halt. It stared at Ning unmovingly, then said in a low
voice, “You won.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These golems were
non-living creatures; even Void-level Fiendgods that fought against
them would be unable to destroy them. Thus…being able to break
through their outer layer of protection was enough to symbolize
victory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, you can now go to the fourth floor of the
Divinities Palace and choose a technique at will,” the fan-holding
Silvermoon said with a smile as he walked over. With a wave of his
hand, he collected the golem again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled.
Fortunately, he had experienced the [Thousand Year Dream] earlier;
his sword-arts had indeed stabilized and become more firm, and his
execution of them had become more profound and unpredictable as well.
That was the only reason why he was able to defeat the fourth golem.
Otherwise…he would have probably only been able to beat the third
golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was as he had
expected. After all, he had been forbidden from using any divine
abilities, resulting in his greatest source of power, the
[Starseizing Hand], being unusable. His power would naturally be much
lower as a result!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he had become
the champion of his Conclave of Immortal Destiny, he was actually a
bit weaker than Cangwu Jiu, Xiamang Zishan, and the others when it
came to his comprehension of the Dao. He had only become champion
thanks to the [Starseizing Hand].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, when ordinary disciples of Mount Innerheart first
arrive at the mountain, which golem are they generally able to beat?”
Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The newcomers are
sometimes a bit weaker while sometimes a bit stronger. On the whole,
they are on par with you, I suppose. However, they have generally
trained for centuries before arriving, while some have trained for
thousands or tens of thousands of years,” Silvermoon said. As they
chatted, the sound around them was blocked from transmitting to
others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “Given
how many years the ordinary disciples have been in the mountain, they
are definitely more powerful than they were in the past. It seems I
am the weakest person here at Mount Innerheart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…Ning continued
to feel complete confidence in himself. He had only trained for
thirty years, and had just arrived at the mountain. After a hundred
years, he would definitely be able to surpass them all! And he also
had the [Starseizing Hand] in reserve! In these trials against
golems, since his divine abilities were unusable, his greatest
advantage had been neutralized.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…no matter what,
compared to the ordinary disciples of Mount Innerheart, he was at the
bottom of the barrel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A thirty thousand meter
tower starts from the ground. He still had to work hard!
</P>

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_7___Thirty_Years_at_Moun"></A>
Chapter 7 - Thirty Years at Mount Innerheart
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, how long have you been training for?”
Silvermoon asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“More than thirty
years,” Ji Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Silvermoon instantly
began to laugh. “Ah, no wonder! That explains it. So you’ve only
been training for around thirty years. For you to be able to defeat
the fourth golem despite having trained for such a short period of
time…I trust that in the future, here at Mount Innerheart, your
rate of improvement will be similarly astonishing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled. “Thank
you for your kind words, senior apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Under the gazes of the
many humans, monsters, and Fiendgods, Ji Ning and Silvermoon stepped
into the fourth floor of the Divinities Palace. The profoundness of
any of the sword-arts manuals located on the fourth floor was
comparable to the complete nine stances of the [Three-Foot Sword]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This truly is a
blessed land for learning the Dao.” Ning flipped through the
abridged versions of the sword-arts manuals, which included some of
the preliminary parts to each technique. His eyes and eyebrows danced
expressively as he read. “So many sword-arts…this place
represents the collective enlightenment gained by countless Sword
Immortals of the Three Realms. My own sword-arts will definitely
improve dramatically after I draw from the wisdom of so many other
Sword Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, Ning’s life
of learning the Dao at Mount Innerheart had begun.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he wanted to leave
his master’s tutelage, he had to at least be able to defeat the
ninth golem and acquire a ninth-level technique from the Divinities
Palace. Only then could he enter the Three Realms Palace, and only
then could he leave. This was a prerequisite! He had to be trained as
a personal disciple would be trained, which meant that he had to be
able to enter the Three Realms Palace and learn the truly powerful
divine abilities located within it. This was the most fundamental of
expectations which Patriarch Subhuti had for Ning as his apprentice;
Ning understood this quite well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Yu Wei had
agreed that they would reunite in the future in the Grand Xia world.
And so…he had to enter the Three Realms Palace as soon as he could!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t want to
spend centuries or millennia here at Mount Innerheart; if he truly
did spend thousands of years here, then what in the world would
happen to the people he cared about in the Grand Xia such as Yu Wei,
Autumn Leaf, Mu Northson, or Yuchi Xiyue?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to defeat the
ninth golem as soon as I can, ideally within a few decades.” This
was Ning’s goal for himself, but he knew very well how incredibly
difficult this goal would be. “I can’t allow myself to be
distracted whatsoever during this period of time at Mount Innerheart.
Lotus techniques, divine will techniques…I’ll put them all to one
side for now. Here in the Divinities Palace, I will exclusively focus
on sword-arts manuals!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-arts, focused on
attacks! This was Ning’s decision!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time slowly flowed on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, the Whitewater
Hound, and Little Qing all spent their time training on Mount
Innerheart. And in fact, the Whitewater Hound and Little Qing were
even more excited than Ning to be here!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?
The third golem defeats us with utter ease,” Little Qing said
helplessly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems that we
might not even be able to beat the second golem,” the Whitewater
Hound said helplessly as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The disciples of Mount
Innerheart were almost all incomparably talented monsters who came
from throughout the Three Realms. Some of the others were
spirit-beasts of Celestial Immortals who had trained for a very long
time. By comparison, the Whitewater Hound and Little Qing had trained
for a very short period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s nothing we
can do. Let’s go do manual labor,” the Whitewater Hound said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s our only
option.” Little Qing nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, both of them
went to accept the manual labor ‘trials’. They spent nearly a
full month manually deweeding the surrounding hundred kilometers of
land. Only then were they allowed to choose a third level technique
from the Divinities Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The techniques on the
third floor of the Divinities Palace…any one of them when placed
within the Black-White College would become the most treasured
technique of the College!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, so someone
like me can actually acquire a technique like this!” Little Qing
snatched up a copy of the [Qiankun Sword Song] with absolute
excitement. “I can now finally, truly train on the Grand Dao of
Qiankun.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are the
writings of a Celestial Immortal on formations?” The Whitewater
Hound was holding a book on formations. He, too, was incomparably
excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of them were
actually extremely gifted. Uncle White was a Whitewater Hound;
although in other aspects he was rather ordinary for a Godbeast, in
one aspect, he was exceptional - his intelligence!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Little Qing, in turn,
had absolutely astonishing talent in the Grand Dao of Qiankun. She
was even able to use the Void Blink (spatial teleportation) technique
at the Xiantian level! Although at that point in time, there was no
way Little Qing could actually understand the profound mysteries and
principles behind spatial teleportation, this was her innate ability
as a Godbeast. All she had to do was be able to touch upon just the
slightest bit of this Grand Dao and she would be able to teleport.
She didn’t need to actually understand it; just brushing against
the Grand Dao of Qiankun allowed it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, neither of two
had ever had a truly good teacher! Ning had the help of the Stellar
Hall of the underwater estate, and also had the guidance of Immortal
Diancai. Uncle White and Little Qing, however, had to work hard to
study on their own!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Having arrived at Mount
Innerheart, however, everything had changed! They had a chance to
interact with so many talented humans, monsters, and Fiendgods. The
Void-level Fiendgods in particular had lived extremely long lives,
and their level of experience was definitely not inferior to Immortal
Diancai’s. For the sake of giving Ning face, they would often give
pointers to Little Qing and Uncle White. And occasionally, the two
would even have a chance to ask the likes of the white-robed Lord
Jiang or the old demon Silvermoon for some advice as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But most importantly of
all…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Subhuti had
begun to lecture on the Dao!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Subhuti
rarely expounded on the Dao; sometimes, ten thousand years would pass
without a single lecture. However, ever since he had taken on Ning as
a disciple, Patriarch Subhuti immediately began to give far more open
lectures on the Dao than before; in fact, he would expound on the Dao
almost every month! This was a habit for Patriarch Subhuti; generally
speaking, after taking in a new disciple, he would often expound on
the Dao with great frequency for a time. But if he didn’t take in a
new disciple? He would only expound on the Dao when he was in the
mood for it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all, the Old
Patriarch only truly valued his personal disciples enough to do it.
As for the other disciples…they generally didn’t even have a
chance to meet or speak with the Old Patriarch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, all of the
disciples of Mount Innerheart were in a state of collective
excitement. Even several True Immortals or Empyrean Gods would
occasionally come over to listen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Daofather lives
up to his reputation.” The Whitewater Hound was currently filled
with the utmost of excitement. “Listening to the Daofather expound
on the Dao once is more helpful than me ruminating by myself for a
century. So many of the questions in my mind have been explained, and
I have now mastered a Dao-Path!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Daofather must
have completely mastered the Grand Dao of Qiankun. His casual
mentions regarding it have caused me to comprehend so much. I can now
even teleport out of a spacelocked region!” Little Qing was excited
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One year after another
passed. The two of them had spent another half year doing manual
tasks and had acquired a technique from the fourth floor of the
Divinities Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These manual tasks just
took up time; they didn’t need to actually use up too much of their
mental energy on them. They were able to completely focus on training
in the Dao while carrying out the menial jobs!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They then spent another
three years carrying out menial jobs, thus acquiring a fifth level
technique from the Divinities Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then they spent
another twenty years before finally acquiring a sixth level technique
from the Divinities Palace!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixth level
techniques would be considered amongst the most supreme of techniques
in the Grand Xia Dynasty! Almost all of them were created by
Celestial Immortals, and some were even created by Pure Yang True
Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twenty-sixth year
at Mount Innerheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AHAHAHA! I’m
invincible! INVINCIBLE!” As rain poured down from the skies, Little
Qing ran around wildly in circles around Ning’s Immortal estate,
her body flickering and flashing about. Her figure was very blurry as
she repeatedly teleported about with high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Qing. Little
Qing!” Ning stood there at the entrance to his Immortal estate.
Just by standing there, he gave off the aura of an Immortal sword,
causing others to feel an uncontrollable desure to submit to him.
“How are you now ‘invincible’? Can’t you see it’s raining?
Stop running around like that!” Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Qing.” The
Whitewater Hound spoke in the human tongue as well. “What is going
on? Why are you so excited?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…”
Continuing to laugh, Little Qing suddenly appeared in front of Ning
with a swish. “Master. Master!” Little Qing’s eyes were filled
with excitement. “I’m now able to use Greater Teleportation! I’m
finally able to use Greater Teleportation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! Greater
Teleportation?” Ning revealed a look of surprise. When he had
killed Youngflame Nong, he had once acquired a Dao-seal of Greater
Teleportation. In the underwater estate, he had also acquired one as
a protective item. Normal ‘Void Blink’ techniques or ‘spatial
teleportation’ techniques…they were all classified as ‘Lesser
Teleportation’. They only allowed one to teleport around within a
single region; at most, they would allow one to move a certain
distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As one gained more and
more insights into space, one would be able to teleport greater and
greater distances, and even spacelock techniques would begin to
become ineffective.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But upon completely
mastering the complete Grand Dao of Qiankun, one would be able to use
Greater Teleportation. Greater Teleportation…it could allow you to
teleport from one world to another world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, one might
be located in the Netherworld Kingdom, but with a single Greater
Teleportation, one could move straight back to Serpentwing Lake of
the Grand Xia world!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was why Youngflame
Nong had been so confident despite having been trapped within the
Witchriver Immortal Estate. He knew that no matter how dangerous
things became, all he had to do was use the Greater Teleportation
Dao-seal and he would be able to immediately flee back to his clan’s
headquarters in the Grand Xia world. But unfortunately, he had viewed
Ning with complete contempt, and had believed Ning to pose no threat
to him at all. By the time Ning released that black loop…there was
no longer a chance for Youngflame Nong to escape!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve reached the
Grand Dao Domain level of the Grand Dao of Qiankun!” Little Qing
said excitedly, “I’m already capable of Greater Teleportation.
Ahahaha…I’m now invincible. Who can kill me? Who can kill me?!
Ahahaha, I can now escape from any formation, no matter how
formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Whitewater
Hound both laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Azure Skysnakes
possessed astounding talent and affinity for space. Upon reaching the
Grand Dao Domain level, they could become as one with the Grand Dao,
and thus they would be able to utilize Greater Teleportation. There
was no point in even feeling jealous about it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, teach me
some more about the sword. I now have a greater understanding of the
Grand Dao of Qiankun, and my ability to improve my sword-arts will
improve as well,” Little Qing immediately said. She wanted for Ning
to be able to teach her, and so she had chosen to learn the sword as
well, fusing her Grand Dao of Qiankun into her sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Little Qing was
improving, but his own rate of improvement was even more astonishing.
After all…from the time when Ning established his Zifu region in
the Grand Xia world to the day he entered Mount Innerheart, only
roughly twenty years had passed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now he was training at
Mount Innerheart, and he even had the chance to listen to his master,
Patriarch Subhuti, lecture on the Dao. He also often went to meditate
in the Stellar Hall, and also fought constantly against the golems,
so as to further sharpen and refine his sword-arts. He also had
countless exquisite sword-arts to analyze! How could his rate of
improvement be slow?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With each defeat of a
golem, Ning was allowed to choose a new technique. But with each
fight, the golems would change as well. For example, during the first
battle, the fourth golem had used overbearing, powerful sword-arts;
during the second, third, and fourth battle, however, the golem had
used different techniques. At the start, the golem only changed
between different sword-arts styles, but afterwards it even began to
use sabres, longspears, staves, and even flying swords, magic
treasures, or formations to assist it. This made the fourth golem
increasingly difficult to defeat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning’s own
power was improving at an astonishing rate as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had now analyzed
more than a hundred sword-arts from the fourth level of the
Divinities Palace, all of which were comparable to the complete
[Three-Foot Sword].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next, Ning had defeated
the fifth golem more than thirty times and analyzed more than thirty
sword-arts manuals from the fifth floor!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After that, Ning
defeated the sixth golem more than twenty times and acquired more
than twenty sword-arts manuals from the sixth floor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, Ning had
defeated the seventh golem eighteen times, acquiring eighteen
sword-arts manuals from the seventh floor!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he had read
and analyzed multiple sword-arts manuals, many of which had been
written by Empyrean Gods or True Immortals and some of which had been
written by Daofathers…Ning continued to spend most of his efforts
on the [Three-Foot Sword], keeping it at the heart of his sword-arts.
He infused the strengths and excellences of the other sword
techniques in the [Three-Foot Sword], causing it to be continuously
improved and perfected. There were now more and more differences
between the current [Three-Foot Sword] and the one which Immortal
Northwalker had originally created. In fact, it had now transformed
into an even more formidable sword-art that belonged to Ning and Ning
alone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, completely
focusing on his training, Ning spent more than thirty years here
within Mount Innerheart.

Chapter 8 - The Ninth Stance of the [Three-Foot Sword]
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a grassy area in
the Tristar Crescent Abode. This was the location of Ji Ning’s
Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a courtyard
inside the Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was seated in the
lotus position on the ground, eyes shut, completely unmoving. Next to
him lay a large, snowy-white hound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An azure-robed maiden
appeared out of nowhere. It was Little Qing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t make a
sound.” The Whitewater Hound opened his eyes, hurriedly sending her
a mental message.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it, Uncle
White?” Little Qing looked puzzledly at Ning, seated in the lotus
position with shut eyes. She sent mentally back, “Master is
training? But doesn’t he usually go into his private room when
meditating? Why is he sitting here on the ground?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When training, Ning
actually spent most of his time within the Still Room in the
underwater estate. This was a training room built by Daoist
Threelives which truly did allow one to gain insights into the Dao at
an astonishing rate. But of course, the very existence of the
underwater estate was a huge secret; Patriarch Subhuti had also
reminded Ning that he absolutely could not reveal its existence.
Thus, not even Little Qing or Uncle White knew about it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was taking a
stroll in the courtyard but suddenly had a flash of insight, and so
he immediately sat down in the lotus position to meditate on it,”
the Whitewater Hound sent back. “This flash of insight came
suddenly; he didn’t have any time to waste on running back to his
private room.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Little Qing
nodded. This was how sudden flashes of insights often worked; when
they came, they had to be seized right away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“During the past
thirty years, Master’s sword-arts have improved at an astonishing
rate. He’s even defeated the eighth golem nine times. He’s now
gained a sudden flash of insight…his power is definitely going to
improve dramatically!” Little Qing said excitedly, “He might even
be able to beat the ninth golem!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ninth golem…even
many Void-level Diremonsters and Fiendgods were helpless before it!
From this, one could tell how utterly astonishing Ning’s rate of
improvement had been during the past thirty years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My child Ning’s
talent is extremely high, and his affinity for the Dao of the Sword
is particularly exceptional,” the Whitewater Hound said. “When in
the Grand Xia world, he had to divide up his attention amongst
multiple types of techniques as well as engage in all sorts of
battles! Here at Mount Innerheart, however, there is no infighting at
all. In addition, Ning has completely focused his attention on his
sword-arts for more than thirty years. His sword-arts have already
exceeded an utterly inconceivable level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Truly
inconceivable.” Little Qing nodded as well. During the past thirty
years, Little Qing had improved dramatically as well, having mastered
Greater Teleportation. The Whitewater Hound was more intelligent than
Little Qing, with superb comprehension ability; thus, he had become a
true grandmaster of formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning’s
improvement outstripped both of theirs!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Originally, the
ordinary disciples of Mount Innerheart murmured amongst themselves
about the strength of this new disciple, not feeling much respect for
Ning. Afterwards, however, Ning began to focus all his heart and
efforts on sword-arts, and his abilities began to dramatically rise
without pause. He defeated the fifth, sixth, seventh, and even the
eighth golem…causing all of the disciples of Mount Innerheart to be
completely tongue-tied in shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the controller of
the Divinities Palace, the old demon Silvermoon, had said with an
emotional sigh, “Junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning truly is a
peerless future Sword Immortal. His improvement in his sword-arts has
been utterly terrifying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Patriarch
Subhuti helped by expounding on the Dao, as the saying went, the
master might open the door, but cultivation depends on the self. The
Patriarch could give some advice at critical moments, but most of
Ning’s cultivation and insights came from himself. Clearly, he was
extremely well-suited to the Dao of the Sword! Even the similarly
peerless Sword Immortal, Lu Dongbin, had felt the desire to recruit
him, and had made repeated requests to take him as his disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unfortunately, the
Grand Xia Emperor had steadfastly refused! However, thanks to this
‘setback’, Ning had ended up arriving at Mount Innerheart and
becoming apprenticed to Patriarch Subhuti.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, look!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the twelfth day of
Ning sitting in the lotus position in meditation, sword-ki suddenly
began to fill the pavilion area around Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Little Qing and Uncle
White both hurriedly stepped back, moving to a distant pathway to
watch from afar. They saw that more and more streaks of sword-ki
began to appear in the area around Ning. Suddenly, Ning opened his
eyes as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is this…the realm
which senior Northwalker had reached in the past?” Ning murmured
gently to himself as the countless streaks of sword-ki around him
began to gather together, becoming extremely solid and dense and
forming into a single, dazzling Immortal sword that glowed with white
light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chop,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">SLASH!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-ki that had
formed into a sharp Immortal sword of light sliced through the air,
and as it did so, the illusion of an enormous black dragon actually
appeared above it! This illusory black dragon coiled around the
flying sword of light, and in the eyes of the black dragon a look of
wanton arrogance could be seen. The flying sword of white light
sliced through the air, and the surrounding space completely
exploded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ninth stance of
the [Three-Foot Sword]…” Ning murmured to himself, “Sword
Roaming the Three Realms!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The most powerful
sword technique left behind by senior Northwalker…I’ve finally
mastered it. However, I feel as though this sword technique of senior
Northwalker’s, this ‘Sword Roaming the Three Realms’, is too
flamboyant and brash. It isn’t stately enough. If this technique
could be altered to be slightly more reserved and not so brash, its
power might rise even more.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s own level of
judgment was now extremely high.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that the sword-arts manuals on the fourth floor of the Divinities
Palace were already on the level of the complete [Three-Foot Sword].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fifth, sixth,
seventh, and eighth floors…although Ning hadn’t chosen certain
techniques that overlapped with techniques he had already chosen, he
had still analyzed a total of more than a hundred sword-arts manuals!
Ning had even chosen nine books from the eighth floor of the
Divinities Palace, each of which had been written by major powers of
the Three Realms. Although they were written rather casually, they
were still unfathomably profound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given that Ning already
had so many sword-arts for his perusing, how could he not have superb
judgment by now?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Northwalker
had roamed the world by himself and painstakingly taught himself.
Ning, however, had become an apprentice to Patriarch Subhuti, and had
the chance to analyze countless sword-arts that had been collected
from throughout the Three Realms. Given that he was incomparably
suited to be a Sword Immortal, how could he not be extremely astute
in judging these types of techniques?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have now
completely mastered all nine stances of the [Three-Foot Sword].”
Ning nodded to himself. “However, I’ve modified the first eight
stances to make them more suited to me. As for this ninth stance…I
will need to modify it as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With so many peerless
sword-arts manuals available to him, Ning’s foundation in the Dao
of the Sword was indeed at an inconceivably sturdy level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, Master.”
Little Qing flew over. “That sword technique just now…it seemed
to be unfathomably profound. Did you make a breakthrough?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. I’ve already
mastered the ninth stance of the [Three-Foot Sword].” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine complete
stances of the [Three-Foot Sword] were: Lustrous Sword-Heart,
Manifold Thistlethorns, Sudden Sword-Light, Sun in the Sky, Moonlight
Hiding the Sword, Grand Dao Domain, Horizontal Sword Execution,
Immortal-Devil, and Sword Roaming the Three Realms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Uncle White
also said with amazement and excitement, “Ning, child, I heard that
by using this [Three-Foot Sword], Immortal Northwalker was comparable
to a Celestial Immortal in power. There are even Celestial Immortals
whose sword-arts are not as profound as this [Three-Foot Sword]. Your
sword-arts are already now comparable to that of some Celestial
Immortals?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Northwalker
was comparable to a Celestial Immortal…but that was a bit of a
misleading saying.” Ning had often chatted with his fellow
disciples here at Mount Innerheart, and he now naturally knew much
more than he had in the past. “It is extremely hard for a person to
overcome the Celestial Tribulation and become a Celestial Immortal.
Some Void-level Earth Immortals have fairly simple tribulations,
while others might have tribulations that are hundreds or even
thousands of times harder. In fact, I’ve even heard that for some
Void-level Earth Immortals, the Celestial Tribulation didn’t even
descend at all; it just dissipated. In addition, Celestial Immortals
have trained for varying amounts of time, and some are unaffiliated
individuals who train on their own while others are apprenticed to
major powers. Naturally, they will all be at different levels of
power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus, Immortal
Northwalker being ‘comparable to a Celestial Immortal’ was only
in reference to the most ordinary type of Celestial Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For example, Loose
Immortal Juhua had lived for many millions of years and was also
referred to as being ‘comparable to Celestial Immortals’, just
like senior Northwalker who had lived for a million years,” Ning
said with a laugh. “There are great differences in power between
Celestial Immortals. Things are quite tricky. It’s possible that
monstrously powerful Loose Immortals who have lived for millions of
years or ten million years might be able to kill weak Celestial
Immortals, but the most powerful Celestial Immortals…I hear that
some of them have already completely mastered the Grand Dao of the
Sword or other Grand Daos, and are extremely close to becoming Pure
Yang True Immortals. These are the geniuses of Celestial Immortals,
and some are even able to compete against Pure Yang True Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus, even amongst
Celestial Immortals, there are still many varying levels of power.
This thing about being ‘comparable to Celestial Immortals’…haha,
that’s just a form of praise and flattery,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At present, Ning has
already reached the fifteenth level of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of
the Nine Heavens] as a Fiendgod Body Refiner, which was comparable to
an early-stage Void-level Fiendgod Body Refiner! Upon using his
[Starseizing Hand], and his terrifyingly powerful sword-arts…he was
definitely no weaker than the former Immortal Northwalker by now!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning had first
entered the Black-White College, he had felt incomparable veneration
for Immortal Northwalker. Naturally, at the time, he had felt nothing
amiss about the saying that he was comparable to a Celestial
Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now that Ning
himself had already reached Immortal Northwalker’s level, he felt a
bit embarrassed upon hearing himself being praised as ‘comparable
to Celestial Immortals’. After all, Ning knew very well that he was
currently merely on par with ordinary Celestial Immortals. If he were
to run into slightly more powerful Celestial Immortals, they would
probably be able to defeat and even kill him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Little Qing still
said excitedly, “Master, stop being so modest. No matter what, your
sword-arts are definitely at the level of a Celestial Immortal by
now! In fact, you are even superior to ordinary Celestial Immortals,
right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled for a
moment, then let out a resigned laugh and said, “True. But Little
Qing, I’m still just a minor figure in the Three Realms; it’s
best for me to be a bit more low-key at my current level of power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, it can be
said that at your current level of power, you are utterly invincible
against anyone below the Celestial Immortal level.” Little Qing
didn’t show the slightest hint of modesty at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled. Invincible
against anyone below the Celestial Immortal?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most likely even
monstrously powerful Loose Immortals who had lived for millions of
years wouldn’t be that much more powerful than the current Ning. It
could indeed be said that he was at the very peak of power for those
below the Celestial Immortal level. However…in the Three Realms,
Loose Immortals were still just minor figures; only Celestial
Immortals had some status. As Ning was the Old Patriarch’s
disciple, he had higher standards for himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I haven’t even
accessed the ninth floor of the Divinities Palace or the Three Realms
Palace,” Ning mused to himself. “After I go to the ninth floor
and to the Three Realms Palace…especially the Three Realms
Palace…mm. My fellow disciples have all said that so long as I can
acquire a single technique from the Three Realms Palace, I can rely
on it to roam the entire Three Realms. By then, I’ll probably be
much more powerful than I currently am; I’ll no longer be on
Immortal Northwalker’s level, and will probably be on Immortal
Juhua’s level. Even against fairly formidable Celestial Immortals,
I should still be able to keep myself alive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was quite eager to
see the Three Realms Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Qing, Uncle
White,” Ning instructed, “I am going to go into secluded
meditation to further perfect my [Three-Foot Sword]. For now,
continue to handle your own affairs; there’s no need to pay me any
attention.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The
Whitewater Hound nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, you are
going into seclusion right after making a breakthrough? The gap in
power between you and me is growing greater and greater,” Little
Qing said helplessly. But then she chortled, “Fortunately, I have
Greater Teleportation. It will probably be a long, long time before
you can do this, right Master?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head. A
‘long time’? He was a human; he had to completely master the
Grand Dao of Qiankun before he could use Greater Teleportation. He
was still extremely far away from mastering his Grand Dao of the
Sword, much less the Grand Dao of Qiankun!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stone door slid
shut as Ning entered his private room. A rippling ‘wall’ could be
seen in this private room, and as Ning stepped into the ripples, he
arrived within the underwater estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you have
finally mastered the ninth stance of the [Three-Foot Sword].”
Within the underwater estate, the giant yellow bear was waiting with
a smile on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, will I now
be capable of challenging the eighth level of the Wargod Hall?”
Ning asked. More than ten years ago, he had already passed the
seventh level of the Wargod Hall and chosen an Immortal-ranked magic
treasure.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 9 - Two Immortal-Ranked Treasures
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
nodded lightly. “Your chances are quite good. You can give it a
try.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled, then
walked towards the corridor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At every distinct level
of power, Fiendgody Body Refiners would have just two chances to
attempt to pass the Wargod Hall’s trials. Thus, Ning would
generally ask the giant yellow bear for his opinion. Each trial
represented a supreme treasure, and so Ning didn’t dare to be too
reckless in taking them. This was especially true now, as they
represented Immortal-ranked magic treasures!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning walked out
from the Wargod Hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success!” Ning let
out a soft breath. On the eighth floor of the Wargod Hall, he had
encountered an ancient, Void-level Fiendgod! Ning’s own
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] was only at the fifteenth
stage, and he was only comparable to an ordinary early-stage
Void-level Fiendgod Body Refiner. If he was to be compared against
real Fiendgods, he would probably only be equivalent to a peak
Primal-level Fiendgod!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Void-level Fiendgod
was a full level higher than him in power! It also had its own divine
abilities that allowed its might to increase even further!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This truly had been a
bloody, hard-fought battle. In fact, the Void-level Fiendgod had even
unleashed three powerful clones as he transformed his single body
into three mighty Fiendgods which surrounded and assaulted Ning! Ning
had used the [Three Heads, Six Arms] ability, the [Starseizing Hand],
and had sent his sword-light flashing everywhere…and in the end, he
managed to seize the upper hand, then force the Fiendgod to admit
defeat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That was absolutely
fantastic. After studying the Dao for thirty years here at Mount
Innerheart, I finally defeated a Void-level Fiendgod!” Ning thought
back to the past, when he had roamed the wild marshes of the Gaol
Mountains. Back then, he had been nothing but an ant in the eyes of
that ancient, Void-level Fiendgod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now! He himself was
on the same level of a Void-level Fiendgod! He was no weaker, and in
fact, he had just defeated one!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Strange. Why would a
Void-level Fiendgod have appeared within the underwater estate?”
Ning’s heart was filled with questions. He had asked the spirit of
the underwater estate, that giant yellow bear, about some of these
questions, but the spirit refused to say.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning,
congratulations. You’ve defeated the eighth level of the Wargod
Hall.” The giant yellow bear appeared out of nowhere. “In the
past, even Immortal Juhua himself was only able to overcome the
seventh level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Juhua, after
becoming a Loose Immortal, had finally challenged and overcome the
seventh level. A long, long time later, he became powerful enough to
challenge and overcome the eighth level, but by then he no longer had
any chances left to make the attempt!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, I’m going
to choose a treasure now,” Ning said with a laugh. “Last time,
when I overcame the seventh level, the book of treasures you brought
out only included high-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasures; there
wasn’t a single top-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasure to be
found.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This time, there
definitely will be,” the giant yellow bear said. “And during your
third selection, the number of treasures will be even greater.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt resigned.
This was in accordance with the rules of the Treasure Hall. In
principle, one had three chances to acquire Immortal-ranked magic
treasures! They would come when one challenged and overcame the
seventh and eighth levels of the Wargod Hall, and when one reached
the sixteenth level of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine
Heavens] and entered a brand new and distinct level of power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the number of
Immortal-ranked magic treasures available for the choosing during the
first chance was quite limited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second choosing saw
more choices.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the third…all
of the Immortal-ranked magic treasures which Daoist Threelives had
left behind would be put on display. Naturally, many exquisite
specimens would be made available then.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You know, it is a
minor matter for you, as the controller of the Treasure Hall, to pull
out those other treasures and let me choose from them, right?” Ning
felt resigned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can’t do it.”
The giant yellow bear shook his head. “Not even I can change the
rules which Master left behind. In the past, it was because you had
just entered the Wanxiang Adept level, the level at which a
cultivator is most likely to perish, that Master’s rules allowed
for an exception to be made and for you to choose some protective
treasures. As for now? You are sufficiently strong enough already; we
must follow the rules now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning entered the
Treasure Hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An amount of time equal
to boiling a kettle of tea passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He left the Treasure
Hall, another Immortal-ranked magic treasure in his hands!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” Ning
laughed as he walked out of the Treasure Hall. He was indeed much
happier with what he chose during this second choosing than he had
been for the first.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, I’m going
to go to the Still Room for a period of closed-door meditation,”
Ning said, then headed to the underwater estate’s Still Room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble! The door to the
Still Room swung open, then once more swung shut.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat down in the
lotus position atop that enormous bed of netherwater jade. The
inky-jade bed emanated an astonishing aura of coldness, causing even
the soul to feel chilled! The very first time he had sat atop this
bed of netherwater jade, Ning had felt as though his soul had been
completely frozen. However, Ning was now far more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His insights into the
Dao were at a high level. His Dao-heart was firmer. His soul was more
powerful! Even the bed of netherwater jade was only able to make Ning
feel extremely cool and relaxed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Bodhi
Stillheart Formation began to emanate ripples of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart turned
completely calm. With a wave of his hand, Ning caused two treasures
to appear and levitate before him. One treasure was a golden circlet!
As for the other, it was a set of nine black Immortal swords that
seemed to flutter in and out of existence in a transient manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden circlet was
the item Ning had chosen when he had overcome the seventh level of
the Wargod Hall. It was known as the Tripartite Immortal-Locking
Circlet. It was a high-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasure that was
meant to trap or restrain foes. Once a foe was caught by it, it would
become very hard for the foe to escape, and in fact some weaker foes
would be restrained and absorbed into the circlet itself. There was a
stand-alone dimension within the circlet, and it could be used to
collect living creatures or inanimate objects. Upon being trapped
within it, even the likes of a Pure Yang True Immortal would be
unable to depart from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, Pure
Yang True Immortals wouldn’t be so stupid as to just stand there
and allow it to draw them in!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the nine black
Immortal swords, they were the set of Immortal-ranked magic treasures
which Ning had just chosen after having overcome the eighth level of
the Wargod Hall. They were known as the Heavenraker Swords. All nine
of them were top-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords. These nine
swords…although they were individually still inferior to the
Thousandbull Sword, which had reached the very peak of top-grade
Immortal-ranked magic items and was almost comparable to a Pure Yang
Immortal sword in power, there were nine of these Heavenraker Swords!
Taken as a whole, they were not weaker than the Thousandbull Sword at
all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most importantly of
all, Ning had once seen a sword-arts secret manual on the ninth floor
of the Divinities Palace which was known as [Heavenraker].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had previously
asked the giant yellow bear, “Senior, on the ninth floor of the
Divinities Palace, I saw a sword-arts manual titled [Heavenraker].
The abridged version stated that this technique was a sword-art
created by a major power of the Three Realms known as Daofather
Heavenrake. Might I ask if there is a connection between the
Heavenraker Swords and Daofather Heavenrake?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, this set of
Heavenraker Swords were specially designed to be used to execute the
Heavenraker sword technique! The Heavenraker sword technique was
already tremendously famous back in the Primordial World of Pangu,
and is still an extremely famous sword-art in the current Three
Realms!” The giant yellow bear had said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, Ning had
immediately chosen this set of swords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat there atop the
netherwater jade bed, staring at the two mighty Immortal-ranked magic
treasures before him. He nodded gently. “After I defeat the ninth
golem, I’ll immediately go to the ninth floor of the Divinities
Palace and choose the [Heavenraker] sword technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the future, I
will need to slowly perfect the [Three-Foot Sword] by absorbing many
of the best points from other techniques. As for [Heavenraker]…if
things are as I suspect, it will become yet another technique that I
can use to defeat my foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-arts which
Immortal Northwalker had created was…more than a bit lacking
compared to some of the powerful sword-arts contained within the
Divinities Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had already
completely overhauled and perfected the first eight stances! As for
the ninth stance, he had improved and perfected it. He himself would
have to go create a tenth stance and an eleventh stance for this
technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-arts which
Ning himself created would be the sword-arts that were best suited to
him, and which would be the most powerful in his hands!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, before he
actually created his own sword-arts, the [Heavenraker] technique
could be used for a period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Tripartite
Immortal-Locking Circlet…after Uncle White becomes a Void-level
Earth Immortal, I’ll give it to him,” Ning murmured to himself.
This circlet wasn’t of great use to him, and when he had chosen it,
it was with the intention of giving it to Uncle White. Uncle White
was a grandmaster of formations, but he was lacking in attacking
techniques. This Tripartite Immortal-Locking Circlet could transform
into the tripartite powers of Heaven, Earth, and Man. It was
incredibly difficult to use, but it was very well-suited for Uncle
White, who was a grandmaster of formations. It didn’t even require
Uncle White to go fight in close combat. It was indeed quite well
suited for him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This closed-door
session lasted for more than a month. Ning completely and thoroughly
overhauled this ninth stance of the [Three-Foot Sword], ‘Sword
Roaming the Three Realms’, making it more reserved and stately
while also making it even more ferocious and fast!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For Immortal
Northwalker, the ninth stance of ‘Sword Roaming the Three Realms’
represented the pinnacle, but for Ji Ning, the ninth stance was just
a midway point; he was definitely going to go create a tenth and an
eleventh stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s already
summer?” When Ning walked out of his Immortal estate he saw the sun
hanging high in the sky, blazing with incomparable heat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single world was
illuminated by the Solar Star and the Lunar Star.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was even true for
the estate-world of the Tristar Crescent Abode. Every single world
would see the projections of the Solar Star and the Lunar Star. For
example, within the world of the Grand Xia, there was also a Solar
Star and a Lunar Star! Because the Solar Star was a bit closer to the
world of the Grand Xia, in that world, the Solar Star was a bit
larger while the Lunar Star appeared a bit smaller.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they were only
‘projections’ of the Solar Star and the Lunar Star, they still
possessed utterly terrifying power. Clearly, the power of these two
stars, the most supreme and exalted of celestial bodies, was utterly
inconceivable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle-master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many disciples of Mount
Innerheart were currently congregated outside the Divinities Palace.
Some were quietly training in the Dao, others were discussing it, and
still others were relaxing. Upon seeing Ning arrive, they all
hurriedly rose to their feet and called out with respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the course of
these thirty years, these disciples of Mount Innerheart now felt true
esteem for Ji Ning, an admiration which came from the depths of their
heart!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning just
nodded lightly, then stepped into the Divinities Palace. He started
from the first floor and walked all the way to the ninth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the staircase to the
side of the ninth floor, the white-robed Silvermoon was seated,
leaning against the banister. There was some Immortal wine, roasted
goose, and other roasted meat next to him. His feather-fan was
covering his stomach as he just lay there napping.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was in no hurry.
He first walked to a nearby bookshelf, then picked out the sword-arts
manual titled [Heavenraker].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The secret manuals
located here on the ninth floor were all extraordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning flipped through
the abridged version, then nodded gently, revealing a hint of a
smile. [Heavenraker] was indeed created by Daofather Heavenrake of
the Three Realms. It required nine Immortal-ranked flying swords to
be used, and ideally the nine swords would all be infused with the
36-Layered Heavenrake Sword Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This
[Heavenraker]…it uses the profound mysteries of the elements of
Water and Earth, has also been infused with the secrets of the Grand
Dao of Qiankun, and is unleashed through the Grand Dao of the Sword.”
Ning nodded to himself. He was quite skilled in Water, Qiankun, and
the Sword. As for Earth…Daofather Heavenrake had clearly prepared
some more elementary sword techniques amongst the many sword
techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning had few
to no insights regarding the element of Earth, he could still use
those sword-arts that didn’t include the Earth-element. In the
future, he would probably advance in Earth as well as a result.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, senior apprentice-brother.” Ning put down the
abridged version, then walked next to Silvermoon and called out to
him. In fact, he even gave him a little push. “Senior
apprentice-brother!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?” Only now did
Silvermoon open his eyes. “What, what is it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, I want to challenge the ninth golem,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_10___The_Senior_Disciple"></A>
Chapter 10 - The Senior Disciples
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ninth golem?”
Silvermoon immediately rose to his feet. Feather-fan in hand, he
began to laugh in surprise. “Junior apprentice-brother, do you feel
confident?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haven’t fought it
before, so hard to say,” Ji Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, you are always so modest. Come, come, come. Let’s
hurry. Show me what you have.” Silvermoon immediately led Ning down
from the Divinities Palace and to the empty testing grounds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many of the disciples
of Mount Innerheart were gathered in the empty area. Even Little Qing
and Uncle White had hurried over here. Because Ning had sent his two
spirit-beasts a mental message earlier, telling them that he was
going to challenge the ninth golem, Little Qing and Uncle White had
paused their training and hurriedly ran over to watch the fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that
Patriarch Ji Ning is going to challenge the ninth golem? He’s
already defeated the eighth golem nine times by now, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He might really be
challenging the ninth golem!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are so many of
us here, including some monsters that have lived here for tens of
thousands of years, but none of us have ever defeated the ninth
golem.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other disciples
were all stealthily chatting amongst themselves. In fact, some of
them even spoke out towards Little Qing or Uncle White.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Azure Skysnake,
Whitewater Hound, which golem is Patriarch Ji Ning challenging?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little sister Qing,
don’t tell them, just tell me alone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Over the course of the
past thirty years, Little Qing and Uncle White had become quite
familiar with these disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Uncle White smiled.
Little Qing just raised her head proudly. “Just keep watching and
you will find out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Ning and
Silvermoon were currently chatting with each other. These two both
had very high statuses, and generally speaking the normal disciples
of Mount Innerheart wouldn’t dare to speak to them too often.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Silvermoon
waved his hand, and a golem appeared out of nowhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This golem’s entire
body was a white jade color. Around his right arm were nine circular
loops, and the invisible aura of power emanating from him was quite
strong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ninth golem!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ninth!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle-master Ji Ning
is actually challenging the ninth golem!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a series of
startled cries rang out as everyone felt excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Life here at Mount
Innerheart was too relaxed and peaceful. Normally, everyone just
focused on quietly training in the Dao. Thus, when someone went to
challenge the ninth golem, many of the other disciples would cluster
around to watch. And this particular challenge…was issued by Ji
Ning, who had just become a member of Patriarch Subhuti’s school
around thirty years ago, and who had been selected as the Old
Patriarch’s future personal disciple. This naturally caused great
excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the testing
grounds. Ning and the ninth golem stared at each other from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is your first
time challenging me, but your Fiendgod body is only at the peak
Primal level,” the ninth golem said, his eyes flashing with hidden
sharpness as he carefully inspected Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew that this
ninth golem had been personally forged by his master, Patriarch
Subhuti, and that it was comparable to a Pure Yang treasure in power.
It had its own soul and possessed intelligence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A pair of Darknorth
swords appeared in Ning’s two hands. “Enough chit-chat. Show me
your most powerful sword attacks.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The ninth
golem let out a cold snort as a wide, heavy sword appeared in his
hands. “Then I’ll play with you for a bit.” As soon as his
words came out, the ninth golem took a single step forward, causing
the ground to tremble as he suddenly appeared in front of Ning. He
had moved so fast that Ning couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows.
Ning’s feet moved just slightly as he simultaneously sent the twin
swords in his hands blocking upwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh whoosh whoosh….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A massive illusory wave
that seemed to fill the heavens suddenly appeared. Ning’s
sword-arts had reached a high enough level that it could call upon
the aid of a large amount of natural energy, thus generating this
sort of manifestation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The illusory wave swept
forward, Ning’s sword-light within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang! Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ninth golem’s
heavy sword carried incomparable savagery and dominance, and with
each stroke the heavy sword smashed against the wave!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword
technique was more tenacious and powerful, and it came out in a
steady, unbroken stream. By contrast, the ninth golem’s sword
technique was more savage and ferocious. However, in the face of
Ning’s unbroken, flowing string of attacks, the ninth golem was
finding it increasingly hard to hang on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So you have a bit of
talent after all. If I don’t bring out some of my true power, I
won’t be able to beat you.” The ninth golem produced a second
heavy sword in his other hand as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom. Boom. The two
heavy swords began to whirl out, seeming to have transformed into an
enormous windmill and creating the massive illusion of a whirlpool
above it! The enormous whirlpool illusion clearly represented an
enormous amount of natural power had been summoned…and the ninth
golem’s sword technique clearly became even more savage and
dominating! It carried a crushing, grinding power that was able to
completely suppress Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword Roaming the
Three Realms!” Upon being suppressed, Ning instantly changed his
sword technique. He immediately executed ‘Sword Roaming the Three
Realms’, which he had perfected while in closed-door training. Two
streaks of dazzling sword-light flew out like a pair of black dragons
that were swimming through the air. These two roaming black dragons
twined around each other as they pounced towards the enemy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang! Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their respective
sword-lights clashed out three times.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, everything
came to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ninth golem and
Ning had moved past each other while exchanging blows. Their backs
were to each other, and the ninth golem was completely unmoving. As
for Ning, he put away the Darknorth swords in his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the golem’s chest,
there was a wicked, savage-looking wound!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During their three
clashes, Ning’s sword had clearly been a slight bit faster.
Although it was only faster by a small amount…it had been the
deciding factor in this battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ninth golem lowered
his head to look at the wound. The wound on his chest disappeared in
the blink of an eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You win.” The
ninth golem turned, giving Ning a glance. “You beat me in our very
first fight; you can now enter the ninth floor of the Divinities
Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Jadesuffer, this is
my junior apprentice-brother; it is only natural that he beat you.”
Silvermoon walked over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother? The Old Patriarch took on a new disciple?” The
ninth golem looked towards Ning in surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The more disciples
who defeat you, the closer you are to freedom. You should be happy.
Alright, time for you to go back to your place.” Silvermoon waved
his hand, instantly collecting the ninth golem again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, congratulations.” Silvermoon smiled towards
Ning. “Come, let’s go into the Divinities Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded. He immediately followed Silvermoon into the Divinities
Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The disciples of Mount
Innerheart watched this all happen in a daze. They stared as Ning and
Silvermoon entered the Divinities Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He won!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually won!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch Ji Ning
defeated the ninth golem.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a dominating
sword-art…what a terrifying sword-art!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle-master truly
is a peerless Sword Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them sighed in
endless amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It has only been
thirty years, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It has only been
about thirty years since the Patriarch became the Old Patriarch’s
disciple, right? Thirty years ago, the Patriarch was just barely able
to defeat the fourth golem, but after thirty short years, he has
actually defeated the ninth golem. I’ve been here on this mountain
for nearly a million years!” A six-armed Fiendgod whose body was
wreathed in dim flames muttered to himself, then shook his head and
sighed. “You humans truly do have a ridiculous level of
comprehension.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m a human and
I’ve been on the mountain for a thousand years, but I haven’t
beaten the ninth golem.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not even Celestial
Immortals are necessarily capable of defeating the ninth golem.
Thirty years…no wonder the Old Patriarch chose him as a disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The personal
disciples of the Old Patriarch truly are all formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little sister Qing,
can you ask the Patriarch to lecture to us on the Dao sometime?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother White, your
master’s sword techniques are truly formidable. I have many
questions with regards to the sword; can we have your master provide
us with a few pointers sometime?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone was discussing
what had just happened. Little Qing and Uncle White both felt their
hearts filled with delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After just thirty
years, Ning had defeated the ninth golem. This caused all the
ordinary disciples of Mount Innerheart to sigh in amazement at how
inconceivable this was. However, for the personal disciples such as
the old demon Silvermoon, this was as expected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Silvermoon
were walking up the stairs in the Divinities Palace, striding upon
the wooden steps as they moved upwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, for you to be able to defeat the ninth golem
after thirty years is quite impressive,” Silvermoon laughed. “All
of those ordinary disciples below us are completely shocked right
now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh.” Ning didn’t
feel as though there was anything to be proud of. He had the guidance
of his master, Patriarch Subhuti, as well help from the Stellar Hall
of the underwater estate. He would often sit atop the bed of
netherwater jade within the Still Room in the underwater estate, and
constantly attune to the Dao within the Grand Bodhi Stillheart
Formation. Thirty years? His original goal had always been to defeat
the ninth golem within a few decades.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Might I ask, how did
my senior fellow disciples do? How many years did they spend in order
to defeat the ninth golem?” Ning asked curiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Amongst Master’s
many personal disciples, your performance can be described as
normal,” Silvermoon said with a laugh. “Ruling out the ones who
were already extremely strong when they first followed Master…there
have been a total of twelve who were very weak when they first
followed Master. The fastest one took one year, while the slowest one
took more than 13000 years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was amazed. “The
fastest one took one year? The slowest one took more than ten
thousand?” A personal disciple of the Old Patriarch who had taken
more than ten thousand the years…this was too ridiculous. And just
a single year for the other? This was also too crazy!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master has a total
of nineteen disciples. There were seven who were already extremely
strong when they accepted him as their master, while there were
twelve who accepted him as master when they were weak,” Silvermoon
said. “Amongst them…ninth junior apprentice-brother had an
exceedingly high level of comprehension. Back then, Master’s avatar
was roaming the ancient Primordial World. He ran into ninth junior
apprentice-brother, who at that time was nothing more than an
ordinary child who loved to paint. Master just provided him with a
single line of guidance…and ninth junior apprentice-brother
transformed overnight from an ordinary child who had never before
engaged in cultivation to the level of having completely mastered an
entire Dao-Path, the Dao of Inkwater. He then followed Master to
Mount Innerheart. After a year, he defeated the ninth golem.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning blinked. To
transform overnight from an ordinary child who loved painting…to
someone who had completely mastered a complete Dao-Path?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To defeat the ninth
golem after a single year?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Next are third
senior apprentice-brother and sixth junior apprentice-brother,”
Silvermoon said. “Both of them only spent a few years to defeat the
ninth golem, and when they first joined the school neither had
engaged in any cultivation training. However…they have
extraordinary heritages. Third senior apprentice-brother was blessed
with tremendous luck when he was born, as he is a Golden Crow who was
born on the Solar Star. As for sixth junior apprentice-brother, he is
also incredible; he is a spirit-monkey who was born from one of the
stones which Lady Nuwa used to repair the Heavens.” 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled. A
spirit-monkey born from a stone that was used to repair the Heavens?
This caused Ning to think back to a story recorded in a novel back
from his own lesser world of Earth. 2 He wondered if this so-called
spirit-monkey was similar to the one mentioned in the story he had
read.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After those two are
the ones who trained for dozens of years,” Silvermoon said. “In
short…humans have extremely high levels of comprehension, while
third senior apprentice-brother and sixth junior apprentice-brother
were born as extraordinary living creatures who also had extremely
high levels of comprehension.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of the disciples
under Master’s tutelage who defeated the ninth golem in under a
century were humans and those with extraordinary lineages.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are several
who are monsters like me who are under Master’s tutelage. For
example, I had to train for more than three thousand years before I
defeated the ninth golem. There are some who were even slower than
me. On the whole, monsters have a much lower level of comprehension
than humans do.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Monsters had poor
levels of comprehension, and Fiendgods had it even worse! However,
the heavens had made it up to them in other ways. Humans at the Zifu
level had a lifespan of five centuries, while those at the Wanxiang
levels had a lifespan of eight centuries. Monsters, however, were
different. Xiantian-level Diremonsters were capable of living up to a
thousand years, and Wanxiang-level Diremonsters were able to live
more than ten thousand years. As for Fiendgods, their lifespans were
even more ridiculous. Fiendgods were innately ageless, and they
didn’t even have to worry about the Three Calamities and Nine
Tribulations. However, their levels of comprehension were pitifully
low; it was possible for them to spend a trillion years without
improving even a tiny bit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Truly, all of the
senior fellow disciples under Master’s tutelage are extraordinary.
Some were born incredible, while others met with incredible luck and
destiny. I myself was only able to enter his tutelage due to having
acquired the legacy of Daoist Threelives.” Ning understood that
amongst his fellow disciples, he was quite ordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, there was a
difference between him and the others. He was the disciple of both
Patriarch Subhuti and Daoist Threelives…and his divine ability, the
[Starseizing Hand], was the ability which Daoist Threelives had
relied on to dominate and roam the Primal World. Not even Patriarch
Subhuti had ever created a divine ability on this level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ninth floor.”
Silvermoon reached the ninth floor, then said with a laugh, “After
you choose a technique from this ninth floor, you can go to the Three
Realms Palace! After you learn a single technique from the Three
Realms Palace, if you can train in that technique to its limit,
you’ll absolutely be able to roam the Three Realms fearlessly and
become an awe-inspiringly famous figure.”

Chapter 11 - Houyi’s Archery
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning walked to the
bookcase that only held sword-arts manuals, carefully flipping
through the others. After confirming his decision, he then picked up
the abridged version of the [Heavenraker].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, I choose this one, [Heavenraker],” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the Heavenraker
Swords in his hands, he would of course choose [Heavenraker].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Silvermoon
nodded, then waved his hand. A series of thick tomes appeared within
his hands; this was the full version of the [Heavenraker] technique
which Daofather Heavenrake had created. Ning’s eyes immediately lit
up as he accepted the tomes. As he opened them up, he couldn’t help
but lose himself within their contents. Ning couldn’t be bothered
to move around, and so he just sat down right there on the ninth
floor of the Divinities Palace and began to analyze this sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Summer left, winter
came. A full year had passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During this past year,
Ning didn’t immediately go to the Three Realms Palace. After all,
it wasn’t as though the palace would run away. During this year,
Ning defeated the ninth golem three more times, acquiring two more
sword-arts manuals alongside the [Heavenraker]. These were all
created by Daofathers, and were all some of the most supreme
sword-arts of the Three Realms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning carefully analyzed
the techniques, gaining quite a bit from them. He mastered thirteen
sword-stances in a row of the [Heavenraker]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is time to go to
the Three Realms Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was already night,
but Ning set out from his Immortal estate. Over the course of this
past year, he had further perfected his [Three-Foot Sword], and his
level of insight into the [Heavenraker] had already reached a very
high point. It would be hard for him to improve significantly within
a short period of time, and so he decided to go to the Three Realms
Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms Palace
was an ordinary building that was just ten meters high…but it was
the one of the most mysterious places in Mount Innerheart!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ordinary disciples of
Mount Innerheart could occasionally enter Patriarch Subhuti’s
Daoist monastery and listen to him expound on the Dao, but they would
never, ever have the chance to enter the Three Realms Palace. Almost
every single person allowed into the Three Realms Palace was an
extremely famous figure of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snooooore.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A ringing, snoring
sound rang out, occasionally high, occasionally low. Outside this
palace was a skinny old man who was lying on the ground, his fan
across his chest as he slept. When Ning had first arrived at Mount
Innerheart, he had seen this old man sleeping. It had been thirty
years, but Ning had never seen him wake up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was as though this
old man would slumber for ten thousand years at a time!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second senior
apprentice-brother,” Ning walked over, then called out
respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having lived here
for a period of time, Ning now knew about this second senior
apprentice-brother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Lord Jiang had said,
“Of the many disciples which Master has accepted, his true heir is
our second senior apprentice-brother! Second senior
apprentice-brother trains in both the Dao and in Buddhism, and is a
master of all techniques. He’s even the only one who has ever
learned Master’s greatest divine ability, [Dream of the Three
Realms]. I once asked Master to teach me this divine ability, but
Master said that I cannot learn it. Of his students, only second
senior apprentice-brother was able to learn it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Silvermoon had said
something similar. “Don’t be fooled by the fact that second
senior apprentice-brother is always there sleeping. In reality, his
avatars are roaming throughout the Three Realms, leaving behind
countless legacies. There are very few mysteries in the Three Realms
which can deceive second senior apprentice-brother. As I see it,
under Master’s tutelage, eldest senior apprentice-brother might be
the most powerful, but the second most powerful is definitely second
senior apprentice-brother!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Subhuti had
also praised him. “Your second senior apprentice-brother has done
countless good deeds and accumulated nigh-infinite amounts of karmic
merit. He truly wishes to do good, and has been like this since the
era of the Primordial World. His karmic luck has already reached an
utterly inconceivable level. Both the Buddhists and the Daoists have
invited him on multiple occasions to join them.” Even Patriarch
Subhuti felt proud when mentioning his second disciple. Clearly, he
was very satisfied with him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After learning more
about his second senior apprentice-brother, Ning also felt extreme
admiration.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because of the [Dream
of the Three Realms], Ning’s second senior apprentice-brother’s
avatar had visited almost all of the lesser worlds, and had left
behind legacies in countless places. Thus, his name was extremely
famous! Even in Ning’s own world of Earth, his second senior
apprentice-brother’s reputation was as resounding as the thunder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second senior
apprentice-brother? Senior apprentice-brother Crazy Ji?” Ning
called out. 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is calling my
name?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The skinny, napping old
man rubbed his name, then opened his eyes languidly, seemingly to
still be half-asleep. Beaming merrily, he said, “Oh, you are the
disciple which Master just took in, that Ji Ning of the Grand Xia
world?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just so,” Ning
immediately said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the figures the Old
Patriarch’s command, eldest senior apprentice-brother was
unfathomably profound in power and without question the number one
figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Second senior
apprentice-brother’s reputation was known throughout the Three
Realms, and he had accumulated tremendous karmic merits and had
tremendous karmic luck. Both the Buddhists and the Daoists desired to
take them into their leagues…but he continued to wander the Three
Realms by himself, doing countless good deeds but belonging to
neither the control of the Daofathers or of Lord Buddha.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master told me long
ago that you would come, but I didn’t expect you to come so soon.
Just thirty years after joining, you have already come to my Three
Realms Palace.” Crazy Ji held that ragged fan in his hands as he
nodded slightly. “Go in, then. You can choose from the divine
abilities and secret arts inside as you please…but the Dao cannot
be casually taught. You will have to pass some simple tests in order
to learn them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand,”
Ning said. He had similarly had to pass some tests in order to
acquire each of the sword-arts manuals he had chosen in the
Divinities Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crazy Ji watched as
Ning entered the palace, a hint of light flashing through his
half-asleep eyes. “This junior apprentice-brother…he has a pure
and innocent heart, and is surrounded by karmic merit. And that
sword-heart of his…ohoho, it really is not bad at all! But why has
Master chosen him as a disciple?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crazy Ji understood
Patriarch Subhuti more than anyone else, and he had learned more of
Patriarch Subhuti’s abilities than anyone else as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Patriarch Subhuti
chose a disciple, he always had a reason for it; he wouldn’t just
randomly pick someone. Perhaps the disciple was surrounded by
tremendous karmic luck! Perhaps the disciple had an extraordinary
heritage! Perhaps the disciple had an unearthly level of
comprehension! There was always something!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But it seems this
junior apprentice-brother doesn’t fit any of the usual criteria.
Can it be that there is a huge secret regarding him?” Crazy Ji
smiled, then walked in as well. He was going to see what Ning would
choose.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon entering the
building, Ning saw three tables scattered within it. Theses tables
all had various abridged books placed in a casual manner atop of
them. In total, there were only nineteen books. There were divine
abilities, there were formations, there were secret arts…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The complete [Torch
Dragon’s Eye]?!” Ning immediately picked it up. Back in the world
of the Grand Xia, Ning had only learned the first part of the
technique. So the Three Divinities Palace had the full version!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He flipped the abridged
version open. Atop the first page was listed a simple trial: “Go
and clean the mountain paths of Mount Innerheart and you can learn
this technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But but but…”
Ning was speechless. “How can this be a trial?! And this is the
same as for the techniques on the first level of the Divinities
Palace!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A supreme divine
ability that could rank in the top hundred of the Three Realms…could
actually be so easily learned? Just by cleaning the mountain paths?
That wouldn’t even take half a day!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was Master who
collected these divine abilities and secret arts in this Three Realms
Palace,” Crazy Ji said as he walked in, a smile on his face. “He
did this to teach them to his disciples. Naturally, he wouldn’t
make the trials too hard.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…this is still
too easy. Even the trials for the seventh and eighth floors of the
Divinities Palace are far more difficult than this,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is true that the
‘test’ for this [Torch Dragon’s Eye] is a bit too simple,”
Crazy Ji agreed. “However, the Torch Dragon died a long, long time
ago, after all. After he died, quite a few of the Daofathers acquired
this divine ability! This is the first reason why the test is so
simple. The second reason is that the [Torch Dragon’s Eye] is
best-suited for Fiendgods like the Torch Dragon to train in. As for
other living creatures…to this very day, I’ve never heard of
anyone who could reach a level of power in the [Torch Dragon’s Eye]
that the Torch Dragon had.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now understood.
This technique was not only difficult to train in, it was also fairly
common amongst the various Daofathers, and so the ‘trial’ was
made a simple one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the easiest
of all trials,” Crazy Ji said. “Junior apprentice-brother, keep
looking at the others carefully. There are some truly supreme
techniques here…and in fact, there are some that are unique in the
Three Realms, to be found nowhere else.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately began
to look carefully at the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another manual suddenly
caught his attention. The words atop the manual caused Ning’s
pupils to contract. The words were: [Houyi’s Archery].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Houyi?” 2 Ning had
naturally heard of this major power before. He immediately picked up
the copy of [Houyi’s Archery] and started to flip through it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The name of this
technique was very simple…but [Houyi’s Archery] was indeed an
incredibly powerful divine ability! In fact, it was even more
powerful than the [Torch Dragon’s Eye].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ever since Pangu
established the universe, this divine ability has always been ranked
in the top ten,” Crazy Ji said. “This was created by True God
Houyi, who used it to roam and dominate the Primordial World.
However…the trial to acquire it is also the most difficult trial
here in the Three Realms Palace!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master actually has
the main divine ability of Houyi?” Ning was astonished. This was
ranked in the top ten! That meant it was on the same level as Ning’s
own [Starseizing Hand]?! Not even Patriarch Subhuti had ever
developed a divine ability on this level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This trial truly is
difficult.” Ning immediately frowned upon seeing it. This trial was
indeed the hardest of the nineteen trials here in the Three Realms
Palace. Ning then looked at the contents of the abridged book. “So
this is what [Houyi’s Archery] is all about…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
understood. Although [Houyi’s Archery] and the [Starseizing Hand]
both ranked amongst the top ten divine abilities of the Three Realms,
they were diametrically different.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Starseizing Hand]
was used to make one’s hands even more terrifyingly powerful than
magic items. By the Second Cycle, one’s hands would already be
comparable to Immortal-ranked magic treasures. By the Third Cycle,
they would be comparable to Pure Yang magic treasures! The raw power
and strength of the [Starseizing Hand] was utterly astonishing!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But [Houyi’s Archery]
was a skill-type ability!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was just like the
[Windwing Evasion], in that it was a matter of skill and finesse. It
required enlightenment and it required slow comprehension. Although
it did include some clever ways to use divine power…it was more
about skill and technique! Even Ki Refiners were capable of learning
[Houyi’s Archery], so long as they could comprehend the mysteries
within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is much simpler
to train in the [Starseizing Hand]; all I need to do is procure
enough Five Elements essence, and my hands can become even more
terrifyingly powerful, to the point where in the future I will even
be able to crush stars with my hands,” Ning mused to himself. “But
this [Houyi’s Archery]…it requires enlightenment!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They truly were
completely different. As a result, [Houyi’s Archery] was extremely
hard to train in. To this very day, aside from Houyi who had
dominated the Primordial World with this divine ability, there had
never been any other individuals who had been able to completely
master this divine ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t read it,”
Crazy Ji said, shaking his head. “Quite a few of Master’s
disciples have chosen this archery technique, but most of them were
only able to gain a basic understanding of it. None of them have
reached the level which the primordial Houyi once did. Go look at the
other techniques first…and in the future, when you have some more
free time, you can try and learn [Houyi’s Archery].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No matter what…this
simple archery technique was still ranked in the top ten of the
divine abilities created since Pangu established the universe! He had
to learn it sometime! But of course, there was no rush.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately began
to read through the other tomes…and suddenly, yet another technique
caused his eyes to light up. The words written atop this abridged
tome were: [Eight-Nine Arcane Art].
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 12 - The Choice Within the Three Realms Palace
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art] is the number one divine ability in the Three Realms for
those below the True God level.” This line of characters on the
abridged version instantly drew Ji Ning’s attention.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Number one in the three
realms?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had never before
heard anyone bold enough to claim that a particular divine ability
was number one in the Three Realms. This claim couldn’t even be
made regarding the [Starseizing Hand] or [Houyi’s Archery]. But
this [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] actually dared to claim itself the
number one divine ability in the Three Realms for those below the
True God level!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art], also known as the [Nine Cycles Arcane Art] or the
[Seventy-Two Transformations]1. This divine ability allows one to
completely and perfectly control one’s Fiendgod body. A basic level
of skill in this art allows one to transform into anything in the
world; this is why this divine ability is also referred to as the
[Seventy-Two Transformations].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood that
this didn’t mean that the technique was really just limited to
seventy-two transformations; rather, ‘seventy-two’ was another
way of referring to the original name of ‘Eight-Nine’. It was a
figurative number!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This divine ability
allows one’s divine body to become akin to a magic treasure, to the
point of being like an unbreakable vajra! At its peak of power, the
user can allow Pure Yang magic treasures or even supreme Protocosmic
spirit-treasures to chop against the user’s body. At most, there
might be a few sparks; the body itself won’t be harmed at all!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s gaze turned
heated as he read. Even Pure Yang magic treasures and Protocosmic
magic treasures would only be able to cause a few sparks to fly? This
was insane!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This divine ability
places tremendous stress on the body. Thus, only Fiendgod Body
Refiners can train in it. You have to at least have reached the
Primal level as a Fiendgod before you can train in the First Cycle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At the Primal level,
you can train in the First, Second, and Third Cycles.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At the Void level,
you can train in the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Cycles.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At the Empyrean God
level, you train in the Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Cycle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once the Third Cycle
is mastered, then the body will be comparable to an Immortal-ranked
magic treasure! Even ordinary Celestial Immortals would find it
difficult to wound you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once the Sixth Cycle
is mastered, then the body will be comparable to a Pure Yang magic
treasure! By relying on it, one can become truly famous in the Three
Realms!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once the Ninth Cycle
is mastered, the body will be comparable to the most supreme of Pure
Yang magic treasures, comparable to a Protocosmic spirit-treasure! It
can truly be described as an unbreakable vajra at that point, and one
can truly roam about the Three Realms without fear. Aside from major
powers, no one can harm you at all. Even major powers will have to
use special techniques in order to break your vajra-like body.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The description on the
manual caused Ning to pant in excitement. This was far too
formidable. Manmade magic treasures were divided into Mortal-rank,
Earth-rank, Heaven-rank, Immortal-rank, and Pure Yang rank, with the
Pure Yang rank being the limit. Above Pure Yang magic treasures were
Protocosmic spirit-treasures!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Protocosmic
spirit-treasures were born from the natural universe itself. However,
this didn’t necessarily mean that all Protocosmic spirit-treasures
were superior to all Pure Yang magic treasures. After all, amongst
manmade Pure Yang magic treasures, there were treasures which truly
possessed insane levels of power. In fact, some were created by
fusing the extracted essence of multiple Protocosmic
spirit-treasures, such as the Starseizing Manor itself, which had
used quite a few Protocosmis spirit-treasures in the forging!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, there were grades
of Protocosmic spirit-treasures as well. They were also divided into
low-grade, middle-grade, high-grade, and top-grade.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Supreme Pure Yang
treasures were generally comparable to middle-grade Protocosmic
spirit-treasures!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but sigh in amazement. “Protocosmic treasures!” To make one’s
body comparable to a Protocosmic spirit-treasure! No wonder one’s
body could be described as unbreakable as a vajra, and why even major
powers of the Three Realms would have to use special methods in order
to break past this divine ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Ning continued
to flip through the pages and read.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This divine ability
was jointly developed by the spiritual leaders of both Buddhism and
Daoism, who wished to create a divine body that was comparable to
that of the great god Pangu’s.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Per the predictions
of the spiritual leaders of Buddhism and Daoism, this arcane art
should have a total of Twelve Cycles.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first three were
for the Primal level; the next three were for the Void-level, and the
Seventh to Ninth Cycles were for the Empyrean God level, while True
Gods would train in the Tenth to Twelve Cycles. The True Gods of the
Three Realms, when using this divine ability, should theoretically
have divine bodies that were comparable to Pangu’s. Unfortunately,
although their predictions were idealistic, despite spending
countless amounts of effort and time on this technique, they were
still unable to come up with anything past the Ninth Cycle…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And so, this divine
ability only has Nine Cycles!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon seeing the
description within the tome, Ning couldn’t help but sigh in
amazement yet again. So the [Seventy-Two Transformations] had such an
illustrious history. It had been jointly developed by the spiritual
leaders of Buddhism and Daoism!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pangu…the same
Pangu who established the universe?” Ning sighed in amazement. If
one could use a divine ability to strengthen one’s body to Pangu’s
level, that would be utterly insane. However…even the most supreme
of experts in the Three Realms were only able to develop a total of
nine of these Cycles. Mm…it truly can be described as the number
one divine ability in the Three Realms for those below the True God
level.” Ning couldn’t help but nod to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It lived up to its
reputation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After reading the
description, Ning noticed that the [Seventy-Two Transformations] was
quite similar to his own [Starseizing Hand].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Second Cycle of the
[Starseizing Hand] made one’s hands comparable to Immortal-ranked
magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Third Cycle, Pure
Yang magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fourth Cycle,
supreme Pure Yang magic treasures or middle-grade Protocosmic
spirit-treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fifth Cycle,
supreme Protocosmic spirit-treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sixth Cycle…it
allowed a pair of hands to effortless seize and crush stars! One
truly could use one’s bare hands to annihilate an entire world. As
far as the major powers of the Three Realms were concerned, the
reason why Daoist Threelives had become so famous and powerful was
only because he had managed to develop the Sixth Cycle of his
[Starseizing Hand]; only then had he been able to kill so many
Fiendgod Daofathers during that great tribulation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My [Starseizing
Hand] only focuses on a pair of hands, while the [Seventy-Two
Transformations] trains the entire body.” Ning realized what the
difference was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because the
[Seventy-Two Transformations] was only designed for the Empyrean God
level, it could only be described as the number one divine ability in
the Three Realms for those below the True God level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Starseizing Hand],
however, had a level meant for True Gods. Thus, it could be described
as one of the top ten divine abilities in the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After reading this
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art] tome, Ning set it aside and began to flip
through the other books.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Xingtian’s
World-Destroying Axe] 2
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an
axe-technique developed by one of the major powers of the Three
Realms known as Xingtian, the Castigator of Heaven. However, it was
ranked as a divine ability, because just like [Houyi’s Archery], it
largely involved profound and arcane ways to apply divine power. This
complicated way of applying divine power, when matched with the axe
technique, would produce the true power of [Xingtian’s
World-Destroying Axe]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This divine ability was
ranked as one of the top hundred in the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Vairocana Guardian
Halo].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a protective
divine ability developed by the spiritual leader of Buddhism, Lord
Buddha. It was extremely powerful, and at the True God level it was
even slightly more powerful than the [Seventy-Two Transformations].
However, the [Seventy-Two Transformations] required a large amount of
magic artifacts, and so the number of people who had ever trained in
the [Seventy-Two Transformations] all the way to the Ninth Cycle was
very low. Although at the same level, this [Vairocana Guardian Halo]
was a bit weaker in power, it didn’t require as many magic
treasures; one only need to focus on comprehending and mastering it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Thundergod’s Eye].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This divine ability
attracted Ning’s attention as well. This was because Ning had
previously trained in the [Divine Thunderbolt Eye], which was a
simplified version of the [Thundergod’s Eye]. Upon training in the
[Thundergod’s Eye], when the user unleashed the eye, it could be
used to see even the ghosts in the Netherworld Kingdom. Nothing could
escape the gaze of this divine eye, and when mastered to an extremely
high level, one could unleash ‘Divine Lightning of the Violet
Skies’. Not even someone with an unbreakable, vajra-like body would
dare to take a blow from this divine lightning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course…just
like the other supreme divine abilities, to train in this one to the
point of unleashing the ‘Divine Lightning of the Violet Skies’
was harder than hard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Buddha-Realm Within
the Palm].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a truly
powerful divine ability of Buddhism, which could be trained all the
way up to the True God level. If one mastered it, then an entire
major world could be stored on one’s palm! When one struck out with
one’s palm, one would be striking out with the entire power of a
major world. If any enemy were to land atop the massive palm, even if
they flew for an extremely long time, they would still find it
difficult to fly out from this palm. 3
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because the
palm itself was the size of an entire major world!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, compared
to the [Starseizing Hand], it was still a bit weaker. The
[Starseizing Hand], when trained to its limit, could effortless
annihilate an entire major world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Heavenslayer Sword
Formation].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a true
sword-formation technique. The [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] was
also a true sword-formation technique, but compared to this
[Heavenslayer Sword Formation], it was much weaker. The [Heavenslayer
Sword Formation] was incredibly complicated, and it required the
forging of a Heavenslayer sword-diagram, as well as a total of
eighty-one Immortal swords…but it was extremely powerful, ranked as
one of the supreme skills of the Three Realms. However…only someone
with the power of a Daofather could produce the required
sword-diagram.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s gaze burned
hotter and hotter as he continue to read.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were a total of
nine divine abilities: [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], [Houyi’s Archery],
[Xingtian’s World-Destroying Axe], [Vairocana Guardian Halo],
[Thundergod’s Eye], [Buddha-Realm Within the Palm], [Torch Dragon’s
Eye], and two more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were also a total
of ten secret arts, formations, and other varied techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? There are
actually no manuals focused exclusively on sword-arts, saber-arts,
archery, axecraft…” Ning was surprised by this. For example,
[Houyi’s Archery] wasn’t purely archery; it also included a very
complicated way of activating and transforming divine power. This was
why [Houyi’s Archery] was considered a divine ability! The same was
true for [Xingtian’s World-Destroying Axe].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the unique methods
of employing divine power were stripped from these divine abilities,
then [Houyi’s Archery] and [Xingtian’s World-Destroying Axe]
would most likely only be placed on the ninth level of the Divinities
Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crazy Ji beamed merrily
as he watched. He could tell that Ning had been completely captivated
by these techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were five
techniques Ning wanted: [Buddha-Realm Within the Palm], [Thundergod’s
Eye], [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], [Houyi’s Archery], and [Torch
Dragon’s Eye]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For one’s palm to be
able to encompass an entire major world, a major world that
completely belonged to him and him alone…how could Ning not feel
desire for this technique?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Thundergod’s
Eye]…Ning had long ago started to train in the elementary version
of this divine ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Eight-Nine Arcane
Art] was even critical! After all, the path of Immortal cultivation
was a difficult and dangerous one. To reach the Empyrean God level
meant that one would be comparable to figures like Lu Dongbin and be
an expert of the Three Realms. It was far too difficult to reach the
True God level and become a major power like Daoist Threelives.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, this number one
divine ability for those below the True God level, this [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art], was absolutely necessary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother,” Crazy Ji said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second senior
apprentice-brother.” Ning turned to look at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you aware that
you are not permitted to simply learn as many techniques within the
Three Realms Palace as you please? Every single fellow disciple is
limited to just a few,” Crazy Ji said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know.” Ning
nodded. “Silvermoon and Lord Jiang both spoke to me of this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
each person could only learn two or three divine abilities or secret
arts from the Three Realms Palace before Patriarch Subhuti would
forbid them from learning more!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. To be greedy
is unwise!” Crazy Ji nodded. “Any one of these techniques, when
trained to the peak, will allow you to roam and dominate the Three
Realms. Even the seemingly unremarkable [Thundergod’s Eye], when
trained to the limit, will allow you to control ‘Divine Lightning
of the Violet Skies’ . Thus, if you are too greedy, the end result
will be that you will be unable to train any technique to its limit
and end up an ordinary figure. If you focus on training in one,
however, you will be able to train to the limit and dominate the
Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He
understood this principle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning pondered for a
time…then picked up an abridged version. “This is my choice from
the Three Realms Palace.” This book was of the [Eight-Nine Arcane
Art]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The number one
technique for those below the True God level. Ning had to choose it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crazy Ji laughed and
nodded. “Alright. Look at the trial first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
immediately flipped to the first page of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art],
carefully looking at the trial details. Ning immediately frowned upon
doing so. This trial was many times more difficult than the trial for
the [Torch Dragon’s Eye]; after all, that trial was just to sweep
the mountain paths.
</P>

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_13___Void_Level"></A>
Chapter 13 - Void-Level
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The trial was explained
in just two simple lines of words:
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Go and take on a
disciple of great karmic virtue, surrounded by at least three hundred
meters of golden karmic light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Go and kill ten Earth
Immortals or Loose Immortals who have committed great sins,
surrounded by at least three hundred meters of bloody sin light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…” Ning
frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To take on a disciple?
To go kill?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Someone who had
accumulated so much karmic virtue as to be surrounded by three
hundred meters of golden karmic light was far too rare. Generally
speaking, such individuals would have tremendously good luck, and so
they would have joined a school long ago, and most likely a major
school at that. After all, the larger a clan or sect, the more they
would desire to take on a disciple with that much karmic virtue. This
would bring the entire sect fortune!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Was he supposed to
steal a disciple from someone else?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for killing
someone…the Three Calamities and Nine Tribulations which Earth
Immortals and Loose Immortals had to face were of frightening power.
The more sin one had accumulated, the greater the power of the
calamities and tribulations. Thus, most Earth Immortals and Loose
Immortals would limit the amount of sin they would accumulate; they
wouldn’t dare act in excessively sinful ways, and would in fact try
to do good as much as they could. Only truly fiendishly demonic
figures who truly had formidable Dao-hearts and unearthly levels of
power would dare engage in wanton slaughter and draw countless
amounts of sin to them! This type of Earth Immortal or Loose Immortal
definitely wasn’t easy to deal with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And he didn’t have to
just kill one…he had to kill ten!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Taking on a disciple
and killing others…second senior apprentice-brother…” Ning
looked towards Crazy Ji.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To take on a person
with great karmic virtue as a disciple and to teach that person is in
and of itself an act of karmic virtue. Killing great sinners, in
turn, is also an act of karmic virtue. Both of these things are good
for you.” Crazy Ji nodded. “Although it might take a bit of
time…there’s no need for you to rush. Go down into the world and
spend some time searching. If you haven’t succeeded in one year,
then go ahead and take ten.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “The
so-called going ‘down into the world’…where am I supposed to
go? The three thousand major worlds and the trillion minor worlds?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You haven’t left
Master’s tutelage; you are not permitted to leave this
estate-world,” Crazy Ji said. “The so-called going ‘down into
the world’ refers to this estate-world itself. It is absolutely not
inferior to a major world in any way. You can spend a million years
wandering it without seeing everything within.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
immediately said, “Thank you for your guidance, second senior
apprentice-brother. I’m going to leave now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go ahead.” Crazy
Ji waved his fan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t
immediately go into the rest of the estate-world; first, he returned
to his own Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Still Room
in the underwater estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…the stone door
swung shut.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat in the lotus
position atop the netherwater jade bed, his heart quickly calming
down. The excitement he had felt upon previously seeing so many
divine abilities in the Three Realms Palace gradually dissipated.
After he was completely calm, Ning began to ponder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although there are
many divine abilities and secret arts in the world, it is true that
one should focus on a few. If you learn many of them but are unable
to focus on them, there’s no point.” Ning calmly reflected on
each divine ability and secret art he had learned.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Learning the
[Vairocana Guardian Halo] is a waste of time; it is of very little
help to me. Although the [Buddha-Realm Within the Palm] technique is
quite powerful, I already have the [Starseizing Hand]; training in
that divine ability won’t increase my power by much.” Ning
quickly began to mentally discard one divine ability after another as
he focused on which techniques were worth his energy and which ones
would bring the maximum amount of power to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are two I must
train in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first is the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art]. Once I train in it, my body will be as
unbreakable as a vajra, just like a magic treasure. I won’t need to
waste any divine power; most divine abilities require divine power to
be used, such as my [Starseizing Hand], which uses up a shocking
amount of it. The Nine Cycles of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art],
however, causes the body itself to be made as hard as a vajra. The
fact that this does not consume divine power in battle is a
tremendous advantage! I can just stand there, and my foes will be
unable to do anything to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning mentally discarded
all of the other techniques within the Three Realms Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Eight-Nine Arcane
Art] focused on defense! It made the body as unbreakable as a vajra,
and it didn’t use up any divine power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Houyi’s Archery]
focused on long range combat! It was one of the top ten divine
abilities of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Starseizing Hand]
focused on close combat! It was also one of the top ten divine
abilities of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Defense, long range
combat, close combat…that’s enough.” Ning nodded gently. “If
Master permits it, I will also choose the [Torch Dragon’s Eye].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Torch Dragon’s
Eye] was neither defense, nor long range combat, nor close combat; it
was an extremely powerful support technique! And not only was it able
to provide support skills, it was also a divine ability with an
extremely simple ‘trial’; to simply clean the mountain roads a
single time. However, Ning didn’t dare choose it just yet. After
all, no one could say how many techniques Patriarch Subhuti would
choose from the Three Realms Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ning were to choose
the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] and the [Torch Dragon’s Eye] and the
Old Patriarch then forbade him from choosing any more, he would feel
miserable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First, the [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art]. Then, [Houyi’s Archery]. Lastly, if possible, [Torch
Dragon’s Eye].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But why is it that
the Three Realms Palace doesn’t have a single evasive divine
ability?” Ning furrowed his brows. The Windwing Evasion was just
the simplified version of the divine ability [Garuda’s Wings];
after having spent thirty years at Mount Innerheart, he now felt that
the Windwing Evasion was far too weak and wasn’t suitable for him
to use at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had already
completely mastered the Windwing Evasion, but the technique itself
was far too low-level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When I next see
Master, I’ll ask him to provide me guidance and teach me an evasive
divine ability,” Ning mused to himself. “If there are no other
options…then I’ll go find one in the Divinities Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Divinities Palace
had quite a few divine abilities. Ning had completely focused on
studying sword-arts, and hadn’t chosen a single other type of
manual from the Divinities Palace. He had wanted to choose his other
techniques from the Three Realms Palace, but who would’ve expected
that the Three Realms Palace wouldn’t even have one evasive
technique? He would first go ask his master; if his master wasn’t
able to provide him with one, then he would go to the Divinities
Palace to find an evasive divine ability. Although those techniques
were fairly average amongst the upper tiers of the Three Realms, they
were still hundreds to thousands of times better than the likes of
the Windwing Evasion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Ning seated
himself atop the netherwater jade bed, a mist arising around his
body. The mist condensed into a figure; it was the black-robed Ji
Ning. Ning’s Primaltwin!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is time for my
Primaltwin to become a Void-level Earth Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the past
thirty-one years at Mount Innerheart, Ning’s Primaltwin had
remained at the peak Primal stage. The reason he didn’t advance
further was because his master, Patriarch Subhuti, had warned Ning:
“Ji Ning, I know that you acquired five million kilograms of
liquefied elemental essence during the Conclave of Immortal Destiny,
but you should not be in a hurry to make your Primaltwin break
through to the next level. Your Primaltwin was formed from the
Sole-Ki of Primalwater, and has an extremely high level of aptitude
for understanding the element of Water. Even though both are at the
Primal level, there is a difference between your true body and your
Primaltwin in terms of how fast you will comprehend Water. Thus, you
should have your Primaltwin remain at the Primal level for at least
ten years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
had immediately acknowledged his master’s orders back then.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And indeed, it had been
as his master had said; the Primaltwin’s aptitude for Water was
quite incredible. Aside from the Dao of the Sword, Ning’s current
highest level of attainment was in Water. Water far surpassed
Fire…and the weakest were Wind and the Grand Dao of Qiankun!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because he saw the
aforementioned advantages, and because there were no fights on Mount
Innerheart whatsoever, Ning had never been in a rush to make any
breakthroughs. He wanted to let his Primaltwin remain at the Primal
level for as long as possible. His master had said ten years, but
Ning had spent more than thirty years at this level. But now, he was
going to leave the mountain and go kill enemies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He wasn’t going out
to kill ordinary Loose Immortals or Earth Immortals; he was going to
kill figures who were surrounded by sin, going to kill terrifying,
demonic figures that were surrounded by three hundred meters of
bloody sin light. Ning naturally was going to make ample
preparations, and thus he was going to have his Primaltwin advance to
the Void level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, during these
past thirty-one years, the Primaltwin had also been training in the
[Darknorth Sutra]. However, since this sutra was created by a
Daofather of the Great Firmament, the Primaltwin remained at the peak
Primal level and had not reached its limit, despite having
painstakingly trained for all these years! If it had still been
training in the [Flowing Watersource] of the Black-White College,
most likely thirty or so years after reaching the Primal level it
would have been time for a breakthrough to the Void-level and to
become an Earth Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given that Ning was
training in the even more profound [Darknorth Sutra], if he had
slowly cultivated as he had planned without using any spirit-pills or
liquefied elemental essence, he would’ve had to spend at least
eighty or ninety years before training to the early Void level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A jade bottle flew out,
landing in front of Ning. The bottle’s stopper opened on its own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fortunately, I have
five million kilograms.” The Primaltwin Ning willed it, and wish a
swoosh, a flood of liquefied elemental essence flew out from the jade
bottle. The mouth of the bottle was only as thick as a finger, but as
the essence flew into the air the stream became more than thirty
meters thick. It flew straight towards the Primaltwin Ning, then
formed into a vortex around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The essence vortex
swirled into Ning, then disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Sole-Ki
Pearl of Primalwater inside the Primaltwin Ning’s body, a blurry
void of a Zifu region could be seen. Within this void, there was a
sea of elemental ki which had an enormous Turtle-Snake within it. On
the back of the Turtle-Snake, flames could be seen blazing. These
flames were Primal Fire!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Zifu sea began to
surge and swell as refined elemental essence began to surge to the
‘skies’ above them. The countless stars in the sky shone down
with rays of light, all centered upon the giant Turtle-Snake. The
Primal Fire on the Turtle-Snake’s back instantly and dramatically
expanded!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crackle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Primal Fire roared
and blazed, causing the Turtle-Snake to begin hiss and screech.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fifty thousand
kilograms. A hundred thousand kilograms. A hundred and fifty thousand
kilograms…more and more of the liquefied elemental essence was
absorbed, and as Ning’s level of power began to rise, his rate of
absorption began to rise as well. The Primal Fire began to blaze with
greater and greater fury.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long time later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">WHOOSH.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like a planted
seed suddenly sprouting up beyond the dirt. From within the blazing,
heaven-towering flames on the back of the Turtle-Snake, a single,
slender, delicate golden lotus emerged from the cracked turtle shell.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The turtle shell was
like the soil. The Primal Fire was like the sunlight and water. The
golden lotus slowly grew out and grew larger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This golden lotus was
extremely small; compared to the heaven-towering flames on the back
of the massive Turtle-Snake, it was extremely unremarkable. However,
elemental ki of unbelievable purity swirled arounded the golden
lotus, far surpassing the purity of the elemental ki Ning had in the
past. Then, the entire Turtle-Snake began to grow dim as large
amounts of its essence began to flow towards the golden lotus,
causing the lotus to continuously grow larger and larger. As it
continued to grow, the luster of the shell of the Turtle-Snake began
to disappear as it grew dark.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The early Void
level.” Ning’s Primaltwin soul had advanced from the Primal
Turtle-Snake to the ‘Goldlotus’ level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Earth Immortals and
Loose Immortals all had Goldlotus souls for their Primal soul!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one wished to become
a carefree, unbound Immortal, one had to plant the seeds of the
Goldlotus within the flames!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Continue!” The
Primaltwin Ning was like a black hole, absorbing as much liquefied
elemental essence as there was on offer. Only after a long time did
he stop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Primaltwin Ning
pointed towards the distance. Instantly, the jade bottle on the
ground became stoppered up again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The amount of
liquefied elemental ki needed to train in the [Darknorth Sutra] is
absolutely astonishing. However, my elemental ki is now up to two
levels more pure than that of an ordinary Earth Immortal.” Ning
didn’t feel sorry for how much he had used up. “I used a total of
2.5 million kilograms of liquefied elemental essence in training from
the peak Primal stage to the late Void stage! Around two million
kilograms remain in this jade bottle of mine. Right…I should leave
it for Uncle White and Little Qing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why he had
halted at the late Void stage was because upon reaching the peak of
the Void stage, the Celestial Tribulation would be impending.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go down into
the world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The door to the Still
Room slid open, and Ning’s true body walked out.

Chapter 14 - Going Into the World
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning stood outside
the entrance of his Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White. Little
Qing.” Ning sent a mental message to the two, and they soon
arrived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These two had
previously been elsewhere at the Divinities Palace, discussing the
Dao with the other disciples of Mount Innerheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, why have you
summoned us? We were in the middle of this great discussion about the
Dao,” Little Qing said unhappily. The Whitewater Hound just looked
at Ning, waiting for him to speak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am going to go
down into the world and roam about this estate-world,” Ning said.
“It will be anywhere from a year to ten years before I return.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whaaa?! Go down into
the world?!” Little Qing said with great excitement, “Great,
great! Although Mount Innerheart is nice enough, and I have the
chance to listen to the Old Patriarch discuss the Dao here and have
many divine abilities and secret arts to peruse…it is way too
relaxed and boring here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head.
“I’m going down into the world on official business. You and
Uncle White need to seize every moment of this incredible chance you
have to study here at Mount Innerheart. After all, we are going to go
back to the Grand Xia in the future…and I don’t know when we will
return. A chance to study here is something that most people can’t
even dream of.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After they went back to
the world of the Grand Xia, it would not be easy for them to come
back here. It wasn’t up to them; it was up to the Old Patriarch.
Without his permission, no one could locate this estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Little Qing
nodded in understanding.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, child, be
careful as you roam the world. This estate-world is not one whit
inferior to the world of the Grand Xia, and experts are as common as
the clouds within it. I imagine there are quite a few Celestial
Immortals as well,” Uncle White instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry.”
Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, why are you
going down into the world? What’s this official business all about?
Oh, if it’s really important, then don’t worry about telling me.”
Although this was what Little Qing said aloud, her eyes were
sparkling. Clearly, she was quite intrigued.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “This
is a test which Master gave me. I need to go down into the world,
accept a disciple, and kill some people.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Accept disciples?
Kill people?” Little Qing and Uncle White both grew intrigued.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These two jade
bottles each have a total of 750,000 kilograms of liquefied elemental
essence.” Ning waved his hand, and two jade-green bottles appeared.
“Uncle White, Little Qing, the two of you have reached the peak
Primal level in recent years as well. However, from the peak Primal
level to the Void level requires a long period of time. Although the
techniques you use are the techniques from Mount Innerheart, you will
still probably need a few decades before succeeding. With this
essence, the two of you will be able to reach the early Void stage
and also stabilize your foundation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
hesitated momentarily. Little Qing, however, immediately accepted her
bottle with glee. “Thanks, Master! Master, you are the best. I’ve
been hankering to reach the Void-level and become an Earth Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take it, Uncle
White,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Here at Mount
Innerheart, there was no way to acquire more liquefied elemental
essence. Otherwise, given his current level of power, it wouldn’t
be too hard to sell some treasures and procure some. In the future,
his true body, Uncle White, and Little Qing would all rise to the
late Void level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the peak Void
level?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was in no rush
because he often heard Patriarch Subhuti expound on the Dao and had
learned that every Celestial Tribulation was tailored to the specific
person. The more monstrous a genius, the more ridiculously powerful a
Celestial Tribulation would be. For someone like him, an expert who
had divine abilities such as the [Starseizing Hand] and who was
blessed by luck, the power of his divine tribulation would be
similarly astonishing!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had to make ample
preparations!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had to raise his
level of comprehension. The [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], [Houyi’s
Archery], and the [Starseizing Hand]; they all had to reach the
highest level of power possible prior to the Celestial Immortal
level. He had to prepare enough magic treasures and curios as well.
His Dao-heart also needed to be stronger…in short, in the face of
the Celestial Tribulation, no matter how many preparations he made,
it wouldn’t be too much. No one wanted to be defeated by it, after
all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon being defeated,
one would naturally perish. Even if one managed to luck out and
become a Loose Immortal, under the eternal, remorseless trials of the
Three Calamities and Nine Tribulations, death would be the only
result.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial
Tribulation…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a true
tribulation that would determine one’s destiny! The greatest
tribulation there was on the Immortal path! Those who succeeded would
soar into the heavens and truly escape the binds of the Three Realms.
They would be carefree and unbound, no longer subject to the Three
Calamities and Nine Tribulations. But those who failed…they were
finished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the mountain paths
of Mount Innerheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
and Little Qing sent off Ning together. Ning didn’t bid his fellow
disciples farewell; after all, this was just a trial, and a short one
at that. To his fellow disciples who had lived for countless years,
this was indeed a very brief trip.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to send me
any further,” Ning said with a smile. He then transformed into a
streak of light and flew out of the giant, levitating Mount
Innerheart. He flew downwards towards the vast, endless world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, my son, be
careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, be careful.”
The Whitewater Hound and Little Qing watched as Ning flew away. They
watched until he disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared downwards
towards the countless cities that dotted the vast world. Prior to him
leaving Mount Innerheart, Little Qing had gone to a good friend she
had made, an ordinary disciple of Mount Innerheart who was a
Void-level Diremonster, and acquired a fairly detailed map of the
entire Crescent world!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Crescent world
is as large as the world of the Grand Xia. Above an endless sea,
there are three enormous continents. These three continents are all
slightly smaller than the continent of the Grand Xia, but combined
they are comparable to it.” Ning pondered to himself. “Mm. To the
Star continent!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Crescent world had
a total of three continents. The Cloud continent, the Flame
continent, and the Star continent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The one which was below
the airborne Mount Innerheart was known as the Cloud continent. The
Cloud continent was the continent with the best governance, whereas
the Flame continent and the Star continent were in states of utter
chaos. They had many small kingdoms, as well as many Diremonsters,
clans and sects that caused a state of turmoil to be maintained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Great sinners can be
found amidst great chaos. Perhaps I might also find an individual of
great karmic merit who has escaped notice,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Space rippled around
him, and Ning then disappeared from midair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Crescent world. The
Star continent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A flying shuttle was
flying through the skies at high speed. Within the shuttle were a
group of cultivators, with the leader being a man and two women. The
other six were all servants and guards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Qi Empire has
been abandoned to those monsters. Why won’t they let us be?!” A
violet-robed woman spoke out, her eyes filled with rage. “When we
hide in mountain wilds, the Diremonsters still find us and chase us.
Our imperial clan of the Qi Empire is now extremely puny; we aren’t
a threat to them at all. Why won’t they let us be?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little sister.” A
black-robed maiden next to her shook her head. “The monster king
who has taken over our Qi Empire has given the order to completely
exterminate our imperial clan of Qi. None are to be spared. The
countless monsters under that monster king’s command are naturally
going to chase us and kill us. Only by killing us will they have
rendered merits and be rewarded by the monster king.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So are we just going
to keep running and running?” The violet-robed maiden gritted her
teeth. “I’ve had enough of this life of fleeing. I started
fleeing when I was a child, and it has now been several decades. I’ve
been running away this entire time. I have had enough. Enough! Let’s
go all out against these demons. Big brother, second sister, let’s
fight them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shut your mouth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tall, muscular man
who was on his feet growled softly, “Our imperial clan has existed
for tens of thousands of years; now, only the three of us still
remain. Even our uncle ended up dying when he fought against those
demons to try and protect us. We are alive because of the sacrifices
of countless subordinates. We absolutely cannot just throw our lives
away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then what should we
do? That monster king is so powerful; how are we supposed to escape
him? And where can we run to?” The violet-robed woman said with
rage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tall man growled,
“By now, there’s no other choices for us. The only choice is…to
go to the Viledragon River!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, everyone
fell silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two younger sisters
who were behind him as well as all of the servants fell silent. Their
eyes were filled with amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Viledragon River?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Star continent was
vast and boundless. There was no way these three imperial scions and
their servants could fly out from the Star continent. Within the Star
continent, however, Viledragon River was one of the most famous and
largest rivers of all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Viledragon River cut
through a large half of the entire Star continent. It was
incomparably wide; even at the narrowest points, it was at least
eight hundred kilometers across, and up to a thousand or more at its
thickest. As far as its length…given that it cut through most of
the Star continent and was a sinuous, undulating river, one could
imagine how unfathomably long it was!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to legend,
after a primordial Viledragon was killed, its body was transformed
into this river. But of course, this was too extravagant a legend and
there was no way to verify its authenticity. Still…Viledragon River
truly was bizarre. Anyone who moved within a thousand kilometers of
it would become completely unable to fly, and also become unable to
use evasive techniques based off the Five Elements. Supposedly, even
Celestial Immortal Patriarchs who neared this Viledragon River would
also be unable to fly or use evasive techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From this, one could
see how bizarre Viledragon River was!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, Viledragon
River also had some dangerous zones inside of it which even Immortal
cultivators did not dare to charge into.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no way to
fly within Viledragon River, and no way to use evasive techniques. It
will be very hard for the monsters to catch us within it,” the tall
man growled. “I trust that they will also be nervous, and won’t
dare to chase us all the way into Viledragon River.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…that’s
Viledragon River,” the black-robed maiden said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re trying to
find a way to stay alive in an impossibly lethal situation. It
doesn’t matter how dangerous Viledragon River is! In addition,
Viledragon River is enormous, and it cuts through more than half of
the Star continent. Actually, most of it is quite safe; only a few
parts of it are dangerous. If we are lucky, we can find a safe island
and start life anew there. We can build up our power on the island,
and in the future, we can slaughter that monster king and take back
the Qi Empire,” the tall man said. “Second sister, little
sister…we have no other paths to take.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two girls gritted
their teeth and nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Life or death…it
comes down to this toss of the dice,” the black-robed woman said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Let’s do
it.” The violet-robed maiden gritted her teeth as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Viledragon River. The
waters of the river frothed and bubbled with unnatural turbidity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Viledragon River.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother, up
ahead is Viledragon river.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here we are.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The man, two women, and
six guards quickly arrived at the banks of Viledragon River. They
stared at the turbid waters. They could already sense the invisible,
nameless ripples of power emanating from the entire Viledragon River.
They couldn’t help but feel terrified; Viledragon River was simply
too famous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hey, big brother,
second sister, hurry and look over there.” The violet-robed maiden
pointed at the distant, wide Viledragon River. Aboard the river, a
wooden boat was slowly sailing forward. Atop the wooden ship was a
fur-clad youth who was holding and playing a bamboo flute.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone present was an
Immortal cultivator; given their perfect vision, they were able to
see this person clearly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This youth actually
dares to sit on a boat on Viledragon River and leisurely play the
flute?” The black-robed woman was extremely startled as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If he is an Immortal
cultivator…no matter how powerful he is, he should still be
extremely cautious right now.” The tall man frowned. “Can he be
an ordinary mortal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Viledragon
River was reputed to be dangerous, that was only in some parts of it.
There were often some stupidly brave mortals who would try to show
off their valor and sail on a ship atop Viledragon River. And indeed,
there were some mortals who were lucky enough to be able to sail on
Viledragon River for months, then come back to tell the tale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother, that
youth is coming over here!” The violet-robed maiden called out in
alarm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fur-clad youth’s
ship, which had previously been following the currents of the river,
suddenly turned. The oars on the boat began to strike against the
water, kicking up waves of white froth as it moved closer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning used his hands to
steer the boat, beaming as he stared at the individuals on the
distant shore. His divine sense had covered this region long ago, and
he saw that amongst the crowd, there was a female servant who was
emanating a golden light detectable only by his divine sense. The
golden light of karmic virtue was at least nine hundred meters long
and was utterly astonishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How very lucky I am!
I found a person of great karmic virtue quite quickly.” Ning felt
incomparably delighted.
</P>

Chapter 15 - The Survivors of the Qi Empire
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having descended
onto the Star continent, Ning had sailed down the Viledragon River,
continuously sweeping his surrounding region with divine sense. He
had already searched for nearly half a month, but he hadn’t found a
single person of great karmic virtue or great karmic sin. Today, he
had been leisurely relaxing on his boat while playing his bamboo
flute…but he had actually run into a person of great karmic virtue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The oars of the
boat continued to sweep forward, sending the boat towards the shore.
Ning walked out of his boat and onto the shore.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the distant group of
imperial Qi clansmen walked over, they saw Ning disembark through a
very ordinary method. They couldn’t help but feel even more
convinced that he was an ordinary mortal. The weakest in their group
was at least a Zifu Disciple; why would they view an ordinary mortal
with any care? And yet…this mortal was walking straight towards
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother, he’s
actually walking towards us,” the black-robed princess sent
mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A puny little
mortal…if we were back in our imperial palace, he would’ve been
killed long ago for trying to stand in our way.” The violet-robed
princess had a hint of darkness in her eyes. After having fled for so
many years, her heart had become filled with hate and darkness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t cause
unnecessary trouble.” Their leader, the tall youth, just spread out
his majestic aura. He was the most powerful figure in this squad of
theirs, a Wanxiang Adept.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An invisible aura of
power came crashing downwards. Any mortal faced with this aura of a
Wanxiang Adept would instantly quiver and become utterly terrified.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” After
having released his aura, the imperial prince led his two younger
sisters and his guards towards Viledragon River. They couldn’t be
bothered to act against a mortal as they were fleeing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…” Suddenly,
loud laughter rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial prince,
the two princesses, and the guards all turned to stare in
astonishment. That fur-clad youth who they had assumed to be a mortal
was standing there, laughing. The fleeing imperial prince of Qi
naturally understood right away that this backwater youth was clearly
not a mortal. A mortal would have been quivering supinely on the
ground by now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An invisible aura of
might and power swept out from Ning like an enormous tidal wave,
smashing towards the imperial Qi group.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of their faces
changed. This backwater youth…he was no mortal. He was someone
whose power vastly outstripped theirs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My name is Shi Feng.
These are my family retainers. Dare I ask who you are, senior?” The
tall imperial prince immediately spoke out with great respect. At the
same time, he produced a tiny bead of water on his finger. He
pretended to scratch his eyes, but in reality he pressed that bead of
water onto them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial prince
lifted his head to take a look. He saw the ripples of power emanating
from the backwater youth, then immediately sent mentally to his two
little sister, “Ruyu, Ruhui, judging from the ripples this
backwater youth is emanating, he should be at the peak Primal
level…and he doesn’t seem to have any ill intentions. We
absolutely cannot make an enemy out of him. Each time we use up one
of our protective treasures, that is one less that we will never get
back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood, big
brother,” the black-robed princess sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s just a Primal
Daoist. If our imperial father were here…how could a Primal Daoist
like him possibly behave so arrogantly in front of us?” The
violet-robed princess felt relaxed; she no longer felt afraid. They
were of the imperial clan, after all; although their nation had
collapsed, they had quite a few treasures on them. They had remained
alive for several decades despite being continuously pursued; this
was proof of their ability to stay alive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clearly, they were
confident in being able to escape from a single Primal Daoist by
using up some treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am Darknorth. For
us to meet here today is destiny.” After releasing his aura, Ning
then said, “Come aboard my boat and drink a few cups of wine?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could tell that
these individuals had moved towards Viledragon River with the intent
of sailing atop it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Viledragon River was
extremely famous, and of these nine only a single was at the Wanxiang
Adept level. The other eight were all merely Zifu Disciples. Why was
it that they dared to come to Viledragon River?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Others might fear
Viledragon River, but Ning was Patriarch Subhuti’s disciple. He
often chatted with his fellow disciples, and had learned about some
of the secrets of this Crescent world. Naturally, he had no fear of
Viledragon River.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since senior
Darknorth has invited us, we shall naturally comply.” The imperial
prince immediately accepted the offer. They were going sailing to
begin with; with a peak Primal Daoist by their side, they might have
a helper.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning waved his
finger, and instantly the wooden boat expanded in size, expanding to
a three hundred meter long ship. The nine figures immediately boarded
the large ship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the deck of the
ship appeared chairs, tables, fine wine, and spirit-fruit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sit.” Ning sat
down at the host’s position. The imperial prince and the two
princesses all sat down, while the other guards remained standing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shi Feng.” Ning’s
gaze fell upon the female maidservant whose body was covered by the
golden light of karmic virtue. The golden light surrounding her
appeared incomparably majestic and vast; it was at least nine hundred
meters long. That was as long as some of Earth’s rivers were wide;
from this, one could imagine how utterly astonishing this young
woman’s karmic light of virtue was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She is your
maidservant?” Ning pointed at the maidservant standing behind the
seated violet-robed princess.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial prince
smiled. “Indeed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is her name?
What is her history? Tell me of her,” Ning said. As Ning saw it…it
wouldn’t be too hard for him to take this maiden away from these
people. However, this was his first time taking on a disciple! Ning
naturally wanted to get an idea as to what sort of personality this
maiden had. Her golden light of karmic virtue might be a result of
her actions in her previous life; it was hard to say what she was
like in this life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If she had a negative
personality, Ning would rather go find another person with karmic
virtue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Her name is Qi
Xiaoyu 1; she came from a backwater place,” the imperial prince
said with a laugh. “An elder of my family saw that she was
talented, and so took her on as a disciple when she was very young
and taught her cultivation. The elder doted on her fiercely; although
she is a servant in name, in reality she can be described as my
junior apprentice-sister.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Qi Xiaoyu?” Ning
raised an eyebrow, then turned to look at her. Her appearance was
quite pretty; although she was inferior to Yu Wei, she was still
quite a beauty. In addition, there was a resolved look in her eyes;
clearly, her Dao-heart was excellent as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Qi Xiaoyu, come here
and sit.” Ning waved his hand, and another table filled with fine
wine and spirit-fruit appeared next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qi Xiaoyu stood there,
hesitating slightly as she looked towards the imperial prince and the
two princesses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial prince
instructed, “Senior Darknorth has already given you instructions;
why don’t you go to him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Qi
Xiaoyu immediately walked obediently towards the table, but she
didn’t touch the wind or the spirit-fruit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked towards Qi
Xiaoyu. He could sense that this maiden had an invisible sort of
magnetism that caused one to naturally gravitate towards her and want
to befriend her. “Is this what it is like to be blessed with
tremendous karmic virtue? This is my first time seeing her, but I
can’t help but feel kindly inclined towards her.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiaoyu,” Ning
spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Darknorth,”
Qi Xiaoyu replied with great respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tell me about your
life, from youth til now,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qi Xiaoyu looked
towards the imperial prince and the two princesses. In truth, this
request of Ning’s was rather excessive. Still, the imperial
clansmen didn’t wish to offend Ning. This was one of the benefits
of being powerful; as long as Ning didn’t go way too far, the
imperial prince and princesses wouldn’t quibble too much.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial prince
nodded gently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qi Xiaoyu immediately
said, “Senior, when I was young, I lived in a tribe with a few tens
of thousands of individuals known as the Bluecliff tribe. The chief
of the Bluecliff tribe was my great-grandfather. When I was young, I
was without a worry in the world. I was very happy…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As she spoke, a look of
happiness appeared on Qi Xiaoyu’s face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, my tribe
suffered an attack from Diremonsters. Our tribesmen were all forced
to flee in defeat. My family all died, and as I was fleeing, I
encountered Master…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning listened quietly.
At his current level, Ning could clearly sense the changes in Qi
Xiaoyu’s soul! If she lied, Ning would immediately be able to tell.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning was revealing
his power, forcibly inviting the imperial Qi clansmen onto the ship,
then asking Qi Xiaoyu about her history…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the skies more than
ten thousand kilometers away, there was a giant black ship. The giant
black ship had twelve black-armored figures aboard it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant black ship
had a single flag atop its mast; the flag had the diagram of a pair
of flaming wings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Local monsters and
Immortal cultivators would immediately be able to tell…that this
was the legendary Flamewing Guard, which many powers were in absolute
dread of.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Captain, the
survivors of the imperial Qi clan really know how to flee. It has
been so many years, but they still haven’t been wiped out yet. Our
Flamewing Guard have been chasing them for this entire time.” A
skinny man with scales on his face let out a sigh as he spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are indeed
skilled at flight. For the Qi Empire to be able to take over a
territory of a million kilometers over the course of just a few tens
of thousands of years, and for them to have been able to kill so many
Diremonsters at the Earth Immortal or Loose Immortal level…how many
treasures must they have? In addition, given how rapid their rise to
power was, there are many who believe that the founding emperor of
the Qi Empire had acquired an enormous treasure trove. Regardless of
whether or not that is true, these fleeing survivors most assuredly
have many treasures on them. We’ve chased after and attacked them
so many times, but they’ve always been able to flee.” A massively
muscular black-armored man replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next to him was an
alluring woman who had a plume on her head. She laughed beautifully.
“Captain…no matter what, more and more of the surviving imperial
Qi clansmen have been killed by us during the pursuit. The last time
we attacked them, we killed the final Primal Daoist the imperial Qi
clansmen had. The only three survivors of the imperial Qi clan are
the crown prince and those two princesses.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They don’t even
have Primal Daoists with them; they are going to die soon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we can kill the
crown prince and the two princesses, we will have rendered a great
merit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the survivors
of the imperial Qi clan were very weak…they represented the last
remnants of their clan. Many of the treasures of the Qi Empire, and
perhaps even the Dao-Repository of the Qi Empire, were undoubtedly
being carried by the crown prince.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Suddenly, the
massively muscular black-armored man was startled. He waved his hand,
and a fireseed appeared within it. The fireseed was trembling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are within ten
thousand kilometers of the survivors of the imperial Qi clan!” The
black-armored man revealed a look of delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, this time we
are going to catch them all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve rendered
incredible merits.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They don’t even
have a single Primal Daoist with them. Wanxiang Adepts? Killing them
is as easy as chopping lettuce!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The soldiers of the
Flamewing Guard were all extremely excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There had long been
rumors that the reason why the Qi Empire had risen to power so
quickly was because they had acquired an enormous treasure trove. As
a result, even the Flamewing King had grown envious, and he had led
his Diremonster army to annihilate the entire Qi Empire! He had
seized all of the important treasure troves of the Qi Empire. As for
the surviving imperial clansmen, the Flamewing King couldn’t be
bothered to kill them personally; he simply ordered his subordinates
to handle it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we were to kill
these survivors, we can just offer the most precious treasures to the
King. As for the other treasures…” The twelve soldiers of the
Flamewing Guard looked at each other and smiled. Their eyes flashed
with greed and viciousness. Their monstrous king was savage, and his
soldiers were also quite savage as well.

Chapter 16 - Flamewing Guard
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The waves of the vast
Viledragon River crashed down like the stampede of ten thousand
stallions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aboard the giant ship.
After chatting for a period of time, Ning felt as though his mind had
been settled. The little lass named Qi Xiaoyu had very little
experience; she was as pure as a sheet of white paper. In addition,
she was clearly quite respectful towards the young man and the two
sisters; she continuously watched for the young man’s signals
before acting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Based on what she
said, she’s only trained for twenty years. Those blessed by great
karmic virtue are indeed talented. And…she isn’t a bad person.”
Ning nodded lightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He didn’t require
that his disciples be perfect; however, they couldn’t be evildoers.
Given his current level of enlightenment, it was very simple for him
to judge and assess a mere Zifu Disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I like Xiaoyu very
much,” Ning said. “Since Xiaoyu’s former master has already
perished…I wonder, Shi Feng, if you would be willing to give her up
and let her become my disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The waves of the vast
Viledragon River continued to crash down resoundingly…but within
the ship, things had fallen silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qi Xiaoyu was
completely speechless. She hurriedly shook her head repeatedly as she
looked towards the crown prince.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crown prince and
the princesses had changed looks on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Darknorth
really thinks too highly of himself,” the violet-robed princess
sent angrily. “He actually wants to take Xiaoyu as his disciple.
Xiaoyu is blessed by karmic virtue; she can provide karmic luck to
our entire imperial clan. How can we give her away to a random Primal
Daoist?! Hmph, even if an Earth Immortal or Loose Immortal wants to
take away Xiaoyu, we still shouldn’t agree hastily, to say nothing
of this Darknorth!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother,” the
black-robed princess sent mentally as well, “What should we do? We
definitely can’t let Xiaoyu just be taken away, but this Darknorth
wishes to take her as a disciple…what should we do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crown prince was
frowning. The roots of their imperial clan were very deep, and in the
past, they had Primal Daoists of their own! A simple sweep of divine
sense had allowed them to know that ‘Qi Xiaoyu’ had an utterly
astonishing level of karmic virtue. Thus, they had done everything
they could to take Qi Xiaoyu into their fold, and had even bestowed
her with the imperial surname of ‘Qi’. They had shown her
incomparable favor, causing her to feel incomparably grateful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiaoyu is an
important chess piece. This Darknorth is just a Primal Daoist…we
absolutely cannot give her to him,” the crown prince sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the crown prince and
the princesses were conversing mentally, Qi Xiaoyu said hurriedly,
“Senior Darknorth, I received great benevolence from Master and
cannot betray…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said, “So long
as you are willing to allow Xiaoyu to be my disciple, then I will
repay you with magic treasures.” As he spoke, he suddenly produced
ten Heaven-ranked flying swords that emanated watery ripples of
power. The strength of these ripples caused everyone present to feel
a sense of pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ten high-grade
Heaven-ranked flying swords. What do you say?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems this
seemingly rustic Daoist Darknorth is actually quite wealthy,” the
violet-robed princess sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heaven-ranked magic
treasures are very important to Primal Daoists. It isn’t easy for
one of them to produce ten. It seems he truly does want to take
Xiaoyu as his disciple. Unfortunately for him, as far our imperial Qi
clan is concerned, ten high-grade Heaven-ranked flying swords are
nothing,” the crown prince sent back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the three
feigned looks of amazement, in their hearts they remained quite calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing this, Ning
frowned slightly. “How about a hundred high-grade Heaven-ranked
flying swords?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a dense
cluster of a hundred Heaven-ranked flying swords appeared in the air
above the ship. The ripples emanating from each Heaven-ranked flying
sword were enough to cause the Wanxiang Adept and eight Zifu
Disciples present to feel an enormous sense of pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This, this…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qi Xiaoyu was
completely stunned. A hundred high-grade Heaven-ranked flying swords?
To take her on as disciple, this man was willing to take out this
many magic treasures? Although she wasn’t willing to betray the
clan, the actions of this ‘senior’ Darknorth who looked like a
youth still caused her to feel a hint of delight. For this senior
Darknorth to be willing to offer such a high price was testament to
how much he valued her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A hundred!” The
crown prince and the princesses felt desire now. Although they had
quite a few treasures on them, over the course of decades of pursuit
after the destruction of their country, with so many of their experts
having perished and their treasures having been taken…the total
number of treasures they had was now limited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hundred high-grade
Heaven-ranked flying swords was worth five hundred thousand kilograms
of liquefied elemental essence!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Primal Daoist
has actually taken out this many Heaven-ranked flying swords.” The
violet-robed princess’s eyes were blazing. “Big brother…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The three of you!”
Ning controlled the hundred Heaven-ranked flying swords which hovered
above them as he frowned and barked, “This is enough. Don’t go
too far!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crown prince
naturally wanted these items. But he knew quite well that these
hundred Heaven-ranked flying swords would be of almost no use to them
in their flight. Even if they went to a city and traded it for some
elemental essence, what good would that be? They already had some
protective, fleeing items; if they bought a few more copies, that
wouldn’t make a huge difference.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Darknorth,”
the crown prince said respectfully, “For you to give up a hundred
high-grade Heaven-ranked flying swords in exchange for having Xiaoyu
follow you as her disciple is of course acceptable. However…it
isn’t that we aren’t willing, it is that after Xiaoyu became a
Zifu Disciple, she swore an oath to the Dao of the Heavens to be
loyal to my clan. For you to force her to leave would be to cause her
to violate her oath. She will immediately perish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned. “The
oaths a servant swears to the Dao of the Heavens…but the master can
generally gift the servants to others.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was extremely common
for major clans to give away Deathsworn, for example. Thus, when
servants swore an oath to the Dao of the Heavens, they would
generally say that they would follow the clan leader’s orders in
all things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That is true.
However, that requires the clan leader of my Stone clan to agree. I
cannot agree in his stead,” the crown prince said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face instantly
sank. As it did, the hearts of the crown prince and the others all
clenched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand.
The hundred high-grade Heaven-ranked flying swords in the sky all
vanished, and he gave the crown prince a cold look. “You are
lying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lying?” The crown
prince was flabbergasted. “I didn’t lie…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You say that you are
Shi Feng? That was a lie! You said that you are unable to permit
Xiaoyu to be my disciple and that you need the clan leader to agree;
this, too, was a lie!” Ning said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crown prince was
startled. The two princesses were shocked as well. Indeed, the crown
prince’s name was not Shi Feng; rather, it was Qi Rufeng! His
surname was ‘Qi’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only members of the
imperial Qi clan left were the three of them; thus, the crown prince
Qi Rufeng was the leader of the clan. As long as he agreed, he could
give Qi Xiaoyu to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t lie.”
The crown prince wanted to keep up his false front.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Would you dare swear
an oath to the Dao of the Heavens stating that you didn’t lie? So
long as you dare to swear this oath, I will gift you with those
hundred high-grade Heaven-ranked flying swords and leave on the
spot.” Ning’s face sank even further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qi Rufeng and his two
sisters both felt pressure now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since Darknorth
won’t accept a soft refusal, let’s give him a hard one. Ten years
ago, back when the old servants were alive, he would’ve been killed
long ago by now.” The violet-robed princess sent an angry mental
message to the other two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning suddenly
turned his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?” The crown
prince and the others turned their head as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A group of figures had
appeared on the distant shores of the Viledragon River. There were a
total of twelve figures, all dressed in black armor and staring in
their direction. On their bracers were emblazoned the logo of a
flaming wing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These twelve warriors
stared in their direction. Their captain, the massively muscular
black-armored man, was holding a flamewing bug in his hands, a cold
smile on his face. He pointed towards the distance. “The survivors
of the Qi Empire are over there. Do it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them emanated
incomparably savage auras. The twelve soldiers instantly transformed
their shape. One became an enormous horned rhino, another into a
three-tailed fox, a third into a coiling serpent, a fourth into a
white-furred bear…but they all shared a single commonality. All of
them wore black armor. With the giant horned rhino at the center, the
other soldiers spread out, filling and cycling their elemental ki
through their Dao-armor and joining together into a whole.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous venomous
bug that had fiery wings suddenly appeared in the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Flamewing
Guard.” The faces of the crown prince and the others changed
dramatically. They had suffered miserably for the past few decades
under the pursuit of the Flamewing Guard; the Flamewing Guard was
their nightmare, a nightmare they had never been able to escape. The
Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals of their clan had all perished;
even all of their Primal Daoists had perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were the only ones
left. How could they resist the Flamewing Guard?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although this was just
a small squad of the Guard, the imperial clansmen knew quite well
that each squad of the Flamewing Guard was led by a Primal
Diremonster as well as eleven Wanxiang Diremonsters who were capable
of joining together into a Dao-soldier formation. After they assumed
the formation…even peak Primal Daoists would probably find it hard
to do anything to these Diremonsters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should we do?”
The black-robed woman frantically sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no way to
use evasive techniques here on the Viledragon River, and there’s no
way to fly. We have to rely on the ship.” The crown prince was
panicking as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have this Darknorth
go block them. He is a peak Primal Daoist; he can definitely buy us
some time,” the violet-robed princess sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment,
the enormous bug with flaming wing charged straight into the
Viledragon River. It flew through the river, moving as fast as
lightning. It was about to arrive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and die!”
An enraged bellow rang out from the enormous flamewing bug.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is my ship.”
Ning stood on the prow of the ship, staring at the enormous flamewing
bug that was flying towards him. “Hurry up and beat it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crown prince and
the others instantly felt overjoyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wonderful. This
Darknorth has actively gone out to engage it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let him help us
block them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ideally, this
Darknorth and the Flamewing Guard will kill each other. We can then
acquire all of Darknorth’s treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Flamewing Guard
were famous for their savagery. Local cultivators and monsters
would’ve fled long ago in the face of their arrival. They didn’t
expect that today, they would run into someone who didn’t fear them
at all. Behind them stood the fearsome Flamewing King! What they
didn’t realize…was that behind Ning stood Patriarch Subhuti.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since you dare to
try and stop the Flamewing Guard, you can die with them!” The green
eyes of the enormous flamewing were filled with viciousness as it let
out a shrill, enraged screech.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The flamewing
bug soared towards the boat, and a blurry green fog appeared around
it, causing the crown prince’s group to be filled with terror. They
hurriedly retreated, setting down a formation in the surrounding area
to defend. The hideous insectoid head of the massive flamewing bug
shot outwards through the mist, attacking Ning atop the board of the
ship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head.
“You truly are seeking death!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aboard the ship, the
formerly ordinary-looking Ji Ning suddenly exploded forth with a
terrifyingly powerful presence. The world itself seemed to instantly
grow silent, and even the powerful, turbid waves of the Viledragon
River went still. In fact, the waves and even sea spray suddenly
froze mid-motion. The enormous flamewing bug was paralyzed in its
attacking posture as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial Qi
clansmen who were hiding behind their formation were all frozen as
well. Some had frozen looks of astonishment on their faces, others
had mouths open, while still others were mid-step. They were all
frozen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire world had
turned still.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wind had stopped.
The water had stopped. The people had stopped. The monsters had
stopped. Everything had stopped.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That vast, terrifying
presence caused everyone present to feel terrified. The crown prince
and the others couldn’t even change their facial expressions…but
shock and terror could be seen in their eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this region, only
Ning alone was the same as he had been before. He stood there atop
the prow of his ship, staring at the giant flamewing bug before him.
He shook his head and sighed. “It was you who sought death. You
have no one else to blame.”

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twelve Diremonsters
that had formed into the massive Dao-soldier formation of a giant
flamewing bug were all filled with terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This formation was
formed by a Primal Diremonster leading eleven Wanxiang Diremonsters.
Through the Dao-soldier formation, they were extremely powerful when
fighting together, and only foes who at least had the power of a
Loose Immortals or Earth Immortals were able to do anything to them.
They had held this fur-clad youth atop the ship’s prow in no
regard…but now, just standing there without moving at all, the
fur-clad youth had unleashed such an aura of majestic power that they
were completely frozen!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where did this
expert come from?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How…how can he be
so terrifying?! What level of insight into the Dao has he reached?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The monsters were
completely stunned. They had held the fur-clad youth in no regard and
wanted to just dispose of him…but now they realized they had
stomped down on a giant steel plate that was harder than any they had
ever seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! One
streak of light after another appeared in the skies. They instantly
pierced through the enormous flamewing bug and the twelve
Diremonsters within it. The Primal Diremonster, the Wanxiang
Diremonsters…they all instantly perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood at the prow
of his ship, looking at the twelve dead Diremonsters. He couldn’t
help but shake his head and chuckle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Killing these twelve
Diremonsters was as easy as waving his hand. They had actually dared
to assault him without even saying a few words to him; naturally,
Ning had shown no mercy in dealing with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for why Ning was
laughing…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was because he was
thinking back to the ancient Fiendgod he had met back in the wild
marshes of the Gaol Mountains. “When I had encountered that ancient
Fiendgod, the Dao Domain the Fiendgod unleashed was enough to freeze
everything, causing me to be unable to move…and now, I just used
the exact same sort of technique to kill a squad that was far more
powerful than I was back then, led by that Primal Diremonster.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dao Domains…through
one’s mastery and insights into a Dao, one could use the power of
the natural world to form a Domain that solely belonged to one’s
self!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dao Domains,
Dao-Realms, Grand Dao Domains…although they had differing levels of
power, in truth, they were all variations on Dao Domains. They shared
the same principles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Rainwater
Sword Domain was also a sort of Dao Domain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At a higher level,
after one mastered a complete Dao-Path, one’s mastery over the
energy of the natural world would become even stronger; this was what
was known as a Dao-Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, that
only referred to lesser Daos!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were also Grand
Dao Domains. They belonged to Grand Daos, and were actually even more
powerful than Dao-Realms. And beyond them were the Grand Dao-Realms!
After one completely mastered an entire Grand Dao, one would be able
to summon an even more terrifying amount of natural energy than Ning
was currently able to. In the face of this sort of power, even Loose
Immortals or Earth Immortals would probably be paralyzed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dao Domains were linked
to one’s insight into the Dao. The higher one’s level of
insights, the more natural energy of Heaven and Earth one could
activate. As one’s insights into a Grand Dao increased, the power
of the Grand Dao Domain would similarly increase, until finally it
reached the Grand Dao-Realm level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s level of
insight into the Dao of the Sword was already at Immortal
Northwalker’s level! This level of insight was even superior to the
level which that ancient Fiendgod of the Gaol Mountains had
possessed. Thus, just by using his Dao Domain, he had been able to
completely suppress those twelve Diremonsters who had been in a
Dao-soldier formation, to the point of making it completely
impossible for them to fight back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everything was back to
normal now. The waves of the Viledragon River continued to crash
forward, and the large ship continued to sail forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The survivors of the Qi
Empire, standing atop the deck of the ship, stared towards Ning in
utter terror and unease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The survivors of the
Qi Empire?” Ning sat down relaxedly, then said slowly, “Are you
still trying to hide it, given the situation? Are you still going to
try and tell me that your name is Shi Feng?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crown prince Qi
Rufeng exchanged glances with the two princesses. The guards behind
them looked towards Ning with fear in their gazes as well. The look
in Qi Xiaoyu’s eyes was especially complicated. This Daoist
Darknorth wanted to take her on as his disciple, and the power he had
just displayed was truly inconceivable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother, what
should we do? When the Flamewing Guard attacked, they revealed our
true identities. This Darknorth knows that we are of the imperial Qi
clan,” the black-robed woman sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Word of the
destruction of our Qi Empire has long since spread. This Darknorth
must know very well by now that we are the lucky survivors of the
imperial clan. He might act to seize our treasures,” the
violet-robed princess sent frantically. “We need to seize the
advantage and use up our magic treasures to kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Idiocy. Although the
remnant treasures of the Qi Empire are in my hands, I have no
confidence in being able to deal with this Darknorth.” Crown Prince
Qi Rufeng sent back with anger, “Just by relying on his Dao Domain,
he was able to summon enough energy from the Heavens and the Earth to
cause a squad of the Flamewing Guard to be completely unable to move.
His insights into the Dao are superior to those of even supreme Earth
Immortals and Loose Immortals. Although judging from the ripples of
power emanating from him, he should still be a peak Primal Daoist,
his power is definitely at the Earth Immortal or Loose Immortal
level. And given that he was able to so easily bring out a hundred
high-grade Heaven-ranked flying swords, he certainly has powerful
treasures of his own. I imagine that he has the power of a supreme
Loose Immortal or Earth Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His nation had once
spanned a million kilometers. The final survivors, including the
crown prince of the nation, naturally had quite a few formidable
treasures of their own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then what should we
do?” The violet-robed princess was panicking now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We only have two
Greater Teleportation Dao-seals; at most, two of us can escape,”
the crown prince said. “This Daoist Darknorth hasn’t moved to
attack us yet; we can still negotiate with him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Let’s
negotiate,” the violet-robed princess said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have no other
choices,” the black-robed princess sent as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning watched as the
crown prince and the two princesses stealthily sent mental messages
to each other. Previously, when they had first boarded the ship, they
had felt mentally superior to Ning; they had believed him to merely
be a Primal Daoist, and that by relying on their imperial treasures
they could deal with him. Now, however, they didn’t even think
about fighting back against him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” Crown
Prince Qi Rufeng said respectfully, “I imagine that since you have
heard what the Flamewing Guard said, you already know the truth. It
is true. We are indeed of the imperial Qi clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">News of the destruction
of the Qi Empire was extremely wide-spread. Virtually all of the at
least somewhat powerful cultivators in the surrounding million
kilometers knew about this matter. However, although Ning had arrived
at the Star continent half a month ago, he actually didn’t know
about this matter at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning calmly sipped his
wine as he listened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qi Rufeng continued
nervously, “Ever since our Qi Empire was destroyed by the Flamewing
King, the imperial Qi clan has been fleeing. The Flamewing Guard has
never let up on their pursuit of us…and so we had to be cautious. I
was forced to report a false name, ‘Shi Feng’, to you. My true
name is Qi Rufeng! A prince of the Qi Empire!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prince?” Ning
gently murmured this word, but continued to look at Qi Rufeng.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qi Rufeng hurriedly
continued, “This is my little sister, Qi Ruyu. This is another
little sister, Qi Ruhui.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced sideways
at the two; the black-robed princess was Qi Ruyu, while the
violet-robed princess was Qi Ruhui.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wise. You didn’t
continue to lie.” Ning just sat there. “If you continue to lie…I
probably will no longer have the patience to talk to you. I’d just
kill you and take away the treasures of your imperial Qi clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crown prince and
the princesses felt their hearts tremble as they heard this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said calmly, “I
wish to take Qi Xiaoyu as my disciple. I imagine that all you need to
do is nod and agree to it. Do not lie to me. If you lie…I will
know.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The difference in power
between the two was simply too vast. In addition, Ning’s soul was
extraordinarily powerful; this was why Ning was so confident. If the
crown prince’s soul was a bit stronger, however, then Ning would no
longer be so sure of himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is true. So long
as I agree, I can indeed give Qi Xiaoyu to you, senior,” the crown
prince said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then why haven’t
you done so?” Ning snapped softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crown prince, Qi
Rufeng, just shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want those
hundred high-grade Heaven-ranked flying swords?” Ning looked at
him, then said calmly, “I can give them to you. However…don’t
go too far. Taking your life would be as easy as turning over my
hand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t want
flying swords.” Crown Prince Qi Rufeng looked at Ning. “I want
you, senior, to protect our imperial clan for a hundred years! If you
agree to protect us for a hundred years, then I will immediately
allow Qi Xiaoyu to take you on as master, and…after a hundred
years, I definitely won’t hinder you in any way. If you want to
leave then, you can!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face sank, and
a cold light flashed through his eyes. “You are courting death!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qi Rufeng actually
began to laugh, laugh in a mad manner. “Courting death? Right, I am
indeed courting death. Senior, you have no idea how pitiful the lives
of myself and my two little sisters have been. Ever since the Qi
Empire was annihilated many decades ago, we have been under constant
pursuit. Every day, we are filled with terror and unease. One
clansman after another has perished, one elder relative after another
has died, and one sibling after another has perished. Many imperial
Qi clansmen had fled with us…but now, only three of us remain. I’m
the only surviving male of our entire imperial Qi clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, it’s
enough. I’ve had enough! My little sister here is already unable to
endure the stress; she wanted to fight those Flamewing Guards to the
death. Although Ruyu has never said it aloud…I know that she is
tired as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And in truth, I am
even more tired!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qi Rufeng stared at
Ning, tears in his eyes. “I’m the final male survivor. The three
of us are the only survivors of the entire imperial clan, and I am
the most powerful of our group, a Wanxiang Adept. All of the burdens
are on my shoulders. Where shall we go? How shall we rebuild our
empire? How shall we take revenge? All of these burdens are crushing
me down. I’ve had enough. Enough! You can say that I’m courting
death or that I’m crazy. Whatever! I’ve given you my terms. If
you protect us for a century, then I will give my servant, Qi Xiaoyu,
to serve you as your disciple, senior.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Qi Xiaoyu is a
person of tremendous karmic virtue, and more than nine hundred meters
of golden light surrounds her. When the elders of our clan discovered
her, they were absolutely delighted and believed that she would be
able to provide luck to our entire imperial clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will not so easily
let Qi Xiaoyu go…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Either protect us
for a century, or kill us and let us reunite with our mother, our
father, and our many relatives.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qi Rufeng’s eyes were
filled with tears, but his voice was filled with absolute
determination.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was staking it all.
He was throwing their lives into this wager. He was tired…he didn’t
want to continue to flee in terror like this. He could tell how
powerful Ning was; with Ning as their guardian and protector, they
would have a much better chance at surviving.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother.” The
black-robed princess’s face was streaked with tears as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother, don’t
beg him. Let’s just end it all here.” The violet-robed princess
gritted her teeth, madness in her eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned. This was
trouble. He hadn’t expected that the survivors of the imperial Qi
clan felt such despair, that they had nowhere to go. He had thought
that a simple threat would have been enough…but they were now
staking everything against him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hundred years?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No chance. Ning had
only spent thirty years on Mount Innerheart, and he had agreed to
reunite with Yu Wei back in the world of the Grand Xia as soon as
possible. How could he possibly extend their reunion by a century?
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 18 - Treasure Trove
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The violet-robed
princess glared at Ji Ning. Gritting her teeth, she said, “If we
die, Xiaoyu dies as well. When the master dies, the servants shall
not live either!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly felt a
loathing for this violet-robed princess, Qi Ruhui. However, Ning knew
that since the imperial Qi clan had known all along that Qi Xiaoyu
was a figure with great karmic virtue, that they definitely would
firmly fasten her to the sides of the imperial clan. Once the
imperial clan perished, Qi Xiaoyu would probably truly die as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shut his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ship became
completely silent. Everyone stared at Ning, waiting for his response.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crown prince, Qi
Rufeng, waited with nervousness and anticipation. “Given how
powerful this senior Darknorth is…a hundred years shouldn’t be
anything to him.” How could he imagine that Ning had only lived for
a few decades?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Utter stillness!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crown prince and
the princesses were all extremely nervous. Qi Xiaoyu felt restless
and uneasy as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly opened
his eyes and looked towards the crown prince, Qi Rufeng. “I
agree…to protect you for a year or to kill the Flamewing King. Once
I complete either of these two conditions, I will take Qi Xiaoyu
away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is my response
to you. If you agree, than you shall release Qi Xiaoyu to me to be my
disciple. If you refuse, then I’ll kill you and take away your
imperial treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you agree or do
you refuse?” Ning stared at Qi Rufeng.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, it’s just
a hundred…” The crown prince, Qi Rufeng, couldn’t help but
begin to argue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You only need to
tell me…if you agree or refuse?” Ning repeated coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crown prince and
the two princesses exchanged glances. There were no other options
now! If this Daoist Darknorth was to protect them for a year…within
this year, they might have a chance for a game-changer to occur.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Qi Rufeng
gritted his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded lightly.
This was as he had expected. If he didn’t give them any benefit at
all, then they probably really would rather die. If he gave them at
least a little bit…their desire to live would take the upper hand!
And in truth, Ning wasn’t planning to actually waste a full year;
he would rather just go and kill that Flamewing King!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After killing the
Flamewing King, his promise would have been completed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then why haven’t
you given Qi Xiaoyu her freedom?” Ning looked at the crown prince.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crown prince
couldn’t help but mumble, “Please swear an oath to the Dao of the
Heavens to attest to your promise, senior, so as to put us all at
ease.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face sank, and
a true killing intent burst forth from him. “It seems you really do
wish to die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An oath to the Dao of
the Heavens was simply too powerful and restrictive; thus, Immortal
cultivators definitely would not casually swear any such oath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crown prince and
the princesses could all tell that Ning had truly lost all patience.
Terrified, the crown prince hurriedly said, “We, we are willing to
believe in your promise, senior.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Qi Xiaoyu, from this
day forth, you shall obey the instructions of senior Darknorth. There
is no longer any connection between you and the imperial Qi clan,”
Qi Rufeng said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the ripples
of the Dao of the Heavens descended within her subconscious mind.
Clearly, the oath which Qi Xiaoyu had sworn in the past to the Dao of
the Heavens had been fulfilled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qi Xiaoyu fell to her
knees. “Xiaoyu shall never forget the benevolence you have shown
me, your Imperial Highness.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, standing to one
side, just sighed to himself. Qi Xiaoyu truly was quite faithful.
However…based on what she had told him regarding her experiences,
Ning had already discovered quite a few suspicious indicators. The
tribe which Qi Xiaoyu had belonged to as a child had tens of
thousands of tribesmen; a tribe like this would rarely be attacked by
Diremonsters!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiantian-level
Diremonsters wouldn’t be able to do it, while higher-level
cultivating Diremonsters wouldn’t be willing to cause sin to gather
around them. And yet…the large tribe in which Qi Xiaoyu had lived
in as a child was attacked and destroyed. Even all of her family had
been slain…and then she just so happened to run into an expert of
the imperial Qi clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How could things be so
coincidental? The imperial Qi clan was in the middle of fleeing for
their own lives as well; how could such a concidence happen?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps the
destruction of the tribe which Qi Xiaoyu lived in as a child had
something to do with the imperial Qi clan,” Ning mused silently to
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qi Xiaoyu knelt down
towards Ning as well. “His Imperial Highness has instructed Xiaoyu
to follow you in the future and listen to your commands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at Qi
Xiaoyu, then said, “Remember this. From this day forth, you have
regained your freedom. You are neither a servant nor a slave; do not
act like one.” Ning continued, “I have never before taken on a
disciple; if you take me as your master, then you shall naturally
become the senior disciple under my tutelage. This is an important
matter for you, but also an important matter for me. I have no wish
to force this upon you; if you are willing, then you may bow to me as
my disciple. If you are unwilling, then I will send you off to some
other places with Immortal cultivation sects; I trust that they will
fight over the chance to recruit you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had his own pride.
There was no way he would force his very first disciple to accept him
as master. Given how large the Crescent world was, he could simply go
and find another person of great karmic virtue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Qi Xiaoyu was
extremely intelligent. She could tell…that the crown prince
actually treated her rather indifferently. The second princess was a
bit better, while the youngest princess actually loathed her. The
only person in the entire imperial Qi clan who had treated her with
sincerity was her master…but her master had been killed by the
pursuing Flamewing Guard long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for this Darknorth
who stood before her…Qi Xiaoyu could tell how much this ‘senior
Darknorth’ valued her. He had immediately taken out a hundred
Heaven-ranked flying swords for her, and now he had promised to
protect the imperial Qi clan. This was as good as becoming enemies
with the Flamewing Guard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of this was for the
sake of taking her on as his disciple. And if she didn’t accept him
as her master, he was still going to have to carry out his promise to
protect the imperial Qi clan for a year. From this, she could tell…he
truly cared very much about her own will and her own choice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple greets
you, Master.” The young maiden immediately fell down to her knees
and kowtowed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt a surge of
joy in his heart. He couldn’t help but laugh, then nodded his head
and said, “Good. From this day forth, you are the senior disciple
of myself, Darknorth Daoist Ji Ning. I don’t have any requirements
for my disciples, aside from one; not to be traitorous!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple
understands,” Qi Xiaoyu said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come with me.”
Ning immediately walked towards a cabin on the second level of the
ship. As he walked, he instructed, “Qi Rufeng, you can take your
people into your cabins to rest. Aboard my ship, I shall naturally
see to your protection. You have nothing to worry about.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qi Xiaoyu obediently
followed Ning to the second level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning was accepting
his first disciple. Within a city that was hundreds of thousands of
kilometers away. Within an enormous palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This palace was simply
so vast that not even sunlight could penetrate into its depths.
Within a dark, secluded courtyard, a tall, thin, red-skinned man
dressed in black robes was frowning pensively in thought.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Third brother.”
Suddenly, a voice rang out. A similarly tall and skinny man, this one
dressed in azure armor and with eyes like an incomparably savage
hawk, came walking in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seventh brother.”
The black-robed man nodded lightly. “You came.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As the Flamewing
King, you are living a carefree life of ease. Why have you summoned
so many of us brothers?” The hawk-eyed, azure-armored man asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Naturally, there is
something good I want to share,” the Flamewing King said. “Seventh
brother, you are the first to arrive, so I’ll let you know in
advance. Do you know why I spent so much effort to annihilate the Qi
Empire all those years back?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-armored,
hawk-eyed man said, puzzled, “The destruction of the Qi
Empire…didn’t you say that you felt your territory was too small,
and that you wanted to take over a large area? Was that not the real
reason? Can it be that it is as the legends claimed, that the Qi
Emperor had a treasure trove? Hahaha…I don’t believe in such
things. As far as we are concerned, not even the treasures left
behind by Celestial Immortals can be considered a ‘treasure
trove’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There is indeed a
treasure trove,” the Flamewing King said seriously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The hawk-eyed
man was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was only because
I learned of the imperial Qi clan’s huge treasure trove that I
acted against them,” the Flamewing King said. “Through torture
and soul-scouring and all other methods available to me, I learned
from the elder members of the imperial Qi clan…that the founding
emperor of the Qi Empire had indeed encountered a treasure trove.
However, he was too weak and so was only able to acquire a very small
portion of the treasure trove, including some cultivation methods,
divine abilities, and secret arts. But just by relying on this small
portion, the Qi clan was able to rapidly rise to power, establish an
empire, and then expand to the point where a few tens of thousands of
years later, they had taken over a million kilometers of land.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hawk-eyed man was
quite startled to hear this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Over the past few
tens of thousands of years, the imperial Qi clan has repeatedly
ventured forth to the location of the treasure trove, but they were
unable to make any progress,” the Flamewing King said. “After I
discovered the location of this treasure trove, I ventured there
twice. The first time, I came back with nothing to show for my
efforts. The second time, I made more ample preparations and forced
my way deeper in…but I ended up being trapped within the place for
more than twenty years. I nearly died there, and just barely managed
to escape from it a short while ago!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” The
hawk-eyed man was completely shocked. He knew exactly how powerful
this Flamewing King was. Of the major powers of the Star continent,
the ‘Twelve Monster Kings of the Eastern Flows’ were extremely
well-known. Each of them had unearthly amounts of power and extremely
large territories. The Flamewing King was one of the ‘Twelve
Monster Kings of the Eastern Flows’ and was extremely powerful.
Otherwise, how could he have annihilated the Qi Empire?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The place where this
treasure trove is located is incomparably dangerous.” The Flamewing
King shook his head. “The treasures within the outermost perimeter
of the trove have all been picked clean by the founding emperor of
the Qi Empire…but those treasures aren’t worth our attention
anyhow. Deeper within are even more powerful treasures, and the
ripples of those treasures…cause even my heart to tremble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cause your heart to
tremble?” The hawk-eyed man was intrigued as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This treasure trove
is incomparably mysterious, and I’ve always wanted to discover what
it contains. But I’m unable to find out on my own; that’s why
I’ve asked all of our brothers to join forces with me. With us
twelve kings combining our powers…I trust that we have a chance to
go deeper into the treasure trove region,” the Flamewing King said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hawk-eyed man
nodded lightly as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right as the two
monster kings were chatting…a figure suddenly appeared in the
distance, outside the courtyard. “Your Majesty, your subordinate
has a report regarding the Flamewing Guard.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The Flamewing
King glanced outside, then nodded. “Come in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A tall, skinny old man
with an extremely long neck and a furry face walked in. He glanced at
the hawk-eyed man before speaking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak. There’s
nothing you need to hide from my seventh brother,” the Flamewing
King said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” The
long-necked elder said respectfully, “Your Majesty, you instructed
us to pursue and kill the survivors of the imperial Qi clan. Only
three of them remain, with the strongest being a Wanxiang Adept.
However, just now, one of our ten-plus Flamewing Guard squads who
were chasing after them was completely wiped out. Their jade
life-tablets have all shattered. They died roughly six hundred
thousand kilometers away from us…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The Flamewing
King frowned. That didn’t make sense. This area was under the
command of himself, the Flamewing King. All the monsters obeyed his
orders, and the human cultivators had been shooed away by him long
ago. Logically speaking…there should be no one in this region who
would dare act against his Flamewing Guard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My guess is that the
survivors of the imperial Qi clan…” The long-necked elder was
about to venture a guess, but the Flamewing King interrupted him.
With a frown, the Flamewing King barked, “Arrange for three
companies of Flamewing Guards to head there and investigate. Can it
be that the survivors of the imperial Qi clan have hidden secrets
that even I am unaware of?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” the
long-necked elder said with respect, immediately accepting the order
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, three companies
of Flamewing Guards that were led by three Loose Immortal monsters
teleported away from the royal capital of the Qi Empire and moved to
investigate this affair.

Chapter 19 - Great Sinners
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Viledragon River. A
large boat was sailing through it with the currents.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a cabin on the
large boat. The crown prince, Qi Rufeng, was currently alongside his
two little sisters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“By this point…all
we can do is trust this senior Darknorth,” Qi Rufeng sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
violet-robed princess, Qi Ruhui, had a look of dissatisfaction in her
eyes. “Although Xiaoyu was just one of our servants, she was
surrounded by the light of great karmic virtue. Loose Immortals and
Earth Immortals of major clans would fight for the chance of taking
her on as a disciple. We actually let this Darknorth acquire her so
easily; he didn’t even have to swear an oath to the Dao of the
Heavens! He took advantage of how downtrodden we are; back when our
imperial clan was flourishing, we would’ve annihilated him for
daring to toy with us in such a manner!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little sister,”
the black-robed princess sent mentally, “That was then, this is
now. We are now extremely weak, and senior Darknorth had even offered
a hundred high-grade Heaven-ranked flying swords for her. This means
that he isn’t an unreasonable person. He hasn’t abandoned us
after taking her own as his disciple, and is continuing to hold fast
to his promise to protect us. Given how weak we are right now, we
should celebrate the fact that we’ve found someone who keeps his
promises.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little sister,
remember this: You are no longer a princess like you were before,”
Qi Rufeng mentally barked at her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The youngest princess
had been a child living in the palace back when the attack came; she
had been spoiled absolutely rotten. Before the elders had a chance to
teach and train her as she grew up, the entire nation had been
destroyed. They had been fleeing this entire time, and nobody had a
chance to teach her and see to her upbringing. Growing up in a state
of constant flight, the hatred and grievances in her heart had grown
increasingly strong. In fact, because the elders of the clan took
good care of Xiaoyu, she herself felt jealousy and dislike for
Xiaoyu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, since Qi
Xiaoyu was a person of great karmic virtue, the clan had ordered long
ago that she could not be assaulted or killed. Otherwise…the
princess probably would’ve arranged for Qi Xiaoyu’s death long
ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thud. Thud. Thud.
Suddenly, footsteps rang out on the stairs outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crown prince and
the two princesses looked out through the window towards the deck.
They saw a white-robed maiden walking down from the second floor. The
white-robed maiden was clearly different from other people, and a
series of ripples could be sensed coming from the magic robes she
wore.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Qi Xiaoyu?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crown prince and
princesses were greatly shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qi Xiaoyu, who had
previously been in servant clothes, now looked completely different.
Her robes were clearly extroradinary, and she had a silver bracelet
around her arm. Her pure white arms were a perfect match for the
bracelet, which made her skin look even paler. She now had a jade
hairpin affixed in her hair which gave off mysterious, powerful
ripples. As the saying goes, clothes make the man; Qi Xiaoyu was
already a person of great karmic virtue who naturally made others
feel positively towards her, and as an Immortal cultivator, her skin
and her figure were superb. Beauty, poise, a wondrous aura…and now
that she had changed clothes, she appeared even more dazzling than
the two princesses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those robes, that
bracelet…they should be extremely rare top-grade Mortal-ranked
magic treasures. As for the jade hairpin…even I can’t tell what
it is!” Qi Rufeng said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth truly is
an extraordinary figure. Although Mortal-ranked magic treasures
aren’t that precious, top-grade Mortal-ranked magic treasures…they
are still very rare.” The black-robed princess sighed in amazement.
“In addition, judging from the way in which senior Darknorth took
out a hundred high-grade Heaven-ranked magic treasures earlier, he
probably would’ve given her even better treasures, were it not for
the fact that she is still weak and can only use Mortal-ranked
treasures. That jade hairpin…it should also be a top-grade
Mortal-ranked treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The violet-robed
princess disagreed. “It’s just a bunch of Mortal-ranked items.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qi Xiaoyu walked down
the stairs, then knocked on the door to the cabin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Open the door,”
the crown prince immediately instructed. One of the guards behind him
immediately walked forward to push open the cabin door.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qi Xiaoyu walked in,
then immediately said, “Your Highness, Master wishes you to go to
him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the future,
there’s no need to refer to me as ‘your Highness’. You are now
the exalted disciple of senior Darknorth; you can just refer to me by
my name,” Crown Prince Qi Rufeng said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But young princess Qi
Ruhui said, “Xiaoyu, what sort of magic treasure is that hairpin?
Neither my big brother nor my second sister can recognize it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master said that
this is a protective treasure that can only be used once. Once the
elemental ki within it is unleashed, it can withstand the attacks of
even a supreme Loose Immortal for a space of ten breaths,” Qi
Xiaoyu replied obediently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Everyone
in the cabin was astonished. Block a supreme Loose Immortal’s
attacks for the space of ten breaths? This was definitely a supremely
valuable protective item.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, this was just
one of the many magic items left behind by Immortal Juhua. Ning felt
that it was actually rather embarrassing for him to give out
Mortal-ranked magic treasures to his first disciple; after all, she
too was now a member of Mount Innerheart. Thus, he gave her this
protective item.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To block a supreme
Loose Immortal…” The violet-robed princess gritted her teeth. She
couldn’t help but feel jealous. “This shitty slave…she sure has
some good luck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because they had been
fleeing for so long, they had often used this sort of protective,
anti-attack magic treasure. Over the course of tens of years, they
had used them all up!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qi Rufeng hurriedly
emerged from his cabin, climbing up the stairs to the second floor to
go see Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings to you,
senior Darknorth,” Qi Rufeng said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Qi Rufeng, I have
questions for you.” Ning sat there, pointing towards a chair. “You
can sit as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Qi
Rufeng immediately sat down obediently as directed. He was a person
who knew when to advance and when to retreat. There was an enormous
gap in power right now; he was completely unable to fight back
against someone like Ning. Ning had given him a promise, and he had
the feeling that this senior Darknorth was a decent person. If he had
encountered a vicious, barbaric person, that sort of person would
undoubtedly have had many ways to force him to hand over Qi Xiaoyu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I ask you this. Why
is it that you have fled for so many years from the Flamewing King
without successfully escaping?” Ning asked, puzzled, “Given how
large this Star continent is, if you run a few million kilometers
away, it will be easier for the Flamewing King to find a needle in
the sea than to find you. And yet…you’ve been fleeing in such a
haggard fashion for decades, and remain under pursuit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qi Rufeng shook his
head and sighed. “This Flamewing King was originally a venomous
pest of a type known as the ‘flamewing bug’ who cultivated the
Dao. After he led his Diremonster army to suddenly attack my Qi
Empire, the Flamewing King personally covered the entire imperial
citadel with flamewing venom. The venom filled every single palace,
and it instantly merged into the body of every single person it
touched. There’s no way to separate it from the bodies it has
touched, and in fact it even has corrupted our souls. Even Earth
Immortals or Loose Immortals are unable to get rid of this poison.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning was
surprised. Flamewing bugs? He had never heard of this sort of
venomous bug back in the Grand Xia world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This flamewing venom
doesn’t actually harm the body or the soul.” Qi Rufeng shook his
head, then said bitterly, “But no matter how far away we move away,
the flamewing bugs can still sense the location of the flamewing
venom. Even if we flee to the Cloud continent or the Flame continent,
the flamewing bugs can still sense us. The Loose Immortals and Earth
Immortals under the Flamewing King’s command can engage in
teleportation and go to the Cloud continent and Flame continent…and
so no matter where we flee to, we are unable to escape pursuit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now understood.
What a nasty poison! He still remembered how in his youth, when he
was adventuring in Eastmount Marsh, he had been attacked and pursued
by Ironwood Zhan. It was precisely because Ning had been touched by
that ‘iceflower liquid’ that Ironwood Zhan was able to continue
the chase, even though Ning had fled very far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, by comparison
this flamewing venom was even more formidable…and it was the
Flamewing King who had personally used it. It was able to stain even
the soul. Within this Crescent world, no matter where the clan fled
to, the countless flamewing bugs under the king’s command would
still be able to sense their direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The majority of our
imperial clan was killed on the spot, and the rest fled in every
direction,” Qi Rufeng said. “Back then, Loose Immortals numbered
amongst the fleeing survivors. However, no matter where we fled to,
they continued to chase us. Thus, we chose to continue to flee about
the former territory of our Qi Empire; after all, this was the place
we originally controlled, and so we were quite familiar with it. In
addition, the imperial clan had built up many secret bases…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After having fled
for so long, we three are the only survivors.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qi Rufeng’s words
were filled with grief and powerlessness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now understood it
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main problem was
that the flamewing venom was hard to eradicate; thus, this crown
prince and the princesses were constantly pursued. This sort of venom
that stained even the soul…not even Ning was able to help get rid
of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I ask you this,”
Ning said. “How great a sinner is this Flamewing King? Is he
surrounded by bloody sin light?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Flamewing King
is one of the Twelve Monster Kings of the Eastern Flows. He is famous
for his savagery; naturally, the amount of sins he has committed
towers to the skies. As far as the bloody aura of sin…from what I
hear, all twelve of them are wreathed in tremendous amounts of bloody
sin light. Anyone who uses divine sense to look at them will see a
towering, tidal-wave of bloody sin light swirling around them. Even
Earth Immortals and Loose Immortals will feel terrified upon seeing
them,” Qi Rufeng said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt a sense of
jubilation in his heart. A towering tidal-wave of bloody sin light? A
huge sinner?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The trial to acquire
the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] was to kill ten great sinners and to
accept a disciple. He had now accepted a disciple, and his next
objective was to kill ten great sinners. Perhaps he would be able to
fulfill the criteria by dealing with these twelve monster kings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You heard this
personally, yes? You aren’t just making this up?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps the stories
are exaggerated, but they shouldn’t be too exaggerated. The
savagery of the Twelve Monster Kings of the Eastern Flows is known
throughout the Star continent. In fact, even those in the Cloud
continent and the Flame continent know about their reputation. Even
supreme powers with Celestial Immortal Patriarchs are unwilling to go
all out against these twelve monster kings,” Qi Rufeng said.
“Although my imperial Qi clan had originally fled to the Cloud
continent, we were unfamiliar with the place and the people there.
The fame of the Twelve Monster Kings of the Eastern Flows was simply
too great; no one was willing to help us, and so in the end, we were
chased all the way back home. At least here within the former
territory of our Qi Empire, we are able to struggle and fight for a
period of time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt startled.
Even powers with Celestial Immortal Patriarchs were unwilling to
fight with them?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How strong are these
twelve monster kings?” Ning asked. “How strong is the Flamewing
King?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All twelve of them
are incomparably savage and ferocious; the reason why they were
willing to swear brotherhood was because they all had similar
temperaments. Every one of them is incredibly powerful…but of
course, some are stronger and some are weaker. The Flamewing King’s
power is average for the twelve; he has nearly a hundred Earth
Immortals or Loose Immortals under his command. Given his power,
killing ordinary Earth Immortals or Loose Immortals is as easy as
killing a chicken,” Qi Rufeng said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The strongest of the
twelve, their number one figure, is the Goldfur Bearking. I’ve
heard that the Goldfur Bearking has previously fought a Celestial
Immortal Patriarch, who was unable to do anything to him. In the end,
it was the Celestial Immortal who retreated. You tell me; is he
powerful or not? When these twelve monster kings join forces,
advancing and retreating in unison…they are one of the absolute
hegemons of the entire Eastern Flows region. Although our Qi Empire
previously spanned a million kilometers, we’ve never dared to
encroach on their territory. Who would’ve thought that the
Flamewing King would annihilate our empire?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
startled. Even a Celestial Immortal had been unable to do anything,
and had voluntarily retreated?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had thought that he
would be able to get his quota of ten great sinners from these twelve
monster kings…but now, it seemed, things wouldn’t be so easy!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Easy is boring. Hard
is interesting. I spent more than thirty years training at Mount
Innerheart; I have yet to truly fight with anyone. The Twelve Monster
Kings of the Eastern Flows…a perfect foe!” Ning could feel his
blood beginning to pump excitedly through his veins, and his desire
to do battle was growing…

Chapter 20 - The Slaughter on Viledragon River
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning stood there by
himself on the prow of the ship, staring at the raging waves. He was
in an excellent mood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had already found
his disciple, and the Twelve Monster Kings of the Eastern Flows would
probably fulfill his quota of ten great sinners to kill. The only
problem was…these monster kings were quite hard to deal with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning suddenly
stared towards the distant horizon. Atop the distant shore, a vague
group of figures could be seen drawing closer and closer to them.
They were moving at an extremely fast speed, and Ning could visibly
make out the emblem of a flamewing on their Dao-armors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flamewing Guards?”
Ning laughed in surprise. “There’s actually a few hundred of
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crown Prince Qi Rufeng
and the others with him within the cabin stared outwards through the
window towards the Viledragon River. They were seeking for a place to
hide.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that…” The
crown prince’s face changed dramatically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hundreds of
Flamewing Guards?!” The violet-robed Qi Ruhui’s face instantly
turned ashen. Twelve Flamewing Guards had already terrified them, but
now hundreds more had come…even Loose Immortals would perish in a
situation like this!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disastrous!” The
crown prince’s face was ashen. He frantically sent mentally, “It
must be due to the fact that all twelve of those Flamewing Guards
died, without a single one escaping. That’s why they sent so many
over this time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, during the
flight of the imperial Qi clan, the Flamewing Guard had always held
the upper hand. It was the imperial Qi clan which had continued to
flee; the Flamewing Guard had never before had a situation where all
their troops died in an encounter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, the crown
prince, Qi Rufeng, was only recently the leader of their squad; in
the past, they had Primal Daoists with them, and it was the clan
elders who made the decisions. But now the Primal Daoists were all
dead…and the decision-maker was Qi Rufeng!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qi Rufeng was
inexperienced. He had never before encountered a situation where all
the chasing Flamewing Guard forces had been wiped out. He had no idea
that the extermination of an entire squad would result in such a
terrifying consequence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A total of three
companies…each one led by a Loose Immortal or Earth Immortal,
eleven Primal Diremonsters, and over a hundred Wanxiang
Diremonsters.” The black-robed princess sent solemnly, “With so
many Flamewing Guards in one place…even supreme Loose Immortals
will most likely perish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why haven’t we
fled?” The violet-robed princess sent frantically, “That
Darknorth is merely a Primal Daoist. Even if he has a high level of
comprehension of the Dao and can fight those at a higher level, he
would at most be comparable to supreme Loose Immortals. In the face
of this many Flamewing Guards, which number three Earth Immortal or
Loose Immortal monsters amongst their ranks, there’s no way he can
hold on.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as Ning was
smiling…and the imperial Qi clan was utterly terrified…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hundreds of distant
Flamewing guards joined together into a grand Dao-soldier formation.
The three companies were all led by Loose Immortals, who led their
Primal Diremonsters and Wanxiang Diremonsters on the distant shore to
join form into a a trio of three thousand meter tall flamewing bugs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blazing wings, and the
body of a centipede.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous
three-headed flamewing bugs were filled with unearthly, savage power.
Their auras alone caused the surrounding waves to instantly be
crushed downwards and flattened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three massive
flamewing bugs all flew into the river, running across the waves as
they threw themselves towards Ning’s ship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood at the prow
of the ship. He barked, “Hurry up and leave, and you can keep your
lives.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So you are the one
protecting the imperial Qi clan.” One of the three massive
flamewing bugs spoke out in a growling voice. “Human, this is the
territory of our Flamewing King. How dare you act so wildly here?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t waste words
with him. Kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill the human.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Monsters and humans
were enemies in virtually every part of the Three Realms. After all,
these two races were the two most powerful races in the current Three
Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head
gently. Three Loose Immortal monsters? They were most likely only on
par with that Loose Immortal, Floatcloud, who had tried to
assassinate him. Even all those years ago, he had been able to deal
with Immortal Floatcloud. Now that his Primaltwin was a full level of
power greater than it had been in the past, and now that his insights
into the Dao of the Sword were unfathomably greater than
before…killing these Loose Immortals would indeed be as easy as
killing a chicken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Accompanied by three
massive waves, the three enormous flamewing bugs charged forward,
seeking to attack Ning en-masse and annihilate him at one go.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning remained very
calm. To deal with hundreds of Flamewing Guards, just by relying on
his Dao Domain wouldn’t be enough; he had to actually fight! But of
course, it would still be very easy for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we dawdle, we
won’t be able to escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial Qi clan
didn’t dare to hesitate at all. If they did, they would probably
die here. As they saw it, no matter how high a level of comprehension
Ning had, he was still just a Primal Daoist. In the face of three
Loose Immortal monsters and hundreds of Flamewing Guards…it would
be incredible if he was even able to block them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crown prince, Qi
Rufeng, waved his hand and a long shuttle once more appeared by the
side of the large ship. Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! The crown prince, the
princesses, and the five servants all entered the shuttle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!” The
violet-robed woman waved her hand, and instantly, a series of green
bamboo strips flew out and descended from the skies, plunging into
the roiling waves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The shuttle cruised
through the waves, moving as fast as lightning. As for those green
bamboo strips, there were hundreds of them, and they all stabbed
downwards, completely surrounding the region where Ning and the three
giant flamewing bugs were located. The bamboo strips even had bamboo
leaves attached to them. The bamboo leaves floated about, causing the
entire region to transform into nothingness. Even the surrounding
waves had completely disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little sister, you,
you…!” Crown Prince Qi Rufeng, within the fleeing shuttle, was
completely shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The violet-robed
princess turned her head to stare at the now-massive bamboo strips.
She smirked disdainfully, “What is it? That Daoist Darknorth is
merely a Primal Daoist; it’d be impressive if he even had the power
of a supreme Loose Immortal. And even if he did, he still most likely
isn’t a match for those Flamewing Guards. Since that was the case,
we have to use him as best as we can and make him offer up his
strength in service to our imperial clan. It can be said that this is
the price he must pay for taking Xiaoyu away as his disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…are…AN
IDIOT.” Qi Rufeng was speechless with rage. “Given how powerful
this Daoist Darknorth is, if he has a school or a master behind him,
how are we supposed to deal with them?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So what if he does?
Who will learn of this?” The violet-robed princess remained
disdainful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed
princess disagreed frantically. “Little sister, given this Daoist
Darknorth’s powerful, he probably has a Celestial Immortal
Patriarch behind him. Celestial Immortals are able to investigate the
past. When they find out…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. So
what if they do find out? Even if this Daoist Darknorth has a
Celestial Immortal Patriarch backing him, there’s no way that
Celestial Immortal will find us. All that Celestial Immortal will
know is that Daoist Darknorth was killed by the Flamewing Guard.
Perhaps this might cause his school to go act against the Flamewing
King!” A look of savagery was in the violet-robed princess’s
eyes. “Hmph. Hmph. Perhaps the Flamewing King will be killed as a
result. Everything would be worth it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
collecting his ship. Qi Xiaoyu, aboard the ship, was also collected
into the Immortal estate he carried with him at all times.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning
glanced at the fleeing imperial Qi clan. He watched as the treasures
the youngest princess threw out, those bamboo slips, sank into the
sea and formed a formation. He naturally understood what the plot
was; to trap him here along with the Flamewing Guard. Otherwise…if
so much as a single one of the three massive flamewing bugs moved to
attack them, they would be in big trouble!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that they were all
trapped in the formation, all three would undoubtedly join forces to
attack him, Ji Ning. Only afterwards would they move to break the
formation. This was a scheme to force Ning to fight with full power.
And if Ning’s level of power truly was what the imperial Qi clan
believed it to be, then most likely the end result truly would be as
the princess predicted; he would be able to buy them some time, then
die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unfortunately…their
guess was wrong!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s school was
indeed powerful, far more so than they could imagine. Ning’s master
was Patriarch Subhuti, the creator of this entire world! And Ning’s
own level of power was far greater than they imagined as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him, then break
the formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three massive
flamewing bugs didn’t panic at all. They had complete confidence in
their ability to first kill this human, then break the formation. It
would at most take them a bit of extra time, which didn’t matter;
those imperial Qi clansmen were all stained by flamewing venom, and
they’d be able to find and catch them later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Ning had an
ugly look on his face. He was protecting them, but they had put a
knife in his back. How could he not be enraged?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enraged Ning no
longer wished to waste any time; he was going to make the imperial Qi
clan pay for what they did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG! BANG! BANG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there atop
the water, Darknorth swords in his hands. He chopped out three times
in a row with his sword-light!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three streaks of
blindingly bright sword-light transformed into three enormous black
dragons. The power of the black dragons was utterly unearthly, and
they smashed towards the three massive flamewings with utterly
catastrophic power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“NO!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Loose Immortal
monsters, Primal Diremonsters, and Wanxiang Diremonsters within the
three flamewing bugs were all stupefied. They were truly scared
silly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three black dragons
each flew to a different target. They had the shape of black dragons,
but they were in reality streaks of incomparably terrifying
sword-light. They chopped through the titanic flamewing bugs as
easily as chopping through rotting wood. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! The
hundreds of monsters, including the Loose Immortal monsters, all
perished!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their souls were
annihilated!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enraged Ning’s
sword-blows were so powerful that they destroyed flesh and soul
alike. In fact, even the Dao-armors worn by the Wanxiang Diremonsters
were ground into dust, and quite a few of their magic treasures were
shattered as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“BREAK!” Ning
launched yet another streak of sword-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The surrounding
formation was a one-use formation. It contained elemental ki and was
primarily meant to trap foes. However, Ning couldn’t be bothered to
actually disrupt the formation; he just broke straight through it
with a streak of howling sword-light, causing the bamboo talismans to
instantly shatter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Ning moved
forward in pursuit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the shuttle
which was escaping at lightning speed, the violet-robed princess had
a look of madness in her eyes. “Hmph. Hmph. Perhaps the Flamewing
King will be killed as a result. Everything would be worth it!
Hahaha, I’m too clever. Earlier, I just wanted to make this
Darknorth’s death useful, to buy us some time. But now, it seems as
though I, Qi Ruhui, just played a marvelous card.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. Quite the
marvelous card.” A cold voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crown prince and
princesses suddenly shook. They turned their heads to look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the other end of the
shuttle stood a fur-clad youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at the
three imperial Qi clansmen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were completely
stupefied. They had escaped just moments ago and had said just a few
words to each other. Almost no time had passed at all. They had no
idea…that Ning would be able to kill hundreds of Flamewing Guards
with a single exchange, then break through the formation and chase
after them. Naturally, this had taken very little time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Darknorth.”
Qi Rufeng immediately rose to his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s gaze turned
towards the violet-robed princess. Instantly, a streak of sword-light
flew out…and the violet-robed princess was instantly ground into
dust which flew everywhere. At Ning’s level…just the slightest
bit of power was enough to shatter someone’s soul.

Chapter 21 - Bluecliff Xiaoyu
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crown prince, the
second princess, and the servants aboard the shuttle all had ashen
looks on their faces. They could all tell that this time, Darknorth
was truly enraged!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were all Immortal
cultivators; naturally, they were no fools. They knew that the little
princess had plotted against this senior Darknorth just now. Senior
Darknorth had clearly gone to help them fight against the Flamewing
Guard, but the little princess had stabbed him in the back…an
action like this would be viewed with contempt by mortals and
cultivators alike!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Darknorth…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknor…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crown princess and
the second princess hurriedly spoke out, utterly terrified. This was
completely not their fault. The little princess had acted completely
of her own accord; they didn’t instruct her to carry out those
actions at all! As for her death, the crown prince and the second
princess felt a hint of regret but not too much pain. This was
because far too many of their siblings had died on this journey, and
all of their elders had perished as well. They were used to this sort
of loss…and on an emotional level, the crown prince and the second
princess were much closer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning willed it,
and a white-robed maiden appeared next to him. It was Qi Xiaoyu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master,” Qi Xiaoyu
said hurriedly, “I saw the little princess…” Halfway through
her words, she realized that she was within the flying shuttle.
Seeing the situation, she couldn’t help but grow confused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciple, watch
carefully,” Ning said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” Qi Xiaoyu
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Darknorth,
what happened just now was completely the actions of Ruhui; she
wanted to use you to delay the Flamewing Guard,” Qi Rufeng said
hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was our little
sister who carried out that action. Her alone,” the black-robed
princess said hurriedly as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qi Xiaoyu just watched
silently. When the Flamewing Guard had arrived, her master had gone
to fight them while the imperial Qi clan had fled…and while
fleeing, the little princess had thrown out a formation to trap them.
Qi Xiaoyu had seen all of these things with perfect clarity. In
addition, after having accompanied the imperial Qi clan for so long,
Qi Xiaoyu knew very well how vicious and cruel the little princess
was. Thus, by now she more or less knew what had happened!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at the
crown prince and the second princess. He said coldly, “I heard it
all. There was talk of having the Celestial Immortal Patriarch behind
me go take revenge upon the Flamewing King on my behalf and kill him?
Hmph…I don’t like to kill, but some people deserve killing!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crown prince and
the second princess trembled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If the two of you
were behind her actions, then you two shall both die as well. If you
did not…I won’t go so far as to implicate the two of you.”
Ning’s gaze turned to the black-robed princess. He immediately used
the [Soulcharmer Art] divine ability. Although this Black-White
College art wasn’t that strong, Ning’s soul was far too powerful!
The black-robed princess’s gaze instantly turned dull.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak. Did you have
anything to do with the little princess’ plot against me?” Ning
asked calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed
princess spoke in a dull voice without any inflection at all. “It
had nothing to do with me. Ruhui acted of her own volition. Although
her action may have caused senior Darknorth to fight for a bit
longer, it also created yet another powerful foe for our imperial Qi
clan. If the school behind senior Darknorth came for vengeance, our
imperial Qi clan would most likely be in even more dire straits.
Ruhui was far too shortsighted…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…what just
happened?” The black-robed princess regained her clarity of mind.
She stared around in astonishment…and slowly, the memories of what
had happened just now when she had been hypnotized came rushing back
to her. She couldn’t help but look towards Ning in terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crown prince’s
face instantly turned even more ashen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You.” Ning looked
towards the crown prince.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crown prince
gritted his teeth. “I definitely didn’t have the intention to
harm you, senior.” Just as these words came out, Qi Rufeng’s gaze
also turned dull.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He, too, dully spoke
out the truth. This truly did not have nothing to do with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Qi Xiaoyu
let out a sigh of relief. She actually felt good-will towards the
crown princess and the second princess.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I ask you,” Ning
suddenly said, “Did your imperial Qi clan arrange for the
destruction of Qi Xiaoyu’s tribe?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed
princess’s face instantly changed. Qi Xiaoyu’s body trembled as
well, and a look of terror and unease appeared in her eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crown prince
responded in a wooden, robotic manner, “For the sake of ensuring Qi
Xiaoyu’s total devotion to our imperial clan, we had to make it so
that she had no one else to rely on. Otherwise, in her heart, her
tribe would still be occupy the most important position. Thus, the
elders of the clan forced three Xiantian Diremonsters to attack the
tribe. As for the two Xiantian experts of that tribe, our clan elders
plotted against them and ensured that they naturally wouldn’t be
able to fight back, causing the entire tribe to be broken apart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Qi Xiaoyu’s family
members all died, giving her no one else to rely on. At that moment,
our elder stepped in to protect her; naturally, she felt gratitude
and affection for the elder’s actions. Everything happened as we
planned, and Qi Xiaoyu became incomparably devoted and loyal to our
imperial Qi clan. In addition, after Qi Xiaoyu became a member of our
imperial Qi clan, our luck took a noticeable turn for the better. The
number of times we were attacked dropped, and the number of elders
who died in each attack also lessened…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…no…” Qi
Xiaoyu’s face was covered with tears. She repeatedly shook her
head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sighed mentally to
himself. In truth, the main reason he had used the [Soulcharmer Art]
was to ask about this matter. Given Ning’s keen senses, he
naturally noticed quite a few oddities regarding the destruction of
Xiaoyu’s tribe. It was extremely rare for this sort of large-scale
tribe to suffer an attack from Diremonsters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As I thought.”
Ning nodded to himself. Qi Xiaoyu felt extremely deep gratitude
towards the imperial Qi clan. Ning was afraid that this might cause
problems in the future, and so he wanted to clarify this matter right
away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You were plotting
against me all along. All along…” Qi Xiaoyu looked at the crown
prince, her face completely pale. “My master? Was she plotting
against me as well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aunt-master
Everlotus was opposed to our scheme. She wanted to go to your tribe
and take you on as her disciple in a voluntary manner. However, our
imperial Qi clan was in a state of flight; all of our actions had to
be for the sake of the imperial Qi clan’s best interests.” The
crown prince, Qi Rufeng, continued to speak in a monotone voice. “She
felt sorry for you, and so when she took you on as disciple, taught
you, and doted on you, it was out of love. In fact, some of the other
princes and princesses felt jealousy for this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qi Xiaoyu felt her
heart unclench slightly. The person she felt the most gratitude for
in the entire imperial Qi clan was her master, Everlotus. Everlotus
had taken care of her like she was her own daughter. She had loved
her and cherished her. Qi Xiaoyu had been able to sense how much love
Everlotus had felt for her, and ever since she was young, her master
had taught her. Thus, although she didn’t have many memories
regarding life in the Bluecliff tribe and although she only had
blurry memories of her parents, she felt an extremely deep affection
for her master, Everlotus. After all, they had been together for the
longest period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qi Xiaoyu was fairly
accurate in sensing if others were kind or malicious towards her, if
they cared about her or hated her. She had always felt as though her
master, Everlotus, had truly loved her. This was why she felt such
gratitude for the imperial Qi clan. In fact, when the now-deceased
leader of the imperial Qi clan had asked her to swear an oath to the
Dao of the Heavens, she hadn’t hesitated at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What just happened?”
Crown Prince Qi Rufeng came back to his senses. He quickly regained
his memories, and his face immediately changed. He stared towards
Ning in terror, then looked towards Qi Xiaoyu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master Everlotus…I
can understand why you did what you did. I don’t blame you. I don’t
blame you…” Tears streaked down Qi Xiaoyu’s face. She stared at
the black-robed princess and the crown prince. Gritting her teeth,
she said, “Your imperial Qi clan destroyed my tribe and home and
killed my family. But Master Everlotus’s benevolence towards me was
as weighty as a mountain. From this day forth, I, Qi Xiaoyu, will no
longer have any connection to your Qi clan. From this day forth, my
name shall be Bluecliff Xiaoyu!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Bluecliff
Xiaoyu turned to look towards Ning, tears in her eyes. “Thank you,
master, for enlightening me and not letting me continue to remain
deceived. I wish to be by myself for a time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Ning nodded,
then willed Qi Xiaoyu to be teleported into his Immortal estate with
a swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s gaze turned
towards the crown prince and the princess. Both of them felt
helpless; when they had been hypnotized, they had thought it was just
over the little princess’ plot, but who would’ve thought that
this senior Darknorth would actually uncover the matter of the
destruction of the Bluecliff tribe? Still…by now, they had no
options left. All they could do was beg for their lives.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since you had no
intention to harm me, I naturally won’t act against you. I will
still hold to my promise,” Ning said. “However…before I do so,
come with me to a place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he spoke, Ning waved
his hand, causing the imperial Qi clansmen and the flying shuttle to
all be drawn into his Immortal estate. And then, Ning strode forward
across the waves of Viledragon River, quickly departing from this
place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short period of time
later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The peak of a tall
mountain, surrounded by clouds. A ripple in space could be seen above
it, then a fur-clad youth appeared out of nowhere and descended.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place works.”
The fur-clad youth nodded, then waved his hand. An Immortal estate
appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Immortal
estate. As Ning entered, the crown prince and the second princess
both immediately paid their respects. The crown prince said, “Senior,
where are we?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can exit the
estate now, but you had best not go too far. If you do, I won’t be
able to keep you alive,” Ning said calmly. “This place is more
than ten million kilometers from our previous location; I trust that
the Flamewing King will need some time before chasing you here. Take
a rest and prepare for the next battle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The next battle?”
The two were startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I killed hundreds of
Flamewing guards, including three Loose Immortal monsters. Do you
think that the Flamewing King is just going to shrug that off?”
Ning said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two shook their
heads. Impossible. The Eastern Flows region was the territory of the
twelve monster kings; given that this senior Darknorth had killed
hundreds of Flamewing Guards, how could the Flamewing King not be
enraged? It must be understood that the Flamewing Guards were the
most devoted servants of the Flamewing King. Given that so many of
them had perished, the Flamewing King would probably personally
attack next time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Flamewing King
is coming in person.” Both the crown prince and the second princess
felt restless and uneasy. “And yet this senior Darknorth still
intends to fight?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How powerful is he?
Can it be that my earlier investigations were in error? He is more
than just a peak Primal Daoist?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their hearts were in a
state of panic. Still, given how quickly Ning had chased after him,
he must have disposed of all of those Flamewing Guards…which meant
that things probably truly were as Ning said. He had killed hundreds
of Flamewing Guards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In such a short
period of time, he killed hundreds of Flamewing Guards, broke the
formation, then caught up to us. How powerful is this Ji Ning? Is it
truly possible that he can fight the Flamewing King?” The crown
prince and the princess both felt as though their thoughts were in a
jumble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t be
bothered to pay them any heed. He entered a private room within the
Immortal estate. A ripple in space appeared within it and Ning
stepped into the ripple, entering his underwater estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t
underestimate the Flamewing King’s power. In fact, I might have to
deal with the other monster kings as well. Before doing so…I need
to increase my power a bit,” Ning mused to himself. “My true
body, when using [Three Heads, Six Arms], needs a total of six
Immortal swords. Three of them are my Darknorth swords, and the other
three would ideally be Immortal-ranked.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had an exquisitely
top-grade Thousandbull Sword, as well as a low-grade Immortal-ranked
flying sword that the Grand Xia Emperor had bestowed upon him
previously. Just now, when killing those three Loose Immortal
monsters, he had further acquired two more low-grade Immortal-ranked
magic treasures, one of which was a flying sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My true body needs
to break through to the early Void stage as soon as possible. Only
then can I better unleash the power of my Immortal-ranked magic
treasures,” Ning mused to himself. Those two low-grade
Immortal-ranked flying swords were comparable to the Darknorth swords
in power…what Ning really cared about was the Thousandbull Sword!
That sword had close to the power of a Pure Yang treasure!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
entered the Still Room within his underwater estate, then began to

Chapter 22 - The Twelve Monster Kings of the Eastern Flows
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughly ten million
kilometers away, in the imperial capital of the former Qi Empire.
Within the imperial palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a lavishly
decorated palace hall. Beautiful female attendants carried in
platters of exquisite food and Immortal nectar, delivering them to
the twelve tables, including the main table at the front of the hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, drink.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother, I toast
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninth brother, it
has been a thousand years since we met. Come, come, come; let us
brothers have another cup together!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Carefree laughter rang
out. High-pitched, low-pitched, screeching…every single voice
carried a dominating aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The monsters in the
form of female attendants all felt their hearts tremble. They acted
with the utmost caution, terrified of offending one of the monster
kings. They knew that the twelve gathered here in this hall today
were the Twelve Monster Kings of the Eastern Flows; the likes of them
could not risk offending any of these twelve. If they accidentally
irritated one of the monster kings, the results would be disastrous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the maidservants
had, due to her nervousness, splattered some of the wine from her
platter atop the Jadetoad King, one of the twelve monster kings. The
Jadetoad King had rolled his eyes, opened his mouth, and devoured the
maidservant into his belly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the center of the
hall, there were beautiful human maidens and monsters who were
engaging in dance. Naturally, there were also musicians who were
beating the drums and playing the flute.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright, all of you
can leave for now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After a long time, the
Flamewing King, seated in the host position at the front of the
palace, ordered the servants to depart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, your Majesty.”
The many servants, dancers, and musicians all immediately withdrew,
leaving behind only the twelve monster kings within the hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Third, you invited
all of us brothers here today. Whatever important matter this is
regarding, hurry up and speak.” An extremely muscular monster king
whose entire body was covered with golden fur and who had the head of
a grizzly bear spoke out in a booming voice. This was the leader of
the twelve monster kings, the Goldfur Bearking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother.” The
tall, skinny, black-robed Flamewing King laughed, “Haha, I invited
all of you here to take part in a joyous affair. Seventh brother came
earlier, and so I’ve told him already. If you don’t believe me,
you can ask him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other monster kings
all looked over to the azure-armored, hawk-eyed Skysoar King, who
nodded. “This is indeed regarding a joyous affair.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The other
monster kings all looked back towards the Flamewing King with
curiosity. Although they were friends due to their similar
temperaments, they were famous for their savagery. If they found
anything good, they would usually keep it for themselves. Why would
one of them now be willing to share with the rest of the brothers?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Flamewing King,
seeing their looks, smiled. He waved his hand and a black leather
scroll flew out and unfurled in the air before them. On the leather
scroll there was a complicated map, as well as a diagram.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is this?” The
other monster kings were puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The map to a
treasure trove!” The Flamewing King said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Treasure trove?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A map to a treasure
trove?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you joking? A
‘treasure trove’? To the likes of us, even the treasures of a
Celestial Immortal are nothing. The treasures of a True Immortal or
an Empyrean God might barely qualified as a ‘trove’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the monster
kings spoke out. They were the Twelve Monster Kings of the Eastern
Flows, who even Celestial Immortal Patriarchs were unwilling to
offend. For them to acknowledge a collection of treasures as a
‘treasure trove’ was extremely hard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Skysoar King spoke
out, “My fellow brothers, third brother hasn’t deceived you. The
place marked by this map as having treasures can indeed…be
described as a major treasure trove.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A major treasure
trove?” The other monster kings all began to ponder. For even their
seventh brother, the Skysoar King, to acknowledge this place as being
a treasure trove meant that there really might be something to this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Third brother, can
it be that this has something to do with the Qi Empire?” The short,
chubby, green-skinned Jadetoad King growled out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Flamewing King,
seated at the head of the hall, nodded. “This does indeed have
something to do with the Qi Empire. When I acted against them and
destroyed them, it was because I heard some news regarding this
treasure trove. I suddenly attacked without giving them any notice
and seized a group of important figures of the imperial Qi clan.
Then, I used soulscouring and other methods to learn more about the
treasure trove, then acquired this treasure map from the imperial Qi
clan as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since you already
have the treasure map, you can go by yourself, third brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I refuse to believe
you are truly so generous, third brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, third brother,
what are you plotting? Speak up and be honest. Everyone here knows
what type of person you are.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were
renowned for their savagery; they knew what sort of individuals the
other monster kings were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Flamewing King
chortled. The nearby Skysoar King said, “Third brother did indeed
go twice. The first time he went, he came back with nothing to show
for it; he wasn’t able to go deep inside at all. The second time,
he made more ample preparations and forced his way inside…but was
trapped within the region for twenty years, just barely surviving and
coming back. He just escaped a short while ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? Trapped for
twenty years?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Third brother, you
couldn’t even use a Greater Teleportation Dao-talisman to flee?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was that
dangerous?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The monster kings were
all astonished. The Flamewing King immediately said, “Listen to me
describe in detail. This treasure trove region…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Flamewing King
spoke nonstop regarding what he had experienced. He knew quite well
that by relying on his own power, there was no way he would be able
to make it any deeper; he had to have the rest of the twelve join him
if he wanted to have any chances of success.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the Flamewing King
spoke, looks of astonishment and seriousness gradually began to
appear on the faces of the other monster kings. This place was indeed
both dangerous and terrifying…the Flamewing King’s descriptions
alone indicated how mysterious and frightening this place was. Most
likely, even Celestial Immortals who ventured there would perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only if the twelve
of us join forces do we have any chance,” the Flamewing King said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What in the world is
within this treasure trove?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I feel quite eager
to find out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them felt
tremendous desire towards this treasure trove.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The founding emperor of
the Qi Empire had already scoured the outer perimeter of this
treasure trove, and he had acquired Ki Refining Techniques, divine
abilities, and secret arts from it. These techniques were all truly
top-tier techniques; otherwise, the Qi Empire wouldn’t have been
able to expand so rapidly. Given that the outer perimeter already
possessed such incredible treasures…what did the depths of the
trove hold?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have to plan this
out carefully,” the top-ranked Goldfur Bearking said solemnly. “We
cannot be rash.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, we must make
ample preparations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An extraordinary
place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as the monster
kings were discussing and planning, a long-necked elder appeared at
the entrance to the hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Majesty, Majesty!”
The long-necked elder called out repeatedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enter.” The
Flamewing King frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The long-necked elder
entered, then immediately said with respect, “Your Majesty, the
three companies of Flamewing Guards led by those three Loose
Immortals which we sent out…they all died. None of them escaped to
make it back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They all died?”
The Flamewing King suddenly jumped to his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. All of them.”
The long-necked elder nodded repeatedly, worry in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Flamewing King’s
face changed. Hundreds of Flamewing Guards, led by three Loose
Immortals…how powerful was the enemy, to be able to wipe them out
so cleanly and let none survive?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s wrong,
third?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Third brother, what
happened?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other monster kings
began to query him. The Flamewing King responded solemnly, “To tell
the truth, brothers…there are still a few survivors of the Qi
Empire who are running around. However, the strongest of the imperial
Qi clansmen is a mere Wanxiang Adept. One of my squads of Flamewing
Guards found and attacked them, but the squad was wiped out. I felt
this was strange, and so I sent three full companies to attack, but
all of them were killed as well. None of them survived.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three full
companies? Hundreds of Flamewing Guards in a Dao-soldier
formation…they would be able to wipe out even a supreme Loose
Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To kill hundreds of
Flamewing Guards without letting even one escape…that is quite
difficult.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is an
extraordinary foe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The monster kings knew
each other’s forces quite well; they knew how strong the Flamewing
King’s forces were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, why worry
about this matter? It is quite rare for all of us to be gathered in
one place; let us pay a visit together, then, and see what the
survivors of the imperial Qi clan have up their sleeves.” The
Goldfur Bearking let out a loud laugh. “When all of us join
forces…there truly are few in the entire Star continent who are a
match for us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The supreme powers of
the Star continent only held Celestial Immortal Patriarchs amongst
their ranks. When the twelve joined forces, they truly did have
nothing to fear from Celestial Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let us go together.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Third brother, let’s
go take a look and see who has dared to antagonize the Twelve Monster
Kings of the Eastern Flows.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wiping out the
Flamewing Guard…they gave you no face at all, third brother. Giving
you no face is the same as giving all of us brothers no face.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go take a
look together.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Flamewing King
immediately roared with laughter. “Hahaha, fine! With so many
brothers here…it doesn’t matter who is protecting the imperial Qi
clan. That person will die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s no waste
time. We’ve already eaten and drunk our fill; let us go out and
fight!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go out and
fight!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Twelve Monster
Kings of the Eastern Flows were decisive in their actions. They
immediately led thousands of monsters in an awe-inspiring wave from
the imperial capital of the former Qi Empire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the top of a
mountain peak. Ning was seated next to a cliff. He was holding a
gourd of wine in his hand, drinking in a leisurely manner while
staring at the clouds and the sea. He had just consumed six hundred
thousand kilograms of liquefied elemental essence, causing his true
body to break through as a Ki Refiner from the peak Primal level to
the early Void level! He would now be able to more perfectly control
his Immortal-ranked magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My true body can use
the Thousandbull Sword, the Darknorth swords, and other magic
treasures. My Primaltwin will use the [Heavenraker] sword formation.”
Ning nodded to himself. His power had reached the maximum level it
could reach for now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flamewing King, I
killed hundreds of your Flamewing Guards…I imagine that you will
personally come seek me out, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was waiting
eagerly. Given that he was protecting the imperial Qi clan, the
Flamewing King would definitely be lured over here!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ten major sinners.
First I will kill the Flamewing King, and then I’ll go deal with
the others one by one,” Ning murmured to himself. Given his current
level of power, when his true body and his Primaltwin fought
together, it shouldn’t be too hard for him to kill a monster king.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning was drinking
and waiting leisurely by the cliffside, suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning suddenly
stared into the distance. An enormous cloud was soaring towards his
direction, and atop the cloud there was a dense cluster of countless
figures. There were many monsters there, and in front of the
countless monsters were twelve mighty figures whose auras filled the
heavens, causing Ning’s face to change.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Twelve?” Ning’s
face couldn’t help but blanche as he stared at the twelve figures
standing in front of the countless monsters atop the massive cloud.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Such powerful
auras…these were definitely no ordinary Loose Immortals. The
formless ripples of might caused even Ning to feel surprised. In
addition, these twelve figures stood shoulder-to-shoulder in front of
the countless monsters; clearly, there were no differences in rank
here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you the Twelve
Monster Kings of the Eastern Flows?” Ning called out loudly, his
voice echoing and filling the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little child, who
are you? Is it your master who is protecting the imperial Qi clan?”
The tall, thin, black-robed Flamewing King called out back, “Hurry
up and have your master come out. We twelve brothers would like to
see exactly who it is that has the audacity to annihilate hundreds of
my Flamewing Guards with one breath.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning cursed to himself
with resignation. “All I wanted to do was fight against a single
Flamewing King. Why the hell have all twelve shown up?! The Twelve
Monster Kings of the Eastern Flows all come from their own separate
territories; why have they all gathered here today?”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_23___Towering_Amounts_of"></A>
Chapter 23 - Towering Amounts of Sin
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The voices of both Ji
Ning and the Flamewing King were very loud.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you the Twelve
Monster Kings of the Eastern Flows?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…hurry up and have
your master come out…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both voices echoed in
the heavens, causing the surviving imperial Qi clansmen to feel
shocked. They hurriedly moved to the entrance of the Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crown Prince Qi Rufeng,
Second Princess Qi Ruyu, Ning’s disciple Bluecliff Xiaoyu, and the
imperial Qi servants all stared outwards past the gates of the
Immortal estate. They saw Ning standing at the side of a cliff,
wine-gourd in hand. Far away from him in the skies, there was a
massive horde of countless monsters atop a cloud.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that the
Flamewing King?” Qi Rufeng’s face changed. He would never be able
to forget that figure; that was his eternal nightmare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But right now, the
Flamewing King was just one of the twelve leading figures. “The
Goldfur Bearking, the Snowfox King…there’s no doubting it. They
are identical to the images of the Twelve Monster Kings of the
Eastern Flows which the imperial Qi clan recorded down.” Qi
Rufeng’s face was ashen. “All twelve of them have arrived.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They all arrived?
Even though hundreds of Flamewing Guards were killed, why would all
twelve of them come?!” The black-robed princess felt despair as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the two had
Greater Teleportation Dao-seals, once they used them up, they would
be gone. In addition, given the power of these monster kings, the
monster kings could immediately teleport after them as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the Flamewing King
wanted to chase after them, he would definitely be able to. The
reason why they had been able to flee and survive for so long was
because the Flamewing King didn’t care too much about them; after
acquiring the treasure map, the Flamewing King’s full attention was
on the treasure trove. He had only sent a few of his Flamewing Guards
to deal with the imperial Qi clansmen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Twelve Monster
Kings of the Eastern Flows?” Upon hearing these words, Bluecliff
Xiaoyu’s face changed as well. “Those twelve are the twelve
monster kings?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiaoyu stared at the
twelve distant figures that commanded the countless monsters. Even at
this great distance, the infinitely powerful aura emanated by the
twelve caused her heart to tremble. She grew worried. “Master…I
just took you on as my master. Don’t die. Don’t die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that she had
severed all ties with the imperial Qi clan, she no longer had any
friends or family in the world. Ning was her master, and thus the
closest person she had left. She could tell that Ning viewed her
kindly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t want
Master to die. I don’t want…” Xiaoyu was panicking inside. If
her master died…she would be all alone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qi Rufeng’s face was
ashen. He shook his head in despair. “It’s finished.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed
princess shook her head as well. “All twelve of the monster kings
have arrived. Even during our Qi Empire’s most powerful era, they
would have been able to wipe us out immediately. There is no way this
senior Darknorth can withstand them. No way at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Twelve Monster
Kings of the Eastern Flows were legends! Legends known throughout the
Star continent, the Cloud continent, the Flame continent…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In short, within the
Crescent world, these twelve monster kings were extremely famous.
Most likely only Celestial Immortals would be able to flee and
survive from them when they joined forces!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given the abilities
these twelve monster kings have…even if senior Darknoth uses a
Greater Teleportation Dao-seal, he still probably wouldn’t be able
to teleport away before being attacked,” Qi Rufeng said as he
trembled with despair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Using Dao-seals took
time. At the Celestial Immortal level, multiple techniques could be
used in the blink of an eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Behind Ning, the
imperial Qi clan was in a state of terrified despair, while Bluecliff
Xiaoyu was praying ardently for his survival.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there at the
cliff. He quickly pondered as to how he should deal with these twelve
monster kings while spreading out his divine sense in a wave to test
them. And as he did…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What fine fellows!”
Ning was instantly shocked. The region with the twelve monster kings
was completely filled with limitless amounts of bloody light. The
bloody sin light surged and swelled like the waves of the sea, and
the twisting waves of bloody sin light even formed illusions of
ghosts who had died wrongful deaths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait. They aren’t
all like that.” Ning took a careful look. “Eleven of these twelve
monster kings are surrounded by hundreds of meters of bloody sin
light. But…that monster king with the head of a golden-furred
grizzly bear actually is only wreathed by a bit of corrosive black
light?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed. The only one of
the twelve not wrapped by the bloody aura of sin was actually the
most famous of the twelve, the Goldfur Bearking. This caused Ning to
feel extremely startled…and also even more wary. For this Goldfur
Bearking to set up an alliance of twelve monster kings and be
acknowledged as the most powerful amongst them, but possess the
lowest amount of sin…one had to be wary of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Twelve Monster Kings
of the Eastern Flows,” Ning called out loudly, “Per Master’s
orders, I am here protecting the imperial Qi clan. If you are wise,
you shall immediately retreat. Otherwise, when Master returns, all of
you shall perish!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is your master,
exactly? Give us his name!” The Flamewing King barked from far
away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He dares be so
arrogant? The master of this Primal Daoist must be a powerful
figure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With all of us
brothers present, we wouldn’t feel fear if even Celestial Immortals
came.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The monster kings
silently sent mental messages to each other, trying to guess at who
Ning’s master was. They paid no attention to Ning himself; given
their power, they could naturally tell that Ning was merely at the
Primal Daoist level! A mere Primal Daoist…although they noticed
through their divine sense sweep that his soul was fairly powerful,
he was still merely a Primal Daoist!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As they saw it, there
was no way a Primal Daoist could kill hundreds of Flamewing Guards
without letting a single one escape!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brothers, watch from
the sides for now,” the Flamewing King said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry, third
brother. If a Celestial Immortal Patriarch comes, we will intervene.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Third brother, go
and capture those imperial Qi clansmen.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other monster kings
all spoke out in support. A minor matter like capturing the imperial
Qi clan wasn’t something which required all twelve of the monster
kings to join forces in carrying out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little child, hurry
up and beat it,” the Flameking King barked flatly. At the same
time, he waved his arm, and with a whoosh, a massive fiery palm
suddenly appeared above the mount peak. This massive fiery palm
clawed towards the Immortal estate below it, terrifying the imperial
Qi clansmen and Xiaoyu into fleeing into the estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come in.” Ning
willed it, and the Immortal estate instantly returned to his side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You dare interfere
in my matters?” The Flamewing King was instantly enraged, and the
massivey fiery palm in the sky slammed towards Ning instead. “Since
your master has not arrived, I shall take your life first and calm
myself down a bit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You monster!” Ning
pretended to be enraged. His body instantly transformed and became
three hundred meters in size, and he also executed the [Three Heads,
Six Arms]. In his arms were the three Darknorth swords and three
Heaven-ranked flying swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll chop you
down!” Ning’s swords were like silken light as they chopped down
wildly towards the massive fiery palm. The level of swordplay Ning
was currently displaying was merely on the level he had displayed
back during the Conclave, comparable to a supreme Loose Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom boom boom…with a
series of massive exploding sounds, the massive fiery palm was
completely destroyed, but part of the mountain peak was torn apart as
well. The three-headed, six-armed Ning appeared to be quite angry as
he said, “You monster, you actually dare to try to pick on me, your
grandpa? If Master was here, you’d already be dead!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This human Primal
Daoist is quite arrogant in the face of death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This human is pretty
powerful. He’s a Fiendgod Body Refiner, and was able to use
[Heavenly Transformation] and [Three Heads, Six Arms]; he is indeed
able to give Loose Immortals a fight. His swordplay is also at the
level of a supreme Loose Immortal…he does indeed have a supreme
Loose Immortal’s combat potential.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Although he
is a Primal Daoist, he does indeed have the power of a supreme Loose
Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Third brother, if
you want to annihilate a supreme Loose Immortal at such a great
distance just by controlling the natural elemental energy of the
world…you’d need to do some more training first,” another
monster king teased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed. If the
Flamewing King was to use magic treasures, it would naturally be very
easy for him to kill a supreme Loose Immortal. But to annihilate a
supreme Loose Immortal just by using a fiery palm formed from the
natural elemental energy of the world? He was indeed not even close
to being at that level yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
Flamewing King’s face sank as he flew forward. Six fiery-red
scimitars suddenly appeared before him, each one carrying a powerful
presence; clearly, all of them were Immortal-ranked magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die, brat.” The
Flamewing King was using his true power now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You monster!” Ning
let out a roar, then moved forward like a giant Roc, flying at high
speed towards the Flamewing King and seeking to engage him in close
combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This human is pretty
powerful. His agility technique would be exceptional even amongst
Loose Immortal monsters,” the Skysoar King evaluated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He does indeed have
some potential. When he reaches the late Void level, he’ll probably
be comparable to us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unfortunately, he’s
going to die now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still, we need to be
careful. His master might suddenly appear.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The monster kings
chatted amongst themselves lazily as they watched the battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six scimitars of
the Flamewing King formed into an enormous fiery serpent in mid-air.
The fiery-red serpent was filled with unearthly savagery as it
pounced towards the three-headed, six-armed Ning, who also flew
forward to meet it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish swish swish. The
swords in Ning’s hands suddenly changed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, he was
wielding three Darknorth swords and three Heaven-ranked flying
swords. But suddenly, he put away his three Heaven-ranked flying
swords and pulled out the Thousandbull Sword and two Immortal-ranked
flying swords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Riiiip! The giant
serpent of fire flashed like lightning, pouncing towards Ning. But
what welcomed it was a terrifying sword blow!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword-light
had transformed into a divine black dragon. The terrifying divine
black dragon sword-light chopped through it like rotting wood,
instantly breaking it apart and knocking the six scimitars aside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” The
Flamewing King was instantly shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Ning, who
had previously appeared ‘enraged’, now let a hint of a killing
intent flash through his eyes. With a swoosh, he reached the
Flamewing King’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six streaks of
sword-light simultaneously transformed into six divine black dragons,
filling the world with their power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, go save third
brother!” The face of the Goldfur Bearking instantly changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good!” The
Skysoar King’s face changed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His power…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This human…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The monster kings had
been watching from far away, ready to ward off a Celestial Immortal.
None of them had expected that this clearly puny Primal Daoist would
suddenly explode forth with such power! Ning’s aura increased
explosively, and the power of his swordplay reached an extremely
profound level as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish swish swish…the
black dragon sword-light slashed forth with irresistible power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Engaged in close
quarters, the Flamewing King had no chance to flee at all. In but an
instant, Ning’s six streaks of sword-light completely surrounded
the Flamewing King and killed him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The surrounding area
turned silent. The entire world seemed to freeze. The many monsters
watching from far away were still in a state of amazement…but looks
of seriousness appeared on the faces of the monster kings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there in
midair. Waving his hand, he collected the magic treasures of the
Flamewing King, a smile on his face. “I’m ashamed to say that I
played a little trick on you just now. There was nothing I could do;
the twelve of you are simply far too famous, and given that you have
dominated the Star continent for so many years, I imagine you
definitely have a formation which is extremely well-suited to the
twelve of you. That’s why I had to kill one of you first.”

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_24___The_Sword_as_the_Ra"></A>
Chapter 24 - The Sword as the Rake, the Heavens as the Field
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eleven remaining
monster kings were so angry, their teeth hurt from gnashing. The
reason they were so famous was naturally in part because they had
developed a ‘Grand Soaring Bear Formation’ which was very
well-suited to the twelve of them. The Goldfur Bearking was the heart
of the formation, and the other eleven monster kings served to
support him, transforming into a single massive flying bear. It was
well-suited for both attack and defense, and in the face of it even
Celestial Immortal Patriarchs would choose to flee. Once formed, even
Ning fighting at full-strength would probably be forced to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…the Flamewing
King was now dead. He had been responsible for the ‘central wing
region’ of the formation; without him, there was naturally no way
to execute the incomparably complicated and powerful ‘Grand Soaring
Bear Formation’ to its full power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He tricked us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is this little
human kid so powerful? I’ve never heard of someone like him in the
Star, Cloud, or Flame continents.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The monster kings
really were tricked in a rather unfair manner. Only someone with the
power of a Celestial Immortal would be able to kill the Flamewing
King in an extremely short period of time! Those with the power of a
Celestial Immortal generally were all quite famous. In addition, Ning
had just recently reached the early Void stage; naturally, his level
of insight wasn’t much higher than back when he was a Primal
Daoist, and his elemental ki was three levels lower than that of the
twelve monster kings, who were all comparable to the peak Void stage.
All of the monsters had Immortal-ranked magic treasures as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The combination of all
of these factors was what let Ning catch them off-guard with his
successful sneak attack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, without the
Flamewing King, I imagine you are now unable to form your formation.
If you want to kill me…I’m afraid you won’t be strong enough.”
Ning stood there in the air as he said leisurely, “I urge you to
depart right away. In the future, you can at least term yourselves
the Eleven Monster Kings of the Eastern Flows. However, if we truly
were to fight each other…under the merciless exchange of blows
between swords and sabers, you might end up the Nine Monster Kings or
the Eight Monster Kings of the Eastern Flows.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Human, report your
name!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who in the world are
you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The monster kings were
utterly infuriated. Although they were very much on their guard now
against Ning, none of them chose to leave. After all, he had just
killed one of their brothers; if the remaining eleven fled without
even choosing to fight, that would cause their reputations to be
truly tarnished. For Loose Immortal monsters like them, given that
the Three Calamities and Nine Tribulations were growing increasingly
powerful and that they would eventually die, their reputation was
extremely important!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning secretly felt
resigned as well at their decision to stay. If the monster kings had
chosen to leave, he would’ve secretly gone to their headquarters
and slain them all, one by one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Listen up,” Ning
said with a laugh. “I am Immortal Darknorth, Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Darknorth,
Ji Ning?” The eleven monster kings all quietly memorized this name.
As they did so, they continuously reflected on it, but no matter
what, they couldn’t recollect having heard of such a monstrously
powerful genius on the Star, Cloud, or Flame continents who was known
as Immortal Darknorth or who was known as Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I made a promise to
the survivors of the imperial Qi clan. I will hold to it and protect
them,” Ning said with a laugh. “I urge you all to leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eleven monster
kings stealthily sent messages to each other, but their decision had
been made long ago. Leave? What a joke. Even if this was a Celestial
Immortal Patriarch, they would still attack. One of their brothers
had just died; how could they possibly choose to flee without even
fighting?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble the
formation!” The Goldfur Bearking ordered mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Formless strands of
glowing elemental ki sprang up around the bodies of the eleven
monster kings. They used just a very rudimentary sort of combination
technique, a technique that was similar to the [Netherwyrm Heavenlock
Formation] in that it allowed them to pool and share their elemental
ki! The elemental ki of eleven monster kings merged together…this
allowed the power of their attacks to rise to a brand new level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Use all abilities
you have to kill him,” the Goldfur Bearking sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh. Instantly,
one Immortal-ranked magic treasure after another appeared in front of
the eleven monster kings. As for the Goldfur Bearking, a total of
ninety-nine pearl-type magic treasures appeared around him, each one
with the aura of an Immortal-ranked magic item. Clearly, this was a
set of items. As the leader of the twelve monster kings and the only
one truly comparable to a Celestial Immortal, someone capable of
forcing even Celestial Immortals to retreat, the Goldfur Bearking
naturally had some truly extraordinary Immortal-ranked magic
treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! As they joined
into their formation, Ning charged forward as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eleven monster
kings shared their elemental ki together, using all of their
specialized techniques. After all, if they didn’t have a truly
supreme formation like the ‘Grand Soaring Bear Formation’, it was
better to just share and pool their elemental ki as they used their
own best techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Streaks of light
appeared in the skies. Enormous flaming phoenix wings that blazed for
thirty thousand meters…a black deluge of water that surged towards
Ning…boundless amounts of golden light that streaked and stabbed
towards Ning…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both Ning and the
eleven monster kings had a degree of insight into the Grand Dao of
Qiankun. They all activated the power of the natural world, freezing
the local space with the intention of binding their opponents,
preventing them from teleporting away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course, one could
still use a Greater Teleportation Dao-seal to flee…but who would
choose to flee at a time like this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The monster king
died.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That human is
actually this terrifyingly powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vast horde of
monsters that had been led here by the monster kings primarily
consisted of the most talented and skilled monsters within the court
of the Flamewing King! They numbered tens of Loose Immortals as well
as many Primal Diremonsters and Wanxiang Diremonsters. However, even
their king had been killed by this human youth in a single exchange;
how would they possibly dare to charge forward?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And now, the other
eleven monster kings were attacking the human youth together. A
battle at this level was something which fodder like them would play
no role in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The surrounding
space has been locked. There’s no way to teleport.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems the monster
kings aren’t willing to let the human escape. They insist on
killing him.” As the monsters saw this, their eyes lit up. As they
saw it, the eleven monster kings, when fighting in unison, would
definitely have the upper hand. As to whether or not they would be
able to kill this human…that was hard to say.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three-headed,
six-armed Ning was three hundred meters tall, and his six swords were
also three hundred meters long now. Whirling his six sharp swords, he
sent sword-light criss-crossing across the sky, resisting the attacks
of the eleven monster kings!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” While
blocking attacks, Ning continued to move closer and closer towards
the monster kings. However, given that he was under heavy attack, how
fast could he possibly move? The monster kings were able to easily
pull away from Ning, and the pearl-type magic treasures of the
Goldfur Bear King were particularly fierce. Every single pearl was
like a miniature star that smashed down towards him with the weight
of a massive mountain, causing Ning to feel very taxed when blocking
them. Another monster king, the Mountback monster king, controlled a
mountain-type magic treasure that smashed down with even greater
power than the pearls. Fortunately, however, he only possessed a
single such treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword is an agile
weapon. In the face of other attacks, Ning was able to deflect with a
degree of ease, but he was at a disadvantage when faced with these
heavy smashing blows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, big brother,
although this human has the power of a Celestial Immortal, you also
have the power of a Celestial Immortal. Although the rest of us are a
bit weaker, when we join forces we can completely suppress him.
However…he is a Fiendgod Body Refiner with extremely powerful
recuperative abilities. Still…that will only allow him to delay the
inevitable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If this continues,
he will definitely die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My brothers, be
careful; don’t let him use a Greater Teleportation Dao-seal to
escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry, big
brother; we are using many Immortal-ranked magic treasures to attack
him. How can he possibly have the time to pull one out and activate
it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The monster kings were
filled with an aura of explosive might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was being
assaulted by dozens of Immortal-ranked magic treasures, and every
single wielder was an expert who was at least comparable to a Loose
Immortal who had lived for five hundred thousand years. The Goldfur
Bearking was comparable to a Loose Immortal who had lived for over a
million years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Urgh.” Ning was
repeatedly struck by one of the pearls, causing him to vomit up
blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s almost
finished.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The monster kings all
directed their Immortal-ranked magic treasures to attack, wanting to
seize this chance to slay Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But right at this
moment, Ning mused to himself mentally: “This should be the right
moment.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Not too far away
from Ning, another figure suddenly appeared out of nowhere. This was
a black-robed Ji Ning who emanated an extremely powerful aura, the
aura of a late Void-stage Earth Immortal. Behind him there was a
sword sheath, and within the sword sheath were many Immortal swords
that had been turned illusory and transient. The black-robed Ning
pointed his finger, and instantly…swish swish swish!!! The nine
seemingly-illusory black Immortal swords instantly flew out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heavenraker!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning’s
eyes flashed with a cold light. Instantly, the nine translucent black
flying swords instantly slashed through the skies, causing massive
black scar to appear in the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why was this technique
known as [Heavenraker]?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This technique used the
sword as the rake, and the heavens as the field. Mortals would use
rakes and plows to tear through the fields, while Ning’s
sword-light was like a rake that would tear through the firmament
like a field. Nine massive black scars instantly appeared in the
skies, stretching towards the monster kings and enveloping three of
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s a
Primaltwin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This human brat
actually has a Primaltwin!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At the late
Void-stage!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eleven monster
kings were all shocked. As soon as Ning’s Primaltwin had emerged,
it had immediately used [Heavenraker], a sword technique developed by
a Daofather of the Great Firmament. In addition, he was using it with
nine top-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords, and ones that were
specially designed to form into the [Heavenraker] sword formation at
that! This technique was unquestionably Ning’s most powerful attack
right now!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning used the
[Starseizing Hand], perhaps only the hand which wielded the
Thousandbull Sword, a weapon almost comparable to Pure Yang
treasures, would be able to unleash power which surpassed one of the
nine swords in the [Heavenraker Sword Formation]. As for the combined
attack of all nine swords? Even the Thousandbull Sword was a bit
weaker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Block it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry and block it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other monster kings
moved to help, and the three monster kings assaulted by the
[Heavenraker] swords were completely focusing on blocking the
technique, but…they were unable to!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A look of utter despair
appeared in the eyes of the three monster kings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! All
three of them were instantly killed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Heavenraker]
formation of Ning’s Primaltwin was currently Ning’s most powerful
technique. It was also incredibly fast; although the three monster
kings knew that they wouldn’t be able to block it, there was no
time at all for them to use Greater Teleportation Dao-seals to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Ning’s true
body charged forward as well as his Primaltwin once more launched the
[Heavenraker] towards the other monster kings. The remaining monster
kings instantly grew both panicked and frantic!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, having fought
with them earlier, already knew about the techniques they had
available to them. As the saying went, know thyself and know thy foe;
in doing so, you shall be victorious in all your battles. When his
Primaltwin executed the [Heavenraker], he had focused on the weakest
ones of the eleven! Naturally, he had been completely successful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Ning’s true
body exploded with full power as well. Previously, all six of Ning’s
Immortal swords were comparable in power because Ning was hiding the
full might of the Thousandbull Sword. The enemies believed all six
swords to be identical in power! But now that the real attack had
begun, Ning naturally would no longer hide anything at all. He
exploded forth with full power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“KILL!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Thousandbull Sword
was three hundred meters long, and as it chopped out, the illusion of
an old black bull could be vaguely seen above the sword. The old
black bull was emanating an utterly astonishing sword-ki, and as the
sword itself struck out, it seemed to have transformed into an
enormous divine black dragon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of
single-target attacks, even the [Heavenraker] swords were inferior to
this blow. The Jadetoad King was immediately heavily injured, and a
second blow from Ning’s Darknorth sword finished him off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Retreat!” The
Goldfur Bearking gritted his teeth and howled angrily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too late!” The
reason why Ning had previously hid his power was for the sake of
letting it all explode forth now. Holding nothing back at all, his
Primaltwin and his true body both attacked at maximum force. The
astonishingly fast strikes of his Primaltwin’s [Heavenraker] swords
tore jagged wounds into the skies, and the nine tears were like
infinite chains that came to drag away the lives of the monster
kings.

Chapter 25 - The Monster Kings Flee For Their Lives
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is this human so
powerful?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The monster kings were
terrified and gripped by despair. Of the group, only their boss, the
Goldfur Bearking, was able to withstand Ji Ning’s attacks. The
others were only able to buy themselves a bit of time, but Ning’s
terrifying [Heavenraker] attacks and savage close-combat strikes
would take their lives if they made even the slightest of mistakes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. A bloody streak
of light flashed through the skies as the Redhate monster quickly
fled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go.” A
gale arose, but six streaks of distorted sword-rifts appeared in the
skies, surrounding that gale and slaughtering three of the monster
kings who had been on the verge of fleeing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had truly stumbled
into a hornet’s nest. The Twelve Monster Kings of the Eastern Flows
had never imagined that this human, this Immortal Darknorth, would
have reached such a terrifying level of power. If they had been able
to use the perfect, complete ‘Grand Soaring Bear Formation’, they
definitely would’ve been able to suppress Ning…but Ning had
plotted to kill the Flamewing King right off the start, causing them
to only be able to fight individually.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s own level of
power was simply too strong. Ning’s Primaltwin was at the late
Void-stage and trained in the [Darknorth Sutra], a Ki Refining
Technique developed by a Daofather of the Great Firmament. In terms
of elemental ki, he had an amount that was comparable to the amount
which Immortal Northwalker had previously possessed. In terms of
sword-arts, he was comparable as well. But more importantly, Ning had
a full set of nine top-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords that were
perfectly suited to the [Heavenraker] sword technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, the power of
Ning’s Primaltwin was on a level higher than even Immortal
Northwalker!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s true body was
a bit weaker, but the Thousandbull Sword was exceptionally ferocious.
In addition, wounds were not a problem for his Fiendgod body, and
slashes and stabs were of minor import. This caused the Loose
Immortal monster kings to fear fighting Ning in close combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two Nings. One had
incomparably powerful long range attacks that surpassed each of the
monster kings in might. The other had a Fiendgod body that excelled
in close combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Combined, the two
utterly dominated these eleven monster kings that were unable to
assemble into their standout formation, causing one after another to
perish as they tried to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Darknorth.”
The Goldfur Bearking stood there in midair, his voice booming. “What
sort of a grudge did you have against the twelve of us, for you to
repeatedly plot against us in such a manner?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, the Goldfur
Bearking could tell that Ning had been scheming against them this
entire time. Ning had first feigned weakness and had even lowered the
power of the Thousandbull Sword, only to suddenly unleash it later on
and kill three of the monster kings. The monster kings had
immediately been thrown into a state of utter chaos. Each and every
action of this Immortal Darknorth was clearly meant to result in the
deaths of the twelve of them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three figures
disappeared into the horizons. Ning shook his head and sighed softly.
“I was so careful, but I only killed eight of them.” He only had
a single main body and his Primaltwin, while his opponents were far
more numerous. When they all moved to flee, they all began to use
formidable agility techniques; naturally, Ning was unable to kill
them all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Goldfur Bearking
was so angry, he almost vomited blood. ‘Only’ killed eight of
them?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“CHOP!” Ning’s
gaze turned towards the distant Goldfur Bearking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh. Nine streaks
of distorted sword-tears ripped through the skies, wrapping around
the body of the massive Goldfur Bearking. The ninety-nine pearl-type
magic treasures around the Goldfur Bearking, however, moved about in
extremely profound ways as they joined together in three layers of
defense. The defense was extremely tight and blocked off Ning’s
sword-light attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t waste your
energy. I’ve fought against more than ten Celestial Immortals, and
none of them were able to do anything to me.” The Goldfur
Bearking’s voice boomed out as he growled, “Tell me, why did you
kill my brothers?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brothers?” Ning
shook his head. “Goldfur Bearking, all of the other monster kings
were wreathed in enormous amounts of sin, and each of them were
covered by more than three hundred meters of bloody sin light. You,
however, have an extremely low amount of sin; you just have a bit of
a corrosive black aura around you. You are completely different from
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Goldfur Bearking
nodded slowly. “Truth. You speak truth. They are too blind, too
foolish, too insane. I am more clear-headed than them. In the face of
the Three Calamities and Nine Tribulations, they were all gripped by
despair and so no longer cared about incurring sin at all. But I know
that the more sins one commits, the more powerful the Three
Calamities and Nine Tribulations are. I want to live longer;
naturally, I won’t let large amounts of sin wrap around me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But they were my
subordinates, the subordinates I used to unify the Eastern flows
region. You’ve destroyed everything.” The Goldfur Bearking
growled, “I don’t wish to be enemies with you, but I want to
understand things clearly. Why did you have to kill them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Because of…”
Ning said with a laugh, “Sin!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Goldfur Bearking
suddenly understood. “Ah, I see. You wish to kill great sinners so
as to accumulate more karmic merit. The more karmic merit you accrue,
the easier it will be and the more help you will have during your
tribulation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” Ning
chuckled. “It is because of a test my master gave me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The Goldfur
Bearking was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I must kill ten
great sinners. This is my trial,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Goldfur Bearking
was speechless. “What…what school are you from? Why would you be
given a trial like this? And…you are already so powerful. Who would
dare give you a trial? Can it be that your master is a True Immortal
or an Empyrean God?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You don’t need to
worry about that. Let me ask you a question; compared to Celestial
Immortals, how strong am I?” Ning asked. Since this Goldfur
Bearking had fought with more than ten Celestial Immortals, he should
be able to give an accurate assessment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Goldfur Bearking
nodded. “You are a Sword Immortal. Your attacks are extremely
powerful, especially those of your Primaltwin, which has reached the
level of an average Celestial Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for your true
body, it is a bit weaker; it should be at the level of a weak
Celestial Immortal. Still…your true body should have an extremely
powerful Immortal-ranked flying sword which is clearly more
formidable than the other five. Although you are ‘only’ at the
level of a weak Celestial Immortal, you have the advantage of being a
Fiendgod Body Refiner.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If the twelve of us
had been able to form into the ‘Grand Soaring Bear Formation’, we
would’ve been able to suppress you. Without it, however, you were
able to break us down one by one and defeat us. The other eleven were
comparatively weak and were not quite comparable to Celestial
Immortals yet,” the Goldfur Bearking evaluated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Loose Immortals were
capable of living for a hundred thousand years, three hundred
thousand years, five hundred thousand years, seven hundred thousand
years, nine hundred thousand years, a million years…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The longer they
survived, the greater their power became.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Back in the world of
the Grand Xia, Immortal Floatcloud was merely a Loose Immortal at the
hundred thousand year tier. These monster kings, however, were all at
least at the five hundred thousand year tier. The Goldfur Bearking
had surpassed the million-year tier, which was the level of Immortal
Northwalker. As for Immortal Juhua, he had lived for millions of
years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Ning nodded,
now having a rough estimation of his level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Darknorth,
if there’s anything you need, you can come visit me at Goldtop
Mountain.” After speaking, the Goldfur Bearking transformed into a
streak of golden light and disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning watched as the
Goldfur Bearking left. He mused softly to himself, “The defense of
that Goldfur Bearking was quite formidable. Those ninety-nine
pearl-type treasures…the value of that entire set is definitely
incalculable. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to acquire it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Having
suddenly thought of something, Ning took a step back and returned to
the cliff. The mountain was now a full level shorter than it had been
in the past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand and
an Immortal estate appeared. Bluecliff Xiaoyu and the imperial Qi
clansmen emerged from the Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
The imperial Qi clansmen stared around in terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Did that Immortal
Darknorth die, resulting in the Twelve Monster Kings of the Eastern
Flows acquiring his Immortal estate? Are we now in the hands of
monsters?” The black-robed princess was terrified as well. Xiaoyu
stared around with worry as well, searching for her master’s
figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…they were
all transfixed by what they saw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because they
saw Ning seated next to the cliff, a gourd of wine in his hands. He
was sipping it and staring towards the endless sea of clouds in the
sky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where are the
monsters?” Qi Rufeng was awestruck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But, but…” The
black-robed princess was stunned as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, Master.”
Xiaoyu ran over to Ning’s side. Amongst Immortal cultivators,
masters and disciples had extremely close relationships. As the
saying went, ‘one who is your master for a day should be revered as
a parent for a lifetime’; this saying was no joke. After all, the
benevolence shown by a master in transmitting the Dao was extremely
great. Xiaoyu was very excited to discover that the seemingly
young-looking youth was still alive and perfectly fine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Darknorth,
where are the Twelve Monster Kings of the Eastern Flows?” Qi Rufeng
didn’t dare believe that Ning had the power to defeat the twelve of
them, and he couldn’t help but ask this question.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unfortunately, I
only killed eight of them.” Ning shook his head and sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” Qi Rufeng’s
eyes bulged out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning paid him no
attention. He continued to drink his wine and stare at the scenery.
Although he was in quite a good mood, he still felt rather regretful.
His trial for acquiring the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] was to kill ten
great sinners, but he had only killed eight! He was still missing
two! If he had just killed two more of them, he would be able to go
back to Mount Innerheart and learn the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] right
away. Now, however, he would need to remain here for at least another
short period of time and find two more great sinners to kill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
Darknorth…senior Dark…?” Qi Rufeng couldn’t help but call out
repeatedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Xiaoyu
called out softly as well. At the same time, she couldn’t help but
use her dainty little hand to gently touch Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned to look at
her. Xiaoyu’s face was full of questions. She whispered, “Master,
you said you killed eight of them? But this…this…” She was a
mere Zifu Disciple; the twelve monster kings were incomparably
exalted figures in her eyes. The entirety of the Eastern Flows were
ruled by them. Her master had claimed to kill eight of them? He
must’ve actually just killed eight ordinary Loose Immortal
monsters, right?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look.” Ning
disdainfully waved his hand, and one Immortal-ranked magic treasure
after another appeared in midair. These items had been left behind by
the eight slain monster kings, and each of them emanated powerful
ripples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eyes of Crown
Prince Qi Rufeng, who had the most experience of the lot, instantly
bulged out. He had seen Immortal-ranked magic treasures back in the
imperial palace, which was why his eyes were bulging out right now.
“These…these…these are all Immortal-ranked magic treasures? So
many…how…what…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This set of
Immortal-ranked treasures!” Qi Rufeng suddenly stared at six
scimitars that hung in the skies. The six scimitars were the very
same Immortal-ranked magic treasures which the Flamewing King had
used long ago to slaughter a path through the Qi Empire. Qi Rufeng
would never forget the scene of how one Loose Immortal after another
fell in the face of those scimitars’ wanton slaughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This set belonged to
the Flamewing King. He’s dead now,” Ning said calmly. “He was
one of the eight I killed. I promised to protect you for a year, or
until I killed the Flamewing King. I’ve accomplished my promise and
I’ve done enough. You can go now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning began to walk
towards his Immortal estate, then instructed to Xiaoyu, “Xiaoyu,
come with me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Y…yes master.”
Bluecliff Xiaoyu immediately followed Ning into the estate
obediently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the two entered the
Immortal estate, the Crown Prince and the princess simply stood there
and stared at the estate for a long, long moment.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_26___Success"></A>
Chapter 26 - Success
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crown prince and
the princess were indeed rather dazed. They could clearly see that
the person before them was merely a Primal Daoist. For him to kill
hundreds of Flamewing Guards was one thing, but how was it that he
had killed eight of the Twelve Monster Kings of the Eastern Flows?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they hadn’t
personally witnessed it, the tens of Immortal-ranked magic treasures
before them were real. They didn’t believe that the Flamewing King
and the other monster kings who had used these Immortal-ranked magic
treasures to dominate the region would just voluntarily give them to
senior Darknorth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother, we must
take on this senior Darknorth as our master. Once we miss this
opportunity, we might never encounter someone like him again for the
rest of our lives,” the black-robed princess suddenly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The crown
prince’s eyes lit up as he nodded repeatedly. “Senior Darknorth
is even more formidable than the twelve monster kings! He is far more
powerful than our Qi Empire ever was.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed
princess said solemnly, “The Flamewing King is now dead; the
Flamewing Guards under his command were sent fleeing in panic. They
know that we are under senior Darknorth’s protection, and so the
surviving ones definitely will not pursue us any longer. In the
future, we will no longer need to flee.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crown prince was
startled for a moment, but then he nodded repeatedly with excitement.
He hadn’t seen the situation as clearly as his little sister.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But the only two
survivors of the imperial Qi clan are the two of us. How are supposed
to grow stronger?” The black-robed princess said in a low voice,
“The two of us, relying on our own efforts…we will probably never
see the Qi Empire returned to its former glory again in our
lifetimes. But by borrowing the strength of senior Darknorth, we
would still have hope.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Qi Rufeng
nodded solemnly. “Let’s go take him on as our master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have to do so
with sincerity. For someone as formidable as senior Darknorth…if he
detects even a hint of insincerity, he will probably refuse,” the
black-robed princess warned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two siblings thus
entered the Immortal estate as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a hall in the
Immortal estate. Bluecliff Xiaoyu was seated there, watching as the
two imperial siblings entered the estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We wish to see
senior Darknorth,” Qi Rufeng said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master is in
seclusion right now. Wait a bit.” Xiaoyu didn’t shoo them away,
because she knew that the only reason why the two were able to enter
the Immortal estate was because Ning had permitted it. Ning was the
master of this estate, after all; if he didn’t wish to permit it,
there was no way they would’ve been able to enter at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why Ning had
let them enter was because he had discovered some interesting things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A treasure trove?”
Ning flipped through the maps in front of him. There were eight maps,
all identical, and all pointing towards a treasure trove!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the eight
slain monster kings were formidable, their storage-type magic
treasures were all merely Heaven-ranked items. It was naturally quite
easy for Ning to bind them. As he sorted through their items, he
discovered to his surprise…that every single storage item contained
a map of a treasure trove. All the maps were completely identical.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The treasure maps only
had some simple markings atop them, such as ‘Qi Empire’,
‘Riverfang Mountains’, etc. This made it so that Ning knew that
the treasure map was originally created by the imperial Qi clan! This
was the reason why Ning permitted the two imperial Qi clansmen to
enter his estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Each of the eight
monster kings had a copy of this map, with the Flamewing King’s
copy being much older. The other seven should’ve been made through
a ink-duplication technique.” Ning frowned. “Right…I merely
killed a few hundred of Flamewing Guards, but all twelve of the
monster kings immediately attacked just a short while later.
Logically speaking, the twelve of them should be scattered throughout
the Eastern Flows; it would take them quite a bit of time just to
spread the word to gather here. There can only be one
explanation…when word of my slaughter of hundreds of Flamewing
Guards made its way to the Flamewing King, the other monster kings
were already present!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What sort of a
situation would cause all twelve monster kings to gather together?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given that every single
one of them had a copy of this treasure map…Ning had his answer.
“They were most likely gathering for the sake of this treasure
trove!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately began
to search through the other items, paying especially close attention
to the storage treasure of the Flamewing King. And indeed…although
he didn’t find anything in the other storage treasures, within the
Flamewing King’s items, Ning found an ancient book with golden
parchment; clearly, it was designed to be able to withstand the
passage of ages.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first time I
ventured to the Riverfang Mountains, I was merely adventuring and
entered by accident…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am already a
Void-level Earth Immortal; before my tribulation comes, I’ve
decided to venture there once more, even though I know this place is
very dangerous. I’ve only investigated a very small portion of this
treasure trove; I trust that if I can acquire some more treasures, I
will have a good chance of overcoming my Celestial Tribulation and
becoming a Celestial Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“……”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Six Loose Immortals
once more ventured to the Riverfang Mountains…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This time, we
prepared many Dao-seals and treasures before venturing forth to the
Riverfang Mountains…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning flipped through
the pages of the book. This was a legacy record passed down by the
imperial Qi clan; it described the secrets of the Qi Empire’s
sudden rise to power. The founding emperor of the Qi Empire had
acquired a portion of the benefits of the treasure trove and thus
founded his empire. In just a a few tens of thousands of years, the
Qi Empire had grown to encompass an enormous territory and have quite
a few Earth Immortals and Loose Immortals. Thus, the imperial Qi clan
had naturally tried repeatedly to enter and investigate further. As
they did, they had noted down the various dangers within the treasure
trove.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They wanted to
accumulate more experience and penetrate deeper within!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A treasure trove?”
Ning said softly in surprise, “Based on what this book describes,
this treasure trove has Ki Refining Techniques, divine abilities, and
secret arts…and is the reason why the Qi Empire was able to give
birth to dozens of Earth Immortals and Loose Immortals within a short
span of just a few tens of thousands of years. This is far more
formidable than the Black-White College; I imagine that these
techniques also vastly surpass the Black-White College’s.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. I need to go
take a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While at Mount
Innerheart, Ning would often chat with his fellow disciples, and so
he naturally knew quite a few things about this Crescent world. For
example…he knew about the secrets of Viledragon River. He also knew
the secrets of many other places.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Patriarch
Subhuti had created the Crescent world, in truth, when Pangu’s
World had shattered, Patriarch Subhuti had used a powerful divine
ability to teleport some of the shattered portions of the Primordial
World to his own Crescent world. In addition, when Patriarch Subhuti
wanted to test something or create something a new, his experiments
would be carried out here on the Crescent world! This was because
this world was his territory; the secrets here would never be
released to outsiders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From what my senior
fellow disciples told me…within this Crescent world are some
remnant parts of the ancient Pangu’s World, as well as some of the
treasures left behind by that cataclysmic war.” Ning instantly felt
a hot eagerness rise in his heart. Very few knew this secret, and
almost all who did were the personal disciples of the Old Patriarch.
Thus, they would often go roving and exploring within the Crescent
world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But after the Old
Patriarch sealed off these places with vestigial powers left behind
by the cataclysmic war that ended Pangu’s World…if one doesn’t
visit the places in person, it would be very hard to locate the
places from afar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now, it seems…this
treasure trove is one of those special places.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt quite
certain. This was because the book stated that the deepest ripples
within the treasure trove caused the Loose Immortals of the Qi Empire
to tremble with terror. It must be understood that Loose Immortals
were capable of suppressing and binding Immortal-ranked magic
treasures, and sometimes even capable of suppressing Pure Yang
treasures. A treasure that could cause them to feel terror? Could it
be the corpse of a major power from the Primordial Era? A weapon? A
grand formation? Or was it some other oddity?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to go take a
look.” Ning immediately made up his mind to go take a look. Since
destiny had come knocking, why hesitate?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crown prince and
the princess waited for Ning for a long time. Finally, Ning came out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning asked questions
them regarding the treasure trove. The second princess knew nothing
of this matter, while Crown Prince Qi Rufeng hemmed and hawed, not
wanting to reveal the biggest secret of their imperial Qi clan.
However, by the time Ning spoke of the Riverfang Mountains…the
crown prince felt regret for his hesitation. Only now did he
hurriedly reveal everything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can leave now.”
This was the last thing Ning said to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crown prince and
the princess both fell to their knees, wanting to beg Ning to take
them on as disciples. But Ning’s response was very simple; he
teleported them outside the Immortal estate, and then caused the
entire Immortal estate to vanish into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crown prince, the
princess, and their servants stood there in a daze, atop the
half-shattered mountain peak. The mountain wind blew through their
hair, causing them to feel despair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The opportunity was
right there in front of me. Why didn’t I tell him? It’s just a
treasure trove! Senior Darknorth already knew about it; he must’ve
been considering taking us on as disciples, and just wanted to give
us a test. But I didn’t tell him! Damn me!” Crown Prince Qi
Rufeng was utterly tormented by regret.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But he had no idea that
even if he had been honest, Ning still wouldn’t have taken him on
as a disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How could one accept
disciples in such a casual manner?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t
immediately hurry to the treasure trove area in the Riverfang
Mountains. Instead, he went to search for those two other great
sinners.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He first went to search
for the three surviving monster kings of the Twelve Monster Kings of
the Eastern Flows who had fled. Unfortunately…the only one Ning
found was the fourth, the ‘Venomspike King’. The Venomspike King
was drinking unhappily in his palace with a belly full of anger and
unhappiness. He was toying with a beautiful, fox-like maiden in his
arms as he drank.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning appeared, the
Venomspike King was so terrified that he wanted to immediately
flee…but how could Ning give him the opportunity to do so?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How the hell did I
piss you off?!” The Venomspike King was only able to let out one
final enraged bellow before being killed by Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning then spent more
than half a month before finally finding a Loose Immortal within a
school whose evil reputation was widespread. This was a human Loose
Immortal, and the most powerful expert of his school! This was an old
fellow who had lived for six hundred thousand years. His school was
an evil one, and so Ning immediately went to uproot this vile base!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He first slaughtered
three Loose Immortals who charged towards him, causing the old fellow
to appear at last. As the many disciples of the school watched with
anticipation…their ‘infinitely powerful’ and savage Patriarch
battled against Ning for a period of time, then was pincered and
slain by Ning’s true body and Primaltwin!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a fellow. His
power was close to the Goldfur Bearking’s; only, his defense was a
bit weaker.” Ning had enjoyed this battle quite a bit. He had also
acquired two more Immortal-ranked magic treasures from the old
fellow, one a high-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasure, one a
top-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the most
powerful person Ning had slain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wonderful,
wonderful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve killed so
many formidable Loose Immortals, all of whom were surrounded by
vicious, baleful auras. My three Darknorth swords are now comparable
to high-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords now.” Ning felt quite
delighted; killing ordinary Loose Immortals didn’t do much, but the
nine monster kings and that wicked Patriarch released an absolutely
astonishing amount of baleful energy when slain. The wicked Patriarch
in particular; his baleful aura was comparable to four or five of the
monster kings combined!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I kill ten more
figures like that wicked Patriarch, I imagine that my Darknorth
swords will be comparable to top-grade Immortal-ranked flying
swords.” This was Ning’s estimation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had successfully
taken on a disciple. He had also killed ten great sinners. Now, Ning
led his disciple, Bluecliff Xiaoyu, to the Riverfang Mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So these are the
Riverfang Mountains?” Ning stared towards the distance. The
mountains here stretched out past the horizon and were perpetually
shrouded by fog and clouds. From Ning’s vantage point, these
mountains did indeed look like a series of sharp fangs that were
jutting towards the skies.

Chapter 27 - Riverfang Mountains
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ji Ning stared at
the distant Riverfang Mountains, he couldn’t help but feel his
heart skip a beat. He could vaguely sense an incomparably terrifying
threat that lay coiled deep within the mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At my current level
of power…there are very few people in the entire Crescent world who
can pose a threat to me. The ones who are more powerful than me have
almost all been recruited into Mount Innerheart; when they see me,
they might even have to address me as ‘uncle-master’. Even the
True Immortals and Empyrean Gods would be my fellow disciples,”
Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roaming within the
Crescent world should be like roaming within his own family garden.
This was the very first time he felt a thrill of fear!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems there
really is some danger here, enough danger to threaten me.” Ning
nodded lightly. “Mm. If the situation looks bad, I’ll immediately
hide in the underwater estate. Later, I’ll ask Master to help me
escape back to Mount Innerheart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When trapped in dire
circumstances, ask for Master’s aid. Although this was a bit
shameless, Ning was within the Crescent world, after all; his master
couldn’t be too strict with him. In addition, after he truly left
the Crescent world, Ning wouldn’t even be able to mention his
master’s name; he’d have to rely on himself for everything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master?” The
nearby Bluecliff Xiaoyu called out softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced sideways
at his disciple, then said with a laugh, “Xiaoyu, I am going into
the mountains to take a look. These mountains are very dangerous; go
into the Immortal estate first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master,”
Xiaoyu said obediently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his arm,
immediately drawing Xiaoyu into his Immortal estate. And then, by
himself, Ning transformed into a streak of light that flew straight
into the Riverfang Mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had acquired the
detailed records produced by successive generations of Qi Empire
experts. He soon reached the outer perimeter of the treasure trove.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” As he strode
through the mountains, Ning felt a strange sensation coming to him
through the earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill…kill…kill…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could vaguely sense
as though an invisible howl was being transmitted from far away
through the dirt, as though an unfathomably long period of time ago,
an enormous battle had occurred in this place. Even now, after so
many years had passed, the murderous intent from that battle remained
unabated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The earth here is
different from the ordinary earth found elsewhere in the Crescent
world. It’s clearly much heavier, and the earth’s aura in this
region is significantly denser as well.” Ning nodded lightly. “This
might truly be a tiny remnant of Pangu’s shattered Primordial World
which was teleported here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the aid of the
tests the imperial Qi clan had carried out, Ning quickly found a
mountain valley and began to walk through it. The clouds and the
mists coiled about here, making it so that even Ning was only able to
see to one or two kilometers. As for divine sense? What his divine
sense found was completely different from what his physical eyes
could see. This was because….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My divine sense has
been completely fooled. Everything my divine sense is showing me is
false.” Ning even stretched his hand out to touch a place,
ascertaining that his eyes weren’t being deceived as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He carefully advanced.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Far away, up ahead, he
saw an enormous ravine. Ning could sense a terrifyingly sharp
saber-intent radiating from that ravine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Apparently, although
this ravine looks as though it was naturally formed, it was actually
carved out through saber-ki.” Ning walked forward for the amount of
time needed to boil a kettle of tea. Suddenly, he felt an invisible
pressure envelop him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the same as
what was recorded within the Qi Empire’s book. According to the
book, the deeper one goes in, the greater the pressure shall become.
The experts of the various generations of the Qi Empire were all
ultimately forced to give up by this pressure and return. The pathway
I’m walking through right now should be the pathway with the least
amount of pressure.” Ning quickly advanced. As he did, the strength
of the pressure rose dramatically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning had first
entered this region, five thousand kilograms of pressure was evenly
being applied to his body. But now, it had already reached five
hundred thousand kilograms…fifty million kilograms…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A powerful repulsive
force collided against Ning’s body, causing a series of rumbling
sounds. The amount of pressure pushing down against Ning was now
comparable to a series of massive mountains that were smashing down
repeatedly towards him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even most Loose
Immortals wouldn’t be able to withstand this amount of pressure.”
Ning waved his hand, and the Thousandbull Sword appeared within it.
Brandishing the Thousandbull Sword, Ning caused a divine black dragon
to suddenly howl forth, striking against the pressure that was
crushing down against Ning and lessening it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pretty easy.” Ning
continued to advance forward while using the Thousandbull Sword to
chop apart the invisible pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clearly, this sort of
invisible pressure was born from some sort of ancient, powerful
restrictive formation; it sent pulses of pressure out to attack.
Loose Immortals were generally Ki Refiners with very weak bodies;
thus, if they wanted to advance, they would have to rely on their
magic treasures to break apart the pulses of pressure. Previously,
Ning had been relying on his Fiendgod Body and so didn’t need to
use any magic treasures to make it to this point.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Yet another
divine black dragon howled forth, leaving behind a dazzling arc in
the mist and blasting apart yet another pulse of pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After walking for
another period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Change!” Ning
suddenly transformed into his three-headed, six-armed form. Five more
Immortal swords appeared in his hands, all of them the illusory black
Heavenraker swords. In such a dangerous region, Ning was unwilling to
let his Primaltwin appear. Thus, his true body would temporarily use
the Heavenraker swords; after all, the power of top-grade
Immortal-ranked flying swords was very great.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With six top-grade
Immortal-ranked swords in his hands, as well as the [Three Heads, Six
Arms] divine ability, Ning once more found it easy to advance through
the region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The amount of divine
power [Three Heads, Six Arms] used up was more than ten times less
than the amount the [Starseizing Hand] used up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh whoosh whoosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six divine black
dragons howled forth, blasting apart one pulse of pressure after
another. However, some remnant pulses still made their way through
and struck Ning, causing explosive sounds when they did! Ning,
however, was a Fiendgod Body Refiner; so long as the remnant
pressures didn’t contain too much power, he would be fine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place is a
place the imperial Qi clansmen have never reached.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After walking for
another period of time, Ning realized that even with six Immortal
swords, he was beginning to feel a bit taxed. Right at this moment,
Ning saw a figure off in the distance. The figure saw Ning as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Darknorth.”
A booming voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Goldfur Bearking.”
Ning spoke out. The man before him was the tall, muscular Goldfur
Bearking. Around him were those ninety-nine pearls that were circling
and swirling as they broke apart the pulses of pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Darknorth,
you acquired a treasure map and discovered this place?” The Goldfur
Bearking said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just so.” Ning
didn’t deny it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Originally, the
twelve of us were planning to enter these Riverfang Mountains. We
were discussing this matter with our third brother, but when we
received word that hundreds of his Flamewing Guards had been slain,
all of us immediately followed him to your place to provide
support…but who would’ve thought that most of the others would
die, and that today I would be the only person to come to this
treasure trove? Oh, and you, Immortal Darknorth, the slayer of so
many monster kings…you came as well. Truly, anything can happen in
this world!” The Goldfur Bearking sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “I do
indeed need to thank the Flamewing King. Otherwise, how could I have
learned about this treasure trove? Still…why have you come to a
halt here? Are you unable to move any further?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was something
quite strange about this region. If one advanced, no matter towards
which direction, one would feel tremendous amounts of pressure
crashing down upon one’s body. However, if one didn’t move at
all, one wouldn’t suffer the pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, I can’t
move any further! You have a Fiendgod body, and so you can endure the
remnant repulsive force when it strikes you. Loose Immortals Ki
Refiners like myself, however, don’t dare to fight head on in such
a manner. We need to completely dissipate all of the terrifying
pressure, which requires an enormous amount of elemental ki to be
used up. I need to first restore more of my elemental ki before I go
in any further,” the Goldfur Bearking said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then I’ll take my
leave for now,” Ning said with a chuckle. Six top-grade
Immortal-ranked flying swords in his hands, Ning once more began to
force his way forward, quickly disappearing from the Goldfur
Bearking’s field of vision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The preparations we
made all ended up benefiting this Immortal Darknorth.” 1 The
Goldfur Bearking gritted his teeth, but he felt quite helpless. He
knew that Ning was more powerful than he was, and as a Fiendgod Body
Refiner, Ning had a better chance of survival in a place like this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Starseizing Hand]!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was finally forced
by the pressure to use his [Starseizing Hand].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the power of
the divine black dragons of sword-light increased dramatically. In
fact, Ning even temporarily cancelled his [Three Heads, Six Arms]
technique. Just by relying on the Thousandbull Sword and the
[Starseizing Hand], he carved a path forward!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Charge! Charge! Charge!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But gradually, Ning was
once again pressured to the point of being forced to use [Three
Heads, Six Arms]. All six arms were now using the [Starseizing Hand].
After a long period of time, Ning was even forced to take a break, so
as to recover his largely depleted divine power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Occasional breaks,
followed by occasional advances. Towards the end, Ning would have to
use six strikes of the [Starseizing Hand] for every thirty meters he
travelled. One could imagine how quickly his divine power was being
used up!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning took one more
step forward…he actually broke through and out of the pressure
region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahahaha.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I finally escaped
that damn place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed loudly.
There were no more ripples of pressure in this location. For the
first time in his life…Ning felt as though walking forward normally
was actually quite an enjoyable thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I spent nearly a
full day walking a mere several thousand kilometers, and I used up
all of my divine power several times.” Ning shook his head and
sighed. Still, he continued to advance with all six Immortal swords
at the ready. He tried to use his divine sense to scout ahead, but
unfortunately, his divine sense remained deceived, as everything it
was telling him was clearly false.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning walked forward,
following a winding creek. Fog and mist continued to swirl around the
region, causing him to only be able to see to a distance of one or
two kilometers, where he could vaguely make out a gorge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">CRA-KOW! Just as Ning
took a step forward, a bolt of lightning suddenly descended out of
nowhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Beat it!” Ning
didn’t hesitate at all as he immediately swung out all six swords
with full force. Six divine black dragons of sword-light hwoled
forward, shattering that bolt of lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crackle crackle
crackle…a large amount of lightning and thunder began to swell
forward towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Previously it was
invisible pressure…but at least that wasn’t lethal. But this
lightning is.” Ning hurriedly used his swordplay to defend. He
noticed that so long as he retreated, the number of attacking
thunderbolts would lessen. When he advanced, however, the attacking
thunderbolts would increase at an astonishing rate, growing
increasingly savage and increasingly powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was only able to
advance three hundred meters before being forced to come to a halt,
unable to advance any further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bolts of lightning
were now as thick as a water barrel. They wildly flooded towards and
hammered down upon Ning, who struggled to block them. He tried to
take a single step forward, but the increasingly frenetic
thunderbolts instantly pushed him backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do? I
can’t advance at all.” Ning was worried now. The attacks were
simply too powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had tested letting
a small amount of the lightning strike him, and his divine body had
easily deflected it. However, as he continued to test it, he realized
that there was a limit to how many thunderbolts his divine body could
endure. He had to use his sword-light to break apart the rest!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only reason he had
made it as far as he did was because of his Fiendgod-like body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Am I going to have
to go back? Going back is easy, as the number of lightning bolts will
lessen as I retreat. As for the pressure zone, I’ll only need
around half a day or so to move through it and slowly escape.” Ning
didn’t have any problems with leaving, unlike some; according to
the imperial Qi records, there had been Loose Immortals who had used
special methods to force a path forward, but after making it too far
in, they were unable to escape. This was because when leaving, they
still had to go through the pressure zone once more. They eventually
had to spend countless years retreating, one step at a time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What Ning didn’t
realize was that the Flamewing King had been trapped within the
pressure zone for tens of years!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless bolts of
lightning continued to slam down frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning truly didn’t
want to give up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kiddo, you came in
at such a low level of power? I urge you to hurry up and leave. Don’t
lose your life here!” A shrill voice suddenly rang out within
Ning’s ears.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_28___Returning_to_Mount"></A>
Chapter 28 - Returning to Mount Innerheart
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was someone else
here?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was startled.
He hurriedly retreated several meters, causing the striking lightning
bolts to weaken slightly. Only now did he dare divide his attention
to look around carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning frowned.
From the crevices between the bolts of lightning that continued to
hammer towards him, Ning saw a black-robed youth was standing far
away at the entrance to the distant gorge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Ning hurriedly
retreated, leaving from the thunder field region. All of the
lightning bolts vanished, allowing Ning to clearly see the figure at
the entrance to the gorge. The black-robed youth was similar to Mu
Northson in height, and even skinnier than Ning himself. However,
Ning could sense that this black-robed youth had been alive for a
long, long time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed youth’s
gaze was both sharp and terrifying. His face was expressionless; he
was most likely the type that was born arrogant and aloof.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who are you?” Ning
asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Me?” The
black-robed youth’s voice was shrill. He looked thoughtfully
towards Ning. “Even if I told you my name, kid, you wouldn’t
recognize it. You should be at the early Void stage, but you actually
broke through the first forbidden zone, and were even able to advance
three hundred meters in the second zone, the lightning zone. You just
barely qualify as having the power of a Celestial Immortal. For
someone to have such power at the early Void stage…which school do
you belong to? Who is your master?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
surprised. Celestial Immortal?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since the black-robed
youth had already arrived at the entrance to the gorge, he clearly
should’ve already made it past the lightning zone. This meant he
was far more powerful than Ning. Ning’s Primaltwin at full power
would be just barely at the average Celestial Immortal level; some
particularly formidable and monstrously talented Celestial Immortals
were far more powerful than him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My master’s name
is not for the likes of you to learn,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, is he a True
Immortal or Empyrean God?” The black-robed youth chuckled softly as
he carefully scrutinized Ning’s face. Ning, however, remained calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed youth
shook his head. “Leave, hurry up and leave. Even I am unable to
acquire the treasure within. Even if you were a hundred times
stronger than you are now, it wouldn’t suffice.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A hundred times?”
Ning frowned, not believing it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You don’t believe
it? Then listen to this; this treasure trove is divided into three
forbidden zones. The first zone simply uses pressure and repulsive
force! It is quite safe. The second zone is the lightning zone, and
it is 540 meters long in total. As for the third forbidden zone, it
forbids the usage of all magic treasures. Even I am unable to break
through it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed youth
looked disdainfully at Ning. “And you? You haven’t even overcome
a Celestial Tribulation. You might be a peerless genius, but you are
unable to advance past three hundred meters of the lightning zone.
You must know by now that with each step forward, the power in the
lightning zone increases dramatically. Only if your power increases
tenfold will you be able to break through the second zone…but the
third zone is even more terrifying. I imagine not even many Celestial
Immortals are capable of breaking through it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is in the third
forbidden zone?” Ning couldn’t help but ask.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s not for you
to worry about,” the black-robed youth said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why haven’t you
left?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m a Celestial
Immortal with an infinite lifespan. Since the treasure is here, I
will slowly train here. Perhaps a chance will present itself and I’ll
be able to acquire it,” the black-robed youth said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hearing this, Ning
instantly felt irritated. He could sense the faint ripples of power
coming from within the valley; the ripples were extremely old yet
very powerful. “The Thousandbull Sword is almost at the level of
Pure Yang treasures in power, but its ripples are vastly inferior.
The treasure within must have be an extremely powerful one that was
left behind from Pangu’s World.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…I can’t
even make it through the second forbidden zone. How am I suppose to
pass all three?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there by the
creek outside the lightning zone. He pondered quietly for a moment,
then gritted his teeth, turned, and left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quickly re-entered
the invisible pressure zone, slowly forcing his way outwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s gone?” The
black-robed youth shook his head. “A young kid who was far too
weak. Given his talent, though, he might have a shot at becoming a
Celestial Immortal.” And then, the black-robed youth once more
walked into the gorge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Darknorth,
you returned?” On the way back, Ning once more encountered the
Goldfur Bearking. The Goldfur Bearking was advancing again, but he
had only traversed a kilometer beyond his earlier point.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not strong
enough. Naturally, I have to return.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, in his
three-headed, six-armed form, wielded six Immortal swords and chopped
a path through the pressure pulses as he left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not strong enough?”
The Goldfur Bearking muttered to himself, “Is it possible that this
Darknorth has already acquired the treasures? Still, from the look on
his face, I’d say he isn’t lying.” Although he secretly mumbled
and muttered to himself, the Goldfur Bearking wasn’t confident in
being able to wrest any treasures from Ning’s grasp.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning exited the
Riverfang Mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Turning his head, he
gave the mountain ranges, perpetually shrouded by fog and clouds, a
glance. He murmured softly, “Wait for me to train in the arcane
art…I’ll give you another try then.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A spatial
ripple appeared, and Ning disappeared into it. He reappeared in the
sky above the mountain peak of Mount Innerheart, a cloud beneath his
feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come out.” Ning
willed it, and instantly a white-robed maiden appeared by his side.
This was Ning’s disciple, Bluecliff Xiaoyu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Xiaoyu
stood atop the cloud, staring at her surroundings. “Where are we
now?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at his
disciple, then turned to stare at the levitating Mount Innerheart. It
had only been a month, but he had already accepted a disciple and
killed ten great sinners. Bluecliff Xiaoyu’s golden glow of karmic
virtue stretched to more than nine hundred meters…and now, Ning’s
own clean aura of holiness had also transformed into the golden glow
of karmic virtue!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, his divine
sense told him that his own golden light of karmic virtue merely
stretched to be three feet long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, the process
of accepting a disciple and killing the monster kings had already
caused his clean aura of holiness to become quite dense; after he
killed the wicked Patriarch, it suddenly transformed into the golden
light of karmic virtue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three feet of golden
karmic light, compared to nine hundred meters for my disciple.”
Ning laughed, then pulled Xiaoyu by the hand as he flew upwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiaoyu, the mountain
up ahead is Mount Innerheart. This is the place where Master’s
school is located,” Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiaoyu stared at the
massive levitating mountain, then lowered her head to look at the
endless world beneath them. “Master’s school?” She felt rather
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They flew into Mount
Innerheart, went up the mountain road, and soon arrived at the gates.
Xiaoyu was only Ning’s disciple, and so Ning didn’t take her to
see the eldest apprentice-brother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the gates were those
two azure-robed Dao-novitiates. When they saw Ning, they immediately
bowed and said with great respect, “Patriarch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still stunned, Xiaoyu
let Ning tug her forward by the arm. After passing through the gates,
Xiaoyu came back to her senses. She whispered, “Master, it seems as
though those two novitiates at the gates were very powerful?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Both were Void-level
Earth Immortals,” Ning said casually.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as Ning’s words
came out, two extremely ancient and powerful Void-level Fiendgods
walked over. Both of them called out with tremendous courtesy,
“Patriarch?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The feeling these two
ancient Fiendgods gave Xiaoyu…was that they were even more
terrifying than the monster kings. They caused her to quiver and
shake! And yet, they referred to her master as ‘Patriarch’?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They continued walking
up the mountain path of the Tristar Crescent Abode. As they did so,
they encountered humans, monsters, and even Fiendgods, all of whom
had powerful auras and many of whom were even more terrifying than
the monster kings. And yet, upon seeing Ning, they all showed extreme
respect, addressing him as either ‘Patriarch’ or ‘Uncle-Master’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though
my master has a very high status in his school. On our way over…it
seems everyone we ran into had a lower status than him. I haven’t
even met a single person on his level,” Xiaoyu murmured to herself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Divinities
Palace is up ahead,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Divinities Palace?”
Xiaoyu looked curiously at the nine-storied Divinities Palace. Many
disciples of Mount Innerheart were congregating outside of it, and
they all respectfully bowed towards Ning and addressed him as
uncle-master or as Patriarch. Little Qing and Uncle White ran
straight towards him; they were spiritually connected to Ning and
knew exactly where he was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, child.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both Little Qing and
Uncle White ran over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment, a
handsome, white-robed man walked over from the entrance to the
Divinities Palace. This was naturally the controller of the
Divinities Palace, Silvermoon. Silvermoon smiled as he walked over.
“I heard, junior apprentice-brother, that you accepted a disciple
and subdued viledoers in the world below us. This would be the
apprentice you took on, yes? What a pretty little lass.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve finally met
someone of the same generation as Master…and they seem quite
friendly. He doesn’t have any frightening aura at all,” Xiaoyu
mused silently to herself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiaoyu, hurry up and
pay respects to your uncle-master,” Ning instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings,
uncle-master,” Xiaoyu said as she hurriedly bowed with respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since you’ve
addressed me as uncle-master, I need to prepare a gift for you.”
Silvermoon shook his head and laughed. “It’ll be hard for a
little girl like you to make proper use of a good treasure. Mmm…keep
this little toy with you. Even if a Celestial Immortal wants to kill
you, it’ll be able to protect you for the time needed to boil a
kettle of tea.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he spoke, he tossed
a jade brooch towards Xiaoyu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiaoyu was rather
stunned. A Celestial Immortal’s attacks? Able to withstand them for
a short period of time? This tiny little brooch? Not even the
treasure which her master had given her was this incredible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…but…”
Xiaoyu couldn’t help but feel awkward at the ‘pricelessness’ of
this treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and take
it,” Ning chortled. “This jade brooch is nothing to your
uncle-master. He kills Celestial Immortals as easily as killing
chickens.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, you…fine, I admit that I did indeed make this
jade brooch in a rather casual manner. I’ll also give you another
gift then, a Greater Teleportation Dao-seal. I’m not capable of
forging them; I used treasures to trade for it.” Silvermoon handed
over a Dao-seal to her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s smile became
incandescent. His senior apprentice-brother was an Empyrean God;
although a Greater Teleportation Dao-seal was a treasure to Ning, it
wasn’t much to Silvermoon. It was only fair for him to seize this
opportunity to milk Silvermoon for a few things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiaoyu blinked
repeatedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two treasures? Given
away so casually? Kill Celestial Immortals as easily as chickens?
This…what the hell type of school had she been recruited into?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Qing, show
Xiaoyu around the Tristar Crescent Abode and help her familiarize
herself with this place. Chat with her a bit as well; she still
doesn’t know what sort of a school the Tristar Crescent Abode is,”
Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.”
Little Qing immediately responded with excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately said,
“Senior apprentice-brother, I am going to go to the Three Realms
Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go, go,”
Silvermoon said, nodding his head and smiling. “It seems you are
going to leave our master’s tutelage soon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms
Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Second
apprentice-brother Crazy Ji was beaming merrily here as he waited for
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother.” Ning bowed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master told me that
you passed the trial. This is the full copy of the [Eight-Nine Arcane
Art]. You can learn it now.” Crazy Ji held his fan in one hand and
used the other to hand over a scrolled bamboo book.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes instantly
lit up. The [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]? After he gained a basic level of
expertise in it, his body would be like an Immortal-ranked magic
treasure. He would definitely be able to give the Riverfang Mountains
another try by then.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, senior
apprentice-brother.” Ning immediately accepted the bamboo book. He
sent his divine sense into it, and instantly an utterly prodigious
amount of information began to flow into his soul.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 29 - Training in the Arcane Art
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By the time Ji Ning
came back to his senses, it was already dark.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was still standing
outside the small building. As for the nearby Crazy Ji, he had long
since gone back to sleep and was snoring contentedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although my soul is
unfathomably more powerful than it was back when I learned the
[Starseizing Hand], it still took me many hours to process all that
information.” A hint of a smile was on Ning’s face. This feeling
of complete confidence was quite wonderful. He had fully memorized
the method of training in the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It truly is the
number one divine ability in the Three Realms for those below the
True God level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled as he
walked into the Three Realms Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, you can just put the complete copy of the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art] back in the Three Realms Palace. If you want
to choose something else, you can do so.” Crazy Ji lay there,
seemingly mumbling in his sleep. He then turned and started to snore
again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled. He turned
and bowed. “Yes, senior apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After returning the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art], Ning unhesitatingly walked forward to pick
up another abridged book. Atop this book were the characters:
[Houyi’s Archery].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had dreamed of
learning [Houyi’s Archery] for a long time now. His own divine
ability was the [Starseizing Hand], a divine ability which caused his
pair of hands to possess unfathomably great power. With one hand
holding the bow, and the other drawing it…and in addition, [Houyi’s
Archery] was a technique-focused ability. These two divine abilities,
both ranked in the top ten of the Three Realms, could be used
simultaneously and would synergize very well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first gave Ning’s
twin hands unfathomable power. The second would raise his archery
skills to the limit. Combined…they would become one of Ning’s
most powerful killer combinations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…this trial
truly is difficult. Can I accomplish it?” Ning stared at the trial,
frowning. “No matter what, I have to give it a try. There’s no
time limit, anyhow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother.” Ning put down the abridged book, walked to the
doorway, and looked at the slumbering Crazy Ji. “I wish to learn
[Houyi’s Archery].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go then. Come back
after you pass the trial,” Crazy Ji mumbled in his sleep.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled, turned his
head, and immediately departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, although on
the surface it seemed as though he was informing Crazy Ji, in reality
his was telling his master, Patriarch Subhuti! After all, it was the
Patriarch who would decide whether or not this technique could be
taught to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crazy Ji suddenly sat
up. Leaning against the wooden door of the hall, he frowned as he
stared at the departing Ning. “He wants to train in the [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art] and [Houyi’s Archery]? Doesn’t this little junior
apprentice-brother of mine walk the path of the Sword Immortal? Why
is it that I feel as though he views [Houyi’s Archery] as
absolutely critical for him to acquire? No one in the entire Three
Realms has ever reached a level of archery as terrifying as Houyi
did.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Starseizing Hand]
only required sufficient amounts of Five Elements essence; with it,
one could train all the way to the Sixth Cycle and master it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The same was also true
for the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]. Upon gaining a basic level of skill
with it, as long as one fused enough magic treasures, one could
master all nine of its cycles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the [Starseizing
Hand] and the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] both needed astonishing amounts
of items. The first required shocking amounts of Five Elements
essence, while the other required similarly shocking amounts of magic
treasures. There were quite a few people in the Three Realms who
trained in the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], but the number who truly
achieved mastery and an unbreakable, vajra-like body was very very
low.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Houyi’s Archery] was
completely different! It was a skill-based, technique-based ability.
It required a certain level of comprehension and enlightenment. This
made it even harder to master! It also required a person to
constantly ruminate on the Dao of Archery…although Houyi’s own
level of archery had already surpassed the bounds of the actual Dao
of Archery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Sword Immortal…who
is also going to split up his attention to walk the Dao of Archery?”
Crazy Ji pondered. “Perhaps it is simply because this junior
apprentice-brother knows that [Houyi’s Archery] is one of the top
ten divine abilities of the Three Realms, and so he truly wishes to
learn it. After he learns how truly difficult it is, he might just
give it up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Still Room
in the underwater estate. Ning was seated in the lotus position as he
began to train in the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]. This was a divine
ability, and so he had to have his true body train it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooosh. Ning let out a
breath of air. A blurry golden light began to slowly appear around
his body. The golden light was very faint at first, but it slowly
grew denser until Ning seemed to be made out of gold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Change!” Ji Ning,
who had been seated atop the netherwater jade bed, suddenly vanished.
Atop the jade bed appeared a rock. However, this rock had a living
aura; any Immortal cultivators would be able to immediately tell that
it was extraordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cancel.” The rock
disappeared and Ning once more reappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a Fiendgod Body
Refiner at Ning’s level, the divine body could be completely
transformed into divine power, and vice versa! In fact, even a single
hair could be transformed into a completely separate body! Thus, to
transform one’s self into a rock wasn’t difficult; what was
difficult was to make it so that one’s aura would be so retracted
that one would be indistinguishable from a true rock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Retract the aura?
Change even the aura of one’s soul?” Ning murmured softly to
himself, “This [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] truly is difficult to learn.
However…once I gain a basic level of expertise, I can change my
aura as I please and will be able to easily make it so that I am like
a rock or a piece of dirt.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Eight-Nine Arcane
Art] was the [Seventy-Two Transformations]. As noted, the term
‘seventy-two’ came from the term ‘eight-nine’; in reality,
the number of transformations it allowed was limitless. Rocks, trees,
flowers, plants, animals…even humans, monsters, and Fiendgods!
Anything that existed in the Three Realms, one could transform into.
Even the aura would become absolutely identical.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even those more
powerful than the user would find it difficult to see through the
transformation. Only those who specialized in extremely powerful
‘god-eye’ techniques or other special techniques, when actively
using those techniques, would be able to see the truth! If they
didn’t actively use the special techniques, however, even they
would be unable to realize that the tree before them was actually
someone else transformed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Early dawn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bluecliff Xiaoyu,
rather bored, walked out of her room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s been half a
year since Master brought me back to Mount Innerheart, but he’s
only taught me twice. He instructed me to go learn everything, such
as Ki Refining Techniques, divine abilities, and secret arts, from
the Divinities Palace.” Xiaoyu felt rather resigned. She knew that
some experts had strange temperaments, but she didn’t expect that
her master would care so little about her. She normally didn’t even
have a chance to meet him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mount Innerheart
truly is an incredible place.” Xiaoyu sighed in amazement. Over the
course of the past half year, she was often together with Uncle White
and Little Qing, as well as the other disciples of Mount Innerheart.
Thus, she was beginning to learn more and more. And the more she
learned, the more amazed she was!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortals?
Their statuses was lower than her master’s!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Personal disciples? The
others were all Pure Yang True Immortals or Empyrean Gods. The guard
of the Divinities Palace was an Empyrean God. No wonder that day her
master had told her that this uncle-master killed Celestial Immortals
as easily as chickens!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whaaaat?! The entire
Crescent world had been created by Patriarch Subhuti? He had set up
his own cycle of reincarnation? The Old Patriarch had done this all
by himself?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiaoyu now realized
that the entire Crescent world was like a garden world for the
members of Mount Innerheart. Supposedly, beyond the Crescent world,
there was the even vaster Three Realms. Supposedly, this ‘Three
Realms’ had many other major powers that were comparable to the Old
Patriarch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Um.” Xiaoyu saw a
large rock next to her as she walked forward. Without thinking too
much, she plopped her rear down on it and sat down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder when I’ll
see Master again,” Xiaoyu murmured to herself. And then…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” She suddenly
frowned, glancing downwards at the stone beneath her. “Weird. If
memory serves…there shouldn’t be a rock here. Where did this rock
come from? Uh…well, this is Master’s Immortal estate; everything
within it is under his control. No need for me to worry about it, I
suppose. Mm…right. I’m going to go find that big dumb lunk. He’s
at a fairly high level of enlightenment; he can provide me with some
guidance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bluecliff Xiaoyu stood
up and quickly ran off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stone transformed
into a fur-clad youth, Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…I was actually
sat on by my disciple.” Ning took a deep breath. “Fortunately, no
one saw this. Um…right. Definitely can’t tell anyone about this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No more transforming
into rocks. I’ll transform into a tree. I refuse to believe anyone
is going to sit on me then.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In a corner of the
estate, there were some trees and flowers. Another tree, a small pine
tree that was a few meters tall, now joined their ranks. The branches
of the tree even fluttered in the breeze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had already more
than half-mastered the rudiments to the transformation aspects of the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art]. What he was doing every day was transforming
into rocks, trees, creeks, grass, and other things. To this day, no
one had been able to discover him. In fact, Ning’s Primaltwin had
visually searched, used divine sense, and even opened the ‘Celestial
Eye’, but was still unable to discover any flaws!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning was
transformed into a tree, his bark, his branches, his leaves…they
were absolutely identical to real ones. Even the aura of his soul had
transformed into a tree’s aura! There was nothing special about it
at all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on, day by
day. Ning constantly trained in his transformation techniques,
testing himself repeatedly and accruing more and more experience.
Finally, after spending a year and three months on the [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art], Ning mastered all of the ‘seventy-two’
transformations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The final
transformations truly were difficult. They took so much time! Still,
I’ve finally mastered them. Change!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been seated in
the lotus position next to a creek, but suddenly his figure changed
completely. Now, seated next to the creek was a handsome,
fan-wielding, white-robed man; Empyrean God Silvermoon. He was
identical in both appearance and aura. That incomparably powerful
aura, so great as to cause others to tremble in fear…the aura of an
Empyrean God…and the unique properties of Silvermoon’s own
personal aura…Ning had replicated it all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me give it a
try.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, appearing as
Silvermoon, smiled as he walked through the Tristar Crescent Abode.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
uncle-master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he walked through
the Tristar Crescent Abode, Ning heard others address him for the
first time as ‘senior uncle-master’. It must be understood that
amongst the other personal disciples, Ning was the newest addition,
and so most people just addressed him as ‘uncle-master’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha. These
Void-level Fiendgods and Diremonsters…none of them suspect a
thing.” Ning was in an extremely good mood. He occasionally even
nodded to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Strange. Why isn’t
Patriarch Silvermoon at the Divinities Palace?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s quite rare to
see Patriarch Silvermoon out for a walk, isn’t it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is rather odd.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Ning walked away,
the disciples of Mount Innerheart quietly speculated amongst
themselves. Silvermoon was simply too famous for his ferocity; he was
truly a demon-like figure. The amount of sin which swirled around him
was utterly inconceivable! Silvermoon had accumulated so much sin
that he was no longer covered in the bloody light of sin; rather,
covering him were the legendary karmic sinflames!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, given how
unearthly powerful Silvermon was, he didn’t fear the karmic
sinflames at all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quickly arrived at
the Divinities Palace. In front of it, as always, were congregated
many of the disciples of Mount Innerheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
uncle-master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all called out
with respect, and even Bluecliff Xiaoyu, who had been chatting with
the other disciples, hurriedly rose to her feet and called out
respectfully, “Senior uncle-master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Little Qing and
Uncle White stared in amazement at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who are you?!”
Because of their spiritual connection to Ning, both Little Qing and
Uncle White knew that it was him. However, they couldn’t help but
feel completely amazed and confused. The terrifying aura of the
white-robed man before them…his appearance…clearly, this should
be Empyrean God Silvermoon! But their spiritual sense was telling
them that this man before them was actuall Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This caused both of
them to feel very strange. Previously, Ning had only displayed the
ability to transform into a tree in front of them; he had never
transformed into a person before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning nodded,
then smiled as he walked into the Divinities Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Divinities
Palace there was another white-robed man, also holding a fan. Their
gazes met. Their appearances and their auras were identical.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone who dares
transform into my appearance? Second senior apprentice-brother has
better things to do, and Lord Jiang doesn’t have this sort of
personality…junior apprentice-brother, it seems you’ve
successfully trained in the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]?” Silvermoon
immediately guessed that it was Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formidable, senior
apprentice-brother.” The figure of one of the white-robed men
turned blurry, then transformed back into the figure of a fur-clad
youth, Ji Ning.

Chapter 30 - The Power to Roam the Three Realms
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Silvermoon shook his
head and laughed. “It’s not that I’m formidable; it’s that
there are only a few people at Mount Innerherat who have trained in
the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]. By process of elimination, I was able to
guess that it was you, junior apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. The
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art] was located in the Three Realms Palace; only
personal disciples and those who had received special permission from
the Old Patriarch could learn it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you transformed
into someone else, I might not have been able to tell that it was
you,” Silvermoon said with a laugh. “These ‘seventy-two
transformations’ cause a person’s aura to completely change; even
the appearance of sin or karmic merit surrounding you changes. This
truly is an incredible transformation divine ability.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Indeed.
For example, when Ning transformed into a rock, he could use the
technique to completely retract his three-foot aura of golden karmic
light. If he transformed into a viledoer, he could transform to
display the bloody light of sin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Back in the era of
Pangu’s World, there was an ancient Diremonster who relied on these
seventy-two transformations to transform into the appearance of a
Buddha. He used it to trick people for thousands of years before
being discovered,” 1 Silvermoon said with a laugh. “You have now
gained a basic level of expertise into the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art];
your foundation is set. These seventy-two transformations alone will
serve as a top-notch escape method or hiding method.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…at this
level, it merely remains a deceptive tool, a hiding method. When you
are truly in a dire situation, what matters the most is your combat
ability,” Silvermoon said. “Junior apprentice-brother, although
you’ve reached the early Void stage and are comparable to ordinary
Celestial Immortals…I’m afraid that slightly more powerful
Celestial Immortals would be able to deal with you or even kill you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand.”
Ning truly did. Unless he was so lucky as to only encounter extremely
weak Celestial Immortals, the amount of power he currently had was
only enough to allow him to swagger around in front of those who had
yet to overcome their Celestial Tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s why I’ve
come to find you, senior apprentice-brother. I’ve come to ask you
for help,” Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Help?” Silvermoon
waved his fan, then said in a leisurely manner, “Speak. What do you
need?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m currently
quite weak; forgot about the Thee Realms, even in this Crescent
world, any random Celestial Immortal might be able to kill me. Thus,
I wish to reach the Third Cycle of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] as
soon as I can,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Silvermoon stared at
him. “The amount of treasures consumed by the training of the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art] is utterly astonishing; even I had to spend
countless ages to be able to train to my current Sixth Cycle! Can it
be that you, you little brat, want me to give you my treasures for
free to help you train? No way!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Eight-Nine Arcane
Art] used up far too many treasures. To reach the Ninth Cycle? Even
Daofathers would feel pain at the cost!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even a mighty demon
like Empyrean God Silvermoon had only trained to the Sixth Cycle;
logically speaking, Empyrean Gods should be able to reach the Ninth
Cycle, but he simply didn’t have enough treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course I wouldn’t
ask you to give them to me for free,” Ning said hurriedly. “During
this trip of mine to the outside world, I acquired some
Immortal-ranked magic treasures. I wanted to trade them to you for
Immortal pills, senior apprentice-brother!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Trade for Immortal
pills?” Silvermoon nodded lightly. Immortal pills referred to
Immortal-ranked spirit-pills, Pure Yang spirit-pills, and Great
Firmament spirit-pills.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s
acceptable.” Only now did Silvermoon agree. “Bring out your
Immortal-ranked magic treasures. I definitely won’t make you suffer
a loss, and I won’t profit from this trade with you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled, then waved
his hand. Whoosh. Instantly, one Immortal-ranked magic treasure after
another appeared, hovering in the air. These were the spoils he had
gained from killing the monster kings and the evil Patriarch on the
last journey. In fact, he even took out the low-grade Immortal-ranked
flying sword the Grand Xia Emperor had given him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me take a look.”
Silvermoon quickly spread out his divine power to bind each of the
magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no way to use
divine power to actually control magic treasures, but upon overcoming
the Celestial Tribulation and becoming an Empyrean God, things would
change. Empyrean Gods were unfathomable in their power, and their
divine power could be applied to all sorts of magic treasures. The
Empyrean Gods and True Gods who were birthed from the primordial
chaos were born with the ability to easily use magic treasures. Only
the weaker Fiendgods, such as those that were born at the Xiantian
level, were only able to use Bloodforged weapons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Silvermoon
looked through the weapons, then said, “Three top-grade
Immortal-ranked magic treasures, nineteen high-grade, twenty one
middle-grade, and sixteen low-grade.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Silvermoon kept his
calculations simple and by grade. For example, he counted the six
scimitars which the Flamewing King had used as six separate items!
That was why the number was so high.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother…the difference is pretty huge.” Silvermoon
looked at Ning, then said helplessly, “The amount of Immortal pills
you can trade for with such a small amount of Immortal-ranked magic
treasures…there’s no way you can train to the Third Cycle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately asked,
“How far off am I?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if I’m
generous to the point of suffering a loss…I could at most give you
sixty of my top-grade Immortal-ranked spirit-pills! But to train to
the Third Cycle, if you completely rely on such pills, you would need
at least a hundred of them,” Silvermoon said helplessly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt resigned as
well. He had kept behind a single low-grade Immortal-ranked flying
sword for Little Qing, and had kept the Immortal-ranked magic item he
had acquired in the underwater estate for Uncle White! He needed to
use both the Thousandbull Sword and the Heavenraker swords. He had
taken out every other magic treasure he had left. In fact, aside from
the Heavenraker swords, he no longer even had three spare
Immortal-ranked flying swords for his [Three Heads, Six Arms]
technique!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How about this?”
Silvermoon waved his hand, and a piece of parchment appeared. “Write
on top of this paper that today, you are borrowing a total of forty
top-grade Immortal-ranked spirit-pills from me. You have to repay me
a hundred such pills within ten thousand years. If you are unable to
do so within ten thousand years, then you’ll have to pay me back
with the most valuable treasure you carry!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Silvermoon waved his
fan as he beamed merrily towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt resigned. He
had heard from others long ago as to what sort of a person this
Silvermoon was; the reason why all of the disciples of Mount
Innerheart secretly referred to him as ‘that demon Silvermoon’
was because he, an exalted Empyrean God, would seek opportunities to
squeeze and extort even the ordinary disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Ning
lowered his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and write,”
Silvermoon chortled merrily. “Junior apprentice-brother, the sword
you used to display your swordplay last time was pretty good; it
nearly has the power of a Pure Yang treasure. That sword alone is
worth nearly a hundred top-grade Immortal-ranked spirit-pills. I’m
sure that within ten thousand years, you’ll have acquired even
better treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately began
to furiously scribbling on the parchment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Between fellow
disciples, a written acknowledgment of debt was enough; everyone
would give each other face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here you go!”
Silvermoon waved his hand and a white jade bottle flew towards Ning.
“These are top-grade Immortal-ranked spirit-pills that were forged
in Doushuai Palace. They contain extremely pure elemental essence and
are very well suited for training in the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art].”
2
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been instantly
impoverished…and now owed a hundred top-grade Immortal-ranked
spirit-pills to Silvermoon. Still…Ning accepted this. He wasn’t
strong enough to leave his master’s tutelage yet; any powerful
Celestial Immortal was capable of annihilating him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat on the
netherwater jade bed within the Still Room. Hefting the jade bottle,
he poured out a spirit-pill. The spirit-pill was a white-jade color,
and it emanated a faint aroma of mouth-watering fragrance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If an ordinary Zifu
Disciple or Wanxiang Adept were to eat this top-grade Immortal-ranked
spirit-pill, they probably wouldn’t even be able to refine it;
their Zifus would explode! After all, the purity of the elemental ki
within these pills was comparable to that used by Celestial Immortal.
These sorts of pills were usually given to reincarnated Immortals, so
as to allow them to reach an extremely high level of power in a short
period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alternately, Celestial
Immortals who had fought for a long period of time, or who had used
up a great deal of energy in binding a Protocosmic spirit-treasure,
would use them to instantly replenish their elemental ki.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh whoosh whoosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One pill after another
came pouring out, each comparable to a high-grade Immortal-ranked
magic treasure in value.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning swallowed them all
in one gulp. He then immediately began to activate the [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art] technique. The purpose of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] was
to train his body to the point of making it as indestructible as a
magic treasure! This required an enormous amount of energy…and
top-grade Immortal-ranked spirit-pills were purposefully designed for
replenishing energy. As for ordinary liquefied elemental essence?
Absorbing them took too much time; there was no way one could use
them to activate the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s entire body
immediately began to transform. His bones, his marrow, his sinews,
his flesh, his skin, his hair…every part of his body was now
changing. If previously Ning’s flesh and bones could be described
as tofu, then after using up the very first spirit-pill, they had
reached the consistency of stone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, in
reality, Ning’s divine body had already been extremely powerful.
From this, one could imagine how huge the improvement brought by the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art] was!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The First Cycle is
complete!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense how
powerful his divine body had become. A single top-grade
Immortal-ranked spirit-pill had allowed him to complete the First
Cycle and allowed his body to become incomparably mighty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Ning formed his
finger into a sword and slashed at his other arm. Sword-light flashed
past, but the only thing it left behind was a white smudge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My body is already
comparable to a Heaven-ranked magic artifact. I can just stand there
without doing anything and Loose Immortals will be unable to damage
me at all. And this is just the First Cycle!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art] is far more powerful than whatever divine ability Adept
Ninedeaths used back during the Conclave of Immortal Destiny. Her
body was like a magic treasure, but by comparison…her technique
could not compare to the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art].” Ning didn’t
spend too much time thinking about it; after all, only a Primal-level
Fiendgod could even begin to train in the basics of the [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Ninedeaths had
only been a Wanxiang Adept; there was no way she could’ve trained
in the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], even if someone had given it to her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second pill.”
Showing no hesitating at all, Ning began to digest additional pills.
The incomparably pure elemental ki of the top-grade Immortal-ranked
spirit-pills flowed through Ning’s entire body, being drawn into
every part of it. Ning’s body was like a sponge, ravenously drawing
in the power of these pills…and then his body began to repeatedly
transform, like a sword being reforged time and time again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The eleventh pill.”
As Ning was digesting and refining the eleventh pill, the Second
Cycle of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] was mastered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One spirit-pill after
another was rapidly consumed. Ning’s body was continuously rising
in power as well, increasing in both endurance and resilience. Clang,
clang clang! As Ning continued to train, rumbling and clanking sounds
could be heard coming from within his body as his muscles and flesh
clashed against each other. It sounded like two mighty mountains were
colliding, and as Ning’s heart beat, it sounded like a sea was
trembling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew that this was
a form of tempering! Magic treasures would be tempered through magic
fire and other sources of power, while the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]
tempered the body. Every single organ, including even the skins and
the hair, would be tempered nonstop by this technique. By now…a
single strand of Ning’s hair was so tough that even if a Loose
Immortal were to wildly hack at it with full power, he wouldn’t be
able to damage it in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another booming sound
could be heard from Ning’s body. His muscles rumbled, his bones
rumbled, his organs rumbled…the rumbling almost seemed to form into
a wondrous sort of music.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s skin was
beginning to shine with a dark light. He seemed to have transformed
into a terrifyingly powerful magic-treasure. Only when the dark light
faded away did he seem like an ordinary person once more. His skin
was very soft and white, seemingly quite tender; one could not tell
just by looking at him as to how powerful he had become.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…I’ve
finally completed the Third Cycle.” Ning was overjoyed. Waving his
hand, he immediately produced the Thousandbull Sword. “Time to test
my power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">WHOOSH! The
Thousandbull Sword transformed into a black dragon of sword-light,
carrying unearthly power with it as it chopped down against Ning’s
left arm…but it didn’t even leave a white smudge behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Starseizing Hand].”
Ning used his full power, launching an even more powerful blow!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A thunderous banging
sound could be heard within the Still Room…but Ning’s left arm
still didn’t have even the slightest hint of a mark at all on it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve mastered the
Third Cycle. My body is comparable to an Immortal-ranked magic
treasure now. When striking myself with full force, I can’t even
leave behind a tiny white mark. I imagine that even Celestial
Immortals would only be able to stare at me, stupefied, without
knowing what to do. This truly is the number one divine ability in
the Three Realms for those below the True God level. Primaltwin,
Heavenraker Sword Formation - Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was utterly
delighted. In front of him suddenly appeared the black-robed Ning,
who immediately controlled the power of the Heavenraker swords,
transforming them into nine streaks of sword-light and sending them
howling forth as they stabbed towards Ning’s bared upper chest!

Chapter 31 - Returning to the Riverfang Mountains
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s bare chest
was stabbed into repeatedly by the top-grade Immortal-ranked flying
swords, but they were still unable to leave behind any mark at all.
Although he was knocked backwards with each collision, he was still
able to walk back to his original spot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heavenraker -
Blackwater Line!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
exploded with maximum power, unleashing the most devastatingly
powerful stance of the [Heavenraker]. Whoosh whoosh whoosh! One
sword-tear after another slashed through the air in wavy lines so
thick that they each seemed to be like a river. The illusory rivers
flooded into one location like all the rivers flowing into the sea as
they merged into a single torrential black flow!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This torrential black
flow represented all nine Heavenraker swords as they stabbed
simultaneously towards Ning’s chest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time, Ning’s
true body wasn’t able to stay standing; he was knocked flying away
as he slammed into the wall behind him with a banging sound. However,
Ning used his palms to push off from the wall, stabilizing himself
and landing on the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning lowered his head.
He still couldn’t see any hint of damage at all on his chest or his
skin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a divine
ability. What a divine ability!” Ning felt utterly overjoyed. The
whole point of leaving the Grand Xia for thirty years was to learn
some formidable abilities before returning. And now…he had!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Eight-Nine Arcane
Art] truly was the number one divine ability of the Three Realms for
those below the True God level. The most powerful leaders of the
Three Realms had joined forces in an attempt to develop a divine
ability that would result in a body as mighty as that of Pangu’s.
Although they hadn’t been able to develop the Twelfth Cycle…the
first Nine Cycles were already incredible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was extremely weak
right now, after all; he was still far from becoming an Empyrean God.
As for becoming a True God? That was an even greater distance away.
Even if this divine ability truly did have a tenth, eleventh, or
twelfth cycle, there was no way he would be able to train in it for
the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve gained
expertise in this divine ability. I can now go to the Riverfang
Mountains again!” Ning immediately rose to his feet, the furs once
more reappearing around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning walked out of
the Immortal estate, he collected it with a wave of his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, where are
you going?” Bluecliff Xiaoyu was just about to enter the Immortal
estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going down
into the world. I should be back in a few days.” Ning instructed,
“If your Aunt Qing or Grandpa White ask, that’s what you should
tell them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Xiaoyu
nodded obediently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning left by himself.
As he walked past the Divinities Palace…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, junior apprentice-brother.” Silvermoon beamed
merrily as he walked over, fanning himself with his fan. “Judging
from your high spirits, you must’ve just finished the Third Cycle
of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Precisely so.”
Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were two tough
parts to training the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]; the first was the
initial mastery of the concept of the ‘seventy-two
transformations’, which was a bit difficult, and the second was
acquiring enough treasures to temper one’s body! Ning had gained a
basic level of expertise already; naturally, he had been able to
train to the Third Cycle at one go after acquiring enough top-grade
Immortal-ranked spirit-pills.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How many pills did
you use up?” Silvermoon asked with curiosity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninety-nine,” Ning
said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wow, it was just
barely enough.” Silvermoon nodded. “Work hard, junior
apprentice-brother, and earn back enough treasures to pay me back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Definitely.” Ning
nodded. “I have business to attend to; I’m leaving now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go, go.”
Silvermoon beamed as he watched Ning leave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Ning left,
Silvermoon shook his head, utterly tickled with himself. “I,
Silvermoon, am quite the clever fellow. I gave this junior
apprentice-brother of mine a hundred Immortal pills, and in ten
thousand short lazy years, he’ll have to pay them back to me! I
won’t end up losing a single pill, and I’ll have acquired dozens
of Immortal-ranked magic treasures as well, as well as have him owe
me a favor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, these
treasures really meant very little to an exalted Empyrean God like
him. However, Silvermoon loved to feel like he had made a clever
bargain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Crescent world. The
Star continent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within the
Riverfang Mountains. Within the lightning zone, there were two
figures that were seated on the ground. One of them was the Goldfur
Bearking, while the other was a youth dressed in loose Daoist robes
and whose eyes were like the stars.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder brother,”
the Goldfur Bearking said hurriedly, “The lightning here is too
hard to overcome. Even a Celestial Immortal like you has tried eight
times without success. Just now, the two of us joined forces but we
were still stopped at the 540 meter mark by the lightning bolts,
giving us no chance to advance at all. This is our utmost limit. As I
see it…we should invite another Celestial Immortal to come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You fool!” The
robed youth frowned as he glanced sideways at the Goldfur Bearking.
“How can we let word of such a treasure trove spread to others?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…all we can do
is sit here and stare. Elder brother, you know as well as I do that
the black-robed youth has already passed through the lightning zone
into the gorge. The more we delay, the greater the chances that he
might acquire the treasures,” the Goldfur Bearking said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had previously
chatted with the black-robed youth, then gritted his teeth and
departed. After Ning’s departure, the Goldfur Bearking had mustered
all of his power to finally break through the first forbidden zone,
but upon encountering the lightning zone…although he was skilled at
defense, he was unable to advance a single meter further after
reaching the 360 meter mark. The black-robed youth had mocked him as
well, and the Goldfur Bearking, worried that the youth might end up
taking the treasures, had hurried out of the Riverfang Mountains and
invited a good friend of his, Patriarch Limitless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two had immediately
sworn an oath to the Dao of the Heavens. Upon acquiring the
treasures, they would split them evenly! Patriarch Limitless was a
Celestial Immortal and thus a bit stronger, but the Goldfur Bearking
was the one who had acquired the information regarding the treasure
trove. Thus, they would split things evenly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are already
quite a few who know about this treasure trove. If word spreads
further…the treasure probably won’t end up in our hands at all.”
Patriarch Limitless shook his head. “You big dumb bear. Don’t
worry too much. When that black-robed youth said that there is a
third forbidden zone here, he should’ve been telling the truth. If
there wasn’t, he would’ve left with the treasures long ago. Since
he hasn’t…that means that the third zone is very hard to
overcome. If that’s the case, then even if we do invite another
Celestial Immortal, our chances of success will still remain low…but
word will have spread to even more people. It’s better for us to
take things slowly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” The Goldfur
Bearking nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let us both meditate
on how to use a more appropriate formation for overcoming the
lightning zone,” Patriarch Limitless said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The
Goldfur Bearking nodded again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just two hours after
they had begun meditating, a series of rumbling sounds could be heard
coming from the invisible pressure region behind them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An expert has
arrived!” Patriarch Limitless frowned as he heard the rumbles. “The
rate of advancement is very fast. Can it be that news has leaked to
someone else?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It shouldn’t have.
You and I have already warned the other two surviving monster kings
of us Twelve Monster Kings of the Eastern Flows about telling others
and even forced them to swear an oath to the Dao of the Heavens.”
The Goldfur Beraking frowned. “As for that Immortal Darknorth, he
gave up more than a year ago without coming back.. Can it be…can it
be the imperial Qi clan? But they are so puny…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right as they were
chatting…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! A figure charged
forward and landed on the ground. It was a fur-clad youth who was
wielding an Immortal sword with an incomparably enormous aura of
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Darknorth?”
The Goldfur Bearking was amazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young fellow,”
Patriarch Limitless said with a frown, “Who is your master?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had heard from the
Goldfur Bearking about Ning; naturally, he had immediately guessed
that for this ‘Darknorth’ to be so powerful at the early Void
level meant that he most likely had an incredible master behind him.
Perhaps this person also came from Mount Innerheart, like he himself
did! However…given how many disciples Mount Innerheart had, how
could he, an exalted Celestial Immortal, possibly give up this sort
of treasure trove to another fellow disciple?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Goldfur Bearking,
this is your helper?” Ning’s gaze flickered towards Patriarch
Limitless. This man was an azure-robed youth with an extraordinary
aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He is my elder
brother, someone far more powerful than me: Celestial Immortal
Limitless,” the Goldfur Bearking said smugly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Celestial
Immortal?” Ning was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Limitless
repeated, “Young fellow, I asked you a question. Who is your
master?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled but
didn’t respond. He just walked straight into the lightning zone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Limitless
couldn’t help but frown. Still, given how calm Ning was, he felt
all the more certain that Ning’s background must be incredible, and
so he just said coldly, “Young fellow, this is the lightning zone.
You need to make it past 540 meters of the zone before you succeeded.
Given your power…you are far from being able to do it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to make
his way into the lightning zone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, one bolt of
lightning after another began to hammer down. Ning remained quite
calm, not resisting at all as he allowed the lightning bolts to slam
onto his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even a Fiendgod Body
Refiner will only be able to use his body to forcibly withstand the
lightning in the lightning zone for the first thirty meters.”
Patriarch Limitless shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to walk
forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thirty meters. Sixty
meters. Ninety meters…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lightning grew
increasingly savage, but Ning continued to stroll forward, one step
at a time, allowing the lightning to hit him at will.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But, but but…”
Patriarch Limitless and the Goldfur Bearking were both stupefied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">210 meters. 240 meters.
270 meters…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to walk
forward in a relaxed manner. The bolts of lightning were now as thick
as water barrels, and they came crashing down with utter savagery…but
Ning seemed to be simply walking through a mild rainstorm. He felt
quite relaxed and content; the clashes against his skin felt like an
incomparably comfortable massage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">360 meters. 390 meters.
420 meters…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
simply walk forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed youth
had appeared once more at the entrance to the gorge. Even he stared
in amazement at this sight. “It’s only been a year since I saw
this fur-clad youth…how did he suddenly become so powerful?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">480 meters. 510 meters…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These fur robes of
mine were formed from top-grade Heaven-ranked Daoist robes. They are
extremely tough, resilient, and good at deflecting attacks; they are
comparable to low-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords in endurance.”
Flying swords were too thin and sharp, and thus broke apart more
easily! In terms of ability to withstand attacks, top-grade
Heaven-ranked Daoist robes were indeed comparable to low-grade
Immortal-ranked flying swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bathed by countless
bolts of lightning, Ning stepped past the 540 meter threshold…and
the lightning instantly vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Limitless and
the Goldfur Bearking, on the other side of the lightning zone, were
both completely dazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He used his body to
endure it all? But, but…at the 540 meter mark, the power of the
lightning was comparable to full-force combination attacks from the
two of us. That’s most likely equal to a high-class Celestial
Immortal.” The Goldfur Bearking was truly amazed. “He’s at the
early Void stage, but he didn’t even use a magic treasure…he just
used his body to endure it all?! This body is too…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His body must be
comparable to an Immortal-ranked magic treasure.” Patriarch
Limitless’ face suddenly changed. He was a disciple of Mount
Innerheart, after all; he suddenly thought of a famous divine
ability, reputed to be the number one divine ability in the Three
Realms for those below the True God level - the [Eight-Nine Arcane
Art].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To have a body of
such toughness at this level of power…the only possibility is the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art]! But only personal disciples of the Old
Patriarch can learn the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], or those the Old
Patriarch provides special dispensation to. Can it be that he is a
disciple of the Old Patriarch?” Patriarch Limitless instantly began
to panic as he thought of this possibility. He hurriedly sent a
mental message to Ning, “Dare I ask, Immortal Darknorth…do you
know Empyrean God Silvermoon?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Silvermoon
was the controller of the Divinities Palace; every single disciple of
Mount Innerheart knew him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You know senior
apprentice-brother Silvermoon?” Ning turned his head to glance at
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This junior,
Limitless, pays his respects to you, uncle-master!” Patriarch
Limitless hurriedly sent a respectful mental message to him. He
didn’t suspect Ning of faking it at all, because no one from the
outside world could even enter the Crescent world! In addition…there
was no faking the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled.
Still, it made sense; most of those in the Crescent world who
overcame the Celestial Tribulation and became Celestial Immortals had
been recruited into Mount Innerheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh. If we have the
chance, let’s chat more back at Mount Innerheart.” Ning turned
once more to the gorge, then walked towards it. The black-robed youth
at the entrance to the gorge frowned, then turned and walked into the
gorge himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, Ning entered the
fog-shrouded gorge…and he could sense that the terrifying ripples
coming from within the gorge were gaining in power.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<BR>

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_32___Fiendgod_Corpse"></A>
Chapter 32 - Fiendgod Corpse
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were some grass
and flowers within the gorge, but after Ji Ning stepped into it, he
felt his heart shudder for some reason.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An ancient, primordial
howl of rage smashed against Ning’s soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A series of ripples of
boundless, terrifying killing intent surged towards Ning. Ning
hurriedly visualized the image of Maiden Nuwa, and instantly the
divine image of Nuwa appeared within his soul, stabilizing it
considerably. After having spent so many years at Mount Innerheart,
Ning had learned that the [Nuwa Painting] was a visualization
technique passed down by Nuwa’s lineage that possessed boundless
life-force. Even if the soul was to be badly wounded, through
visualizing the [Nuwa Painting] one could quickly recover. This was
one of the most awe-inspiringly famous visualization techniques that
existed in Pangu’s World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the ninth floor of
the Divinities Palace, there was a copy of the [Nuwa Painting]
visualization technique, and it was described as one of the most
supreme of nurturing and defensive techniques for the soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place is…?”
Ning quickly came to his senses, and he stared at the scene before
him in the gorge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because of the mist
wreathing this place, Ning was only able to see to a distance of one
or two kilometers. From far away, he could see a human-shaped
creature that was lying on the ground unmoving. Ning could only make
out the rough contors of two legs and an abdomen…but the legs alone
were like massive blocks of stone that were over three hundred meters
long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given how strong the
aura of death is here, it should be dead. It seems as though it was
many hundreds of meters tall…given its size, it must have been a
Fiendgod,” Ning secretly predicted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This treasure trove
region was extremely mysterious; there was no way to investigate it
through divine sense, and so Ning had to make guesses for everything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boundless amounts of
killing intent surged forth in waves from that enormous Fiendgod
corpse, smashing against Ning’s soul. The closer Ning moved towards
the corpse, the more powerful the killing intent became, forcing Ning
to constantly visualize the image of Maiden Nuwa to resist it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For the remnant
killing intent left behind in a corpse to be capable of forcing me to
use the image of Maiden Nuwa to resist it…if he was still alive, he
probably would be able to kill me with ease.” Ning’s soul had
been split in two long ago; if one counted the soul within the
Primaltwin, he actually had three souls!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One soul was within his
Primaltwin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One soul was within his
true body’s Primal Turtle-Snake, which had advanced to the
Goldlotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another soul had been
completely fused with his true body’s very flesh and bones. Every
hint of blood and flesh contained a hint of his soul. It was at this
level that Fiendgod Body Refiners were capable of creating an entire
body from just a bit of flesh and blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anyone who trained as
both a Ki Refiner and as a Fiendgod Body Refiner would have to split
his soul at the Primal level. One part of the soul would fuse into
the body, while the other would enter the Primal Turtle-Snake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Ki Refiner
soul was finding it rather difficult to deal with the waves of
killing intent, but his Fiendgod Body didn’t fear it at all,
because his soul in his Fiendgod body was connected to every bit of
his flesh and blood, making it incredibly stable. Now that Ning had
also trained in the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], even if the killing
intent was hundreds of times more powerful, it wouldn’t be able to
do anything to this Fiendgod body of his.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning moved forward one
step at a time, purposefully taking a circular path around the
enormous Fiendgod corpse as he slowly advanced.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally…Ning was able
to see it clearly. The Fiendgod corpse had ashen gray skin that was
stone-like in texture. The corpse had an ordinary, plain face. Its
body was covered in wounds, and the black armor it wore had been torn
apart in many places. By its side were two fiery arrows, as well as a
mighty black greatbow with a shattered bowstring.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t expect
that you would be able to come to this place. For a weak little early
Void-stage fellow to possess such ability…admirable, admirable.”
The shrill voice rang out once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned to look
towards the source of the sound. From afar, at the corner to the
entrance of the gorge, he saw the black-robed youth in a seated
position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you know Empyrean
God Silvermoon?” Ning suddenly asked. This black-robed youth was
most likely a Celestial Immortal, given that he was able to make it
here. Most likely, quite a few of the Celestial Immortals of the
Crescent world were disciples of Mount Innerheart. If they were
fellow disciples, things would probably proceed more smoothly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empyrean God
Silvermoon? Heh heh, an Empyrean God? Not bad. But I’ve never heard
of him.” The black-robed youth sat there, staring at Ning. “Kid…it
seems your background is significant, given that you know an Empyrean
God. However…here in this treasure region, it doesn’t matter who
you know. If you want to acquire the treasures…it’ll all be up to
your own abilities.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quietly came to
the conclusion that this black-robed youth was most likely not a
member of Mount Innerheart. When Ning had traversed the lightning
zone, even the outside Patriarch Limitless had been able to guess
that Ning was a member of Mount Innerheart…and yet, this
black-robed youth didn’t seem to react to that at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are still
quite a few Celestial Immortals in the Crescent world who have not
become disciples of Mount Innerheart…and some don’t even know of
it,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kid, you’ve
already passed through two of the forbidden zones. This is the last
one, but let me warn you…the treasures on that Fiendgod’s corpse
aren’t so easily acquired.” The black-robed youth sat there
lazily, seemingly waiting to mock Ning when he ‘inevitably failed’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked back at the
black-robed youth. “I’ve come to take the treasure, but you
aren’t going to stop me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How would I do that?
Even the lightning zone wasn’t able to damage you at all, you
freak. Even if I attacked you, I’d be wasting my energy. If I had
trap-type treasures, I might try and trap or bind you…but
unfortunately, I don’t.” The black-robed youth spoke in a
resigned manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew what the
weakness of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] was. Training to the Third
Cycle of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] resulted in an extraordinarily
powerful body, but if he encountered restrictive items like magic
ropes or monster-sealing pagodas, he might be wrapped up or drawn
into the magic treasures. Still…Ning was no fool. He would use his
sword to block; to actually trap and bind him would be an extremely
difficult matter. And even if he was trapped…he wouldn’t die from
that, in and of itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then I’m going to
go take the treasure.” As Ning spoke, he moved closer towards the
Fiendgod body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning reached a
distance of roughly three hundred meters from the body, suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black greatbow next
to the Fiendgod suddenly lit up. The bowstring of the black greatbow
was shattered, but an utterly enormous flood of natural energy was
gathering around the black greatblow. It actually created a second
bowstring that was completely composed of natural energy, as well as
a fiery arrow that was similarly composed of natural energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! No one was
controlling the black greatbow, but it shot the arrow straight out
towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The arrow shot through
the air, moving lightning-fast and almost instantly appearing in
front of Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Block!” Ning waved
his arm, allowing the arrow to strike directly on his upper arm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM. The powerful
collisive force sent Ning flying back hundreds of meters, smashing
against the distant canyon walls. The canyon walls cracked apart with
a rumbling sound as many rocks came crashing down…but with a
backflip, Ning emerged from a large crater that had been created in
the wall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a treasure.”
Ning wasn’t worried; to the contrary, he was delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You freak, you could
even take that?” The distant black-robed youth was amazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was incomparably
excited. He stared at the black greatbow, surrounded by the natural
energy of Heaven and Earth. “For it to be able to gather such
natural energy without any elemental ki guiding it…clearly, the
spirit of the treasure of this black greatbow has activated it. For
it to have such power without even a person controlling it…this is
inconceivable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Long ago, Xue Hongyi
had been able to forcibly subdue the Azuresilk Godfire Lamp. At the
Wanxiang level, Ning had been able to use the [Starseizing Hand] to
forcibly hold the Thousandbull Sword. And now, Ning’s power was
unfathomably greater than it had been before…but he had just been
sent flying back by the natural energy gathered by an ownerless
treasure!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Thousandbull
Sword is top-grade amongst top-grade Immortal-ranked artifacts, close
to Pure Yang treasures in power. Then this greatbow…it has to at
least be a Pure Yang treasure, and if it is, it has to be either a
high-grade or even a top-grade Pure Yang treasure. Or it might even
be a Protocosmic spirit-treasure!” Ning instantly came to this
conclusion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The magic treasure,
without anyone controlling it, already had the offensive power of a
Celestial Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It makes sense. This
Fiendgod must have died countless years ago, but his remnant killing
intent is still so terrifyingly strong. Given how powerful he was,
how could his bow be poor?” Ning frowned. “However…the
bowstring to this black greatbow is broken, and tears have appeared
on his armor. I wonder what sort of a battle he must have encountered
for even magic treasures on this level to have been damaged. Even the
Fiendgod himself perished…and strangest of all, the Fiendgod’s
body remained, even after he himself died!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that a Fiendgod’s soul was completely intertwined with his blood
and flesh. If so much as a single drop of flesh or blood remained, he
could be reborn! Unless…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A supremely mighty
power had been able to annihilate every single scrap of the soul that
was within the Fiendgod’s flesh and blood! Without any soul left in
the body at all, the flesh would be useless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How massive a battle
was this?” Ning thought back to the great tribulation that had
resulted in the destruction of Pangu’s World. That had definitely
been an incomparably terrifying battle, one which even Patriarch
Subhuti had been afraid to participate in. Daoist Threelives had
killed multiple Fiendgod Daofathers in it before even he himself had
perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter
what…although the black greatbow and the armor are both damaged,
given how powerful they are without any owner, they must be
incredible treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
causing the Thousandbull Sword to appear. Ning then quickly advanced,
once more pressing closer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black greatblow
shot out more fiery arrows towards Ning, both the arrows and the
bowstring formed from natural energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, used his
swordplay to block. His sword-light flowed out like water, deflecting
the arrows of natural energy to the side. Ning was using one of the
sword-arts from the ninth floor of the Divinities Palace known as
[Water Filling the Heavens]; this was his most defensively suited
sword-art technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish swish swish…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a large
number of arrows shot out; in fact, up to ten arrows were shot out
simultaneously, causing tens of arrows to instantly fly out within a
short period of time. However, despite the arrows coming faster, the
power of each arrow had naturally dropped.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning used either the
Thousandbull Sword to block or his body to take the blows head on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kid, although your
divine body is like a magic treasure, this is just the attacks of a
divine bow without a master; it’s not that impressive for you to be
able to withstand it. Let me tell you this; once you reach thirty
meters of the corpse, you’ll have entered the third forbidden zone.
Passing it has nothing to do with the strength of your body, and the
fact that it is as unbreakable as a magic treasure won’t help you.”
The black-robed youth sat there, watching Ning advance and fight
forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning forced his way
forward, charging through the hail of arrows. When he reached a
distance of thirty meters from the Fiendgod corpse, the natural
energy surrounding the black greatbow dissipated, no longer attacking
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Ning took a
deep breath. At such a close distance to the Fiendgod body, the
invisible aura of majesty surrounding it caused even his heart to
shudder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The third forbidden
zone?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter what I
have to acquire this treasure.” Ning stared at the treasures on the
corpse of the Fiendgod…but what drew his attention most was still
that black greatbow.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s body
flickered, then he transformed into his three-headed, six-armed form.
He wielded the Thousandbull Sword in his hands, as well as five of
the top-grade, Immortal-ranked Skyraker swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the face of this
third forbidden zone, Ning didn’t dare to relax in the slightest.
Only after fully preparing himself did he step forward towards the
Fiendgod corpse, moving past the thirty-meter threshold and entering
the field of the third forbidden zone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son, eat some
more.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an
incomparably familiar hall. The lit candles here were as thick as a
child’s arm, and the child-Ning was seated in front of a table.
Atop the table there was a flagon of water as well as a plate of meat
and pastries.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…” The
child-Ning stared in front of him. In front of him was a woman, her
gaze filled with benevolent love as she looked at him. “Why are you
looking at me? Hurry up and eat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned his head to
look backwards. Indeed; behind him was seated a handsome young man,
Ji Yichuan. However, he only gave Ning a frowning glance, then barked
coldly, “What are you looking at? Focus on your food when you are
eating!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, father.”
Tears suddenly streamed out of the child-Ning’s face, but he
hurriedly lowered his head, picked up a biscuit, and began to wolf it
down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the mountain
gorge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed youth
remained seated in the lotus position at the corner of the gorge. He
stared towards Ning, who had made it within thirty meters of the
Fiendgod corpse, then shook his head. “The third forbidden zone
isn’t so easy to overcome. It tests the weakest, softest parts of
your soul. It doesn’t matter how powerful your body is, how mighty
your divine power is, or how formidable your sword-arts are; all of
those are useless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The days child-Ning
spent with his parents were very happy. One day passed after another,
and the child-Ning learned both agility techniques and sword
techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The child-Ning arrived
outside his parent’s room. There was a female servant yawning
sleepily outside. Upon seeing the child-Ning arrive, she couldn’t
help but feel surprised. However, she didn’t stop him as he moved
to knock on the door.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Creaaaak. The door
opened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was the fur-clad Ji
Yichuan who had opened the door. Upon seeing his son, he frowned and
said coldly, “It’s late. Why have you come here instead of
sleeping?” Ning’s mother, Yuchi Snow, left her bed and walked
over, smiling as she rubbed the child-Ning’s head. “Hurry up and
go back to sleep. It’s late.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father. Mother.”
The child-Ning suddenly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Yichuan and
Snow both looked at their son.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to hug you
two,” the child-Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan was puzzled,
but Snow just laughed. “Silly boy.” She immediately pulled Ning
into her arms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his mother’s arms,
Ning stretched one of his own arms to tightly embrace his mother,
then the other towards his father.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father…” The
child-Ning looked at his father.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are just…”
Yichuan gently shook his head, but he still moved closer, allowing
Ning to hold him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With one arm, he held
his father. With the other, he held his mother. Ning pressed against
his parents, smelling their scent. He closed his eyes, tears
streaming down his face. He said very softly, “I really want to
continue like this, but…my memories are already beginning to grow
blurry.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning? Son?” Snow
looked at Ning, and Yichuan look at him as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised his head,
his tears blurring his vision. He just stood there and stared at his
parents.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Awaken.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Awaken.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AWAKEN!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s unwilling,
angry roar suddenly filled the entire illusory world, shaking it and
instantly shattering it like glass. Everything quickly vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One illusory world
after another appeared, each one playing on all the deepest desires
in a person’s heart. Greed…love…hate…obsessions…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?”
The black-robed youth, still seated in the corner of the gorge,
stared at the scene before him in astonishment. Ning had already
spent more than an hour within the third forbidden zone after taking
his first step…but after that first hour, each subsequent step
needed less than the time needed to boil a kettle of tea. One step at
a time, he broke through the illusions until finally, all of them
vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed youth
laughed, then said with a soft sigh, “So he is the one.” And
then, he disappeared into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning arrived at the
side of the Fiendgod corpse, having completely awoken. He stared at
the enormous figure of the Fiendgod corpse, at the shattered armor it
wore and the black greatbow with the snapped bowstring, as well as
those two glowing arrows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master…thank you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s gaze was
distant and dreamy. He murmured softly, “Although the time I spent
in that illusory world was very short…it was the happiest I’ve
ever been since I left Swallow Mountain. That experience made me even
happier than acquiring these treasures left behind by this Fiendgod.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew quite well
that this third forbidden zone had been created by Patriarch Subhuti
himself. It must be understood that when Pangu’s World was
destroyed, it had been Patriarch Subhuti who had personally
teleported each remnant onto his Crescent world. Naturally, it had
also been Patriarch Subhuti who had set up the forbidden zones. As
for which of his disciples would be able to acquire the relics and
treasures from the Primordial World, that was up to luck and destiny.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young fellow.”
Suddenly, the figure of the black-robed youth appeared in the air
above the black greatbow. He said delightedly, “I bet you didn’t
guess this, did you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are…” Ning
was startled. “…the spirit of the treasure?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course! When I
told you I was a Celestial Immortal, I was just playing with you. I
didn’t expect you to actually pass the third forbidden zone. Based
on what Patriarch Subhuti said back in the day, anyone capable of
passing the third forbidden zone would have to have an incredibly
formidable Dao-heart.” The black-robed youth sighed. “Although
you haven’t overcome the Celestial Tribulation to become a
Celestial Immortal yet, you aren’t bad at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…don’t seem
that excited.” The black-robed youth sat in the lotus position
above the black greatbow. He said in amazement, “I bet you don’t
know who I am, right? Let me tell you. I am one of the top ten divine
bows of the Primordial World, a high-grade Protocosmic
spirit-treasure!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Protocosmic
spirit-treasure? Wonderful.” Ning revealed a smile and said a word
of praise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…I don’t feel
as though you are that excited.” The black-robed youth frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s only
because just a short while ago, I was given something even more
precious.” Ning smiled. “Please introduce yourself to me, as well
as this ancient Fiendgod.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed youth
nodded. “In the era of the ancient Primordial World, the major
powers once killed an incredibly terrifying creature named ‘Rahu’.
1 They used the various components of Rahu’s corpse, mixed with
many other incomparably precious materials, to finally forge a
top-grade Pure Yang spirit-treasure. That would be me…and the name
given to me was the ‘Rahu Bow’. Over the course of countless ages
after my creation, my spirit grew increasingly powerful until I
finally evolved to become a Protocosmic spirit-treasure. As soon as I
made my breakthrough, I became a high-grade Protocosmic
spirit-treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just ‘oh’?! I’m
one of the ten great divine bows of the Primordial Era! Only one bow,
the legendary Houyi’s Bow, was ranked as the undisputed number one;
the rest of us, such as the Qiankun Bow or the Blacknether Bow are
all ranked on par with each other.” The black-robed youth said
arrogantly, “In fact, during that great tribulation, all of
Master’s Pure Yang treasures were damaged, and even the spirits of
those treasures were destroyed. I was the only one left.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chortled. “But
your bowstring is broken.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can just help me
get another bowstring, right?” The black-robed youth shook his
head. “You need to understand that for divine bows like myself, the
bow shaft is what matters; that’s where the increased power comes
from. But of course, the bowstring is also very important. In the
future, I’ll help guide you to picking or forging a good
bowstring.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
asked, “How should I bind you, then?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just use your
elemental ki. I’ll give you all the help I can,” the black-robed
youth said. “I’ve been here for an eternity. I’ve been bored
senseless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
immediately began to bind it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
binding Mortal-ranked, Earth-ranked, Heaven-ranked, Immortal-ranked
and Pure Yang treasures all had certain requirements in terms of
elemental ki. For example, one had to at least be at the Void level
to bind Immortal-ranked magic items, or at the Celestial Immortal
level to bind Pure Yang treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Protocosmic
spirit-treasures had the blessings of Heaven and Earth. They were
extremely mysterious…and if the spirits of the treasures was
willing, they could allow even an ordinary mortal to use them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If they were
unwilling…even Celestial Immortals would be unable to bind them.
Perhaps Pure Yang True Immortals could forcibly bind them, but if the
spirit of the Protocosmic spirit-treasure were to resist, the binding
process would be extremely tiresome. It would have to be done at one
go; if one were to pause midway through, the efforts would be for
naught, and one would have to start from scratch again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, binding a
Protocosmic spirit-treasure was very troublesome. Fortunately, the
Rahu Bow had a good impression of Ning. By overcoming the third
forbidden zone, Ning received his acknowledgment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just a short while
later, the binding process was complete.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning heft the Rahu Bow
in his hands. He could sense the limitless power hidden deep within
it; this was a sort of sinister might that also carried a sort of
power that was akin to the ripples of water. This power was
unfathomably deep and infinitely powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In you go.” Ning
waved his hand, and the Fiendgod corpse next to him was collected as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, all of the
ancient restrictive formations that had existed within the Riverfang
Mountains were automatically deactivated. Previously, divine sense
could not be used to search the region, but now it could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning used his divine
sense to sweep the region, locating the Goldfur Bearking and
Patriarch Limitless outside the gorge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go back.”
Ning flew into the skies, then immediately executed a spatial
teleportation. Entering the spatial ripples, Ning disappeared into
thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Divine sense?”
Both the Goldfur Bearking and Patriarch Limitless were stunned. There
was no way to use divine sense within this region…but just now,
they sensed someone scan them with it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The restrictions are
gone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The lightning zone
is gone as well.” They quickly discovered that even the terrifying
ripples that had emanated from deep within had also disappeared. By
the time they charged into the gorge…they saw nothing within it at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Riverfang Mountains
had become an extremely ordinary mountain range. Although there were
some peculiarities to it, it was no longer anything special.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The treasure was
taken away by uncle-master Darknorth.” Patriarch Limitless knew
what had happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning returned to Mount
Innerheart. He first rested for a day, then went into the mountain
forests of Mount Innerheart. A violet greatbow appeared in his hand;
this was a Heaven-ranked treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The test for
[Houyi’s Archery] really isn’t easy.” When Ning thought back to
the trial mentioned on the abridged version of [Houyi’s Archery],
he couldn’t help but feel a headache.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It really was too hard.
This was the hardest trial of the Three Realms Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.” Suddenly, a voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned his head to
look, only to see a hatchet-carrying swarthy-skinned man wearing
hempsack clothes, a grass hat, and grass shoes come walking towards
him with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eldest
apprentice-brother,” Ning hurriedly greeted him. Mount Innerheart
was vast; he needed some additional space for training in archery,
and so he had left the Tristar Crescent Abode and come to the
mountain forests outside of it. He hadn’t expected to run into his
eldest apprentice-brother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why have you come
here?” The woodcutter asked him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to train in
archery,” Ning replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The
woodcutter glanced at Ning’s greatbow, then asked, “[Houyi’s
Archery]?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded. “But only the trial for [Houyi’s Archery] for now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s not easy.
Train hard.” The woodcutter smiled, nodded, then leisurely
sauntered away, hatchet over his shoulders.

Chapter 34 - When the Arrow Flies…
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning stood there in
an empty field within the mountain forest, holding the bow in front
of him as he stared towards the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ten thousand kilometers
away, at another part of Mount Innerheart’s forest, there was a
black-robed Ning. He waved his hand, and next to him appeared an
archery target.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to hit the
archery target dead center from ten thousand kilometers away.” The
black-robed Ning shook his head slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the trial for
[Houyi’s Archery]; without the usage of divine sense and without
using elemental ki or divine power to actively control the trajectory
of the arrow, using just raw, primal physical force…one had to hit
an archery target dead center from ten thousand kilometers away. The
center of the target was just one inch in size. One had to hit it ten
times in a row!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an extremely
difficult trial.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Without the usage of
divine sense…even most Earth Immortals and Loose Immortals could
just barely see ten thousand kilometers away. As for the heart of the
archery target? There was no way to see that clearly at all. In
addition, because there was a separation of ten thousand kilometers,
there would generally be some mist, trees, and other things impeding
one’s vision, causing one to be unable to see clearly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In other words, one of
the prerequisites for passing this trial was the possession of a
divine ability akin to the [Farseer Eye].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This divine ability,
when trained to the peak, could allow one to clearly see past a
distance of a million kilometers or even more!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Naturally, Ning had
never trained in the [Farseer Eye], but he had trained in the even
more formidable [Torch Dragon’s Eye]. Ning had learned the first
part of the [Torch Dragon’s Eye] in the imperial treasury of the
Grand Xia, which was suited for Fiendgods up to the Void-level. Over
the course of the many years he had spent here at Mount Innerheart,
when Ning was relaxing, he would harvest some of the Polaris light
from the Nine Heavens and refine it within his eyes, forming it into
the ‘innate torch-light’!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the training
process was quite difficult, Ning had still managed to reach the
second stage of the innate torch-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon using this divine
ability, Ning could use his naked eye to clearly see an ant that was
a hundred thousand kilometers away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll give it a
try.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there within
the mountain forest. He executed the [Torch Dragon’s Eye];
instantly, both of Ning’s eyes began to shine with the light of a
torch. If an ordinary Immortal cultivator were to exchange glances
with Ning right now, while Ning was intentionally releasing his
power…that cultivator would first feel as though his vision had
just turned completely white, followed by the entire world turning
dark and pitch-black.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Temporary blindness…and
some weaker individuals would become permanently blind!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh whoosh
whoosh….as Ning executed this divine ability, countless rays of
light came from far away, gathering within Ning’s eyes. Countless
rays of light reflecting off of countless objects were all being
gathered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The trees, the creek,
the pool, the mountain path…everything was within Ning’s vision
now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This included the
archery target that was ten thousand kilometers away, as well as the
black-robed Primaltwin Ning that stood next to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can’t use divine
power or elemental ki to control the arrow.” Ning waved his hand,
and a black arrow appeared in front of him. He nocked it onto his
bow, the pulled the bowstring.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s raw physical
power was utterly astonishing; he was fully capable of tossing around
an entire massive mountain as a toy by now. He instantly pulled this
violet Heaven-ranked greatbow to a perfect full draw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sensed the wind…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wind was blowing…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For archery, being able
to sense the wind was very important. The wind would have a
tremendous impact on the arrow. When Ning was a child, he had spent a
tremendous amount of effort training in archery. However, after
embarking on his Immortal path, he had stopped training in it; after
all, his current level of archery was already sufficient, and when
truly necessary he could use his elemental ki to control his arrows,
causing it to curve and arc in small degrees. That way, even if he
missed his shot due to the distance simply being too great, he could
adjust the arrow mid-flight!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now Ning was
forbidden from using elemental ki to control the arrow. He couldn’t
even use divine power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The speed of the
wind…its changes…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right about…now…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes blazed
with innate torch-light as he stared fixedly towards the distance.
The fingers of his right hand suddenly relaxed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The arrow instantly
transformed into a streak of light, piercing through the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The trees in its path
were pierced through, and the stones in its path were shattered.
However, due to these impediments as well as the changes of the
wind…these seemingly minor factors caused an astonishing amount of
impact over the course of ten thousand kilometers. Swish! The arrow
missed the target by nearly three kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh…” Ning’s
eyes were blazing with innate torch-light; he could clearly see what
had just happened. He couldn’t help but feel flabbergasted. “I
was off by that much?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three full kilometers?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was ridiculous!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll give it
another try.” Ning once more nocked his violet greatbow, then sent
out yet another arrow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sound of the
bowshot rang out once more, and the arrow itself transformed into a
streak of light that flew into the distance. This time, the arrow
missed the target by more than five kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s do that
again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One arrow after another
flew out. Some were off by three, four, five kilometers. Sometimes,
when Ning was lucky, the arrow would make it to one kilometer. One
time, when Ning was extremely lucky, the arrow passed the target by a
few dozen meters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shot off more than
ten thousand arrows at one go before coming to a halt. For an early
Void-level Fiendgod like Ning, whose body was comparable to an
Immortal-ranked magic treasure, shooting arrows was a very simple
matter on a physical level. His mental energy, however, had been used
up!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I knew it would be
hard, but I didn’t expect there would be so many problems.” Ning
had tried more than ten thousand times, and in doing so discovered
many of the problems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To simply rely on raw
physical force in shooting an arrow ten thousand kilometers and
hitting the center of a target…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first problem was
that the trees and stones between him and the target served as forms
of obstruction. When the arrow passed through them, it would be
impacted, albeit by a tiny, minute amount. Although Ning’s raw
power was so great that his arrows would only be impacted
slightly…all of the accumulated obstructions over ten thousand
kilometers would still cause tiny deviation in the flight path. A
tiny deviation magnified over ten thousand kilometers would result in
a huge deviation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second problem was
the wind!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had mastered the
Dao of the Gale during the Conclave of Immortal Destiny, and his
heart had long ago become one with the wind. His wind-sense was
extremely accurate by now. However…the wind that Ning could sense
was only the wind during the instant the arrow was released! In
addition, it was only the wind around Ning himself!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the arrow flew
forward, the wind would change!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, the wind
around Ning might be very weak, but five thousand kilometers away
there might be a storm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even though he could
still get a vague sense for how the wind was off in the distance, and
even though Ning’s arrow was very fast…it would still be affected
by it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were the two
major problems that made it so that hitting the target dead center
from ten thousand kilometers away was very difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?
Right…I have the spirit of a Protocosmic spirit-bow. He must have
seen divine archers of the Primordial Era train before.” Ning
instantly willed the spirit of the Rahu Bow to be summoned forth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The black-robed
youth appeared next to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you need
from me?” The black-robed youth looked at the bow in Ning’s
hands. “Oh, training archery?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rahu Bow, I wish to
train in [Houyi’s Archery],” Ning said directly. “However, I
have to pass a trial before I can do so. This trial forbids the usage
of divine sense, and it also forbids me from using divine power or
elemental ki to control my arrows. Just by using raw physical
strength, I need to hit the center of a target from ten thousand
kilometers away. The center is only one inch in size. I have to hit
it ten times in a row to succeed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Houyi’s
Archery]?” The black-robed youth called out in amazement, “Master,
you have a chance to learn [Houyi’s Archery]?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “But, I
have to pass this trial first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This trial is pretty
hard. Shoot a hundred arrows and let me take a look first,” the
black-robed youth said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately shot
out another hundred arrows. Although he knew where the problems
lay…there was nothing he could do about it. He failed every time by
an enormous margin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed youth
watched from afar. Through using his invisible senses, he could
naturally see the target that was more than ten thousand kilometers
away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How was it?” Ning
looked towards the black-robed youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems you have a
bit of a foundation. I thought you’d be off by at least a hundred
kilometers.” The black-robed youth nodded. “The art of
archery…the most important part of it lies in ‘accuracy’. The
more formidable an archery technique, the more powerful the arrows it
unleashes, but as for accuracy? For powerful archery arts, it is very
difficult to use divine power to improve the accuracy of a shot, and
so accuracy is extremely important.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Start from the
basics. First shoot from a hundred kilometers,” the black-robed
youth said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Under the guidance of
the Rahu Bow, Ning once more began to train in archery. Although the
Rahu Bow had never trained personally, he had seen many of his
successive masters train in archery. Those were the divine archers of
the Primordial Era!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First, a hundred
kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Then two hundred. Then
three…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning spent nearly three
years training in accordance with the guidance from the Rahu Bow, but
was still only able to hit the center of targets from 1200 kilometers
away when using just raw force. 1200 was a limit for him; no matter
how hard Ning tried, he was still unable to improve at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?
Generally speaking, this is how one trains in archery; one needs to
master one’s wind-sense and one’s sense of Qiankun. You’ve
accomplished both, and the speed of your arrow isn’t bad. But why
is it that I keep on feeling as though you are missing something?”
The black-robed youth was extremely puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had only watched
others shoot arrows, after all; he himself wasn’t a divine archer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Over the past three
years, Ning had even gone to the Divinities Palace to pick out some
archery techniques from the eighth floor. He had ruminated over them
alongside the Rahu Bow, which was why he had improved this much over
the past three years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
Ning sat down on the ground, feeling perplexed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, still training archery?” A laugh rang out as
the woodcutter came walking over, hatchet over one shoulder and
firewood over the other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eldest
apprentice-brother.” Ning hurriedly rose to his feet, then said
with embarrassment, “I’ve trained bitterly for three years, but
I’m still unable to pass the trial for [Houyi’s Archery].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Houyi’s Archery]
is indeed extremely difficult, and the trial is quite difficult as
well. Shoot a few arrows for me to see,” the woodcutter said with a
smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning was
instantly overjoyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eldest
apprentice-brother was the absolute number one expert amongst the Old
Patriarch’s disciples. Even the second apprentice-brother, Crazy
Ji, admitted his inferiority, as did all of the other disciples. In
fact, when Ning was chatting with Silvermoon, Silvermoon had secretly
told him that their eldest apprentice-brother was definitely at the
Daofather level of power. Given his incredible power and given how
long he had lived here in seclusion, he had almost assuredly analyzed
a technique like [Houyi’s Archery], one of the top ten divine
abilities of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although there were
quite a few disciples of the Old Patriarch who trained in [Houyi’s
Archery], none of them were that formidable in it. Given their eldest
apprentice-brother’s power, however…he surely was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twang! Twang! Twang!
Twang! Twang! Twang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One arrow after another
shot out. Ning used all of his power while attuning to both the wind
and to the Qiankun. In this instant, the world and the wind were all
one with his heart. It was as though he himself was the master of the
entire world, as though he was the master of countless winds. In
fact, even some of the distant transformations of the wind were held
within his heart, as though his subconscious was whispering to him of
what would happen. This state was the state known as the Dao Domain
of the Dao of Archery. Given what a high level of comprehension Ning
was at, and given that the Dao of Archery was heavily related to both
‘wind’ and ‘Qiankun’, Ning had advanced fairly quickly along
this Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One arrow after another
flew out, striking towards the distant target, more than ten thousand
kilometers away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each of the arrows
howled past the target by more than ten meters. In fact, purely
thanks to luck, one of the arrows actually struck the target.
However…it only hit the target, not the center of the target.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. You can
stop now,” the woodcutter said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please guide me,
senior apprentice-brother.” After halting, Ning respectfully asked
for advice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woodcutter laughed.
“Your fundamentals are quite solid. However…you are lacking in
the most important aspect.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The most important
aspect?” Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
woodcutter nodded. “Remember this: When the arrow flies, the heart
flies with it. Once you reach this level, you’ll be able to hit the
center of the target from ten thousand kilometers away.” After
speaking, the woodcutter turned and leisurely departed, still
carrying his hatchet and his firewood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there
unmoving. He murmured to himself, “When the arrow flies, the heart
flies with it?”
</P>

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_35______The_Heart_Flies"></A>
Chapter 35 - …The Heart Flies With It
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he watched the
woodcutter depart, Ji Ning grew increasingly puzzled. “When the
arrow flies…this part I understand. But ‘the heart flies with
it’…what does that mean?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twang! Twang! Twang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning pulled his bow,
testing out a few more arrows, growing increasingly puzzled as he
did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little master.”
The black-robed man appeared once more, face full of excitement.
“Your eldest apprentice-brother said, ‘When the arrow flies, the
heart flies with it.’ I think I somewhat understand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning revealed
an expectant look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed youth
immediately explained, “I’ve gone through many masters and
watched many of them train in archery, as well as watched them train
their successors and descendants in archery. I remember often hearing
them say something; ‘You need to put your heart into it. Put your
heart into the arrow.’ When I was guiding you, I didn’t think of
these words, because I thought they were just casual words of
encouragement, but now…it seems those words must have some special
meaning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was an extremely
intelligent person. This guidance from the black-robed youth didn’t
clearly point at what was necessary, but Ning now already had his own
ideas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To use the heart?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To put the heart into
the arrow?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the arrow flies?
The heart flies with it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My guess is that
‘the heart flies with it’ means exactly that; having your heart
and mind fly along with the arrow,” the black-robed youth said.
“This ‘heart’ is most likely a reference to a sort of invisible
force.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning listened to the
black-robed youth, thinking to himself at the same time. He had shot
out tens of thousands of arrows every day for nearly a year; thus, he
was familiar with all the technical tricks to it. Actually, Ning had
already vaguely touched upon the level of having the heart fly with
the arrow, but no one had been able to guide him to actually breaking
through to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning once more nocked
an arrow to his bow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The air…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The wind…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this instant, his
heart became one with the Heavens and the Earth…and his will began
to fill the arrow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, Ning managed to
brush against the level of ‘forgetting the self’; although his
heart had become one with the Heavens and the Earth, everything
around him seemed vague and blurry, as his heart and will were
focused completely on his arrow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A thunderous twanging
sound. The arrow shot through the air, and Ning’s invisible will
was fused into it. In fact, he had an extremely strange feeling; he
felt as though he himself had transformed into an arrow! As the arrow
shot through the skies, as it pierced through the trees, Ning felt as
though it was he himself who was shooting through the trees. This
sort of feeling, where his mind and heart were one with the arrow,
was quite strange and marvelous…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, after the
arrow flew for a hundred kilometers, that sort of invisible
connection between his heart and the arrow dissipated; Ning was no
longer able to maintain the wondrous feeling of him having
transformed into an arrow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The arrow finally
plunged deep into the target that was ten thousand kilometers
away…but of course, it was still quite a bit off from the heart of
the target.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s the
feeling! Right. That’s the feeling.” Ning began to laugh loudly
out of excitement as he jubilantly lifted the bow up with energy.
“Right. When the arrow flies, the heart flies with it. I felt as
though I had transformed into an arrow myself…this was a wondrous
feeling, and in that state, I felt as though I was able to control
the direction of the arrow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll try again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning once again nocked
an arrow and drew his bow. Twang! The arrow shot through the skies,
and Ning once more felt as though he were an arrow, with his heart
focused upon the arrow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Change directions!
Change directions!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While flying through
the air, the arrow suddenly began to change directions. Although the
magnitude of the change was very small, as Ning repeatedly strove to
influence it, the arrow began to arc outwards and fly even farther,
before finally overshooting the target by thousands of kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When the arrow
flies, the heart flies with it…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the feeling.
However, I’m only able to maintain this state for a hundred
kilometers; any farther, and my will dissipates and becomes unable to
maintain contact with the arrow.” Ning nodded to himself. This sort
of invisible, formless feeling of his will being one with the arrow
was a strange, subtle thing. However…there was indeed such a thing
as a power forged from heart, from will.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That ancient Fiendgod
corpse of the previous owner of the Rahu Bow was proof of it. Despite
having died so long ago, the remnant, vestigial will of death and
killing still was enough to cause Ning’s heart to quiver.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Strictly speaking, the
ancient Fiendgod’s soul had been destroyed long ago…so where did
that invisible will and intent come from?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was what ‘heart’
was all about.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was an invisible
force! The power of the heart! It was different from divine power,
elemental ki, and soul power. It was an extremely illusory,
difficult-to-detect sort of power, but it did indeed exist. A truly
divine archer would have to be able to master this power, the power
of heart; only by mastering it could one become one of the formidable
divine archers of the three realms. And this was just one of the
prerequisites!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Use the heart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The heart!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The heart flies with
the arrow!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning began to train.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew very well that
given how firm his Dao-heart was, the power of his heart should
logically be quite formidable. However, he was still only able to
keep his heart merged with the arrow for a distance of a hundred
kilometers. The reason for this was…his heart was not sincere
enough! His heart was supremely sincere towards the Dao of the Sword,
but it was not yet sincere enough to the Dao of Archery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only with sincerity
would the power of the heart grow!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, thanks to
his three years of painstaking training, Ning had established a solid
foundation, and as Ning’s attitude towards the bow had changed and
as his feelings towards the Dao of Archery grew increasingly
resolute, the power of his heart had grown increasingly strong. In
the legends, there were some truly formidable figures who, no matter
what they trained in, were able to maintain a supremely loyal heart
to whatever they focused on. By doing so, they were able to improve
at a truly astonishing rate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of the heart
was sometimes even more important than raw talent or comprehension.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A thousand kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two thousand
kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three thousand
kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the days passed, the
connection between Ning’s heart and his arrow became increasingly
strong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wow! Little master,
when you draw the bow, you now have a certain aura…an aura that
only the divine archers of the Primordial Era used to have!” The
black-robed man watched excitedly from one side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When one had a heart
that was supremely loyal to the bow, there would be a difference that
would be very hard for most to detect, even if the difference was
magnified ten thousand-fold. However, that innate charisma really did
make an impact. The Rahu Bow, which had passed through the hands of
quite a few divine archers, was definitely able to tell the
difference.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The arrow plunged
straight into the heart of the target.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however,
maintained his calm as he continued to shoot arrows. Ning was now
able to hit the target dead-center every so often, and even when he
didn’t, he was still definitely able to hit the target. To be able
to occasionally hit the target dead-center from a distance of ten
thousand kilometers, with trees and boulders blocking the way, while
using nothing but raw physical strength was already a truly
astounding feat…but unfortunately, passing the trial required one
to accomplish this feat ten times in a row.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five thousand
kilometers. Six thousand kilometers…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart was able
to ride with the arrow for increasingly long periods of time. Under
this sort of training, Ning’s Dao-heart was actually beginning to
grow even more powerful, and his eyes were beginning to grow
increasingly bright! When he drew his bow…anything he stared at
would feel as though a God of Death was staring at them from afar,
causing a sort of inexplicable, nameless terror!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the sort of
mental, psychological sensation of threat which only a true divine
archer was able to impose upon the minds of his foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s own heart was
like an arrow, seeking to stab itself into the enemy’s own heart.
The enemy would subconsciously sense this and feel terrified!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eight thousand
kilometers. Nine thousand kilometers…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Swish! Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An arrow struck
straight into the heart of the target. So did a second arrow. A
third. A fourth…Ning shot out a hundred arrows, and each and every
one of them struck the target dead-center. The inch-thick heart of
the target was completely filled with a tight cluster of arrows now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” From ten
thousand kilometers away, Ning let out a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sort of state,
where his heart rode with the arrow, consumed a tremendous amount of
mental stamina with each arrow. Shooting out a hundred arrows in a
row in this state caused an extremely nauseous feeling of exhaustion!
If Ning was simply shooting out arrows without using the power of his
heart, he wouldn’t feel the slightest bit tired after shooting out
even ten thousand. But it was very, very exhausting to be in the
state where ‘when the arrow flies, the heart flies with it!’
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…the power of
the arrows in this state was truly tremendous, and the arrows were
also much more accurate!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little master, you
succeeded. You succeeded!” The black-robed youth was very excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Rahu
Bow.” Ning smiled in gratitude. Over the past three years, although
he did study some of the secret archery manuals of the Divinities
Palace, what truly made the distance was the guidance of the Rahu
Bow! The Rahu Bow had watched many divine archers grow up; although
he himself was not a divine archer, he had still been able to provide
Ning with a shockingly significant amount of help.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If it hadn’t been for
the Rahu Bow, even ten years probably wouldn’t have been enough for
Ning to complete this trial.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heh heh, little
master, only after you become a true divine archer can I, the Rahu
Bow, truly show off my own illustriousness.” The black-robed youth
was extremely excited. “If you, little master, truly wish to show
your gratitude towards me, then just procure a good bowstring for
me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded and smiled. “Of course.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had a number of
poorer-quality bowstrings. After all, he could remove the bowstring
from the violet greatbow he was currently using and use it for the
Rahu Bow. However…this bow was far too weak. The Rahu Bow was a
top-grade Protocosmic spirit-treasure; Ning really did have to
procure a good bowstring for it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mount Innerheart. The
Tristar Crescent Abode. Outside the fairly small Three Divinities
Palace. Crazy Ji continued to snore there as he always did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second senior
apprentice-brother.” Ning walked over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crazy Ji didn’t even
open his eyes as he mumbled, “The complete copy of [Houyi’s
Archery] is on the table. Go take it yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, second
senior apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
stepped inside. Floating above the abridged versions was a very
eye-catching furled bamboo book. It was indeed the complete copy of
[Houyi’s Archery]. Ning walked over, immediately filling it with
his divine sense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A large amount of
information instantly began to flood into Ning’s soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long, long time
later. The sun had both risen and fallen. By the time the dawn was
just arriving, as half of the distant Golden Crow could be seen
peeking out from the distant horizon, Ning woke up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a powerful
archery technique,” Ning murmured to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was stunned. Truly,
completely stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to the
description of [Houyi’s Archery], if it was truly trained to the
limit, to the level of the mighty primordial divinity Houyi who had
created this divine ability…the power of the arrows would be truly
terrifying, to the point of being above even the Sixth Cycle of the
[Starseizing Hand]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If a True God were to
reach the peak of this divine ability, then with a single arrow, the
True God would be able to heavily injure or even kill other True
Gods!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But there was a reason
why the complete mastery of [Houyi’s Archery] was so ridiculously
powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Number one: The amount
of mental energy this supreme archery technique used up was simply
enormous. At the level of perfect mastery, even a True God would
probably only be able to fire three, four, or five arrows before
becoming utterly mentally drained and unable to fire off another
arrow. Ning’s [Starseizing Hand], however, could be used
continuously without worry of using up any mental power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Number two: This
archery technique had extremely high requirements with regards to
both the bow and the arrow. Especially the arrow! It must be
understood that at full power, [Houyi’s Archery] was mighty enough
to annihilate a True God with a single arrow; to be able to compress
this much power into a single arrow, the arrow had to be of
tremendous quality, as it would otherwise collapse and break apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, in order to
execute this technique, one not only needed a good bow, one also
needed some specially-prepared arrows that were incredibly powerful!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A superb bow. Superb
arrows. And just a few shots before utter exhaustion!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slightly poorer archery
arts could allow for a hundred shots, while even poorer archery arts
could easily allow for ten thousand shots. This was a testament to
how truly draining this supreme archery technique was when it came to
the power of the heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The power of this
archery art…although the number of times it can be used in
succession is low, it truly is without question one of the top ten
divine abilities created since Pangu established the universe!”
Ning felt endless admiration towards this divine ability, as well as
the number one God of the Bow of the Three Realms, Houyi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning then stepped
forward and picked up the abridged copy of the [Torch Dragon’s
Eye].

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s odd.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Patriarch is
personally sweeping the mountain paths? Isn’t that the trial for
the first level of the Divinities Palace?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Patriarch can
enter even the ninth level whenever he pleases, to say nothing of the
first. He defeats the ninth golem with utter ease.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But the Patriarch
truly is sweeping the paths personally. Are we seeing things?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Maybe…maybe the
Patriarch is meditating on something.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two Dao-novitiates
who were guarding the entrance stared in amazement as they watched
Ning personally sweep the mountain roads. They stealthily sent mental
messages to each other regarding this. News quickly began to spread,
and soon all of the disciples of Mount Innerheart came to know of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was very calm. He
kept his head lowered, focusing on his broom. Each sweep of the broom
felt like a cleansing sweep against his soul as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He swept each of the
mountain steps, one at a time. His sweeping speed wasn’t too fast;
he seemed to be enjoying this sweeping process.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He only finished his
labors late in the afternoon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, I’m done?”
Only now did Ning come back to his senses. He straightened his back,
then murmured softly to himself, “It seems as though when Master
set trials such as sweeping the path and weeding the mountain, he had
certain other things in mind as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Apprentice.” A
voice suddenly rang out by Ning’s ears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was momentarily
startled, but then hurriedly responded, “Master!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Despite having been on
the mountain for so many years, Ning had never before received a
direct mental message from his master like this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After you learn the
[Torch Dragon’s Eye], come to my place,” the voice rang out
again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, master,” Ning
replied respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quickly moved up
the mountain, heart filled with questions. Why was his master
summoning him? This was extremely rare. Could it be…that he was
going to leave his master’s tutelage soon?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning went to the Three
Realms Palace and acquired the full copy of the [Torch Dragon’s
Eye].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To date, the three
major techniques which Ning had learned from the Three Realms Palace
were the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], [Houyi’s Archery], and [Torch
Dragon’s Eye].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The process of being
transmitted the information regarding the [Torch Dragon’s Eye] took
a full day. The next day, Ning regained his faculty of mind. Only
then did he head towards the Daoist monastery of Patriarch Subhuti.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle-master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two Dao-novitiates
at the entrance to the monastery both called out respectfully. One of
the two, Clearwater, also added, “Uncle-master, the Patriarch has
sent word that you are to be allowed direct entry.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, smiled,
then passed in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Daoist
monastery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a prayer mat
within an open region with a skinny old man dressed in loose Daoist
robes seated atop it. The old man’s hair was completely white, but
he didn’t seem decrepit at all; rather, Ning felt as though this
person had reached the level of infinite eternity. In addition, he
also could sense a boundless life-force coming from this person. Ning
couldn’t help but feel his own spirit completely calming down,
thanks to his master’s simple presence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Ning
walked in, then called out respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sit,” the Old
Patriarch said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately sat
down on a prayer mat in the lotus position, awaiting instruction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Old Patriarch
looked at Ning, then said slowly, “How long have you spent on Mount
Innerheart?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It has already been
more than thirty years and five…this year shall be the
thirty-sixth,” Ning said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Which abilities have
you learned?” The Old Patriarch asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple has
learned the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] and reached the Third Cycle! I’ve
just reached a basic level of skill in [Houyi’s Archery]. I have
also trained in the [Torch Dragon’s Eye] and reached the second
stage of innate torch-light! In the past thirty-plus years, your
disciple has primarily focused on swordplay; I’ve already mastered
the ninth stance of the [Three-Foot Sword], and have learned other,
more powerful sword-arts as well,” Ning said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Old Patriarch
nodded. “You have many abilities now; it can be said that you are a
completely different person compared to when you first came up the
mountain. At your current level…remaining on Mount Innerheart will
no longer help you as much as before. What you need to do now is go
temper yourself within the real world, so as to prepare for your
upcoming Celestial Tribulation. Given your abilities, and given that
you have the legacy of brother Threelives…your Celestial
Tribulation will surely be extraordinary. It will be very, very
difficult.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple shall
remember to be cautious.” Ning was enlightened. So indeed, it was
as he had expected…it was time for him to leave his master’s
tutelage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is time for you
to leave now.” The Old Patriarch looked at Ning. “I once said
that when you left my tutelage, I would give you two great gifts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly felt
intrigued.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After you entered my
tutelage, I often watched you, appraising your comprehension ability,
your talent, your habits…all for the sake of developing a
completely unique evasion divine ability for you, known as the
[Obscuring Wind of the Nine Heavens],” the Old Patriarch said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was overjoyed.
This had been created just for him?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was badly in need
of an evasive ability right now. He had been preparing to ‘settle’
for an evasive technique from the Divinities Palace if he couldn’t
find a good one, but unexpectedly his master had been preparing this
for him the entire time, developing an evasive divine ability that
was completely suited for Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are a human,
after all; if you are to train in any other evasive abilities, it
will be hard for you to reach the peak in them. Even if I gave you
the [Wings of the Garuda], from which your Windwing Evasion ability
originates, you will never be able to reach the level which the great
Roc did,” the Old Patriarch explained. “The ‘best’ skill is
the one most-suited to you. This technique, the [Obscuring Wind of
the Nine Heavens], when trained to the utmost peak…although it
might not be as good as perfect mastery over [Wings of the Garuda],
it isn’t that far off. You will be able to move 90,000 kilometers
in a single movement.” 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“90,000 kilometers in
a single movement?” Ning was extremely delighted. 90,000
kilometers…this was an astonishing speed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the evasive
divine ability I prepared for you. In the future, when you have your
own insights, perhaps you’ll be able to further perfect it,
allowing you to move even faster. That, however, shall be up to you,”
the Old Patriarch said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An evasive ability
which Patriarch Subhuti had personally developed…most likely it
would be hard for Ning to improve on, even after he became an
Empyrean God. Improving it…that would be a very, very distant task.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can see that in
the future, you shall be a Sword Immortal. But any truly formidable
Sword Immortal needs a powerful sword-formation,” the Old Patriarch
said. “The so-called [Heavenraker] sword formation, in truth, was
used by Daofather Heavenrake as something he could teach his
disciples. Even I don’t know what his most formidable and profound
sword-arts…Daofather Heavenrake keeps them hidden as his secret
weapons for keeping himself alive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation] relies on using many treasures, relying on
superiority of numbers; when combined with an appropriate sword-art,
it is indeed capable of unleashing tremendous power. Both the Daoist
Path and the Buddhist Sangha have similar types of techniques that
rely on overwhelming numbers. Using your [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation] as the foundation, I have distilled the essence of the
best Daoist and Buddhist techniques of this nature and developed a
new sword-formation technique for you. I have given it the name,
[Greater Thousand Swords Formation],” the Old Patriarch said. “If
you have enough treasures, the power of this [Greater Thousand Swords
Formation] will be absolutely astonishing. It can be described as one
of the supreme sword-formations of the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Master!”
Ning was both excited and overjoyed. The [Obscuring Wind of the Nine
Heavens] evasive technique, the [Greater Thousand Swords Formation]
sword-formation technique…his master had personally designed both
for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What Ning did not
realize…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Was that Patriarch
Subhuti was truly very diligent in teaching his students. Despite the
passage of countless ages, the total number of students he had taken
on was quite low, but he whole-heartedly focused on every single one
he took on, especially during the early periods when they had first
entered his tutelage. Although it seemed as though Ning hadn’t had
the chance to meet with his master many times, in reality Patriarch
Subhuti had been constantly monitoring Ning. Then, based on Ning’s
own traits and characteristics, the Old Patriarch had tested out and
developed these techniques in a completely separate world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Obscuring Wind of
the Nine Heavens], for example; Patriarch Subhuti had spent hundreds
of thousands of years developing it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By comparison, the
[Greater Thousand Swords Formation] was easier; after all, this sort
of formation simply centered around massive numbers of treasures.
Patriarch Subhuti had only spent a thousand years to develop it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this other world,
the flow of time was different. This was why Patriarch was able to
bring out these two techniques now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Step forward,” the
Old Patriarch instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hurriedly stepped
forward, walking in front of the Old Patriarch. The Old Patriarch
tapped Ning on the center of his forehead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a large
amount of information flooded into Ning’s brain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By the time Ning
recovered, the [Obscuring Wind of the Nine Heavens] and the [Greater
Thousand Swords Formation] had been firmly imprinted into his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. It is time
to leave,” the Old Patriarch said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master,” Ning said
respectfully. “Your disiciple also wishes to meditate on the
secrets of the lotus. I wish to make a trip to the Divinities Palace
and acquire a few manuals on lotus techniques.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Old Patriarch waved
his hand and a bamboo book appeared within it. He handed it to Ning.
“This is a set of lotus techniques I acquired by accident. The
mysteries within it are unfathomably profound, and will be more than
enough for you to meditate on. You can carry it with you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Master.”
It was one surprise for Ning after another. Ning hurriedly added,
“Your disciple has an apprentice, Bluecliff Xiaoyu, who has just
arrived on the mountain and only been here a few years. She is still
quite weak; your disciple would like to let her remain here at Mount
Innerheart for now…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Old Patriarch
nodded. “Then let her remain here and train quietly on the
mountain. When the day comes that she can defeat the ninth golem, I
will let her leave and send her to your Grand Xia world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did Ning feel
completely relaxed. Everything had been arranged for.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. Time to
leave the mountain,” the Old Patriarch instructed. “Remember
this: Without my permission, you are not to say that you are my
disciple. Otherwise…do not blame your master for showing you no
mercy. Only when I summon you back can you return to Mount
Innerheart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” Ning said
respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three Realms are
now filled with secret, turbulent undercurrents. Even I, your master,
might perish. You must be careful. You are not to be too rash and
cause a disaster for yourself,” the Old Patriarch said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly felt his
heart shake. What? The Three Realms were filled with secret,
turbulent undercurrents? Even his master might perish? Then how was
someone like him, a junior fellow who wasn’t even a Celestial
Immortal, supposed to make it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Old Patriarch waved
his sleeve. “Be it fortune or calamity…you shall bring it to
yourself, and have no one else to blame or to thank. Now, go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning respectfully fell
to his knees, pressing his head down to the ground and kowtowing
heavily nine times. “Your disciple is leaving now. Master, take
care!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His master had indeed
spent considerable effort on his behalf. Both the [Obscuring Wind of
the Nine Heavens] and the [Greater Thousand Swords Formation] were
truly supreme techniques of the Three Realms. Even Daofathers weren’t
capable of casually creating techniques on this level. Although his
master hadn’t spelled it out, Ning could imagine how much enormous
effort his master must’ve gone into in order to develop these
techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning would naturally
engrave his memory of this kindness into his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, the
thirty-plus years he had spent on Mount Innerheart had been the most
peaceful years of his life, the years when he had truly, firmly
established his foundation. After leaving the mountain, it would be
as his master said; given how the Three Realms were filled with
dangerous undercurrents, it would probably be hard for him to find
such peace again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Ning left,
another person appeared within the Daoist monastery. It was the
second apprentice, Crazy Ji.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Crazy Ji
watched as Ning walked away, then sighed, “This junior
apprentice-brother of mine truly is a man of deep emotions.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unfortunately, he
was born at the wrong time.” The Old Patriarch shook his head.
“When most of you were growing up, I was able to protect you. But
he will be growing up in an era when a great tribulation is
descending upon the Three Realms. The Three Realms are already filled
with many dangerous undercurrents…and this tribulation may prove to
be even more terrifying than the one that shattered Pangu’s World.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Crazy Ji’s
face instantly changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nuwa has left long
ago, entering the endless primordial chaos. Despite the passages of
countless years, she has never returned,” the Old Patriarch said.
“When Nuwa was present, the Three Realms were finally settled down
and the Six Paths of Reincarnation were established. The Celestial
Court was created to manage the Three Realms, and the Daofathers and
True Gods all separated into their respective territories. But with
Nuwa gone…with the Six Paths of Reincarnation destroyed…with the
Celestial Court only a court in name…with the Three Realms filled
by dangerous undercurrents…I fear that this tribulation…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Old Patriarch shook
his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crazy Ji began to
worry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But in times of
tribulation, a person can bring either fortune or calamity upon
himself. If it is calamity, only he himself can save himself,” the
Old Patriarch said. “Everyone, including you and the others, all
need to be careful. I imagine that a large number of True Gods and
Daofathers shall die during this tribulation…and if even half of
the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals survive, they should count their
blessings. If you are faced with danger, I may not be able to protect
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple shall
remember and be cautious,” Crazy Ji said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning led Little Qing
and Uncle White out of Mount Innerheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the path to Mount
Innerheart. Bluecliff Xiaoyu fell to her knees, pressing her forehead
against the ground. “Your disciple shall definitely train hard.
After I reach the ninth floor of the Divinities Palace, I will
immediately head for the world of the Grand Xia to reunite with you,
Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded and smiled.
He then led Little Qing and Uncle White to fly out of Mount
Innerheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They arrived in the
sky-void, and as they did, a void tunnel appeared. This was a
void-tunnel which Patriarch Subhuti had personally opened for them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Little Qing, and
Uncle White flew directly into it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! They all
disappeared, and the void-tunnel closed behind them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master!” Xiaoyu
knelt there, tears streaming uncontrollably down her face. “I will
definitely go to the Grand Xia world and meet you there.”
