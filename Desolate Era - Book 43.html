had never been kind to Ji Ning. Wracked by illnesses and infirm his
entire life on Earth, Ning knew early on that he would die as a
teenager. What he didn’t know was that there really was such a
thing as life after death, and that the multiverse was a far larger
place than he thought. A lucky twist of fate (one of the few in
Ning’s life) meant that Ning was reborn into a world of Immortals
and monsters, of Ki Refiners and powerful Fiendgods, a world where
Dynasties lasted for millions of years. A world which is both
greater…and yet also smaller…than he ever could imagine. He would
have the opportunity to join them, and in this life, Ning swore to
himself, he would never let himself be weak again! The Era he was
born into was a Desolate one, but Ning would make it his era.

Chapter 1: Sealed Away?</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
dazzlingly beautiful and fragrant meadow. A barefoot, gray-robed man
was seated in the lotus position here. He reached out to gently pluck
a flower, then closed his eyes to sniff it. A gentle yet infectious
smile appeared on his face which affected even the nearby Exalt
Bowenya. This caused the latter to feel an even-greater sense of awe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
handled this matter very poorly,” Iyerre said while continuing to
enjoy the flower’s fragrance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
made a mistake. I was too desperate for glory,” Bowenya said rather
nervously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
stared raptly at the flower before him, as though he wanted to
memorize every millimeter of it. “Your hunger for glory and your
unwillingness to share it resulted in you not notifying me about this
until the very last moment, when the Daoguard Tower itself was about
to be destroyed. In other words, you only reported it when you were
out of options. You didn’t give me enough time at all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Bowenya
was silent. He didn’t dare to say a word, especially since Iyerre
was correct. He had indeed waited until the situation was quite grim,
with Ning ripping his way through spacetime and charging towards the
heart of the tower.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
didn’t have enough time to fully prepare a counter-plan, and so his
only choice had been to send in a servitor who he thought would have
the highest chance for success.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Losing
a servant is a minor matter,” Iyerre continued, “But I’m
concerned that the local Autarchs will discover that our heartlands
have not been truly sealed by them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Impossible.
They won’t be able to discover anything. We didn’t make any
mistakes at all,” Bowenya said hurriedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
sent over a servant and tore a dimensional tunnel for it and you to
traverse. This created a dimensional ripple,” Iyerre said. “It
was thanks to this ripple that Autarch Titanos and Autarch Mogg were
able to enter the dimension and slay my servitor.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
acted to mislead Daolord Darknorth,” Bowenya said. “I made sure
that he thought I fled out of fear while unleashing the creature
being suppressed by my Daoguard Tower. It all fits together
perfectly. There were no mistakes made at all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
nodded slightly. If certain secrets were revealed, their chances at
victory during the final battle would be lessened. The most important
secret, of course, was the existence of himself – Iyerre!
Thankfully, this wouldn’t be a problem so long as he didn’t
accidentally reveal himself. Everyone who had met him and knew of his
identity had been forced to swear lifeblood oaths. They couldn’t
even mention him in the most oblique of ways!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had reviewed the memories of many Hegemons and Emperors, but he knew
nothing at all of the supreme leaders of the Sithe invasion. He knew
that the Sithe had a Lord of Chaos, but the Sithe Chaoslord was a
transcendent figure that could be described as truly invincible, even
in all the Infinite Void.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
wouldn’t be so foolish as to actually enter Ning’s Chaosverse,
because once he did he would lose his connection to the Chaosverse he
controlled. Not only would he be dramatically weakened, he would also
be suppressed by this Chaosverse. If enough things went wrong, he
could theoretically be killed here! However, so long as he avoided
other Chaosverses he would be completely invincible. Thus, the
Autarchs of Ning’s Chaosverse felt certain that the Sithe Chaoslord
would never come here in person.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
that aside… the fact that the Sithelands had not truly been sealed
away was another extremely important secret! The seals which the
cultivator Autarchs had placed over the Sithelands were so powerful
that the Autarchs felt that if the Sithe wished to escape, they would
have to fight their way through. As a result, the cultivator
civilizations entered an era of peace, with just Autarch Mogg and the
avatars of Autarchs remaining behind to keep a watch over things
here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
reality, however, Iyerre was able to open dimensional tunnels to the
outside world with ease. The tunnel he had established to send out
his servant and bring Bowenya back was proof of this… which meant
that the entire Sithe army was capable of slipping out without anyone
being the wiser!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
were still a few gaps in our masquerade which might be discovered.”
Iyerre glanced sideways at Bowenya. “We didn’t have enough time,
and I really did want to kill Daolord Darknorth and swallow his
truesoul.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
was at fault,” Bowenya said immediately.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“However…
I don’t think the cultivators will be able to notice them,”
Iyerre said calmly. “Either way, the fact that this Chaosverse has
given birth to someone who has mastered an Eternal Omega Dao means
that we’ll need to launch the final war sooner than anticipated! If
we wait for too long, this Chaosverse might give birth to an Omega
Autarch, in which case we’ll truly be finished. You can make up for
your mistakes once the war begins.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood,”
Bowenya said. Iyerre then waved his hand, causing Bowenya to
disappear without a trace. The meadow remained as calm and tranquil
as ever. The only beings here aside from Iyerre were a few ordinary
animals.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Last
time, I saw that the tide was turning against us so I feigned
weakness and allowed you to ‘seal’ us here,” Iyerre murmured
softly. “I’ve waited and prepared for a very long time. This
time, I understand you far better than I did in the past. I’m
definitely going to win.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Immediately
after Ji Ning sent off the Paragon of Pills and the others, Autarch
Mogg’s face turned grave. “Let’s go back into the hidden
dimension,” he said, then teleported Ning and Autarch Titanos
inside once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three of them stood in midair within the Sacred Realm, staring at the
distant Daoguard Tower. The entire Sacred Realm looked as though it
had been through hell and back. The ground was filled with craters
and crevices, a testament to the earlier battle that had rocked this
place.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
been ruined.” Autarch Mogg stared at the distant Daoguard Tower.
“The dimensional control formations have been wrecked. This
Daoguard Tower can no longer be used to monitor the surrounding area,
nor can it be used to activate the dimensional teleport function
which was used to capture cultivators.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
dimensional formation has been destroyed?” Ning was startled. The
grand formation which had captured him was formed by a combination of
nine mighty dimensional formation-bases. When it had activated, Ning
had been teleported straight to this hidden dimension.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sithe definitely arranged for guards to watch over those nine
formation-bases,” Autarch Mogg said. “Once we took over this
hidden dimension, they moved to destroy the formation-bases to avoid
us making use of them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
they’ve been destroyed, they’ve been destroyed. This hidden
dimension is useless to us cultivators,” Autarch Titanos said with
a smile. His gaze suddenly turned towards the devastated landscape.
He frowned: “Mogg, did you have the feeling that the creature we
fought against was much more troublesome than usual?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Mogg blinked, then nodded. “It really was a handful.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Exalt-class
Daoguard Towers generally don’t suppress creatures of such
strength,” Autarch Titanos said. “As I recall, the previous ones
we dealt with I could kill within just four or five palm strikes.
This time, the two of us had to work together to fight for quite some
time before it died. During the Dawn War, it wasn’t until the very
end that the Sithe released creatures of such power.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
secret dimension was used to spy on the outside world. It was
probably quite special to the Sithe, which was why they stationed a
particularly powerful creature here,” Autarch Mogg said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Possible,
I suppose.” Autarch Titanos nodded. “We’ve always felt certain
that the Sithe were completely sealed away, especially since we’ve
taken full control over the outer perimeter of the Sithelands. I
never would’ve imagined that such an enormous dimension could’ve
been hidden from us for so long! If they weren’t so desperate to
get rid of Darknorth, we probably would’ve never discovered it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Mogg frowned. “I’ve been standing guard over this place for
countless aeons, but I never noticed it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
why I’m worried. How many other secrets are the Sithe hiding?”
Autarch Titanos frowned as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hahaha…
we’ve completely locked away the Sithe heartlands. If they made it
out, I’d definitely notice,” Autarch Mogg said with a chuckle.
“It doesn’t really matter if a few Sithe are hiding in the
outside world. How many of them could there be?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Titanos nodded as well. All of the Autarchs had worked together to
forge those seals over the Sithe heartlands. They felt quite
confident in its efficacy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
simply gazed at the world around him. This was very important, but
with his truesoul crumbling away the most important thing for him to
do was to use his remaining years to create the ‘Truesoul
Everlasting’ technique. There was no way he could take part in any
battle against the Sithe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Gentlemen,”
Ning said, “As you know, I acquired the [Five Truncheon Chapters].
This is something which would be tremendously beneficial to the
entire cultivator civilization. I acquired it from Hawkfang after I
entered the Sacred Realm! I promised him that I would guarantee a
peaceful life for the countless Sithe descendants who lived here.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
easy. I have to admit, Hawkfang did something incredible for us. I’ll
give them an otherverse of their own,” Autarch Mogg said with a
smile. “An otherverse will be more than enough for all of them to
reside within.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
feel sorry for them. The Sithe clearly don’t care about them at
all; they treat them as pawns to be sacrificed.” Ning shook his
head and sighed. Suddenly, he frowned and his face turned pale. “Wait
a second!”</P>

Chapter 2: Mistake</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
avatars of Autarch Titanos and Autarch Mogg turned to stare at Ji
Ning, puzzled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
great tree was clearly capable of exhausting me to death… so why
did Bowenya immediately flee upon releasing it?” Ning added, “And
when you fought against it, it showed that it was sentient and
capable of rational thought. It wasn’t like those other insane
prisoners. It followed Bowenya’s orders to continue assaulting me
even though the two of you were destroying it. I doubt it would’ve
accidentally injured Bowenya… so why did he flee?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Mogg hesitated momentarily. “Perhaps… since this was his final
trump card, he felt rather nervous because you defeated all his
previous ones? As a result, he fled immediately after using it, to
avoid you exceeding his expectations once more and making it
impossible for him to flee.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
what are you suggesting?” Autarch Titanos asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
some sense to Autarch Mogg’s explanation,” Ning said, “But
Autarchs… what you don’t realize is that after I entered the
Sacred Realm, I had to first deal with a combined attack from 2,800
Hegemons and Emperors, then had to deal with two Daoguard Towers
which broke free from their foundations to assault me. The Sithe were
clearly willing to pay an enormous price to try and kill me. If you
were Bowenya and had access to such a powerful tree-creature, how
would you employed it against me?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
shook his head, then continued in a low voice, “If I was Bowenya, I
would’ve sent the tree to attack before the 2,800 Hegemons did. The
giant tree could’ve completely surrounded the dimensional trap,
giving me nowhere to run. They could’ve surrounded and killed me
with ease.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
tree was clearly sentient and clear-minded. There was no reason to
wait that long before employing it. Why sacrifice a pair of Daoguard
Towers and thousands of Hegemons and Emperors before releasing it?”
Ning said. “Losing that many Hegemons and Emperors… even if he
would still be rewarded, the rewards would’ve been reduced.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Most
importantly of all… in the Sacred Realm, I meditated and trained on
multiple occasions for extended periods of time. In fact, I even
pretended that I would rather wait for death than actually enter the
Daoguard Tower. Bowenya’s response? He said that he would rather
watch me die outside than take the risk of fighting me.” Ning
frowned. “If he had that tree at his disposal, why would he have
chosen to just watch as I died of natural causes?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Mogg
and Titanos both blinked. They didn’t know all the details of what
Ning had experienced in this hidden dimension, but upon hearing this
they too began to feel that something was off.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">That
great tree had been an intelligent, sentient being which was under
orders to kill Ning no matter what. Given how powerful and obedient
it was, why not use it earlier? Why flee immediately after using it,
instead of continuing to watch over things from within the Daoguard
Tower?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
giant tree was extremely powerful and possessed tremendous amounts of
vital energy. It was perfect for dealing against a failed Daolord
like Ning! Unless Bowenya was a complete fool, he should’ve known
early on that the tree would be a perfect counter for ‘Daolord
Darknorth’… but he refused to use it. He waited until all of his
other resources were used up and until his Daoguard Tower was at the
brink of collapse before using it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Why?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
would’ve rather watched Ning train from his position within the
Daoguard Tower, waiting for Ning’s truesoul to naturally collapse
instead of releasing that creature. Why?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Unless…”
Ning’s eyes flashed with a cold, hard light: “Unless that tree
originally wasn’t here.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Wasn’t
here?” Autarch Mogg and Autarch Titanos both narrowed their eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
wasn’t here… which was why Bowenya was unable to do anything to
me. I trained for multiple chaos cycles, and all he could do was
watch! If the tree had been here this entire time, there would’ve
been no reason for him not to use it,” Ning said. “He waited
until I was at the verge of conquering his Daoguard Tower. He
probably grew desperate, at which point he begged the Sithe
commanders for help, and they sent over that tree-creature in
response.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
where did the great tree come from?” Autarch Titanos said heavily.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“One
of the formation-bases? Another hidden dimension, perhaps? Or…”
An ugly look appeared on Autarch Mogg’s face: “Did it perhaps
come from the Sithe heartlands?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Mogg
and Titanos shared a worried glance. The two of them had learned much
of the Sithe's capabilities during the Dawn War. Creatures like the
giant tree would’ve definitely been classified among the most
powerful of Sithe war assets. They were even more important than
Sithe Exalts!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
didn’t really want to believe it, but… it now seemed that the
likeliest explanation was that it really did come from the heartland
regions of the Sithelands!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
we’ve already locked the Sithe heartlands away,” Autarch Mogg
muttered irresolutely. “Even if they came out, I should’ve been
able to sense something.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Too
much time has gone past. The Sithe were probably able to devise a way
to avoid the seals without us noticing,” Autarch Titanos said
heavily. “They are superior to us in so many areas.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
thank you for informing us.” Autarch Titanos turned to look at
Ning. “We didn’t suspect a thing at all. Once the next war
begins, the Sithe would’ve been able to slip out with us none the
wiser. We would’ve continued to stand guard over this place while
they assaulted the rest of the Chaosverse. We would’ve been caught
completely flat-footed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarchs,
you only arrived at the very end to rescue me and so you didn’t
know the details of what happened here. It was only when I reflected
on all the things that occurred since my arrival into that hidden
dimension that I realized that the way Exalt Bowenya employed the
great tree made no sense at all,” Ning said. “It was my pity for
the Sithe descendants that led me to realize something was wrong.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mm.”
Titanos and Mogg both had extremely serious looks on their faces.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Although
other explanations are possible and we can’t be completely sure
that the tree-creature came from the Sithe heartlands,” Autarch
Mogg said, “I’d say there is a better than 50% chance of it being
the case.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
possible that our seal has been rendered useless, if it was even
effective to begin with,” Autarch Titanos agreed. “It seems we
need to start preparing.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
didn’t make any ‘mistakes’ in sending the great tree to kill
Ning per se, but it clashed with Bowenya’s previous words and
actions. If Bowenya had access to the great tree all along, why would
he have needed to turtle up for so long? Why would he rather wait and
watch as Ning’s truesoul naturally broke apart, rather than use it?
It didn’t add up… and that was the mistake.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning,
Autarch Titanos, and Autarch Mogg continued to stand in midair. By
now, the area in front of them was filled with an enormous amount of
Emperors. There had to be over three thousand of them, and all of
them were Sithe descendants! Around thirty or so were at the Hegemon
level of power... Clearly, the Sithe were far superior in rearing and
teaching their Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
looked at the group before him. “Although you are descendants of
the Sithe, you are still part of our Chaosverse. The true Sithe were
invaders who came here from another place. They don’t care about
you at all. We won’t demand that you take part in our war against
the Sithe, but you are not to assist them either. We’ll arrange for
you to stay in an otherverse of your own, and you can live quiet
lives there. Don’t take part in this clash of civilizations.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you, Daolord Darknorth.” Hawkfang led the group in expressing
reverent thanks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you, Daolord.” A few others quickly followed his lead.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you, Daolord.” Finally, all of them bowed towards Ning, with many
of them tearing up as they did so. They had long ago sensed that the
Sithe treated them differently, and they had been discriminated
against for many, many years.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
can go now. Evacuate all the mortals from the six mortal realms,”
Ning instructed. “This place isn’t safe.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ll
go right now.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go.” The awesome army of over three thousand Hegemons and Emperors
quickly flew away, beginning a large-scale evacuation of this realm.
Although the six mortal realms in this dimension held many living
beings, over three thousand Emperors were working together to
evacuate them. They gave the mortals some time to prepare for their
departure, but it still only took them just half a day before
completing the evacuation process.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
then led the Sithe descendants in departing from the Sithelands. He
brought them to an extremely distant, out-of-the-way location within
the Great Dark.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
a massive otherverse suddenly appeared within the darkness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go
ahead and bind it, Hawkfang,” Ning said, glancing at the three
thousand-plus Emperors before him. All of the Emperors were filled
with excitement. If given a chance to live in peace, who would choose
to serve as cannon fodder instead? This was doubly true when they
would only be repaid for their sacrifices with contempt and
belittlement.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Hawkfang’s eyes were shining brightly. He could sense that the life
he had been longing for was finally at hand.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Whoosh. Whoosh. After Hawkfang bound the otherverse to himself, the
thousands of Emperors all began to fly inside it. Ning, Mogg, and
Titanos all smiled at the sight.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is a secluded place where I once trained. If any Sithe come here, I
will be alerted instantly,” Autarch Mogg said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
these Sithe descendants live a peaceful life here,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Once
we defeat the Sithe, the entire Chaosverse will be at peace as well,”
Titanos said with a smile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
three of them were looking forward to that day.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Gentlemen,
now that everything has been taken care of, it’s time for me to
depart,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
send you back,” Autarch Mogg volunteered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
no need.” Ning shook his head and smiled. “I’m not exactly
busy. The only thing I’m concerned with is creating a ‘Truesoul
Everlasting’ technique. Although the journey back to my homeland is
a long one, I’ll take this opportunity to do some sightseeing. Who
knows, I might even find something which inspires me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well.” Mogg and Titanos didn’t try to press the issue.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
re-entered his realmship. Azurefiend’s avatar once more began to
pilot it, sending it disappearing into the Great Dark under the
watchful gazes of Mogg and Titanos.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_43_Chapter_003__Fina"></A>
Chapter 3: Meeting Autarch Stonerule</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the realmship. Ji Ning sat in the lotus position, staring at the
dazzling prismatic spacetime tunnel as marvelous realmverses
flickered past them, but his mind was occupied on the ‘Truesoul
Everlasting’ technique.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
Truesoul Everlasting… if I can create a technique like this, it
would allow even the damage caused by a failed Daomerge to be
reversed, with the truesoul being healed.” Ning was keenly attuned
to the sensations of his truesoul crumbling away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
Immortal energy, his godsense, his azureflower mist energy… all of
it was filled with his truesoul. But now, every speck of his soul was
beginning to crack apart, with tiny flakes of it slowly drifting off
and disappearing…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
crumbling is taking part in every part of my truesoul. Not a single
inch of it remains intact,” Ning mused. “How should I reverse
it?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
Ning had been a Daolord of the Third Step, he had ‘died’ once but
been revived thanks to the Lifeblood Dao-seal. The Lifeblood Dao-seal
was filled with a portion of Ning’s undamaged truesoul, making
revival a simple process. But now that Ning’s truesoul had already
begun to crumble… there was no known technique which could be used
to stop it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
to reverse it? How do you reverse that which has already crumbled
apart?” Ning mentally reviewed the mysteries of the [Deathless
Chapter] while comparing it to his own crumbling process, and as he
did so he would occasionally make a few changes and improvements to
the chapter.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
five million years of non-stop meditation, Ning finally woke up.
“Azurefiend, where are we?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’re
halfway there. Give us another six million years and we’ll reach
the Flamedragon Realmverse,” Azurefiend’s avatar said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
need for us to rush. Let’s explore the surrounding realms while we
are here,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
Master,” Azurefiend’s avatar said hurriedly. The time he had
spent following Ning had shown him far more stunning sights than
everything he had experienced in the past. They had captured over two
thousand Hegemons and Emperors, fought against a Sithe Daoguard
Tower, seen strange creatures which came from beyond the Chaosverse,
and more. He had never seen such incredible things in the past! Ning
also treated him very well, and he in turn would silently pray: “I
hope Master can remain alive forever. That would be wonderful.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">So
long as Ning remained alive, he would have a powerful backer
supporting him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
continued to wander through the cosmos, visiting the marvelous sights
the Chasoverse had to offer as well as the many unique lifeforms it
had birthed. Every so often, Ning would enter periods of silent
meditation to reflect on what he saw.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
vast planet which was teeming with life.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was seated at the peak of a mountain, silently meditating with
Azurefiend’s avatar standing guard next to him. Ning had been
training here for billions of years now, and ever since he started
there had been no creatures who could move near this peak. A maze
formation had been established halfway up the mountain, and those who
escaped the maze would find themselves back at the base of the
mountain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Young
fellow, the destiny that brought us together must come to an end
today. Your future accomplishments will be up to your own efforts. I
accepted a total of six disciples before you. If you ever meet them,
you’ll know it right away. Remember – you must not battle amongst
yourselves.” Azurefiend’s avatar remained by Ning’s side, while
he had created an incarnation to chat with a youth at the base of the
mountain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Your
disciple understands, Master.” The youth’s eyes were brimming
with tears. The past year he had spent with his master had been a
truly transformative one for him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go,”
Azurefiend’s avatar said, then vanished without a trace. The youth
repeatedly kowtowed before departing as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">At
the peak of the mountain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Azurefiend,
you actually took on seven disciples during the years I was
training?” Ning’s voice rang out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Azurefiend
was badly startled. He turned to glance at Ning, who had already
risen to his feet, then let out a deep chortle: “Don’t tease me,
Master. I was bored and had nothing to do. I spent my time just
watching the countless people who lived in this world, and every so
often I would find one I liked and take him or her on as a disciple.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hahaha!
Well, it is time for us to return to the Flamedragon Realmverse,”
Ning said. “We’ll be leaving soon, so go ahead and finish making
any arrangements necessary for your disciples.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
need. I’ve made those arrangements long ago and have given them
everything they should be given. The rest will be up to them. The
path of cultivation is a path of self-reliance, after all,”
Azurefiend said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well. Let’s head off.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The realmship flew away from the snowy peak, and the maze formation
which had surrounded it for so many years finally vanished as well,
becoming nothing more than a mystery and a legend to this planet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
ended up spending nearly half a chaos cycle on the return trip back
to the Three Realms. He had gained quite a few insights into the
‘Truesoul Everlasting’ technique, but he also gained a better
understanding of how difficult it would be.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
crumbling of the truesoul involved countless tiny little flakes
disappearing and returning to the Quintessence of the Chaosverse. To
reverse this process by seizing those truesoul fragments back from
the Quintessence was impossible! Not even Autarchs could succeed in
this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
only other possibility was to use the remaining fragments to somehow
remake a complete, undamaged truesoul anew! This was very similar to
the concept of ‘Blood-Drop Rebirth’, wherein Fiendgods who had
reached the Zifu Disciple stage of cultivation would be able
completely remake their entire bodies from a single drop of blood, if
they had enough divine power to do so. This was because that single
drop of blood contained the essence and foundation for the entire
body! Now, however, Ning was trying to accomplish this with something
that was even more fundamental… the truesoul.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
goal was to allow a powerful cultivator whose soul had shattered and
whose truesoul was breaking apart to be able to remake the truesoul
anew. So long as just one scrap of truesoul was remaining, the
cultivator would be able to use the ‘Truesoul Everlasting’ to
recreate the entire truesoul, then reconstitute the spirit and the
body.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
very familiar realmverse appeared before them. “We reached the
Flamedragon Realmverse.” Ning revealed a delighted look from within
the realmship. Finally, they had returned. Home was home, and the
feeling of being home was unlike any other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning turned to look in a different direction. He could sense through
karma that another powerful figure, Autarch Stonerule, was located
within the Flamedragon Realmverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Just
one second later… whoosh! Space rippled around Ning, followed by
the dazzlingly handsome Autarch Stonerule appearing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch
Stonerule.” Ning flew out of the realmship to greet him, with
Azurefiend’s avatar following obediently from behind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
Autarch Stonerule smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
have you come here, Autarch?” Ning asked curiously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Because
of you, obviously!” Autarch Stonerule said with a laugh. “I’ve
been waiting for quite some time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Sorry,
sorry. I wasn’t in a rush so I took the scenic route while taking
the occasional cultivation break,” Ning explained. “That’s why
it took me a while to come back. If I had known you were here, I
would’ve immediately returned.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
just teasing you. I’m not in a rush either,” Autarch Stonerule
said. “I came here because there are a few things I need to tell
you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hm?”
Ning looked at Autarch Stonerule.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
of us have been analyzing the [Five Truncheon Chapters] you gave us.
We’re in the process of completing the [Daolord Chapter], but as
for the most important [Deathless Chapter]… I’m sorry to say we
probably won’t be able to help you much,” Autarch Stonerule said
helplessly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
nothing you can do?” Ning felt rather anxious. Although he had made
some improvements in recent years, he knew just how difficult it
would be to create a ‘Truesoul Everlasting’ technique. He had
been counting on the Autarchs being able to help him out with it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
want to help you, but the ‘Truesoul Everlasting’ technique
revolves around reversing the process of a truesoul’s decay,”
Autarch Stonerlue said. “The problem was… all of us Autarchs have
perfectly intact truesouls. We’ve never experienced the crumbling
process ourselves! We’ve seen the truesouls of quite a few failed
Daolords break apart, yes, but just watching it as an outsider
doesn’t really mean much. We don’t know what it is like to have
the truesoul break apart, so we have no idea where we should even
begin to fix it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?”
Ning was stunned. The Autarchs had never experienced their truesouls
breaking apart, which meant that they were unable to make any headway
with regards to the ‘Truesoul Everlasting’ technique?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
the Sithe’s Lord of Chaos…?” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
at a much higher level of insight than us, which was why he was able
to come up with a ‘Truesoul Everlasting’ technique,” Autarch
Stonerule explained. “The six of us are merely on par with you, and
we’ve never truly experienced our truesouls breaking apart. Our
chances of being able to reverse the truesoul process via a ‘Truesoul
Everlasting’ technique are extremely slim. I came to tell you this
in person because I don’t want you to place too much hope on us
being able to help you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. “I understand.” This had always been a path which would
likely result in failure. Autarch Stonerule’s words were a bit
discouraging, but Ning was able to accept them calmly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
of course, we’re still going to keep working at it,” Autarch
Stonerule said. “There’s something else I wanted to discuss with
you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Something
else?” Ning was puzzled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sithe are desperate to kill you. We believe that the Sithe are paying
close attention to whether you are dead or not,” Autarch Stonerule
said. “That’s why I came in person to take a look at the
Flamedragon Realmverse. I followed up on quite a few clues, and in
the end I managed to find a few Sithe spies.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Stonerule waved his hand, causing a total of six individuals to
appear before him. All of them simply stood there, their gazes
vacant. One was a Hegemon, while five were Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Spies?”
Ning frowned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They’ve
infiltrated the Brightshore Kingdom and Vastheaven Palace, hoping to
be able to keep track of your status via your heartlamp and similar
items,” Autarch Stonerule said.</P>

Chapter 4: Solving the Heart of Eternity</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning stared at the six captured Sithe spies, then chuckled: “I’m
a failed Daolord. Why would the Sithe be willing to expend this much
effort on me?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
best if we keep your status a secret,” Autarch Stonerule said
seriously. “The Sithe have never given up on their efforts to keep
our entire Chaosverse under surveillance. In the past, we didn’t
really care as we were sure their army remained permanently sealed
within the Sithe heartlands, but it now appears highly probable that
they long ago found out a way to slip out undetected. They’ve been
biding their time, waiting to deliver a fatal blow to us. We’re
quietly making arrangements for our forces throughout the Chaosverse
to prepare for war, but this will take time. So long as you are still
alive, the Sithe will be hesitant to start the war.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right.”
Ning nodded. The Sithe would naturally be unwilling to start the war
while Ning was alive. Not because they feared him; rather, because
they worried that the high-pressure life-and-death environment
created by the war would result in Ning suddenly making a
breakthrough and mastering an Autarch-level Dao! If that happened,
Ning would be able to easily take control over the entire Chaosverse,
and the problem with his crumbling truesoul would disappear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
chances of this happening were remote, the Sithe were unwilling to
take this risk. Anyone who was able to master an Eternal Omega Dao on
his own, without any guidance at all, was without question an
incredibly talented figure who would have the blessing of the entire
Chaosverse itself. It was entirely possible that a ‘miracle’
would happen, resulting in him gaining Autarchy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thus,
it was best for the Sithe to play it safe. They would wait for Ning’s
truesoul to completely break apart before launching the war! By then,
the cultivators wouldn’t have even a single Eternal Omega Dao
wielder at all, much less an Omega Autarch. The greatest fear of the
Sithe would’ve been avoided.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“With
your Eternal Omega Sword Dao serving as the guide, we’ve already
begun to lead some of the most talented geniuses of the entire
Chaosverse onto the path of the Omega Dao. However, the birth of a
new Omega Emperor will take time! We might need millions of chaos
cycles or even longer. I’m afraid the Sithe won’t give us the
time we need,” Autarch Stonerule said. “But so long as you remain
alive? They’ll have something to fear, something which holds them
back.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
understand. I know what to do.” Ning smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
I’ll be leaving now. Let me know right away if there’s anything
you need.” Autarch Stonerule waved his hand, collecting the six
spies and then disappearing without a trace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
watched as he vanished, already beginning to consider what his next
steps should be.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">That
very day, Ning went to meet with Hegemon Brightshore and Emperor
Solesky.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Brightshore. Big brother Solesky.” Ning said, “My truesoul has
been crumbling away ever since I failed the Daomerge. I’m worried
that the remaining Sithe are trying to keep tabs on my status! Thus,
we must destroy the heartlamp in the Sword Palace of the Brightshore
Kingdom and the other life-monitoring artifacts pertaining to me in
the Dao Alliance and in Vastheaven Palace.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Destroy?”
Brightshore and Solesky were both puzzled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then,
we’ll replace them with fake ones,” Ning said. “The fake ones
we create will always show that I am ‘alive’, even if ten million
chaos cycles go by. I want the Sithe to always believe that I might
be alive.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Solesky
couldn’t help but argue, “Creating a fake one will be easy, but
your truesoul is breaking apart! Even if the fake soul lamps are lit
for a million chaos cycles, do you really think the Sithe would
believe that you are still alive?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Solesky,
that could be explained away by temporal deceleration, yes? A million
chaos cycles could go by in the outside world, but for Darknorth only
ten thousand chaos cycles would have gone past.” Hegemon
Brightshore looked at Ning. “Darknorth, what are you planning to do
next?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go
into secluded meditation,” Ning said. “After this, we probably
won’t be meeting again.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Do
you have a way to reverse the crumbling of your truesoul?” Hegemon
Brightshore said rather anxiously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
way?” Ning smiled. “Maybe. Alright, enough of that. I’m going
to leave with Youji and Pillsaint.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">That
very day, Ning departed from Vastheaven Palace with Su Youji,
Pillsaint, and his other retainers in tow. They went back to the
Three Realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Everything
which was able to detect Ning’s status, such as his heartlamps or
his life towers, were all destroyed and then replaced with fake
versions. In all the Chaosverse, the only ones who would know for
sure if Ning was alive or not were the Autarchs, Nuwa, and Subhuti!
Not even his daughter Brightmoon or his parents would have a way to
know for sure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
finishing all of his arrangements, Ning entered the Azureflower
Estate by himself. He needed the help of the Autarch’s stone dais
for this project.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth.” The estate-spirit was clearly much more respectful
towards him than it had been in the past.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
be spending almost all of my remaining time on researching the
‘Truesoul Everlasting’ technique.” Ning smiled. “Sorry to
disturb you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord,
if you really were able to create such a technique, you would’ve
brought boundless blessings upon the entire Chaosverse. Not only
would you yourself survive, you will have saved countless future
generations of cultivators to come. Our entire Chaosverse shall
thrive and grow strong.” The estate-spirit was filled with
anticipation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
smiled and nodded, then closed his eyes and emptied out his mind of
all extraneous thoughts. With the Autarch’s stone dais and the
Stonefire Pearl aiding him, Ning began to meditate on the task at
hand. Countless insights flashed through his mind as he continuously
analyzed, hypothesized, and restructured the technique he needed.
With the [Deathless Chapter] serving as his framework, Ning knew what
he needed to do. Every so often, he would finish completing a
[Truesoul Everlasting] technique, but each time he tested it out he
would discover that it didn’t work.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
continued to flow on. Every so often, Ning would take a break from
researching the ‘Truesoul Everlasting’ to work on solving Autarch
Awakener’s ‘Heart of Eternity’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">More
than 1600 years after he had entered secluded meditation</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Crack!
Crack! Crack! Ning finally solved the seals covering the ninety-ninth
level of the Heart of Eternity hovering before him. The final layer
of incredibly complicated runes vanished from the sphere, and it was
as though some mechanism had been activated within it. Moments later,
the insides of the sphere were revealed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
a streak of light shot out, resolving into a scholarly youth who was
dressed in white robes with blue fringes. Ning immediately recognized
this person as being Autarch Awakener! Autarch Awakener had been the
most scholarly Autarch, the one with the biggest dreams. He had spent
countless aeons working on the tenth chaos seal.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Young
friend,” the white-robed scholar said. Ning immediately understood
that this was a projection which Autarch Awakener had left behind
before his death.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Since
you were able to solve the ninety-ninth seal covering the Heart of
Eternity, you must be at or near my own level with regards to the
chaos seals I devised,” the white-robed scholar said with a smile.
“Thus, you are probably strong and wise enough to know of the great
danger our entire civilization is facing, and of the foes threatening
our entire Chaosverse… the Sithe. The Sithe are still there, and
they are still as dangerous as ever.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sithe are able to repair even shattered truesouls, allowing them to
attempt the Daomerge repeatedly. They also have a more perfect energy
system, allowing them to generate far more Autarchs than us.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
have always hoped to create a similar technique which would allow us
to birth more Hegemons, and perhaps as many as ten or twenty
Autarchs! If I succeeded, we would easily win the battle which is yet
to come.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
have left behind my Nine Chaos Seals to this Chaosverse. Although
their flaws mean that one can only successfully start to train in
them prior to reaching the World level, I actually fixed those flaws
long ago in my own version. I imagine that you, my young friend, can
easily do the same as well. The reason why I intentionally published
a flawed version of the Nine Chaos Seals is because those who cannot
master it prior to the World level cannot be considered true
geniuses. There is no chance that they can succeed in helping me to
perfect the tenth stage of the technique.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Within
the Heart of Eternity lies the true, perfected version of the Nine
Chaos Seals, as well as two lines of thought I have pondered while
researching the tenth seal. I wasn’t able to succeed through either
of these two paths, but I feel that both can theoretically lead to
success. They represent my greatest accomplishments, and I entrust
them to you along with my hopes and dreams.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is all the Heart of Eternity holds. In terms of value, this probably
is not that valuable to someone who is incapable of solving the Heart
of Eternity… but to one who was able to solve it, they may perhaps
be of some use.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
young friend… after spending countless aeons in painstaking
research, I discovered that I was unable to advance any further. This
is why I gave up. I hope you can complete the Ten Chaos Seals and
give our civilization a chance to defeat the looming threat. If you
can… then I, Awakener, will be grateful even in death.” Autarch
Awakener smiled, then his projection vanished.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-haired elder who was the estate-spirit had been watching this
entire time. Tears streamed down his face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
could sense the powerful will which had driven Autarch Awakener to do
so much. He felt a deep sense of admiration for Awakener, who truly
had been a leader for the cultivator civilizations.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
turned to inspect the contents of the Heart of Eternity, which indeed
held many techniques and records left behind by Autarch Awakener. One
of those techniques was the perfected Nine Chaos Seals.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
perfect Nine Chaos Seals could be trained in by World-level
cultivators, Daolords, and even Emperors. After doing so, it could be
used like ‘divine power’ inside the body and ‘Immortal energy’
outside the body. This was a truly flawless type of energy… but it
was limited to the first nine stages.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Perfecting
it was simple.” Ning was at such a high level of enlightenment that
he immediately grasped the principles behind it. Given enough time,
he too would be able to duplicate the work which Awakener had done.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
Autarch Awakener actually had two different lines of theory, both of
which he thought could be successful in creating the Tenth Chaos
Seal?” Ning nodded slowly. He had the assistance of the [Deathless
Chapter], and he was using it and his own insights to pursue multiple
avenues of research as well. Two of them were the ones which Autarch
Awakener believed to be workable. The first was the path of the
‘Infinity Everlasting’, while the second was the path of the
‘Void Everlasting’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
began to greedily read through Autarch Awakener’s notes. Over the
course of aeons of research, Autarch Awakener had clearly gained many
more insights than Ning with regards to these two paths. He also had
many different ideas of his own, which quickly gave Ning new insights
and ideas.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
became completely focused on reviewing Autarch Awakener’s work and
adding it to his own. A thousand chaos cycles… two thousand chaos
cycles… five thousand chaos cycles… ten thousand chaos cycles…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
continued to flow onwards, as cold and uncaring as ever.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_43_Chapter_005__Fina"></A>
Chapter 5: Out of Seclusion</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-robed Ji Ning was as still as a statue, his eyes closed. He had
been seated there for countless years now.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Finally,
Ning opened his eyes. His gaze was filled with the boundless power of
space and time, containing all the cosmos within them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Truesoul
Everlasting…” Ning murmured softly. He had the insights of
Autarch Awakener and the [Deathless Chapter], as well as 15,000 chaos
cycles worth of meditation. By now, he had reached a level of
understanding with regards to the ‘Truesoul Everlasting’ that
vastly surpassed Autarch Awakener’s.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
has been over 15,000 chaos cycles. I only have 1000 chaos cycles
left. Time for me to resolve my various affairs.” Ning rose to his
feet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
original body’s lifespan had been rapidly depleted due to the
battles which it had fought, but this body had never fought a single
time since failing the Daomerge. The Water Sword Dao, Space Sword
Dao, Illusion Sword Dao, and other Daos had all strengthened his
truesoul considerably, dramatically slowing down the crumbling rate
and extending his lifespan considerably.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
he had spent over 15,000 chaos cycles in training. He didn’t have
much time left, and he had some things he wanted to resolve before he
could finally, fully devote himself while holding nothing back at
all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth.” The elderly white-haired estate-spirit immediately came
over to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
going to make a short trip. The next time I come back, I’ll be
entering terminal seclusion.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Terminal
seclusion?” The white-haired elder was shocked. He could sense the
firm resolve within Ning’s words.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Terminal
seclusion… it represented abandoning everything else and entering
seclusion for the final time. Either one would succeed in one’s
goal, or one would die in seclusion, never to return!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
departed from the Azureflower Estate and made his way over to the
Three Realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
arrived at Brightheart Island in Serpentwing Lake. This was where
Ning’s family resided, and Ning’s three major retainers
Azurefiend, Su Youji, and Pillsaint lived here as well, as did Ning’s
eighth disciple ‘Stonepool’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Everyone
was seated, happily enjoying a meal together.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ji
Ning, each time you go into seclusion you disappear for a few
thousand chaos cycles. We hardly see you these days,” Ji Yichuan
said with a smile. He was in a wonderful mood today. Whenever Ning
reached a bottleneck, he would leave seclusion and spend some time
with his family. During the past 15,000 chaos cycles, he had exited
seclusion a total of six times.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Our
son is busy with something that’s very important to him. He needs
to stay in seclusion to do his best, rather than stay with us and let
you bother him all the time.” Yuchi Snow immediately leapt to
Ning’s defense, then turned and smiled at him: “Ning, son… let
me make the introductions. Dawnjade, come over here.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
adorable child who had been waiting nearby for quite some time
immediately ran over. Yuchi Snow happily took the child’s hand,
then said towards Ning, “Dawnjade is the most intelligent child our
Ji clan has produced in aeons. He’s an absolutely unparalleled
genius who has embarked upon the path of the Omega Dao. He is
currently a Daolord of the Second Step.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh?”
Ning glanced at the ‘child’ in astonishment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Greetings,
Patriarch Darknorth,” Ji Dawnjade said respectfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Father,
I have to admit that Dawnjade is very talented. He’s much more
talented than me,” the nearby Brightmoon said happily. “He’s
only been cultivating for a very brief amount of time, and we didn’t
dare to disturb you when you were in seclusion. That’s why we
didn’t inform you when he became a Daolord.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had long ago instructed that he was only to be disturbed if someone
was in mortal danger. Otherwise, his seclusion was not to be
interrupted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
looked the child over, his eyes lighting up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had long ago instructed his daughter, Brightmoon, to take his place
in teaching his eighth disciple, ‘Stonepool’. After spending many
years training together, the two of them had actually ended up
becoming Dao-companions! Both of them had actually been emotionally
hurt when they were young. Brightmoon had been single her entire
life, while Stonepool had poured all of his efforts on cultivation.
Still… after spending many years together, they began to grow
extremely fond of each other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
two had ended up having a child… and Stonepool had voluntarily
suggested that the child have the surname ‘Ji’ in order to show
respect to his master and father-in-law, Ji Ning! If they had a
second child, that child would take his family name. And so, Ning’s
lineage began to grow.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
had passed on, and Ji Ning’s line had flourished. All of them were
born with tremendous blessings of karmic luck, but none of them were
comparable to the most impressive geniuses of this realmverse…
until, that is, Dawnjade was born. He was incredibly intelligent and
sailed through his path of cultivation, rapidly advancing to the
World level with her clan’s aid. He had then gone out adventuring…
and the end result was that he had also embarked upon the path of the
Omega Sword Dao!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, the Autarchs had already begun to ensure that quite a number
of geniuses scattered throughout the vast Chaosverse had begun to
train in the path of the Omega Dao. There was now one or two in
virtually every single realmverse who trained in an Omega Dao… and
after over ten thousand chaos cycles, the Ji clan had finally given
birth to a second such genius. Yichuan and Snow naturally doted on
him heavily.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mm.”
Ning stared at Dawnjade, scanning his past as he did so. Ning could
even get a vague sense of what the future held in store for the
child, and what he saw was a truly extraordinary destiny. The boy
would probably surpass even Ning’s eight disciples… but in the
end, the Daomerge would remain a huge obstacle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Good.
Good!” Ning actually praised the boy twice. “Dawnjade, from this
day forth, you shall stay by my side. If you have any questions at
all, don’t hesitate to ask me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
Patriarch!” Dawnjade said excitedly. He all but worshipped the
ground ‘Patriarch Ji’ walked on; the Patriarch was a man who
treated with Autarchs as an equal! Dawnjade had also heard many
boasting stories from Hegemon Azurefiend, including the story of how
the Patriarch had captured nearly four thousand Emperors with ease.
He knew that the Patriarch was inconceivably powerful and was the
most supreme expert of the Dao of the Sword their Chaosverse had ever
seen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
more Ning saw of Dawnjade, the more he liked the boy. Ning felt
almost as though he was seeing a reflection of himself in many ways.
If Ning himself failed in his terminal seclusion but Dawnjade
succeeded in his Daomerge… that wouldn’t be too bad an outcome.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Sit
next to me,” Ning ordered. He didn’t disguise his fondness for
Dawnjade in the slightest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brightmoon.”
Ning turned and smiled. “Has anything important happened lately?”
Each time Ning left his secluded meditation, he would ask her this
question.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Both
Brightmoon and Stonepool were Daolords of the Fourth Step. The former
was Ning’s daughter, while the latter was Ning’s disciple. They
often wandered the outside world, and they were well-versed in what
was happening lately.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
actually. Something very important happened,” Brightmoon said. “I
actually considered asking you to leave seclusion, but in the end I
decided not to disturb you. For you to find out a bit later doesn’t
make much of a difference.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Something
very important? What?” Ning asked curiously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Second
brother ‘Green Bamboo’ succeeded in the Daomerge and became a
Hegemon!” Brightmoon said happily. “He was the first in our group
to attempt the Daomerge. To this very day, I’m still afraid to make
the attempt!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Quding
succeeded in the Daomerge?” Ning was delighted to hear this. He
immediately began inspect the karmic threads binding him to his
disciple.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
second disciple, ‘Green Bamboo’ Yang Quding. When Ning was at the
World level, Ning had met him by accident when he had entered
Annihilation’s otherverse. Back then Yang Quding had been an
ordinary mortal, but his Dao-heart had impressed Ning. Ning had taken
a liking to him and had accepted him as his second disciple.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
always had the feeling that his second disciple would probably become
an extremely accomplished figure… but Ning never would’ve
expected him to become a Hegemon so quickly!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“After
he succeeded in the Daomerge he came here in person, wanting to pay
his respects to you, Father. I didn’t want to disturb you, so after
discussing the matter with Patriarch Subhuti I decided to give him
three Sithe treasures as a celebratory gift,” Brightmoon said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
did well.” Ning nodded. He had acquired many Sithe treasures from
that hidden dimension, but he had given them over to Nuwa, Subhuti,
and Brightmoon to hand out as they saw fit. He wouldn’t hand over
treasures of such power to even his disciples without a good reason.
Giving his second disciple a few of them to celebrate his Hegemony,
however, was fine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
not finished. Not too long ago, second brother received an otherverse
and became an Otherverse Lord!” Brightmoon said happily. “He
didn’t acquire it in battle, he was given it by an Autarch.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“By
an Autarch?” Ning was startled. Ning knew the Autarchs very well;
they wouldn’t casually hand over otherverses to juniors, no matter
how much they liked them. They acted impartially in all things.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
here’s the story. Second brother is incredibly talented in the Dao
of the Sword and has a perfect Dao-heart. He had an accidental
meeting with the Autarch of Annihilation, who tested him. He passed
the test, and the Autarch viewed him so favorably that the Autarch
bestowed an otherverse upon him,” Brightmoon said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
perfect Dao-heart?” Ning was astonished. A perfect Dao-heart was a
prerequisite for becoming an Autarch, and also a prerequisite for
succeeding in the Daomerge for an Omega Dao. Everyone who had a
perfect Dao-heart was without a doubt an extraordinary character.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
wonder Ekong showed him such favor.” Ning had felt long ago that
Green Bamboo had an extraordinary heart and was highly suited for
cultivating in the Dao. Ning had ‘released him into the wild’ and
allowed him to make his own way in the world as a mortal cultivator
with just a few techniques. Ning hadn’t spent too much time
teaching or taking care of this second disciple; the man had to rely
on himself for everything.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">So
tired. Had a 9 AM to 11:30 PM yesterday which was capped off by
business beers, fell asleep as I was editing and preparing to

Chapter 6: Old Friends (Part 1)</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning was in an excellent mood today. “Tell me about how all my
other disciples are doing, one by one.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well.” Brightmoon was rather surprised at her father inquiring in
such detail, but she began to narrate without giving it much thought.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had left his secluded meditations to wrap up all his worldly affairs.
Of course he needed to get a good idea as to how his personal
disciples were doing! While listening to his daughter speak, he also
carefully inspected how they were doing through his karmic ties to
them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
first disciple, ‘Bluecliff Xiaoyu’, was even less talented than
Brightmoon. To this very day, she remained just a World-level
cultivator! Still, her life was a carefree one. Perhaps Xiaoyu
preferred this sort of peaceful, quiet life.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
second disciple, ‘Green Bamboo’ Yang Quding, had become a
Hegemon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
third disciple, Skywind, had become a resoundingly famous figure
within the Flamedragon Realmverse. He had caused quite a deal of
trouble, and was stubborn to an extreme. He made many enemies, and
for the sake of a female Immortal he had actually assaulted a major
sect and slain two of its Emperors! He was now publicly acclaimed as
the number one Daolord of the Flamedragon Realmverse. Ning, of
course, had long ago transcendent such silly rankings.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh,
Skywind… I was able to sense long ago that your future would be
fraught with troubles. You’ve always been the one I’ve been the
most worried about.” Ning shook his head, then decided, “I have
to visit him one final time, it seems.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
position of ‘fourth disciple’ remained vacant.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
fifth and sixth disciples, ‘Boundless’ and ‘Muse’, lived a
romantic, heavenly life together as a pair of Immortal lovers. They
remained happily in love, and together they wandered the various
territories of the Flamedragon Realmverse. This pleased Ning greatly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
seventh disciple, ‘Great Immortal Almonder’, had a childlike
disposition and loved to wander about. His current whereabouts were
unknown.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
eight disciple, ‘Stonepool’, was a solid and reliable figure who
had ended up together with Ning’s daughter Brightmoon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
spending two years in the Three Realms, Ning departed with
Azurefiend, Youji, Pillsaint, and his favored descendant Dawnjade.
They left the Three Realms and began to wander through the world
outside. They were going to visit his friends and disciples.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
very first person Ning went to visit was Ninedust, whom he had shared
so many life-and-death adventures with.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Vast,
billowing waves could be seen sweeping through this entire world. At
the very center of the waves was a towering, silver-robed god who was
540,000 meters tall. He stood atop the endless waves, practicing a
set of fist-arts. Every single punch and strike caused the waves
around him to rumble and roil about.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
ship appeared far off in the distance, but it quickly came to a halt
and did not interrupt.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Roughly
an hour later, the training appeared to come to an end. Only then did
the white-robed Ning call from next to the hovering realmship,
“Ninedust!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Ninedust Sectlord turned to stare at Ning, a delighted look instantly
appearing on his face: “Hah! Darknorth, my big shot Daolord friend!
You surely are a sight for sore eyes. You actually came to visit me?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
sorry, I’m sorry! I know I didn’t visit you a single time in many
years. I’ve been in secluded meditation the entire time.” Ning
strolled over, with Su Youji and the others staying behind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“As
it should be. You are working on something important.” Ninedust
looked at Ning. He could sense how Ning’s truesoul was crumbling at
a very fast pace, and he couldn’t help but feel sorrow for his old
friend. He knew that Ning wouldn’t last for much longer.
“Darknorth… have you come to bid me a final farewell?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Perhaps.”
Ning smiled. “I’m about to go into terminal seclusion and make
one final push. If I succeed, I’ll be able to reverse my truesoul’s
decay. If I fail… then yes, this will be the last time we two
brothers have a chance to meet.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Reverse
your truesoul’s decay?” Ninedust instantly became filled with
hope.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Death
has always been the only outcome for anyone who fails the Daomerge,”
Ning said. “No cultivators in our Chaosverse have ever been able to
change this! The Sithe are able to do so, but they are different from
us on a fundamental level. Not even Autarchs are able to reverse a
truesoul’s decay. All I can do is try my best and then pray.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ninedust
patted Ning on the shoulder. “I’m sure you can do it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Enough
about me. How have you been?” Ning smiled. “When are you planning
to attempt the Daomerge? I can tell that you’ve reached an
incredibly high level in the Dao of Water. From what I can see, you
should be the one ranked at the top of the Daolord listings for the
Flamedragon Realmverse. How did my disciple end up taking the
position instead?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had passed on both the Incense Spirit-Fruit and several water-related
techniques to Ninedust to help him out. Ninedust had trained
assiduously and had reached an extremely high level of insight into
the Dao of Water. It could be said that his defensive prowess
surpassed that of all other Daolords in the Flamedragon Realmverse,
save for Ning himself. He was absolutely strong enough to be ranked
number one, but his actual ranking was fairly low.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Who
cares about those stupid lists? Look at you, Darknorth; you
transcended that very concept long ago!” Ninedust chuckled.
“Besides… as your brother, Skywind should be considered one of my
juniors. How could I compete with him over something like this?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Skywind…
he’s a bit too much of a showoff.” Ning shook his head slowly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
he has plenty to show off. I once sparred with him when he first
became a Daolord of the Fourth Step. He truly did amaze me.”
Ninedust let out a sigh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Excessive
hardness leads to brittleness. He’s too extreme… but perhaps
that’s also what made him so special.” Ning shook his head. Of
his many disciples, his third disciple had been given the hardest
path. The man had experienced numerous difficulties as a mortal, and
hadn’t ended after becoming a Daolord.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“When
are you planning to begin your Daomerge?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Soon.
Thanks to the techniques you gave me, I can sense that my Dao is
growing even more perfect than before.” Ninedust smiled. “Once I
feel it has reached full perfection, I’ll use the Incense
Spirit-Fruit and begin the Daomerge. It’ll be anywhere between
10,000 chaos cycles and 50,000 chaos cycles from now.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
have to come to offer my congratulations once you succeed,” Ning
said with a laugh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
must,” Ninedust agreed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Both
had their own tribulations to overcome. Ninedust had to deal with the
tribulation known as the Daomerge, while Ning had to deal with the
crumbling of his truesoul. Both of these two brothers had to succeed
if they wished to meet again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">By
comparison, Ninedust stood a very good chance; he had already used a
Voidsea Jadeseal and been given both techniques and an Incense
Spirit-Fruit by Ning. Ning’s chances were much lower.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
spending quite some time chatting with his old friend Ninedust, Ning
finally bade the Ancient cultivator farewell.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
short while later, Ning headed off to an ordinary chaosworld within
the Flamedragon Realmverse. He had come here to meet his third
disciple, Skywind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
found Skywind in the corner of an alehouse. Skywind was dressed in
ordinary gray robes. The robes were not magic in any manner; these
truly were cheap hemp robes which mortal peasants might wear. He was
caked in filth, and his hair was disheveled. He sat there in the
corner, drinking wine by himself. He was never able to get drunk, but
he still came here to drink quite often.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">No
one in the alehouse dared to bother him… because half a year ago,
this filthy-looking man had killed the governor of this city with a
pair of chopsticks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Drinking
by yourself?” a voice rang out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Startled,
Skywind looked up. Someone had actually been able to approach him
without him even noticing it? And this person clearly hadn’t hidden
his aura either; Skywind could clearly sense the aura of the sword
about him. How did I not notice him approaching? This was so strange
that Skywind could hardly believe it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
he turned around, he saw a white-robed Ning seated at a nearby bench.
Ning poured himself a cup of wine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master!”
When Skywind saw Ning, he immediately fell to his knees and kowtowed.
He respected and revered his master more than anyone else.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
simply watched as his disciple kowtowed, not moving to stop him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
can get up,” Ning said a moment later.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Skywind rose to his feet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
picked up his wine cup. “Come. Let the two of us, master and
disciple, share a cup of wine.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Skywind
immediately lifted up his own wine cup and offered Ning a respectful
toast. None of the ordinary mortals within this alehouse were able to
notice or sense Ning’s presence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
finishing the wine, Skywind said in a guilty manner: “I’ve
disappointed you, Master.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
nothing to be disappointed about. Cultivation can lead to countless
different paths,” Ning said. “A shadow was cast over your heart
back in your homeland, long before you ever entered the Flamedragon
Realmverse. For you to end up in your current situation… I blame
myself as your master for not having helped you more.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
isn’t your fault, Master. This is the path I chose for myself,”
Skywind said hastily. He himself knew that he had gone too far in his
murderous actions. If it hadn’t been for the fact that his master
was Daolord Darknorth, the Archons of the Sacred Cities probably
would’ve wiped him out long ago.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
are you planning to just spend your final years here?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
tired,” Skywind said softly. “I don’t want to run around any
longer, and I don’t want to go back home either. I suppose I’ll
just keep living here in this mortal world.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
might as well.” Ning didn’t try to dissuade him. “This will
most likely be our final meeting. Let’s just share some wine with
each other. I’ll only give you one final piece of advice – In
cultivation, you must always follow your heart. The only thing you
need to do is stay true to yourself. If you can do that, then there
will be no need to feel any fear, nor will you need to feel guilt.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Skywind’s
eyes reddened. He could sense how quickly his master’s truesoul was
disintegrating. His master probably wouldn’t be able to survive for
much longer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now,
enough of all that. Let’s drink.” Ning smiled as he lifted up his
wine cup once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
a lengthy drinking session with his disciple, Ning departed. He could
not interfere in someone else’s path of cultivation; he couldn’t
even interfere in his own daughter’s Daomerge, save to provide her
with as many resources as he could. The only thing he could do was to
try and guide Skywind in following, strengthening, and perfecting his
own Dao-heart. As for what Skywind would do afterwards? That would be
up to him.</P>

Chapter 7: Old Friends (Part 2)</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning next led Su Youji and the others to visit his fifth disciple,
his sixth disciple, and his seventh disciple.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh.
The realmship continued to fly through the skies. “Dawnjade,”
Ning said, “You are significantly more talented than all eight of
my disciples.” By now, Ning had encountered many geniuses in his
life. Mother Nuwa, for example, was so incredibly talented that she
had reached Hegemony within an extremely short period of time. As
Ning saw it, Dawnjade was extremely close to himself and Mother Nuwa
in talent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“However…
you have an obvious weakness,” Ning said. “Due to the fact that
you’ve always lived within the Ji clan, you’ve experienced almost
no setbacks in your life. During your early years in particular, you
were always given the best treatment by the clan. As a result, your
Dao-heart is lacking and needs tempering.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
understand,” Dawnjade said obediently.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">‘Favored
son’: this phrase described Dawnjade perfectly. Ning had been
forced to scour the world for techniques, fighting and clawing for
every scrap of karmic luck he could find before stumbling upon the
path of the Omega Dao. Dawnjade was different. The Ji clan had poured
its resources into rearing him, and had also arranged for him to
undergo many different ‘tempering exercises’, but in the end all
of those exercises were artificial. Dawnjade had a decent Dao-heart,
but it wasn’t even close to the perfect Dao-heart one needed to
succeed in the Daomerge for an Omega Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
you wish to succeed in the Daomerge for the Omega Dao, you must have
a perfect Dao-heart,” Ning said. “In the Flamedragon Realmverse,
there was an Emperor known as Emperor Heartsword. If you can fully
master his [Heartsword] art, you’ll have a perfect Dao-heart. There
are multiple legacies within the annals of the Ji clan pertaining to
perfecting one’s Dao-heart.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
understand.” Dawnjade nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Just
‘understanding’ is meaningless. You have to act,” Ning
instructed. “From this day forth, you shall begin training in the
[Daoheart Illusion Sword].”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
[Daoheart Illusion Sword]?” Dawnjade was puzzled. “Patriarch,
I’ve never even heard of this technique.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is a Dao-heart technique which I just finished creating. I’d be
shocked if you had heard of it,” Ning said with a chuckle. “It
should be a technique which suits you very well… but in the end,
you have to temper your Dao-heart yourself. Techniques can only serve
as a guide.” Ning waved his hand, producing a jade slip which he
handed over to Dawnjade, who respectfully accepted it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Heartsword, God Emperor Helong, ‘Green Bamboo’ Yang Quding… all
of them had perfect Dao-hearts, and all of them were incredible
figures. However, it would be extremely difficult for anyone else to
gain perfect Dao-hearts by training in the techniques they left
behind! This was because every cultivator had to find his own
spiritual path to perfecting his Dao-heart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
Ning had tried to perfectly emulate the [Heartsword] art, he wouldn’t
have been able to perfect his Dao-heart either. In the end, he had
only been able to take that final step during the Daomerge, using
three years of time in that hyper-stimulated environment to succeed.
Alas… all that wasted time had resulted in Ning failing the
Daomerge!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Although
my technique will help you temper your Dao-heart,” Ning said
seriously, “You must remember… your Dao-heart is your own. Not
someone else’s! Thus in seeking the Dao, you must seek your own
true self. If you want a perfect Dao-heart, you’ll need to do it
your own way.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”
Dawnjade firmly engraved these words into his heart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
said nothing further. He had scried Dawnjade’s future, and he knew
that Dawnjade had to suffer many setbacks if the child wished to have
a chance at perfecting his Dao-heart. If everything in his life was
completely smooth and troublefree, he might become a Daolord of the
Fourth Step but he would never be able to perfect his Dao-heart, much
less succeed in the Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
a secret realm hidden within a region of empty space. The insides of
this secret realm had been half-demolished; clearly, a great battle
had been fought here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Greatjoy.” Ning stared at the palace ruins before him, his gaze
piercing through spacetime and showing him what had occurred here in
the past.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">During
the time Ning spent in seclusion, Daolord Greatjoy had perished in
battle here! Greatjoy had been an incredible figure, but in the end
his dying enemy had destroyed the entire realm around them in a final
suicide attack. The two had died together.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Skyfire
Brightshore had a very relaxed life. Ning ate and drank and made
merry with him for two days, then parted paths.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
tens of thousands of chaos planets were being moved about like chess
pieces. They slowly orbited a vast region of empty space, controlled
by a great formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">At
the center of that region was a temple, and before that temple sat a
skinny, bald, red-robed youth. An invisible surge of power swirled
around him, encompassing the tens of thousands of chaos planets
around him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mortal-rank,
class one mission – complete!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
was your first time embarking upon the path of cultivation. You
survived, while all of your experienced teammates died. You are worth
spending a bit of extra effort on. Do not disappoint me, Qin An.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Evaluation
– 6.0!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Reward:
3000 Mortal-ranked gemstones.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
spectacled youth stared, puzzled, at the illusory globe of light
before him. This globe of light was filled with an enormous amount of
information regarding cultivation, pill-making, and even how to
transform the body. One was even able to trade for mighty Fiendgod
bodies that could be used to uproot the mountains themselves! But of
course, the price would be high.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can even trade for a golem-body that would allow me to easily destroy
a vast world with a wave of my hand? If all this is real… this is
absolutely terrifying.” The spectacled youth’s eyes were shining
as he continued to review the information. “I can bring the dead
back to life and even travel to other worlds. Anything and everything
is possible! This type of world is much more interesting than my old
one. I love this world!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Qin
An was a nerd who lived in a world of ordinary mortals. He was
extremely clever, but his brilliance was only put to good use after
he was brought to the ‘Cataclysm Trials’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
took on one mission after another, forming squads with others to
challenge them. He sparred against many powerful martial artists,
going so far as to actually embark upon the path of true Immortal
cultivation. He was even sent into a world of Fiendgods, where he
battled against mighty gods and fiends alike. He was tempered and
tested over and over again. In the process, many teammates perished,
but they were quickly replaced. The survivors only grew stronger and
stronger.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Solewind,
I have to say, this ‘Cataclysm Trials’ game you came up with is
rather interesting.” Ning appeared in the emptiness of space
outside the temple.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
skinny, bald, red-robed youth opened his eyes. A delighted look was
on his face. “Darknorth, you came! What do you think? My Cataclysm
Trials are pretty nice, eh? I used tens of thousands of chaos planets
as the foundation for the formation, my many estate-treasures as
support beams, and my Dao of Illusions to join them all together into
the Cataclysm Trials. I then chose countless mortals to take part in
my trials, allowing them to claw their way forwards upon the path of
cultivation within it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
not bad at all,” Ning praised.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
heartforce is strengthened and improved by the process,” Solewind
said with a smile. “I’m planning to maintain the Cataclysm Trials
for ten thousand chaos cycles. Hopefully, by then I’ll be confident
enough to attempt the Daomerge. If not, I’ll find another way to
train.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. It was extremely difficult for Heartforce Cultivators to
succeed in the Daomerge. They had to try all sorts of strange, unique
methods to train and improve themselves.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Have
you come to bid an old friend a final farewell?” Solewind suddenly
asked. As powerful Heartforce Cultivators with strong hearts, there
was no need for the two of them to mince words.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded and smiled. “I’m going into terminal seclusion after this
meeting.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
made many friends on my path of cultivation, but I admire you above
all others,” Solewind said. “You are going to succeed. You have
to.” Solewind knew that if Ning was going into terminal seclusion,
that meant Ning was most likely trying a last-ditch effort to save
himself. If Ning was truly out of options and saw no hope at all, why
would he go into seclusion?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Stop
trying to make me feel better,” Ning said with a chuckle. “I
don’t need it. By the way, I actually spent a thousand years
watching events occur within your Cataclysm Trials.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
long?” Solewind was surprised. “I use reality as the foundation,
then use illusions to make up for reality’s shortcomings. Now, why
would the venerable Daolord Darknorth take an interest in such a
simple technique?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
explained, “I was actually watching a young fellow who was training
within it. That’s why I watched for a thousand years. Are you
willing to let him follow me instead?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
might have put countless cultivators into my Cataclysm Trials, but
only a few thousand have been able to survive for more than a
thousand years. They are priceless treasures to me,” Solewind said
in an intentionally sorrowful manner. “Buuuuut… since you’ve
made the request, Daolord Darknorth, I suppose I must give you face.
Which one have you taken a fancy to?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
one called Qin An,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Qin
An had come from a world which was extremely similar to the world
Ning had lived in during his previous life, ‘Earth’. There were
quite a few under-developed worlds like ‘Earth’ in the
Chaosverse, and Daolord Solewind had teleported many people from such
worlds to the Cataclysm Trials.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Qin
An! That boy was born to be a cultivator.” Solewind sighed
dramatically. “You know, he doesn’t view the ‘trials’ of the
Cataclysm Trials as dangers to be avoided. He eagerly dives into
mission after mission! I actually prepared a few difficult trials
just for him, but he managed to flip the script each time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
taken a liking to the kid as well,” Ning said. “I’m planning to
take him on as a disciple.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
he is one lucky kid.” Solewind immediately waved his hand.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
A youth suddenly appeared in the emptiness of space by Solewind’s
side. The kid was dressed in black robes and had a stately gaze. He
looked completely harmless… but when he scanned the area around him
and saw Daolord Solewind and Ji Ning, his eyes narrowed. He could
sense that his very soul itself was quaking in fear. The auras
emanating from the two individuals before him were absolutely
terrifying.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Even
though just hints of their auras were leaking out, the two were
clearly unfathomably more powerful than even the most powerful
creature he had ever encountered, an Elder God-class Fiendgod.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
am the creator of the Cataclysm Trials. You can address me as
‘Solewind’.” Daolord Solewind's very first words caused the
young Qin An to feel completely stunned. The creator of the Cataclysm
Trials?!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Solewind
smiled. “Next to me is my good friend, Darknorth. Qin An, today is
your lucky day. My friend is far more powerful than I am, but he’s
actually taken a fancy to you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Qin
An, are you willing to become my disciple and take me on as your
master?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had always followed his own heart in choosing new disciples. His
‘fourth disciple’, for example… Ning had simply tossed a
talisman into a hidden location. Whoever was lucky enough to acquire
it would become his fourth personal disciple! Thus far, this person
had yet to arise. His seventh disciple ‘Almonder’ and his eighth
disciple ‘Stonepool’ had all been extremely weak when Ning had
first noticed them, while his second disciple ‘Green Bamboo’ Yang
Quding had been just an ordinary mortal.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
cared more about the Dao-hearts of his potential disciples. And of
course, he also chose people whose personalities he liked! He had
seen countless beings struggling within the Cataclysm Trials, but the
only one he had liked was Qin An! He admired how Qin An was still
brimming with confidence and excitement despite having seen so much
death and lost so many friends in the Cataclysm Trials. This truly
was quite rare!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
willing! Willing!” Qin An had experienced much in recent years, and
he was no fool. He immediately knelt down and kowtowed: “Master,
your disciple Qin An greets you!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Good.
From this day forth, you shall be the ninth disciple of myself,
Darknorth. You are the last personal disciple I shall ever take,”
Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Solewind
glanced at Qin An. How the hell was this kid so lucky? He actually
became the final disciple Daolord Darknorth chose before going into
terminal seclusion! It must be remembered that even major powers like
Lord Houwu of the Blazesun Domain would love for the chance to become
Ning’s servant and receive a few occasional pointers from him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
looked at his new disciple, Qin An, then nodded. He now had a ninth
disciple, and he had visited everyone he needed to visit. It was time
to return to the Three Realms and prepare to enter terminal
seclusion.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">* *

Chapter 8: Terminal Seclusion</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Before
Ji Ning brought his ninth disciple, Qin An, back to the Three Realms,
he first paid a brief visit to the Badlands Territory.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Halt,”
Ning instructed. The realmship came to a halt in midair. Ning turned
to glance at Qin An, then reached out to tap Qin An on the middle of
his forehead. An enormous amount of information began to pour into
Qin An’s mind, followed by three surges of sword-intent being
hidden deep within his soul. All three surges of sword-intent were of
varying levels of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">At
Qin An’s current level of power, if he had to learn this enormous
amount of information from jade slips it would probably take over ten
thousand years. Using this method, Ning had accomplished it in the
blink of an eye. Most of the information, however, would remain
sealed. Qin An was currently too weak; his soul and truesoul simply
couldn’t absorb that much information at once.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.”
Qin An regained consciousness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Of
my nine disciples, you are the most talented at dealing with danger,”
Ning said. “I’ve left you three surges of sword-intent to protect
you and many techniques for you to learn. The rest shall be up to
you. This place is known as the Badlands Territories, and it is very
vast, far vaster than the ‘Cataclysm Trials’ you were in. You’ll
have to rely on yourself in adventuring through this place. Once you
reach the World level or become a Daolord, you’ll probably be able
to locate your fellow disciples.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“World
level?” This was an incredibly distant concept to Qin An. He hadn’t
even become a Celestial Immortal yet!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright,
you can leave now. Your path will be your own.” Ning waved his
hand. Whoosh! Qin An was teleported through spacetime into an
ordinary chaosworld within the Badlands Territory.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master…
you remain as, uh, succinct as ever in teaching your disciples,” Su
Youji said with a snicker.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
more setbacks they encounter, the farther they’ll make it on their
respective paths,” Azurefiend said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
Ning returned to the Three Realms, he began to meet with some of his
old friends for what was perhaps the final time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Northmont
Baiwei, Mu Northson, his master Immortal Diancai…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
must be remembered that even Empyrean Gods and Celestial Immortals
were able to live for the incredibly long time of 108,000 chaos
cycles. When Ning had been very young, he had acquired a prisonworld
filled with Empyrean Gods and Celestial Immortals who had been alive
for multiple chaos cycles.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
Empyrean Gods and Celestial Immortals generally had very weak
Dao-hearts. Very few would be able to live to their maximum
lifespans, as most would end up developing mental issues that would
result in their energies running wild, resulting in death. Most had
to rely on using spirit-pills to nourish their bodies; only then
would they be able to live long enough to hit the 108,000 cycle
limit. Northmont Baiwei, for example, was merely a Pure Yang True
Immortal, but he was still alive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Another
person Ning went to visit was Ninelotus.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ninelotus
was the first woman Ning had ever romantically loved. Ning’s status
was so incredibly high that after they broke up, no one else ever
dared to pursue Ninelotus! Ninelotus herself set up her own school
long ago, and she only accepted female cultivators who swore to be
forever single.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ninelotus
had vanished for many years after establishing her sect, but then she
had suddenly skyrocketed in power. She had first reached the World
level of power, then became a Samsara Daolord during the period of
time that Ning was secluded in meditation. This caused many people in
the Three Realms to feel quite speechless… and many secretly
whispered that Fairy Ninelotus had to have reached this level thanks
to Daolord Darknorth’s help. Otherwise, how could she have been
ordinary for so long, then suddenly risen to power?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
himself, however, knew that he hadn’t helped Ninelotus at all!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Below
a giant tree within a courtyard. Ning and Ninelotus were seated
facing each other, with Ninelotus pouring Ning some tea.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
grew this tea tree myself and personally harvested the leaves,”
Ninelotus said. “Have a taste.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Senior
apprentice-sister Ninelotus.” Ning smiled. “You truly amaze me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had seen many things. By now, he knew that there were indeed some
cultivators who rose to prominence late in life! Common sense
dictated that they shouldn’t be able to make any further
breakthroughs, given how long they had been alive for, but they
somehow did. They just slowly advanced at their own pace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“For
a long time, you cast a deep shadow over my heart.” Ninelotus
looked at Ning. She could sense his truesoul crumbling away, and she
felt sorrow for him. He had been an extremely important man in her
life, after all. “I eventually set up my own female-only school and
strictly forbade my disciples from falling in love… but that’s
not something a mere rule can prevent. In the end, quite a few of my
disciples ended up becoming Dao-companions with men from the outside
world. After teaching many of them and seeing many things, the shadow
over my heart began to gradually dissipate. I began to get over the
past.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
simply taught my disciples and tended to my garden, planting trees
and weeding weeds. Every so often, I’d read a few treatises on the
Dao.” Ninelotus smiled. “Honestly, it was quite strange. For some
reason, cultivation became easier and easier for me, and I began to
improve faster and faster.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
could sense that Ninelotus’ Dao-heart had reached incredible
heights after she had managed to dispel the shadow that had bedeviled
her heart for so many years. In the end, the Dao-heart was what
mattered the most to cultivators!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Long
ago, Ning had established a Dao-repository filled with countless
techniques which all talented cultivators of the Three Realms were
given access to. Many of those techniques had been written down by
Hegemons and included a detailed explanation from start to finish.
This had allowed the Three Realms to produce more and more major
powers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, the brightest star of the Black-White
College… I felt certain that you would continue to dazzle long
after I died,” Ninelotus said. “I never thought that I’d still
be alive while you…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
why I had to come visit you, old friend.” Ning smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Is
there hope?” Ninelotus suddenly asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
the love between them had vanished long ago, she still cared deeply
about Ning. Many failed Daolords refused to give up hope. Daolord
Allgod, for example, had tried all sorts of methods to extend his
life! The law of the universe was that the heavens always gave a
chance, no matter how slim… and it was true! There was, in fact, a
way for those who failed the Daomerge to survive. Alas, to this very
day not even the Autarchs had been able to truly grasp it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
enter terminal seclusion soon to find out,” Ning said with a smile.
“If you ever see me again, you’ll know that I succeeded.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
I’ll wait for you to come back. I’ll make sure to have some more
tea ready for you,” Ninelotus said hopefully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
felt quite happy after leaving Ninelotus’ residence. He could tell
from her breakthroughs that she had gotten over her previous issues.
This was why he had been willing to visit her. If she was still
entangled by the demons of the past, he wouldn’t have disturbed
her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
continued to wander the Three Realms, visiting all of his old
friends. Finally, he hosted a family banquet in Brightheart Island.
The only ones invited to the banquet included his parents,
Brightmoon, Uncle White, Autumn Leaf, and other extremely close
friends and family. Youji, Pillsaint, and Azurefiend were also
permitted to attend as his retainers. Even the slumbering Flamewing
God was awakened by Ning and called over to take part.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
the banquet ended, Ning was going to enter terminal seclusion.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flamewing,”
Ning instructed, “Stay for a few hundred thousand more chaos cycles
in the Flamedragon Realmverse. After that, you can go where you
please.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You’ll
definitely make it back, Master!” Flamewing truly couldn’t bear
to part with Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha…”
Ning chuckled, then turned to look at everyone else present.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ning.
Son.” Yuchi Snow’s eyes were filled with worry.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Young
master.” Autumn Leaf looked at Ning as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Yichuan and Uncle White looked at Ning. Both were able to remain
fairly calm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.”
Su Youji’s eyes were filled with anxiousness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
looked at this gathering of the friends and family who meant the most
to him, then smiled. “Relax, everyone. I’m going into terminal
seclusion, not certain death. Besides, I’ve already lived a far
longer life than ordinary mortals are granted. I’m an old fart by
now! Alright. I’m off!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
he turned to leave, he cast Su Youji a final glance and nodded
towards her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">How
could he not understand the feelings Su Youji bore him? Su Youji, in
turn, knew how Ning felt and so she continued to ‘hide’ her
feelings, never giving voice to them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had no answer for this, no solution. Mortals might be easily moved to
love, but someone like Ning? At most, he could care about her as he
would a beloved family member. As far as romantic love went… he
truly felt nothing for her at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
As Ning took a single step forwards, a dimensional tunnel appeared
before him. He stepped into the dimensional tunnel, then vanished.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Everyone
on Brightheart Island watched as Ning departed, their hearts filled
with many emotions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.
Nuwa. If I truly do fail in my terminal seclusion, the security of
the Three Realms will be up to the two of you.” Ning’s voice
suddenly rang out in the minds of Subhuti and Nuwa.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Subhuti
had been meditating, while Nuwa had been teaching students. Both were
startled by Ning’s sudden message.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
hadn’t met with them before going into secluded meditation. He only
sent them this single, simple mental message.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Disciple,”
Subhuti murmured softly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
is still hope.” Nuwa turned to stare into the void beyond the Three
Realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Azureflower Estate was as same as it always was as the white-robed
Ning stepped inside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth.” The white-haired elder had been waiting at the gates
for quite some time now. He immediately bowed respectfully as Ning
entered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha.
You get to be the last one by my side as I enter terminal seclusion,”
Ning teased.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“To
accompany you in this is my honor,” the white-haired elder
chuckled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
turned to glance at the world behind him. He felt as though he could
see the images of those who he cared about appearing outside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Close
the gates,” Ning instructed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">With
a rumble, the towering gates to the Azureflower Estate swung shut.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Far,
far away, in the outer perimeter of the Sithelands. There was a
floating island here which had an ancient temple on it. Inside were
Autarch Mogg and the avatars of the other Autarchs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarchs,
I wanted to let you know that I, Darknorth, am preparing to enter
terminal seclusion. Let our various conversations and sharing of
insights be paused for now! But of course, if you gain any extremely
important insights, you can still go ahead and share them with me,”
Ji Ning sent via the Autarch talisman to the other six Autarchs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Terminal
seclusion?” Titanos, Ekong, Bolin, Skyfeeder, Stonerule, and Mogg
all stiffened. They all felt a mixture of complex emotions in their
heart, as well as a sense of sorrow. They knew just how difficult
creating a ‘Truesoul Everlasting’ technique would be. The six of
them had spent a great deal of time in recent years on this
technique, but they actually made much less progress than Ning. There
were no important insights they could share with him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
we have any important insights, we’ll definitely notify you.”
Autarch Bolin was the first to reply.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
you are the first and only master of an Eternal Omega Dao our
Chaosverse has produced. I know you can succeed, no matter how hard
the task,” Autarch Titanos said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
always a chance, no matter how slim. I know that you will seize it,”
Autarch Skyfeeder said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
all replied supportively, but although their words were filled with
encouragement and they spoke of their faith in Ning, deep in their
hearts they knew how slim Ning’s chances were. That was why they
had to speak so supportively! Over the course of the past 15,000
chaos cycles, they had often exchanged insights with Ning regarding
the [Deathless Chapter]. At first, they had been able to provide Ning
with some new ideas, but later on their rate of advancement became
far slower than Ning’s.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.
I’ll definitely find and seize that chance. I’m going into
seclusion now.” Ning sent one final reply, then fell silent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
six Autarchs exchanged glances, then sighed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ugh.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Just
like that, one of our good friends has…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Perhaps
a miracle will happen.” All of them felt saddened, and the
atmosphere quickly turned heavy. Darknorth had been a dazzling
figure, the first master of an Eternal Omega Dao their Chaosverse had
produced. He had established a new path for future generations to
follow, and now… all by himself… he was preparing to go out in a
blaze of glory, fighting a battle which no one had ever won in a bid
for survival. He had so many unfinished hopes and dreams… but alas,
nothing in life would ever be exactly as one wished it to be.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
six Autarchs could do nothing but wait silently.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
a silent hallway. The white-robed Ning first drew all six of his
Northbow swords from their sheaths, then placed them atop a nearby
table. The elderly white-haired spirit of the estate watched silently
from one side.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
then walked to the Autarch’s stone dais, sat down in the lotus
position, then slowly closed his eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had already settled as many affairs as he could. There was no point
in worrying about the rest. He was now able to truly empty his mind
of all extranteous thoughts and focus everything on creating the
complete [Truesoul Everlasting] technique!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Creation
of this technique was his one and only chance to survive. Of course,
successfully becoming an Autarch via the Omega Dao was also possible,
but by all rights that would require an enormous amount of work and
time. He simply didn’t have that much time left to him!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rely
on an epiphany? Epiphanies could only be hoped for, not counted on.
Hoping for an epiphany that would propel him into Omega Autarchy was
nothing more than a foolish pipe dream. He at least had a slim chance
at surviving with a ‘Truesoul Everlasting’ technique, but his
chances of surviving due to becoming an Omega Autarch were next to
nil. If he had a million chaos cycles or more, he might be able to
accomplish it with some luck and an epiphany, but as of right now?
Forget it!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Besides…
when entering terminal seclusion, one had to put everything at stake.
The worst thing he could do was to allow himself to be distracted by
other possibilities!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
knew that becoming an Omega Autarch in such a short period of time
was far less likely than successfully developing the ‘Truesoul
Everlasting’ technique. Thus, he didn’t hesitate at all in
choosing the latter option! He had made this choice 15,000 chaos
cycles ago, and he didn’t hesitate at all as he entered terminal
seclusion.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
path was illuminated by the [Deathless Chapter] of the [Five
Truncheon Chapters], which in turn represented Hawkfang’s
distillation of the Sithe Chaoslord’s insights as represented by
the nine techniques he had created. Ning had joined them together
with all of the insights pertaining to this Chaosverse which he had
gained over countless years, as well as the insights of Autarch
Awakener. Without question, it was the path most likely to succeed!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
‘Truesoul Everlasting’… there are two paths to success which I
can take. The first is that of the ‘Void Everlasting’, while the
second is that of the ‘Chaos Everlasting’.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
began to ponder this most important of questions. “What should I
choose? Once I make the decision, I’ll have to follow it to the
bitter end.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">During
previous aeons, he had pursued multiple paths at the same time.
Autarch Awakener had believed that the two most likely paths were
those of ‘Void Everlasting’ and ‘Infinity Everlasting’. The
latter followed the most fundamental principles of Daoist
cultivation, and was based on the principle of how ‘one begat two,
two begat three, and three begat all things.’ The principle was
basic, but actualizing it was difficult. Ning had finally abandoned
this approach by chaos cycle 12,000. As for the other paths, he had
abandoned them at other intervals as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Now,
only two paths remained which Ning felt would have the highest
chances of success.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Void Everlasting… it involves using my will as the core. I would
need to be able to maintain my will and consciousness in the
emptiness of space itself. Even after my truesoul shatters apart, I
would still be able to remain conscious and could then use the empty
void of space itself to serve as the medium for remaking my truesoul
anew.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Chaos Everlasting… it involves trusting my will to the prime
essences of the Chaosverse themselves. I would borrow from the power
of the Quintessence, asking it to halt its instinctual desire to
swallow my truesoul. If I can do that, my truesoul will naturally
stop crumbling.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
continued to ponder this decision. The ‘Void Everlasting’
required him to rely on himself, while the ‘Chaos Everlasting’
involved him swaying the prime essences and convincing them to ease
drawing upon his truesoul.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Why
did the truesoul continuously shatter and break apart? Because the
prime essences would begin pulling at it after the first cracks
appeared during the Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Void Everlasting technique works in theory, but I haven’t sensed it
actually function in practice,” Ning mused. “As for Chaos
Everlasting, I can sense its effects. I’ve tried numerous times to
link my will to the prime essences and have been able to use this
technique to slow down the rate at which it absorbs my truesoul…
but as soon as I halt the technique, the prime essences will continue
to swallow my truesoul at the normal rate once more.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
first technique seemed ineffective, while the second one did have
some effects. Which one should he choose?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
gritted his teeth. “To completely prevent the prime essences from
devouring my truesoul fragments would be to go against the natural
order of the Chaosverse! The only reason why my technique seems to be
effective is because right now, this Chaosverse has no Lord governing
it.” Ning shook his head. “However, my chances of completely
halting this process remain very low.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
understood this point from the very beginning. To go against the
natural order of the Chaosverse was not a wise option. The only
reason he had yet to abandon it was because it did seem to at least
have some effect.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can’t leave things to luck, nor can I try and have ‘backup’
options. Void Everlasting it is!” Ning made his final decision,
deciding to focus all of his efforts on embarking upon the path of
the Void Everlasting.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
[Void Everlasting] technique was a completely self-reliant technique.
It required him to be able to maintain a ‘void will’. Only then
would he have successfully acquired a ‘Truesoul Everlasting’!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">What
did the phrase ‘void will’ mean? The word ‘will’ referred to
his mind, to his consciousness! For ordinary mortals, possessing a
soul meant possessing consciousness. Powerful cultivators understood
that only possessing a complete truesoul represented having
consciousness and the capability for true thought.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for the most supreme of major powers? Even if their truesouls were
fragmented and shattered, they would still be able to maintain
consciousness! A major power’s mind and consciousness would only
come to a halt when the final fragments of his truesoul completely
collapsed. When Ning’s original body had perished, he had
experienced this process of his truesoul breaking apart and his
consciousness dimming away. The reason that consciousness vanished
was because its most fundamental vessel, the ‘truesoul’, had
completely broken apart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">To
have a ‘void will’ meant that even after your truesoul completely
broke apart, you would still be able to maintain consciousness,
housing it within the emptiness of the void itself! Imagine what a
powerful will one would need in order to be able to accomplish such a
thing!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
his will was sufficiently powerful, he would be able to play
tug-of-war with his truesoul fragments, forcibly latching onto them
even after his truesoul had broken apart and preventing them from
dissipating. He would draw them together into a new whole! In order
to accomplish this, the power of his will would have to surpass the
absorptive power of the Chaosverse itself. Only then would one have a
‘Truesoul Everlasting’!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Chaos
Everlasting required one to be able to convince the Chaosverse to
temporarily halt the absorption process, while Void Everlasting
required one to use one’s will to overpower the energy-sucking
strength of the Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Willpower
strong enough to exist independently of body and soul… to
accomplish this, I will need to truly perfect the [Void Everlasting]
technique,” Ning mused to himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was going all-in on this final gamble, and he completely threw
himself into researching this technique.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
continued to flow on. He continuously tested out new theories, but
each time he failed. There was no effect at all on the dissolution of
his truesoul, but he didn’t let himself grow dispirited. Instead,
he drew from these experiences and continued to perfect this
technique, pushing in one new model after another.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
failed a billion times. Ten billion times. A trillion times. If he
was a mortal, he would’ve abandoned himself to despair long ago.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning,
however, remained as calm as a still pond of water. Everything was as
he had expected.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
thousand chaos cycles went by in the blink of an eye, and he was
getting close to the very end. A million years. A hundred thousand
years. Ten thousand years. A hundred years. One year. One month…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
now had very, very little time remaining.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_43_Chapter_010__Fina"></A>
Chapter 10: The Final Gamble</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">One
month. Ten days. One day. One hour…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning learned from each of his failures, drawing upon those
experiences as he worked hard to further perfect the technique.
Slowly, the ‘Void Everlasting’ technique began to take some
effect, dramatically strengthening the power of his consciousness.
However, he still wasn’t even close to being strong enough for his
truesoul to resist the siren song of the prime essences of the
Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Northbow.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was seated next to a table, pouring himself a cup of wine. He had
chosen to spend his last hour of life drinking wine and relaxing,
releasing all of the tension that had built up over a thousand chaos
cycles in one fell swoop.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.”
Sad-faced children had appeared on the surfaces of all six Northbow
swords. They looked despondently at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Number
one, number two, number three, number four, number five… and number
six.” Ning called them all by ‘name’, then smiled: “After I
finish this cup of wine, I’ll go try one last time. If I fail,
it’ll all have been for naught. The six of you are, without
question, the deadliest swords in all the Chaosverse, the only swords
powered by the Eternal Omega Sword Dao. Once I’m gone, you will be
ownerless. Go and find owners which suit you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
won’t choose anyone else! We only want you, Master.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You’ll
definitely survive, Master.” All six of the sword-spirits were
unwilling to part with Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
can also choose to take human form and just rove the Chaosverse,”
Ning said. Given how powerful the Northbow swords were, they could
easily choose to take human form, while their natural power was
enough to heavily injure even Hegemons. If they wanted to flee from
someone, not even an Otherverse Lord would be able to catch them.
Bind them by force? That would be even harder!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You’ll
definitely succeed, Master. We want to stay by your side forever.”
All six of them were crying.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
looked at the six little children, a smile playing on his face. “When
I see the six of you, I feel satisfied with what I accomplished in my
life.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
lifted up the tankard of wine, drinking it all down in one gulp
before rising to his feet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
me congratulate you in advance, Daolord, for you shall surely
complete the technique and gain a Truesoul Everlasting.” The
white-haired spirit of the estate had been watching silently this
entire time. Upon seeing Ning rise, he came forward and bowed
respectfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Complete
the technique and gain a Truesoul Everlasting!” all six
sword-spirits chorused.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha.
Yes, a Truesoul Everlasting! I shall indeed.” Ning walked over to
the Autarch’s stone dais, then sat down in the lotus position. His
truesoul was on its last legs now, and he didn’t have any time to
waste. The remaining fragments of his truesoul were so weak that they
could very well completely collapse as soon as Ning attempted to use
this truesoul technique!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
final gamble! If I fail, I die. If I succeed… a new world will
begin.” Ning closed his eyes and began to ruminate on ways he could
further perfect the [Void Everlasting].</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Just
ten seconds later…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
Ning’s shuddering truesoul began to come together in a final
attempt. Ning’s powerful consciousness reached out, seizing to
forcibly pull the dissipating truesoul fragments back into shape…
but the call of the prime essences was simply too hard to resist.
Alas… this final attempt caused the final shards of his truesoul,
which had been just barely able to hold onto a basic framework, to
finally and completely break apart!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
failed?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
in the end, I still failed…” Ning opened his eyes, and a peaceful
look was in them. His eyes, his skin, his body… every inch of him
began to crumble apart and vanish away like sand blown away by the
wind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
the remaining fragments of his truesoul finally and truly broke apart
in a complete and utter collapse. Countless spots of light which
began to fly out of Ning could be seen with the naked eye… and
then, Ning’s entire body transformed into an enormous, human-shaped
mass of light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord.”
When the white-haired estate-spirit saw this, a look of grief
appeared in his eyes. A truly peerless Daolord, the very first
Daolord to master an Eternal Omega Dao, had just passed away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.”
The six sword-spirits stared frantically at the humanoid mass of
light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was like a dazzlingly beautiful flame… but hidden behind its beauty
was the sorrow of a peerless Daolord’s passing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Ning’s light-body split apart into countless specks of light that
quickly began to shoot out in every direction.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No…”
the sword-spirits sobbed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
that ancient temple located in the outer perimeters of the distant
Sithelands. Autarch Mogg and the avatars of the other Autarchs
remained gathered here as always. Suddenly, all of them fell silent
and began to exchange glances with each other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
The six of them could sense through their message-talismans that the
one belonging to Daolord Darknorth had just lost its master.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Three Realms. Nuwa was responsible for administering many matters
here, while Subhuti spent most of his time training by himself within
his Daoist monastery inside Mount Innerheart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Brush.
Brush. Brush. Subhuti was sweeping the floor of his monastery. He was
the only person in this entire monastery. Not even the two novices
stationed outside would enter without a very good reason.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Subhuti
had already trained to an extremely profound level, and he put
particular emphasis on training his Dao-heart. In this, he was second
only to Ning and Nuwa.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
he finished sweeping the floor, he entered another room and began to
wipe down the pillars and the tables. As he did so, he raised his
head to glance at a lamp located atop the highest table. The light of
the lamp blazed away like a tiny little bead of flame.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was a heartlamp, Ning’s heartlamp! In all the Three Realms, only he
and Nuwa had a way to know whether Ning was alive or not. Ning’s
parents, Brightmoon… their Dao-hearts were too weak. Ning was
worried that if they found out that he died, they wouldn’t be able
to keep it completely secret.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mm.”
When Subhuti saw that the heartlamp was still lit, he couldn’t help
but smile. He usually cultivated in this very room. That way, he
could glance at the heartlamp whenever he wished. Whenever he saw
that the heartlamp was still lit, he would feel a sense of relief in
his heart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
wiping down the tables, he turned to sit down upon a nearby prayer
mat and began to meditate. But just a short while after he began his
meditations…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Subhuti suddenly shuddered. He quickly opened his eyes and turned to
look at the highest table, as though he could sense something was
amiss. The light coming from that heartlamp was quickly dwindling
away… and the sight of it disappearing was like a bolt of thunder
that came crashing into Subhuti’s mind, completely stunning him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Subhuti!”
Nuwa’s slightly frantic voice echoed within his mind: “Ji Ning,
he…!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
student…” Subhuti’s old eyes began to redden as a hint of tears
appeared.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had accepted many disciples in his time, and some had caused him
quite a bit of trouble. Ning had been a fairly unremarkable disciple,
one who Subhuti hadn’t spent too much effort on. Ning’s later
accomplishments, however, had truly impressed Subhuti. Subhuti had
come to view this disciple as he would his own son. He knew that this
disciple of his had worked many miracles in the past, and he had felt
so certain that another miracle was in the making…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ji
Ning,” Subhuti murmured softly. The old man shut his eyes as tears
began to fall down his face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But…
right at that moment. ‘Pop’. The heartlamp had clearly been
extinguished… but suddenly, flickers of flame began to appear
within it as it lit up once again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Subhuti
was a Daolord of the Fourth Step. He was naturally able to sense what
had just happened, and he immediately opened his eyes, not quite
daring to hope that his senses were telling him the truth. That
heartlamp… it remained lit, as it had been over the course of
countless aeons. It was as though it had never dimmed at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“B-b-b-b-but…”
Subhuti was completely stupefied. He had never imagined that a
heartlamp could be extinguished, then reignited!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Once
the truesoul was destroyed, the heartlamp would no longer be able to
sense it, at which point it would become extinguished. Now, however,
it had been reignited. This meant that the truesoul was back to
normal again, but… how was this possible?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Subhuti,
did your heartlamp suddenly light up again?” Nuwa sent mentally.
She was in a state of joy mixed with disbelief as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is lit! Lit!” Subhuti sent frantically.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the second hall inside the Azureflower Estate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
countless specks of light began to gather together, coming to form a
humanoid shape.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the instant of his truesoul’s destruction, Ning finally felt what
true death was like. All of his truesoul fragments had completely
dispersed, losing all cohesion.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
felt nothing but emptiness… as though he was drifting within a
world with no time, no space, and no color.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
various ‘Void Everlasting’ techniques he had theorized in the
past were not able to allow Ning’s truesoul to resist the call of
the prime essences, but they had still strengthened Ning’s
consciousness dramatically. Even as his truesoul broke apart, he
didn’t immediately lose all consciousness the way an ordinary
Daolord might. Instead, his consciousness entered an extremely faint
and sluggish state. He couldn’t sense either space or time… all
he could sense was complete and utter nothingness, the emptiness of
the void.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is what the void truly is…” Suddenly, Ning’s sluggish
consciousness was awakened to the truth. In this instant, he truly
understood what ‘emptiness’ meant, what the ‘void’ truly
meant. Only now was he able to understand how to entrust his
consciousness to the void, and his [Void Everlasting] technique
immediately transformed on its own accord. At the same time, Ning’s
feeble consciousness immediately began to pull at his countless
dispersing truesoul fragments. As he continued to follow the
principles of the [Void Everlasting] technique, his consciousness
suddenly began to grow much more powerful, skyrocketing to
unprecedented heights.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“VOID…
EVERLASTING!” A powerful will suddenly manifested, and it let out a
psychic scream of such power that it could actually be heard audibly.
It was a cry filled with power, a cry of indomitable resolve.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
this shout rang out within the room, it caused the sorrowful
white-haired elder and the six sword-spirits to all stare in
astonishment. They watched as the countless specks of light which had
been flying every which way to suddenly freeze in midair as a
powerful force suddenly pulled at them, connecting them together. The
countless specks of light seemed to come alive as they came forward
to form a complete whole.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
no longer had a truesoul holding them together in an established
framework, but they somehow still remained bound to each other!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“MERGE!”
Yet another shout echoed within the room.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Those
frozen countless specks of light instantly began to gather together
once more. They quickly reformed into a humanoid blob of light, and
that blob of light quickly crystallized in appearance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Once
again, the white-robed Ning appeared within the room. He carefully
inspected everything around him, then gently reached out to touch the
table next of him. The cool, slick touch of the table made him smile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-haired elder and the six sword-spirits were all unspeakably
excited. His truesoul was now Everlasting… which meant that
‘Daolord Darknorth’ was about to become ‘Emperor Darknorth’!</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">* *

Chapter 11: Emperor Darknorth</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
with those silly looks on your faces?” Ji Ning glanced at the six
sword-spirits and the white-haired elder: “Come, let’s drink!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
wasn’t in a rush to connect with the outside world just yet. He
wanted to be by himself for a while.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright,”
the white-haired elder said excitedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Woohoo!”
The six sword-spirits were quite excited as well. Treasure-spirits at
their level all possessed keen senses of sight, smell, and taste. It
was quite common for powerful treasures to transform themselves into
human form and live in the mortal world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Wine
was quickly poured for all. Ning’s smile only broadened as he
lifted up his wine cup and gave it a sniff, letting the pleasing
aroma of the wine seep into his soul. He glanced at the crystalline
liquid within his cup, then murmured softly, “Being alive feels
wonderful.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
looked very calm, but inside he was unspeakably excited. He had
succeeded! He had actually succeeded in overcoming the greatest
tribulation he faced. Although he had behaved quite placidly before
others, he knew just how tiny his chances of successfully creating
the ‘Truesoul Everlasting’ technique were. He had mentally
prepared himself for death, which was why he had gone to visit so
many of his old friends and even Ninelotus. He wanted to empty his
mind of all distractions and leave nothing behind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
that I’ve created the ‘Truesoul Everlasting’ technique, I can
make repeated attempts at the Daomerge.” Ning smiled. “However…
I personally don’t need to. I can easily succeed in the Daomerge
and become an Emperor.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“An
Emperor with an Eternal Omega Dao… I can reach this level whenever
I want to. Now, it’ll be much easier for me to deal with the
Sithe.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had always been extremely strong thanks to his Eternal Omega Dao, but
he had never dared to truly launch a wild barrage of attacks! Autarch
Mogg and the other autarchs could launch tens of thousands of attacks
in a split second, allowing them to overpower and crush everything in
their path. The only place which made them a bit nervous was the
heart of the Sithelands, but they were able to handle it by pouring a
large amount of energy in casting a seal over that place.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Dangerous,
eh? Then I’ll seal you inside and make it impossible for you to
leave. Just rot there!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarchs
were unimaginably powerful. The only problem was that there simply
were not enough of them. If they had dozens of Autarchs, the Sithe
would’ve been defeated long ago!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Once
I become an Omega Autarch, I’ll be able to bring her back to life.”
Ning lifted up his wine cup, his gaze distant. He could still
remember with absolute clarity the life they had enjoyed together.
Having the chance to bring Yu Wei back to life was the greatest
source of joy he felt.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
knew that actually becoming an Omega Autarch would be extremely
difficult, but at least there wouldn’t be any fatal roadblocks in
the way that could derail him. So long as he was given enough time
and continued to slowly build up his experiences, with a bit of luck
he would sooner or later suddenly gain an epiphany and break through.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
willing to wait as long as it takes. As long as we’re able to meet
again, it’ll all have been worth it.” Ning began to blissfully
fantasize about their reunion. It had been a long time since he was
this happy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly…
beep! “Eh?” Ning sensed something happen. He waved his hand,
producing a dark-red jade talisman within it. This was the Autarch
message-talisman. He was able to sense the location of the other six
through it, and even sense their very auras.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
just now we sensed that your talisman suddenly lost its aura… but
now, the aura is back. Have you created the ‘Truesoul Everlasting’
technique?” Autarch Titanos asked. All six of them had thought that
Ning was dead… but now, Ning’s talisman had suddenly regained its
aura. This caused them to feel rather stunned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
must be remembered that very few of these talismans had ever been
made. Only the Autarchs were in possession of them! No one else but
Ning would be able to bind the one he had been given, which meant
that if the talisman had Ning’s aura about it, the only explanation
was that Ning had to have created the ‘Truesoul Everlasting’
technique.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But…
they had to ask. Just to be sure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
succeeded,” Ning replied.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ahahaha!
Darknorth, I knew you would succeed!” Autarch Ekong said excitedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
from this day forth, you must join the six of us in bearing
responsibility for overseeing and safeguarding all cultivator
civilizations as well as the very Chaosverse itself.” Autarch Bolin
was fairly calm, but his words and his meaning were clear. Now that
Ning was no longer in danger of losing his truesoul, there would no
longer be any limits on his power. For all intents and purposes, he
was now a true peer of the Autarchs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Congratulations,
Darknorth! Our civilization has finally given birth to an Omega Dao
Emperor. You know, I’ve been thinking about this for quite some
time. In the past, the most powerful Emperors were always called
‘Hegemons’, but you became an Emperor through an Omega Dao. What
should we title you?” Autarch Skyfeeder teased in a relaxed manner.
She was in a wonderful mood as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Before
Ning’s sudden rise to power, she had been planning to follow
Autarch Awakener’s path and try to take control over the
Quintessence of the Chaosverse, but she knew that her chances were
slim and that she was almost guaranteed to perish in the attempt.
Now? Now, there was no need for her to take that risk.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
think we should call him Autarch Darknorth!” Autarch Ekong said
immediately.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But…
he’s only an Emperor. If we call him Autarch Darknorth now, what
are we supposed to call him once he actually becomes an Autarch?”
Autarch Stonerule jested.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Well,
by then he’ll be the Lord of Chaos!” Autarch Ekong laughed
loudly. “Hey, Darknorth? Get a move on it! You are the first
creator of an Eternal Omega Dao this Chaosverse has ever seen, and
you were also the first to create a ‘Truesoul Everlasting’
technique. The rest of us would submit to you if you became the one
to bind the Chaosverse, but what if it ends up being someone else? In
the future, there will be many juniors who will make use of your
experiences in treading the path of the Omega Dao. If one of them
ends up becoming an Omega Autarch before you do and then takes
control over our Chaosverse, we’ll be annoyed and you’ll be
embarrassed! But of course, there’ll be nothing we could do by
then.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was speechless for a moment, then snorted in laughter. The Autarchs
were bombarding him with messages. He didn’t even know how he was
supposed to respond!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
title doesn’t really matter. We don’t need to worry about it too
much.” Finally, Ning was able to compose a reply. “And… I think
it is best if we kept this a secret for now. That way, we can deal
the Sithe a nasty, unexpected blow at just the right moment.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
agree. Let’s keep this a secret for now.” Autarch Titanos and the
others all agreed with this proposal.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
that means you have to keep staying in hiding for now, Darknorth.
Ugh. You made such a huge breakthrough, but you still have to be so
low-key about it. That’s no fun,” Autarch Ekong muttered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
wouldn’t say I have to be ‘in hiding’. Given my mastery over
the art of illusions, the Sithe Exalts wouldn’t be able to
recognize me even if I stood right in front of them,” Ning said.
“Later on, I’ll pay a visit to the Quintessence. Let’s chat a
bit then.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
meet at Skyfeeder’s place.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“See
you all at Skyfeeder’s.” The six Autarchs were all in a wonderful
mood. Their civilization had just gained another protector who could
battle by their side as an equal. This meant their entire Chaosverse
had just risen considerably in power… and Ning might one day
advance to become an Omega Autarch!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
short while later, Ning re-initiated the Daomerge process. This time,
things were completely different. Ning didn’t need to make any
preparations at all, he just sat there by his table, drinking his
wine as he initiated the Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
body was perfect, as were the Jindan chaos region and the Dao-tree
inside. Once again, the Flower of Eternity began to bloom.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Flower of Eternity.” The aura of the Daomerge began to flood
outwards, but the seals protecting the Azureflower Estate were able
to mask it all and keep it contained.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
thick, towering Dao-tree was 540,000 meters tall. It gave birth to a
dazzlingly beautiful flower bud which glistened with beads of dew
formed by countless flashing illusions of sword-stances. This was a
Flower of Eternity which was born from the Eternal Omega Sword Dao, a
flower which was far more beautiful than the ones which ordinary
Emperors and Hegemons could produce.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
the prime essences of the Chaosverse descended upon Ning, whispering
in joy and delight. Ning could sense their happiness, which
contrasted with the sorrow they ‘felt’ the last time they
descended upon him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
seems I’ll have to make a visit to the Quintessence if I wish to
make a breakthrough with my heartworld,” Ning mused. His Immortal
energy could easily evolve from Daolord-level energy to Emperor-level
energy, as the amount of energy needed could be provided by the
Azureflower Estate, even though Ning’s Immortal energy was far
purer than that of ordinary Hegemon’s. It was on the level of the
Autarchs! His heartworld, however, would be another matter.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
next breakthrough he made in heartforce would result in his
heartworld becoming incredibly realistic! In addition, it would
expand once more to become the size of an entire realmverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
realmverse-sized heartworld that was semi-real… to form such a
thing would require an absolutely enormous amount of energy. If Ning
simply sat here in the Azureflower Estate and tried to draw in enough
energy from the surrounding area, it would probably result in
destruction on a vast scale that would damage even the Three Realms.
In fact, the entire Flamedragon Realmverse would probably be shaken!
If that happened, there would be no way he could hide his
breakthrough.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
only choice was to go to the Quintessence, where energy was so
plentiful as to be nearly limitless. Only then would Ning be able to
form his heartworld with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
this is what it feels like to be an Emperor?” Ning’s godsense had
evolved as well, gaining a whiff of eternity about it. His godsense
was now as stable and far-reaching as an Autarch’s.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning’s godsense spread out silently and soundlessly, easily
reaching out past the Azureflower Estate and almost instantly
reaching out through space and time to cover the entire Flamedragon
Realmverse!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
was now able to monitor an entire realmverse with but a thought. The
Brightshore Kingdom, the Dao Alliance, Vastheaven Palace, the Three
Realms… all of it was under Ning’s watchful gaze.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was also able to see his friends, his family, and his disciples.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_43_Chapter_012__Fina"></A>
Chapter 12: Reunion</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning’s godsense was omnipresent and all-encompassing. Every single
speck of dust within the Flamedragon Realmverse was plainly visible
to Ning’s gaze. Nothing could escape it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ah,
the Sithe gave up?” Ning was able to quickly scan all of the
Emperors and Daolords within the entire Flamedragon Realmverse. The
only ones present were the ones he knew. Ning worried that the Sithe
would use their techniques to disguise themselves as individuals he
was familiar with, and so he double-checked through karma just to be
safe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
seems Autarch Stonerule scared them off when he captured all of their
spies.” Ning smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
actually was in fact the case. With Autarch Stonerule personally
keeping watch over the Flamedragon Realmverse, how could any spy
escape? As many spies the Sithe sent, as many spies the Autarch
captured. Daolords might be able to confuse him, but they were so
weak that they wouldn’t really be able to find out anything
important. Thus, the Sithe leader Iyerre had chosen to give up and
instead prepare his other plans.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.
Nuwa.” Ning simultaneously reached out via godsense to both his
master and Nuwa.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Disciple.”
Subhuti was overjoyed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
Nuwa finally let out a sigh of relief when she heard Ning’s voice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
created the ‘Truesoul Everlasting’ technique and succeeded in the
Daomerge. I am now an Emperor,” Ning sent. “I’ll be coming back
soon. Don’t worry about me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Truesoul
Everlasting? Emperor? Good, good, good!” Subhuti was unspeakably
excited. His student was now an Omega Emperor!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can finally relax a bit now,” Nuwa said with a laugh. “I’ve
been worried for years that the Sithe might come, and so I kept a
vigilant watch without ever relaxing. Now that you’ve broken
through, Darknorth, things will be much simpler. I don’t think the
Sithe would be able to get anywhere near the Three Realms without you
noticing.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
could sense how excited his master and Nuwa were when he sent them
word. Not just them – Ning himself remained ecstatic!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Time
to recreate an avatar.” Ning rose to his feet. Now that he was an
Emperor, he naturally had to remake his avatars.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">At
his current level, it would be simple to create even Universe-class
treasures. It must be remembered that of the many Universe treasures
which lay scattered throughout the Chaosverse, only a tiny portion
had been created by actual Hegemons, and mostly through luck at that.
The vast majority were created by Autarchs. Autarchs were able to
create entire otherverses, after all! All they had to do was infuse a
weapon with just a hint of their Daos and a new Universe treasure
would have been born.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
truesoul had been crumbling, and so he didn’t dare to expend his
Immortal energy on creating new treasures for himself. Now, however,
creating a Universe treasure was simplicity itself. He could create
new weapons which were close to the Northbow swords in power, then
fill them with the Eternal Omega Sword Dao as well. The Northbow
swords, however, would still be stronger because they were Ning’s
original Lifeblood weapons. He had nurtured them for many years, and
they had grown alongside him. Without question, they shared a higher
level of affinity with Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Newly
created weapons might have the Eternal Omega Sword Dao within them,
but they wouldn’t have as high a level of affinity. Thus, they
would only be ‘close’ to the Northbow swords in power… but of
course, they would still surpass the vast majority of other Universe
treasures. With them in hand, Ning’s avatar would have close to 80%
of Ning’s power! This represented another Autarch-class combatant.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Boom!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
Ning’s estate. Ning had set up a large formation to help him create
his avatar, and he had poured a large number of resources into the
forging. The wind howled through the formation as thunder came
crashing down again and again upon a giant boulder. The left side of
the boulder was covered by boiling red lava, while the right side was
covered by a freezing blue liquid. One side hot, one side cold; Ning
was using a combination of elements for the forging of his avatar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">At
Ning’s current level, treasures were ubiquitous and meaningless.
Weaker Emperors and even Hegemons would generally start with a weak
but flawless avatar, then use time to slowly nurture it and empower
it. Ning, however, elected to start off by using the finest
ingredients. That way, the avatar would grow more quickly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Three
years went past in the blink of an eye. The boulder was now perfectly
round and semi-translucent, and a humanoid figure could be seen
seated inside of it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come
out,” the white-robed Ning barked from next to the boulder. Boom!
The round boulder cracked open, followed by a youth who looked
identical to Ning flying out of it. Moments later, a layer of golden
robes formed across the youth’s body.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Greetings,
real Ning.” The golden-robed Ning bowed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Greetings,
avatar Ning.” The white-robed Ning chortled as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
two shared the same mind and shared the consciousness. Ning was just
playing around by speaking to himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Whoosh. The two simultaneously left the estate-world they were in,
returning to the private room within the Azureflower Estate. When the
white-haired spirit of the estate saw them appear, he immediately
realized that one of them was an Avatar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Time
to go visit Autarch Skyfeeder.” Ning pondered for a moment, then
turned to look at the white-haired elder: “I’m planning to bring
the Azureflower Estate along with me. Any objections?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Emperor,
since you were able to create a ‘Truesoul Everlasting’ technique,
I’m sure that you’ll be able to create the Tenth Chaos Seal with
ease,” the white-haired elder said with a laugh. “My master built
this estate because he wanted to produce a dazzlingly talented
successor… but you, Emperor, are far more impressive than what my
master ever would’ve dared to hope for! You can do whatever you
want to this Azureflower Estate.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Emperor,
the Hegemons and Emperors within the Azureflower Estate have been
trapped here for countless aeons. They might’ve made some mistakes
in the past, but I think it is time to release them,” the
white-haired elder said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Awakener had long ago promised that when this estate finally gave
birth to the mighty successor he hoped for, the bound Hegemons and
Emperors would be granted their release. They had been trapped by
countless oaths and spells that compelled them into a golem-like
existence, but the process was a reversible one that was completely
different from what the Sithe used to ‘tame’ their enemies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Easily
done.” Ning immediately exerted his will, binding and taking
control over the entire Azureflower Estate. He then sent out the
power of his Illusion Sword Dao into the minds of the imprisoned
Hegemons and Emperors, wiping out any and all memories pertaining to
‘Ji Ning’!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
the Hegemons and Emperors regained consciousness, the only thing they
heard was Ning’s voice echoing within their minds: “Immediately
swear lifeblood oaths not to divulge any information at all regarding
the Azureflower Estate, and you’ll be granted your freedom.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Hegemons and Emperors instantly grew excited. Freedom? Their endless
days of imprisonment had finally come to an end? Without hesitating
at all, the Hegemons and Emperors instantly swore the required
lifeblood oaths.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
can go now.” Ning dissolved all the other bindings on them, then
casually ‘tossed’ them out of his Azureflower Estate through
spacetime tunnels, scattering them throughout the Sixteen Realmverses
Alliance!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Get
in here.” Ning then drew the entire Azureflower Estate into one of
his holding treasures. The most valuable thing within the Azureflower
Estate was the Autarch’s stone dais. Even at Ning’s level of
power, it would take him an extremely long period of time and many
precious materials to create a similar dais. He didn’t have the
time to waste on something like that! However, the stone dais was the
nexus of the entire Azureflower Estate; if he wanted to ensure its
marvelous effects remained active, he would have to take the entire
estate along with it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
After the estate disappeared, the local spacetime continuum went back
to normal. The white-robed Ning put his black scabbard on his back,
then used his Spacetime Sword Dao to tear a tunnel straight towards
the Quintessence of the Chaosverse. He was now able to move far
faster than he had in the past; even amongst Autarchs, he ranked
close to the top in speed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now,
back to the Three Realms.” The golden-robed Ning returned to the
Three Realms. This avatar-body was perfectly built; it had been
‘born’ with 50% of Ning’s power, and as time went on it would
improve at a fairly fast rate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Quintessence. Within the massive sea of prime essences.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
a wooden cottage which ‘floated’ within this sea. The seven most
supremely powerful leaders of the cultivator civilizations were
gathered in this cottage – the six Autarchs and Ji Ning. The other
five Autarchs and Ning had all come in person, while Autarch Mogg had
sent his avatar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ahahaha!
I’m in such a good mood right now. Our civilization has finally
gained another Autarch-class figure!” Autarch Ekong roared with
laughter. “I must say, Omega Daos really are awesome. Darknorth,
Titanos told me that your mastery of spacetime is second only to
Mogg’s and Skyfeeder’s? And that your prowess in illusions is
second only to Stonerule’s?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
simply infused the Dao of Spacetime into my Dao of the Sword,” Ning
said. “The only reason they are so strong is because my Eternal
Omega Sword Dao is fueling them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
he infused more and more Daos into his Dao of the Sword, Ning was
beginning to become extremely well-rounded. For example, Autarch
Stonerule was the master of the ‘Illusion Daobirth Essence’;
Ning’s Illusion Sword Dao was naturally inferior to it, but
superior to the techniques of the other Autarchs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Mogg
and Skyfeeder had respectively mastered the ‘Space Daobirth
Essence’ and the ‘Time Daobirth Essence’. Ning’s mastery of
spacetime was second only to the two of them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for actual combat prowess? The Dao of the Sword was a Dao meant for
combat. Even amongst Autarchs, it stood at close to the apex of
power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’re
only skilled in one aspect each; it is very, very hard to gain a
second Daobirth,” Autarch Bolin sighed. “I have spent countless
years ruminating on the nature of life and death, but I’ve only
made modest gains in this regard. You, however, are able to continue
to improve your mastery of many other Daos. I truly do envy you,
Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
you’ve only been training for a short period of time. I imagine
there are many areas which you can still improve on, right?”
Autarch Titanos asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. The Dao of Karma, the Dao of Numerancy, the Dao of
Formations… he had yet to infuse any of them into his Dao of the
Sword. There was indeed a great deal of room for improvement.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
reason why I didn’t want to make my status public was partially
because I want to keep training, under 100x temporal acceleration,
for another 10,000 chaos cycles. That translates into 1,000,000 chaos
cycles of training time, and I should be able to improve
significantly during that period of time. It would put me in a better
position to deal with the Sithe,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hm.
100x temporal acceleration? That’s way too slow. Skyfeeder?”
Autarch Titanos looked at Autarch Skyfeeder. “We’ll have to ask
you to help Darknorth out.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well. I can grant you 1000x temporal acceleration,” Autarch
Skyfeeder said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was surprised and delighted to hear this. He had reached the Autarch
level of power; accelerating time for him was extremely difficult!
Ning himself was able to maintain a rate of 100x while keeping his
power consumption stable. 1000x? That would be far too difficult.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ll
do it here in the Quintessence, where the energy reserves are
limitless. It’ll cost me half of my energy reserves, but I’ll be
able to maintain a rate of 1000x temporal acceleration for you.”
Autarch Skyfeeder looked at Ning, then smiled: “The rest of us have
long ago hit our limits. There’s no way for us to grow stronger,
but you are a different story. If you can improve, you need to do so
as quickly as possible. None of us can be sure when the Sithe will
launch the final war.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Ning nodded. If he was given 1000x temporal acceleration, he would
have more than enough time to achieve his goals.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_43_Chapter_013__Fina"></A>
Chapter 13: A New Type of Energy</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
awesome energy of the prime essences was pooled here in vast,
interconnecting lakes. There was a lake filled with the prime essence
of lightning, a lake filled with the prime essence of destruction…
the different lakes all represented different prime essences, and
together they formed the vast sea.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
power here was truly limitless.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
white-robed youth was standing in the center, surrounded by the lake
filled with the prime essence of water. Boundless amounts of energy
poured towards him and were all absorbed in turn.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Stonerule,
Darknorth’s heartworld is probably on par with yours,” Autarch
Ekong chuckled. The six Autarchs were standing next to each other and
watching from afar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“His
heartworld was formed using the Eternal Omega Sword Dao as the focus.
Of course it is in par with mine!” Autarch Stonerule said. He was
the only one of the six who had an Autarch-class heartworld.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
really envy you guys,” Autarch Titanos sighed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You?
Envy me? I envy you!” Autarch Stonerule smirked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Titanos,
at least you once were a Heartforce Emperor! The rest of us weren’t
able to truly stabilize our heartworlds at all,” Autarch Skyfeeder
said. “And you control the mighty Karma Daobirth Essence; in terms
of power, you are the strongest of us six. How can you have the
audacity to say you envy us? I’m hurt! Hurry up and bring out your
finest food and wine as compensation.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Titanos stared at her wide-eyed. “Are you kidding? It took me ages
to build up my collection. Don’t even think of touching it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Heartforce
Cultivators had to follow a different path in making their
breakthroughs. Those who followed other Daos would reconstitute their
divine power and Immortal energy, but Heartforce Cultivators relied
on expanding their heartworlds. The more stable a heartworld was, the
larger it could become and the more powerful the Heartforce
Cultivator would be.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Once
the entire heartworld became large and stable enough to become
perpetual, the Heartforce Cultivator would be able to step into the
Emperor level! This was why almost all Heartforce Emperors had
reached Hegemonic levels of power. Stabilizing a heartworld enough to
make it eternal was extremely difficult! The ones who succeeded were
almost all Hegemons, with just the tiniest of fractions being at the
Archon level of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Of
course, there were many who dabbled as Heartforce Cultivators.
Bertulu, Winesage, Ning… all of them trained both as normal
cultivators and as Heartforce Cultivators. This was generally true
for all truly talented cultivators!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Early
on, Autarch Skyfeeder had trained as a Heartforce Cultivator as well.
However, after she completed the Daomerge and gained Hegemony via the
Dao of Time, she discovered that her Dao of Time was not a Dao that
could produce a stable, perpetual heartworld. She had thus been
forced to abandon the path of heartforce, and after 108,000 chaos
cycles her unstable heartworld came to a natural end.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Of
the living Autarchs, Autarch Titanos was the most powerful. He had
reached Hegemony via the Dao of Karma, and his Dao of Karma was
capable of allowing his heartworld to become eternal. In other words,
he had been both a Karma Hegemon and a Heartforce Hegemon! Alas, when
he made the breakthrough which enabled him to become an Autarch, his
heartworld wasn’t able to expand alongside any further. He too was
forced to abandon the path of heartforce as he allowed his Dao of
Karma to transform into the Karma Daobirth Essence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Omega
Daos really are the best,” Autarch Titanos sighed. “Only Omega
Daos can be considered truly perfect Daos. Even the heartworlds
formed by them are the best.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
only Omega Daos can allow for truly perfect heartworlds,” Autarch
Stonerule said. His Illusion Daobirth Essence allowed for his
heartworld to reach the Autarch level, but his heartworld still
couldn’t be considered ‘perfect’. This was why he remained
slightly weaker than Autarch Titanos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Azureflower Estate was floating right next to Autarch Skyfeeder’s
wood cottage within the vast sea of prime essences. Autarch Skyfeeder
had begun the process of keeping time accelerated at a rate of 1000x
for the entire Azureflower Estate, while Ning trained within the
second hall inside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had already finished his heartworld breakthrough. Now, it would be a
slow process of training.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Back
in the Three Realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Whew.
I’ve finally finished.” The golden-robed Ning stared at the six
golden swords before him, a pleased smile on his face. He had spent
over fifty thousand years to create these swords, and the materials
he had used were superior to the ones which had been used to create
the original Northbow swords! Back then, Ning had been comparatively
weak; how could he possibly acquire as many precious materials as he
had now? The materials he now had were far superior to what was
available back then. If Ning wasn’t such a perfectionist, he
would’ve been able to complete these six Universe weapons within
just a thousand years.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Unfortunately,
they haven’t been developing by my side for countless aeons like
the Northbow swords. I’ve done as much as I can, but they are still
a teensy bit weaker than the Northbow swords.” The golden-robed
Ning smiled. “Still, they are more than good enough for killing
Sithe. From this day forth, you shall be named… the Northmoon
swords.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swish.
Swish. Swish. All six golden swords flew into the sheath on Ning’s
back. He was now dressed in golden robes, carried golden swords on
his back, and had a body formed from so many precious materials that
it was comparable to Universe treasures in strength.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Time
to expand my heartworld.” The golden-robed Ning took a single step
forwards, then departed from the Three Realms and reappeared within
the Great Dark just outside the Flamedragon Realmverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
the Great Dark was quite distant from the Three Realms, the
golden-robed Ning still released his godsense and kept it spread
across the entire Flamedragon Realmverse. The Sithe danger was
all-encompassing, and Ning didn’t want to let his guard down.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
it begin.” The golden-robed Ning began to expand its heartworld as
well. Here in the Great Dark, he was able to draw upon a large amount
of energy from an extremely wide region with impunity. Ning had
already scanned this part of the Great Dark to ensure that there were
no living creatures here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“At
this rate of absorption, it’ll take me roughly thirty billion years
to finish expanding my heartworld.” The golden-robed Ning sat down
within the endless Great Dark, beginning to slowly train as he
absorbed power from within it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
flowed on like water. Over 120 chaos cycles went past in the blink of
an eye.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
finally completed the Tenth Chaos Seal.” The white-robed Ning had a
smile on his face as he turned to glance at the nearby white-haired
elder: “Autarch Awakener would probably be ecstatic, were he still
alive.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master’s
final wishes have finally been completed.” The white-haired elder
was extremely excited.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
start.” Ning immediately began to use the perfect, complete
technique on himself. The previous azureflower technique he had used
was incomplete and flawed. Autarch Awakener had actually fixed those
flaws in his private version, but had intentionally released a flawed
version in order to separate the gold from the dross.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Out
with the old…” With but a thought, Ning sent his will descending
deep into his sea of consciousness, where an azure flower was slowly
swaying. When Ning’s will descended, the flower suddenly began to
decay and break apart. A moment later, the azure flower had
completely vanished within the sea of consciousness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“…and
in with the new.” Ning began to redeploy the true, complete, and
perfect technique. It was now suitable for even Autarchs to use,
although Ning wasn’t completely sure as to whether or not it could
convert Autarch-level divine power and Immortal energy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Whoosh. Whoosh. The various chaos seals began to manifest within
Ning’s sea of consciousness. Ten of them appeared in succession,
and they began to interlay atop of each other, solidifying into an
azure seed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
azure seed popped open as a sprout emerged from it. The sprout began
to grow, resulting in a series of dazzlingly beautiful leaves
appearing, with a little closed bud appearing in their midst. The bud
slowly grew larger and larger, and it looked as though it was opening
up but not quite ready to fully bloom just yet. The beautiful azure
flower emanated an aura of ineffable mystery, and it was many times
more dazzling than the previous one. It gently swayed there in Ning’s
mind, surrounded by countless green leaves.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was the perfect azureflower technique which arose from the Ten Chaos
Seals.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Strands
of divine power, Immortal energy, and heartforce all flowed into the
azure flower, which was able to easily take them in and then
transform them into a new type of energy. As soon as this new type of
energy was created, Ning felt extremely comfortable.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whooosh.
Under Ning’s control, this new type of energy quickly filled every
inch of his body. Crack! Pop! Ning’s muscles, tendons, and blood
began to change and transform.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was a new form of energy, a perfect form of energy that vastly
surpassed divine power and Immortal ki. As a result, it could be used
to create a more perfect body as well! It could be used for close
combat, could control magic treasures from afar, and was incredibly
strong.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
physical body was quickly remade by this new form of energy. He
withdrew his Immortal ki back into his Jindan chaos region, leaving
only this new energy pulsing through his veins.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is the new type of energy which Autarch Awakener hoped for. I shall
call it…” Ning paused for a moment, then smiled. “Mana.” He
opened his eyes, his entire body feeling clean, refreshed, and
comfortable as the mana flowed through him. This new power, mana, was
a thousand times stronger than Emperor-class divine power or Immortal
ki. When he used mana to execute his Eternal Omega Sword Dao, the
power of his strikes would probably increase by another twenty to
thirty percent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
reason it ‘only’ increased by that amount was because at Ning’s
level, the power of one’s attacks was chiefly determined by one’s
insights into the Dao. Personal strength only played a fairly minor
role. For ‘mana’ to improve an Autarch’s power by 30% was
absolutely incredible!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mana…
so it has finally been completed.” The white-haired elder was very
excited. “Master was unable to perfect it, and so he never even
came up with a real name for this new type of energy. Now, it has
finally been completed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">From
this day forth, ‘mana’ was born. In the future, it would slowly
be spread throughout the Chaosverse and supplant divine power and
Immortal ki as the most important type of energy a cultivator could
train in.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Completing
the Ten Chaos Seals had been fairly easy. Now, Ning would need to go
into deep meditation to work on his other Daos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
360 chaos cycles in secluded meditation, Ning fused the Dao of Light
into his Sword Dao and created the Light Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
430 chaos cycles in secluded meditation, Ning mastered the Dark Sword
Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
3,200 chaos cycles in secluded meditation, Ning learned how to fuse
his Dark Sword Dao together with his Light Sword Dao into a new
technique he named the Cycle Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
11,100 chaos cycles in secluded meditation, Ning fused the Dao of
Formations into his Sword Dao and created the Sword Formation Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
continued to fuse one Dao after another into his Dao of the Sword.
Finally, after 3,900,000 chaos cycles, Ning successfully integrated
his Dao of Karma into the Dao of the Sword and created the Karma
Sword Dao. This took Ning the most time of all to complete.</P>

Chapter 14: The Calm Before the Storm</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning continued to train, and nearly 6 million chaos cycles went past
in the blink of an eye. Autarch Skyfeeder continuously maintained a
rate of 1000x temporal acceleration for the Azureflower Estate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">One
day, the gates to the estate suddenly swung open. The white-robed
Ning walked out, black sheath over his back, and Autarch Skyfeeder
halted the temporal acceleration process.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You’ve
finished?” Autarch Skyfeeder left her wooden cabin and walked
barefoot through the air towards Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you for everything, Autarch Skyfeeder,” Ning said gratefully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
minor matter. The stronger you become, the better off the entire
cultivator civilization shall be,” Autarch Skyfeeder said with a
smile. “And besides, it only took me 6,000 chaos cycles of real
time. That’s nothing to me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
was 6,000 for you, but to me it was 6 million,” Ning said with a
sigh. It truly had been an extremely long period of time for him, and
he had experienced it in its entirety. He had completely focused on
cultivating, having emptied his mind of all other thoughts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the end, he had successfully mastered everything he wanted to master.
The most time-consuming had been the Karma Sword Dao, and it had
taken him nearly 3 million chaos cycles to complete it. Next was the
Numerancy Sword Dao, which should’ve been just as difficult, but
since he had already mastered the Karma Sword Dao he had managed to
speed up the process a bit and had completed it in roughly 2 million
chaos cycles.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Karma
and Numerancy… both were extremely difficult to master. All the
other Daos were simpler, with some taking a few dozen chaos cycles at
most.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
did your training go?” Skyfeeder asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
advanced as much as I can,” Ning said. “Based on my theories, I
should be able to merge all the other Daos into the Autarch-level
Omega Dao, but as of right now I still don’t know what that
breakthrough would look like.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Going
from Emperorhood to Autarchy has always been a difficult task,”
Skyfeeder said with a smile. “Everything shall be as fate wills it.
Based on what I know, the Sithe Chaosverse actually has quite a few
Omega Emperors of the Sword, but all of them have remained trapped at
that level.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Makes
sense.” Ning nodded. He had reviewed the memories of many Sithe
Emperors, and so he had come to learn quite a few things. All
information regarding the Omega Daos themselves had been sealed, but
there had been a few memories regarding the Omega Emperors. This was
why he had come out of cultivation. It was probably impossible to
become an Omega Autarch through secluded meditation. In fact, it was
actually more likely that this breakthrough would come naturally as
one lived an ordinary life! The Dao could be found in all things,
after all, as all things were linked together.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was true that putting yourself in a life-or-death situation could be
even more effective, but then you ran the risk of failing and dying.
The Autarch’s generally wouldn’t put themselves in such great
danger without a very good reason, because their deaths could
destabilize the entire cultivator civilization. In fact, it would
impact the entire Chaosverse itself!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh,
right. I used Autarch Awakener’s original energy-cultivation
technique to create an even more profound one,” Ning said. “Anyone
can train in the new [Azureflower] technique and use it to convert
divine power, Immortal ki, and heartforce into a new type of energy!
This will greatly strengthen both body and soul. Give it a try,
Skyfeeder. Let’s see if the technique is capable of transforming
Autarch-class divine power and Immortal ki.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch-class?”
Skyfeeder felt rather excited at the prospect.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
not sure if it’ll work,” Ning admitted with a chuckle, “But it
was able to transform mine, so perhaps it’ll be able to transform
yours as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
me give it a try,” Skyfeeder said eagerly. At their level, it was
extremely difficult to become even a tiny bit more powerful than
before.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
handed over a jade slip. Skyfeeder accepted it, then memorized the
information within it. This technique was extremely profound, but it
only encompassed ten seals and so the amount of information needed to
express it wasn’t too excessive. It was truly a highly refined and
distilled technique. The Ten Chaos Seals were capable of transforming
into countless other seals, but so long as you memorized the ten
basic seals themselves, you would have memorized the entire
technique.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
the awesome energy of the Quintessence suddenly parted, avoiding the
area around Autarch Skyfeeder as her aura gradually began to change.
Her very skin seemed to flicker with light. Clearly, her body was
being reconstituted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
short while later, she turned to smile at Ning. “It can indeed
convert Autarch-level divine power and Immortal ki, purifying both to
a great degree!” As she spoke, she waved her hand, causing
spacetime around her to twist into knots. She nodded slowly. “When
I use this new energy to activate my Time Daobirth Essence, the power
is increased by 30%. I can also sense that my soul and truesoul are
more stable as well, while my body is now comparable to Universe
treasures.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Previously,
her body had been created through divine power. Now, her body was
created by the far more distilled energy known as ‘mana’, making
it just as tough as a Universe weapon. The same was true for Ning’s
body as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hurry
up and inform Titanos and the others about this amazing technique,”
Autarch Skyfeeder said hurriedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
was planning to, I just wanted to let you try it out first,
Skyfeeder.” Ning smiled, then immediately notified the other five
Autarchs through the message talisman.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Soon,
all the other Autarchs came rushing over. Autarch Mogg, of course,
only sent over his avatar. Ning provided them each with a complete
set of the [Azureflower] technique, and they all found that after
their energies were converted, they were now 30% more powerful than
they had been in the past.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Awakener
had slaved away at this technique for so long… and now you,
Darknorth, have finally completed it.” Autarch Titanos let out a
sigh. “All of us have grown stronger thanks to this technique. Now
that we also have a ‘Truesoul Everlasting’ technique, the
cultivator civilizations shall be able to produce far more Emperors
and Hegemons in the future. Given enough time, we’ll probably see
many new Autarchs as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Time
is exactly what we don’t have,” Autarch Mogg said. “If we had
another ten million chaos cycles, sure; we’d probably have a large
number of new Hegemons and maybe even ten new Autarchs. But I doubt
we’ll be given that chance.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
‘Truesoul Everlasting’ technique would allow some truly talented
figures who had failed the Daomerge due to having made the tiniest of
errors a second chance at the Daomerge. If they succeeded the second
time, they would become Hegemons. The more Hegemons the Chaosverse
had, the more Autarchs would eventually be born as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
no way the Sithe would just sit idly and watch our Chaosverse grow
that much.” Autarch Stonerule frowned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Screw
them. We’ve locked them all away!” Autarch Ekong said. “Sure,
we suspect that they might be able to escape our seal, but even if
they have, the fact that they have still been biding their time
instead of attacking means that they are planning something else.
Let’s start teaching these techniques to as many deserving
cultivators as we can. If we can produce more and more powerful
experts, the Sithe will grow restless and might end up launching
their attacks ahead of schedule, before they are truly ready.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
agree. Let’s force their hand,” Autarch Titanos said. “If they
really are sealed away, we’ll have nothing to fear and can use this
opportunity to grow stronger; if they aren’t, we’ll disrupt their
plans. Either way, we win.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
didn’t matter if the Sithe were truly sealed away or not. They
could not delay the teaching of the ‘Truesoul Everlasting’
technique any longer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“For
Daolords who have failed the Daomerge, the sooner they begin using
the ‘Truesoul Everlasting’ technique the better,” Ning said.
“If they wait until their truesoul actually breaks apart before
trying to fuse the pieces together, it’ll be extremely difficult.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was the creator of the technique and understood it better than anyone
else. He also had a perfect Dao-heart. This was why he had been able
to reverse even the complete collapse of his truesoul! The vast
majority of Daolords, however, had far weaker Dao-hearts than Ning.
If their truesouls collapsed, not even the [Truesoul Everlasting]
technique would necessarily be able to save them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
I don’t think anyone would be dumb enough to actually wait until
their truesoul collapsed before using the technique, right?”
Autarch Titanos said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the others eventually went their separate ways, returning to
their various residences. Ning went back to the Three Realms, living
a life of ease and comfort. He didn’t spend too much time analyzing
the Dao of the Sword. Instead, he emptied his mind and purified his
soul, spending his time on calligraphy, art, and gardening.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
1,200 chaos cycles… Ninedust attempted the Daomerge. He succeeded
on his very first try! He didn’t even need to use the ‘Truesoul
Everlasting’ technique Ning had prepared for him. Ninedust had
built up an incredibly deep and stable foundation before attempting
the Daomerge. Not only had he used a Voidsea Jadeseal, Ning had also
given him many techniques and an Incense-Spirit Fruit!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
quietly went to visit Ninedust by himself, offering his
congratulations. The fact that he was still alive remained a secret!
Ning’s success meant that their Chaosverse had just gained two new
Autarch-class combatants due to Ning having such a powerful avatar.
More importantly, Ning was different from the other Autarchs in that
he was skilled in many different areas. He had his Spacetime Sword
Dao, his Karma Sword Dao, his Cycle Sword Dao, his Numerancy Sword
Dao, and more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
made Ning practically flawless, able to cope with any situation. Two
new Autarch-class combatants who had no flaws at all… once they
were unleashed, they would definitely give the Sithe a nice big
‘surprise’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
congratulating Ninedust, Ning went back to the Three Realms and
continued his relaxed life. The Otherverse Lords and Hegemons in
every single realmverse were all granted the ‘Truesoul Everlasting’
technique, and they were told to secretly teach the technique to
deserving Daolords who had failed the Daomerge. Without exception,
they were admonished to try and keep this hidden as best they could.
The longer they could hide this from the Sithe, the better!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
slowly continued to flow on… but roughly 3,100 chaos cycles after
Ning’s return to the Three Realms, the peace within the Chaosverse
was shattered at last!</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_43_Chapter_015__Fina"></A>
Chapter 15: The Engine of Destruction</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
Autarch Titanos’ residence. Nine strange parts were hovering in the
air within his private study, and Autarch Titanos was frowning
thoughtfully as he analyzed them. Even the two fleshy antennae on top
of his head were drooping in a pensive manner.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Titanos had spent more time studying and understanding Sithe
treasures than anyone else in this entire Chaosverse! He knew more
than any other cultivator, and he had created quite a few weapons
based off of those treasures, some of which were suitable for
cultivators to use. Autarch Titanos was eagerly anticipating the
creation of even more. “Harrumph! We are no longer the cultivators
of old. We have many unique weapons of our own now, and even our
ordinary Emperors are far more difficult to deal with than the ones
of the past.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Each
Autarch followed a different, separate path. Autarch Titanos was the
master of the Karma Daobirth Essence, which was arguably the most
difficult Dao aside from the Omega Daos. As a result, he was the
best-suited for ruminating on difficult, complex mechanisms. He spent
his time creating many unusual weapons, allowing their Hegemons and
Emperors to unleash tremendous power in battle This would make it
much more difficult for the Sithe to slay the Emperors of this
Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
he could raise the overall power of their forces, they would have a
greater chance at gaining victory in the upcoming war… and the
countless aeons he had spent in research had resulted in many
splendid achievements indeed!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
The two fleshy antennae on top of Autarch Titanos’ head suddenly
shot up straight, and a sharp look flickered through his eyes. “This
is…” Autarch Titanos could vaguely sense that the entire
Quintessence was somehow in grave danger. An invisible, destructive
force had suddenly cast a shadow over the entire Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Destruction…
the destruction of the entire Chaosverse?” Autarch Titanos turned
slightly pale. “The source of this destruction is coming from that
direction!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Long
ago, the Quintessence had sent a similar warning to all of the
Autarchs, ensuring that they knew how dangerous the ‘Sithe’ were.
Now, for the second time, they had received this warning!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Could
we be facing a new threat, something aside from the Sithe?” Autarch
Titanos was slightly panicked. There was no way the Quintessence’s
warning could possibly be in error, and so he abandoned all of his
experiments and immediately exited his laboratory, then tore a tunnel
through spacetime towards the source of the danger.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
handsome but sorrowful-looking white-haired Autarch Bolin was
standing in a wild, untamed land. He stared at the earthen dwelling
before him and the mortals inside of it. There were a total of three
children within.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
these kids are rather interesting. Are you ready? Ready to transcend
life and death and become a brand new, powerful type of creature?”
Autarch Bolin looked at the oldest child, the nine-year-old, with a
hint of anticipation in his eyes. He had just prepared a new…
experiment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Bolin had spent many aeons treading the line between life and death,
scrying the mysteries of this great cycle. He hadn’t come close to
mastering the Samsara Daobirth Essence, but he had other plans he was
focused on.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
wanted to create a truly perfect lifeform! The Aeonians had been one
of his many experiments, but they weren’t truly perfect. He wanted
to create perfect beings which were on par with Sourcewalkers and
Chaos Primordials in might. If the cultivators could produce a large
number of ‘perfect’ beings and allowed them to propagate, they
would have gained a powerful new army which made battling against the
Sithe easier.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly,
Autarch Bolin’s face turned pale. “Danger?” He immediately
abandoned his new experiment. He could sense on a subconscious level
that the entire Quintessence was shivering in terror, as though a
terrifying destructive force had just appeared in front of it which
could tear it apart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
prime essences of the Chaosverse were awesome and powerful, but they
were also quite weak. This was because they weren’t truly sentient,
nor were they able to defend themselves. Thus, they had to rely upon
the Autarchs and the cultivators to protect them against the Sithe.
Once the cultivators were defeated, the Quintessence would be like
meat on the chopping block for the Sithe to butcher as they pleased.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Autarch Bolin immediately tore through spacetime and departed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the Three Realms. Brightheart Island. Ning was seated facing Autumn
Leaf. The two were playing chess, while Brightmoon was watching from
nearby.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hm.”
Autumn Leaf pondered her next move.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
held a small black gourd in his hand. Every so often, he would take a
swig from it. After Autumn Leaf finally made her move, he casually
made his own move as well. After mastering the Numerancy Sword Dao,
Ning was arguably the number one master of Numerancy and divinations
in the entire Chaosverse. Perhaps Autarch Titanos, who was the master
of the Karma Daobirth Essence, might be on par with him, but no one
else! Chess? Of course Ning couldn’t play too seriously. If he did,
it’d ruin the whole game.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Aunt
Autumn Leaf, that’s not right! If you do that, you are going to be
in serious trouble.” Brightmoon shook her head, reaching out to
prevent Autumn Leaf from making the move she wanted to make.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
what should I do next?” Autumn Leaf immediately pulled her chess
piece back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ahem!
For a bystander to remain silent is the way of gentlemen.” Ning
glanced sideways at Brightmoon, then looked at Autumn Leaf. “And
since when did we allow take-backs in chess?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
didn’t put my piece down yet. It doesn’t count as a take-back,”
Autumn Leaf said immediately.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“And
I’m not a gentleman, I’m a woman!” Brightmoon rebutted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Speechless,
Ning chose to continue drinking his wine instead of arguing. The two
of them would wrack their brains over every move while he just played
casually, but he’d still win nine out of ten games. This was on
purpose, of course. If you won every time, who would be willing to
play with you?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brightmoon,
when are you planning to begin your Daomerge?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
anytime soon,” Brightmoon said. “It’ll definitely be after
Patriarch Subhuti.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“After
we finish this game of chess, I need to talk to you about something,”
Ning said. He was planning to transmit the ‘Truesoul Everlasting’
technique to her. Right now, they were extremely cautious and careful
in transmitting this technique, generally only teaching it to the
most incredibly talented Daolords of the Fourth Step. In each case,
they would require the Daolord to swear a lifeblood oath which would
cover many things.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">For
example, the Daolord could only attempt the Daomerge in a place where
his or her aura would be completely hidden. That way, in the event
that the Daolord failed the Daomerge and had to use the ‘Truesoul
Everlasting’ technique to repair his truesoul, no one would be the
wiser. In fact, no one would even know that he had attempted the
Daomerge! This was the best way to keep things secret.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
short, they did everything they could to keep this hidden from the
Sithe. They’d hide it for as long as they could! They knew that
once the Sithe spies found out that the cultivators possessed the
‘Truesoul Everlasting’ technique, they would immediately be able
to guess that Ning was still alive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
was really nothing they could do about this. They couldn’t keep the
‘Truesoul Everlasting’ technique hidden from all cultivators just
to ensure that Ning’s continued survival remained a secret, right?
This was a technique which would strengthen civilization as a whole.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning suddenly frowned midway through his next move. Given the power
of his godsense and his connection to the prime essences of the
Chaosverse, he was naturally able to sense a terrifying danger
suddenly manifest… a danger which could very well destroy the
entire Quintessence itself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
going on? Has another civilization aside from the Sithe invaded us as
well?” Ning turned pale.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
The golden-robed Ning which had been roving the outside realm almost
instantly tore through spacetime and hurried towards the source of
the danger. The golden-robed avatar now had only 80% of the true
Ning’s power, but it must be remembered that when compared, Ning
was now at least 60% stronger than he was back when his truesoul was
crumbling! This was because he had first gained Emperor-class energy,
then transformed it into mana! After another six million chaos cycles
of cultivation, he had infused many new Daos into his Sword Dao. As a
result, the avatar-Ning was now much more powerful than ‘Daolord
Ning’ had been.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
terms of raw power, Ning was ranked at the top of the list amongst
the Autarchs. Even Autarch Titanos was slightly inferior to him, as
Titanos wasn’t as well-rounded as Ning was! Ning’s avatar was
terrifyingly strong.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
weaker cultivators felt nothing at all; the only people in the
Chaosverse who sensed the danger were Ning and the six Autarchs, and
all of them arrived. Autarch Mogg sent his avatar as he needed to
stand guard over the Sithelands. The other five Autarchs all left
their avatars in the Sithelands and came in person. Ning was
extremely confident in his own power, and so he sent his avatar as
well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, Autarchs would generally send their avatars to deal with any
dangerous situations. This was because if the avatar died, they could
easily remake a new one! If their true bodies died, the Autarchs
would be dead for good.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiiip.
Ning tore through spacetime and arrived in a place within the Great
Dark. He immediately saw Autarch Ekong.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
The muscular Autarch Ekong was dressed in his usual loose robes. He
had been the first to arrive, as he had been the closest to this
location. Ning was the second to arrive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
going on?” Ning strode through the void towards him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
no one here save us.” Autarch Ekong pointed off into the distance.
“The danger is coming from over there.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
could sense it as well. Far off in the distance, there was an
enormous silver vortex that was slowly swiveling in place. This
silver vortex was so gigantic that it was vastly greater than an
ordinary realmverse in size. Ning was able to see through to the very
center of the silver vortex, where he saw a giant, ancient
sphere-shaped object that was the size of a realmverse. It was
riddled with countless holes, but Ning was unable to see through them
to the insides of this sphere. All he could sense was that it was
filled with boundless danger.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
giant sphere simply sat there in the darkness, furiously devouring
the primordial chaos around it. The silver vortex around it
represented all of the energy which it was draining from the
surrounding area. Even the endless darkness itself was being
swallowed up by it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Just
looking at the thing caused Ning and Autarch Ekong to feel a sense of
dread.</P>

RWX's Thoughts</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">I
kept silent the previous release because I wanted to see what
everyone's reaction was to 'mana'. In raws the term was <FONT FACE="Ovo">元
</FONT>, which is basic AF to use a modern colloquialism. Other
novels call it 'Yuan power' or 'essence power' or 'Origin power'. I
ended up deciding on mana because mana is just as 'basic' as <FONT FACE="Ovo">元
</FONT>is in Chinese... but it also shares the commonality in that in
the game(s) which made it popular, such as MTG or Diablo, all spells
are powered by mana (albeit colored mana in MTG), much like how in DE
it shall replace Immortal ki, divine power, godsense, etc. and be the
'one true energy'. That, and I thought it'd be a nice little
throwback to Ning's origin from Earth; we don't get nearly as many of
those as I'd like. What do you all think?</P>

Chapter 16: Going Inside</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Where
did this thing come from?” Ji Ning stared at the titanic sphere
located at the very center of that giant silver vortex. At his level,
he was able to see at a glance that this terrifying celestial object
was the source of the threat to the entire Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Everything
within the Chaosverse, be it the emptiness of space, the endless
Great Dark, or the countless living beings, were all part of the
Chaosverse. In life and in death, they remained parts of the
Chaosverse. Their deaths would not weaken the Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However…
if their energies were somehow swallowed away, this would in fact
harm the prime essences! The Sithe, for example, wanted to kill as
many Autarchs and Hegemons as possible, then draw away their truesoul
fragments and cause the prime essences to weaken. After the
Chaosverse was weakened to a sufficient extent, the Sithe would have
a chance at binding and controlling the entire Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
things were part of the Chaosverse. Destroying and devouring the
souls of ordinary mortals would also weaken the Chaosverse, but doing
this would be too slow and inefficient! The Sithe soul-eater
technique could only be used to swallow truesouls that had been
destroyed in extremely close proximity. It would probably take the
Sithe tens of millions of chaos cycles to slowly do this to the
countless living beings in a single realmverse!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was why they had chosen to act against the Autarchs and the Hegemons
instead. And now? This hole-riddled, realmverse-sized sphere was
swallowing away even the darkness of the Great Dark! It was somehow
devouring the darkness in a way that completely destroyed it, causing
the Chaosverse to forever lose its energy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
wasn’t an issue in the short term, but given enough time it would
cause the Chaosverse to suffer grave injuries, and possibly even
weaken the prime essences enough for the Sithe to bind them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Where
the hell did this terrifying celestial object come from? Who made
it?” Ning was puzzled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Eventually,
the other Autarchs began to arrive as well. All of them stared at the
behemoth sphere for a long period of time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Its
enormous and riddled with holes, almost like a beehive,” Autarch
Titanos said. “Its powerful aura reminds me of the aura of the
Sithe heartlands! It was that very aura of danger which made us
hesitate to go inside and instead opt to seal it away. This thing
reminds me of it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
but there are some differences between it and the Sithe heartlands,”
Autarch Stonerule said. “The Sithe heartlands hold an energy
generator which powers many of their Daoguard Towers. This mysterious
hive, however, is continuously swallowing and destroying the energy
of the surrounding area! The more it swallows, the more our
Chaosverse loses and the weaker our Chaosverse becomes.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
did it suddenly appear here? There’s no way our Chaosverse would’ve
naturally given birth to such a terrifying thing,” Autarch
Skyfeeder said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is a Sithe trump card,” Autarch Titanos said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sithe?” Ning and the others all turned to look at Autarch Titanos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Are
you absolutely certain?” Ning asked. “Can it possibly be from
another civilization?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is Sithe,” Autarch Titanos said with absolute certainty. “I’ve
spent countless aeons analyzing Sithe weaponry. As soon as I took a
close look at it, I could tell that this behemoth hive is actually a
single vast weapon! It was created for the express purpose of
devouring and destroying the energy of the Chaosverse, which would
cause the Chaosverse to weaken.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
can anyone create such a gigantic, powerful weapon?” Autarch Bolin
asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is overwhelming. I can feel that it is on a completely different
level from Exalt-class Daoguard Towers. Not even the strongest Sithe
weapons we faced during the Dawn War could even come close to
comparing with this thing.” Autarch Mogg found it just as hard to
believe that this realmverse-sized object was a manufactured weapon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sithe heartlands contain an energy generator which powers their
Daoguard Towers,” Autarch Titanos said solemnly, “While this
titanic, terrifying weapon also holds an energy generator within it,
which is what allows it to function and forcibly tear away energy
from the Chaosverse and devour it. That’s why I said it reminded me
of the Sithe heartlands.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the others were all rather shocked. The Sithe heartlands had been
created at incredible cost. This thing before them was apparently on
the same level of power?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sithe have been biding their time for countless aeons. We should’ve
expected their first move to be an extraordinary one,” Autarch
Bolin said with a grim smile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ve
been making preparations ever since the last war concluded. It seems
the Sithe have kept themselves busy as well,” Autarch Stonerule
agreed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
them come. We’ll handle anything they can dish out.” A murderous
look flickered through Autarch Mogg’s eyes. The danger which had
just manifested before them had stirred all of the Autarchs,
awakening their combative instincts which had lain dormant for so
long.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
final war against the Sithe had yet to truly begin, but the Sithe had
already made an absolutely terrifying opening gambit!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
have to destroy it, and we need to move fast,” the golden-robed
Ning said. “But… how? I can vaguely sense that this behemoth hive
is filled with tremendous danger. Even if all seven of us go, we
still wouldn’t necessarily be able to successfully deal with it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
behemoth hive is definitely dangerous.” Autarch Titanos glanced at
the other six. “And what if the Sithe suddenly launch the war after
our avatars go inside and then are somehow trapped? Only half of our
total combat power would be available to fight in the war, and we
could very well be defeated.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
can’t all go inside! We need to be ready for the war to breakout.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
many of us should go inside?” The Autarchs and Ning began to
discuss this matter.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Adding
in their avatars, they had a total of fourteen Autarch-class
combatants! Based on their previous experiences, they had to have at
least ten Autarch-class combatants in order to keep a handle on the
situation and not be caught flat-footed. However, given how long the
Sithe had been biding their time, it was entirely possible that they
would unleash something completely unexpected. Even ten Autarch-class
combatants wouldn’t necessarily be enough.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
send in two to take a look,” Autarch titanos said. “That way, we
can still be at close to peak power if the war breaks out.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Who
should go inside?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
go inside!” Ning was the first to volunteer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You,
Darknorth?” Autarch, Titanos, Bolin, and the others all looked
towards Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
stared at the enormous silver vortex and the behemoth hive at its
heart. “We don’t know anything about what this thing holds or
what dangers might be present. We’ll probably have to destroy the
entire thing in order to stop it! Of the seven of us, I am the most
well-rounded and am the best at dealing with unknown dangers. I have
some skill in every single Dao.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Titanos
and the others all nodded in agreement. Ning was very well-rounded
and was quite skilled in every Dao. He had mastered even the Karma
Sword Dao and the Numerancy Sword Dao. He was indeed the best of them
in dealing with unexpected dangers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well.” They all nodded in agreement. Without question, Darknorth
was going to be one of the two to go inside. He would be given the
primary responsibilities for destroying this behemoth hive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
go as well.” Autarch Mogg smiled. “I’m the master of the Space
Daobirth Essence and have the keenest understanding of how space
works. I’m the best at scouting out nearby dangers.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">None
of the other five Autarchs disputed this. They all agreed once more.
Everyone knew where their respective skills lay and who would be most
effective in dealing with this behemoth hive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
other Autarchs should all return to their respective stations and
prepare for war to break out at any time,” Autarch Titanos said.
“Darknorth and Mogg, send in your avatars! I’ll stay here to
stand guard and keep a watch on things, to prevent anything
unexpected from happening.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is settled.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and Mogg had both sent their avatars to this place, and so all they
had to do was make some minor preparations before flying together
towards that silver vortex. As for the other five Autarchs, they
watched from afar as Ning and Mogg flew off into the distance. The
five only departed after seeing the two safely enter the vortex.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
hope they can destroy that thing,” Bolin said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Even
if they cannot, they have to stop it from functioning,” Autarch
Titanos chuckled. “I’m confident in Darknorth’s skills. Even if
he fails, he should be able to get a clear sense of what lies within
that behemoth hive and how it operates.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right.”
Ekong, Skyfeeder, and Stonerule all nodded. They could all vaguely
sense that after 6 million chaos cycles of training, Darknorth was
now most likely the strongest of them all… and he was also the most
well-rounded!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Space
twisted around the golden-robed Ning and the tall, thin, azure-robed,
scale-faced Mogg as they continued to fly forwards through a
dimensional tunnel that led into the silver vortex.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
gigantic silver vortex was filled with apocalyptic power. Only
Exalt-class beings would be able to just barely be capable of
surviving this place. However, Mogg’s dimensional tunnel was quite
stable and it brushed aside all the power which clashed against it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Almost
there.” They continued to fly through the silver vortex, the
behemoth hive slowly growing in size as they moved closer and closer
towards it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
countless tunnels covering the hive were dark and unfathomably deep.
All forms of energy which entered those tunnels vanished without a
trace, never to be seen again within this Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Whoosh. Ning and Mogg both descended towards the surface of the
behemoth hive. The hive was protected by layers of frenzied,
semi-translucent energy which furiously assaulted the two of them,
but they were brushed away before they even got close. Ning and Mogg
landed on the icy surface simultaneously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
enormous weapon, the size of an entire realmverse, was so vast that
ordinary Hegemons and Emperors couldn’t even see it in its
entirety. Ning’s gaze transcended spacetime, and so he was able to
see it clearly.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_43_Chapter_017__Fina"></A>
Chapter 17: Autarch-Class Creatures</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning and Mogg were in no hurry to immediately rush inside the
behemoth hive. Instead, they flew across its surface and began to
inspect it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and Mogg were able to cross hundreds of billions of kilometers almost
instantly, and they continued to fly for a full hour as they reviewed
the hive up close. The hive’s surface was a mixture of dark black
mixed with silvery white. Black was the main color, but some strands
of silvery-white energy had crystallized in certain regions. As for
the tunnels, they ranged from being a hundred kilometers wide to a
trillion kilometers wide.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and Mogg came to a halt and descended upon the surface once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
can’t see anything from outside,” Ning said. “It seems we’ll
still have to go inside to take a look.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
senses are telling me that the interior isn’t uniform in nature. We
can’t simply blink in and out of it,” Mogg said. “Our only
choice is to accept the risk of flying inside.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
two knew that the insides of this behemoth hive were undoubtedly very
dangerous. The gloomy darkness was capable of swallowing all forms of
energy. Any godsense or heartworld projection energies would be
swallowed as well, making it impossible to scry what was inside. They
had been hoping to first learn what they would be facing, but they
still knew nothing after that long inspection of the surface.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go inside.” They chose an ordinary-looking tunnel that was a
hundred million kilometers in diameter. There were countless tunnels
like this across the surface of the behemoth hive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and Mogg stood at the edges of the tunnel, staring downwards. It was
still furiously swallowing energy at an astounding pace. Ning and
Mogg exchanged a glance, then flew downwards.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
They quickly began to descend into the dark depths.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
golden-robed Ning held two Northmoon swords at the ready as he began
to rapidly descend into the abyss, while Autarch Mogg wielded a pair
of long sabers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
wonder we couldn’t just blink inside.” Ning glanced at the walls
of the abyss. Sphere-shaped spacetime bubbles dotted the walls, each
of them ranging from ten thousand kilometers to over a hundred
million kilometers in size. These spacetime bubbles simply hung
there, connected to each other while channeling an enormous amount of
power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
are there so many spacetime bubbles here?” Autarch Mogg was
puzzled. “Let me see what happens when I destroy one of them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Be
careful.” They had come here to destroy this thing. Ning naturally
wouldn’t object to Mogg’s suggestion.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break!”
Autarch Mogg let out a loud shout, sending out a mighty surge of
energy that transformed into waves of folded dimensional attacks that
could be seen with the naked eye. The attacks slammed against a
distant spacetime bubble, causing the bubble to tremble for a few
moments before bursting apart. However, nothing was held within it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
nearby, a new spacetime bubble appeared out of nowhere. This one was
exactly the same size as the previous one, roughly ten million
kilometers in diameter.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
broke one, so this thing made a new one.” Autarch Mogg frowned. “I
can see at least a million of these bubbles. I can’t imagine how
many the entire behemoth hive holds! I can sense how all these
spacetime bubbles are linked to each other, channeling a powerful
force which is used to furiously swallow everything within the
outside world.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
attack at full power and see if we can wreck them,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Mogg nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Both
of them were searching for clues for dealing with the hive. They
could easily tell that the countless spacetime bubbles were important
tools in allowing the hive to devour energy from the outside world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
golden-robed Ning manifested three heads and six arms. Six Northmoon
swords in hand, Ning began to furiously attack the surrounding
spacetime bubbles with abandon via his Spacetime Sword Dao.
Sword-light flashed everywhere, causing the various bubbles to be
instantly destroyed on contact.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
also expanded his Sword Dao Domain to cover a large radius,
reinforcing it with the power of his heartworld projection! Alas, the
spacetime bubbles were so tough that Ning had to attack with his
Spacetime Sword Dao if he wished to break them apart quickly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Mogg manifested six arms as well. He used his Space Daobirth Essence
with his six sabers, furiously destroying spacetime around him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! The two worked together to crush everything before them,
almost instantly destroying over ten thousand spacetime bubbles. But…
it was like they were swimming through a vast ocean, with each wave
producing countless new bubbles.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
were able to destroy ten thousand spacetime bubbles in a flash, but
the gloomy, dark walls of the abyss simply rippled slightly before
manifesting ten thousand new bubbles. It would create as many as were
destroyed!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Halt,”
Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
should we halt?” Autarch Mogg glanced at Ning, puzzled. “Even if
we can’t destroy the spacetime bubbles faster than they are being
created, at least we are forcing this thing to use up more energy. If
we continue, we might be able to eventually run it dry.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
shook his head. “It is useless. I can sense that the power of the
destroyed bubbles is being completely absorbed by the hive, which
then uses them to recreate new bubbles. The hive isn’t losing a
single shred of energy during the destruction/creation process.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?”
Autarch Mogg was shocked. The cycle of destruction and rebirth didn’t
cost any energy at all? “Then what should we do?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“These
spacetime bubbles are nothing more than a tool this hive uses,”
Ning said. “There are other things that matter far more, such as
its energy generator! If we can destroy its energy generator, it’ll
be finished.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
this thing is the size of a realmverse. How are we supposed to find
it?” Mogg was worried. Realmverses were enormous in size. If they
tried to search without any clues, even ten chaos cycles of time
wouldn’t be enough! It must be remembered that this thing was
continuously devouring energy from the outside world, causing the
Chaosverse to gradually weaken. They couldn’t afford to waste any
time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
said, “Give me some time. I can find it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Mogg blinked in surprise and delight. He fell silent, not wanting to
disturb Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
carefully scrutinized the countless spacetime bubbles around them. It
must be remembered that Ning had infused the Dao of Formations into
his Sword Dao, and so he was now highly attuned to how formations
functioned and operated. These countless spacetime bubbles were
clearly part of a single vast formation of incredible complexity!
What he needed to do was find the critical points of this formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
wasn’t strong enough to create or set down a formation of such
magnitude, but by inspecting how it functioned he would still have a
chance to find its critical points.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
continued inspecting for roughly the time needed to boil a kettle of
tea. He then turned to Autarch Mogg and said, “Follow me.” Ning
reached out to cover Mogg and himself with his Spacetime Sword Dao,
then began to advance at high speed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Have
you already found the energy generator for the hive?” Mogg was
surprised.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
not sure, but I’ve definitely found one of its critical points,”
Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
continuously warped through spacetime, advancing at high speed.
Suddenly… whoosh! An enormous, fiery-red tail tore through
spacetime, instantly appearing right in front of Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Huh?”
Ning’s face changed as he immediately brandished his Northmoon
sword, delivering a crushing blow.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!!!
An enormous explosion rang out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
could sense a surge of tremendous power pass through his Northmoon
sword and into his own body. He couldn’t help but stumble several
steps backwards, and a look of shock appeared on his face. His Sword
Dao was the most offensively lethal Dao there was. How was it that he
could actually be knocked backwards in a frontal collision?!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Grr…
you finally come!” A deep voice rang out, followed by a towering
form appearing and drawing near.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and Mogg both stared at this new creature. It looked humanoid but was
so towering as to seem like a mountain! Its entire body was covered
with fiery scales, and it had a pair of sharp claws for hands, while
its lower legs were reverse-jointed. It also had a long tail ! It had
a triangular head and a pair of cold, murderous eyes. An aura of
flames was blazing across its entire body.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
a powerful creature!” Autarch Mogg immediately sent mentally,
“Darknorth, this has to be an Autarch-class void dweller.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch
class?” Ning was secretly shocked. His own ‘Stonefire Pearl’
had been acquired from an Autarch-class lifeform the Autarchs had
slain. These creatures were incredibly rare, and they were viewed as
the kings of the Infinite Void outside the Chaosverses.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
been waiting you for a long, long time,” the towering monstrosity
rumbled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Waiting
for us for a long time?” Both Ning and Mogg were rather puzzled.
But right at this moment…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Two more powerful auras warped through spacetime and appeared
before them. Ning and Mogg turned slightly pale as they stared at the
two similarly massive creatures which had arrived. The first was a
furry humanoid who only had a single eye and who radiated a vile,
evil aura, while the second was something that looked like a dragon
turtle. The dragon turtle was the largest creature of the three.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
finally made it.” The tall, skinny cyclopean creature spoke in a
shrill voice. “We’ve been waiting for ages.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
three of us but only two of them. How are we supposed to divide them
up?” the dragon turtle complained in a booming voice.</P>

Chapter 18: The First Clash</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
got here first! One of them is mine,” the towering creature with
fiery scales said as it stared at Ji Ning and Mogg.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
only got here a half-second before we did, and you’ve already
attacked them. Clearly, however, these two cultivator leaders are
completely unharmed. Why the hell should you get a second chance?”
the cyclopean creature argued shrilly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Are
you trying to start a fight, One Eye?” The flames surrounding the
fiery-scaled creature suddenly rose higher. Clearly, it was quite
offended by this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Do
you think I’m afraid of you?” the cyclopean creature laughed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Heh,
you two are already squabbling before the battle has even begun! So
far, only two of the local cultivator leaders have arrived. Let’s
just kill them first! I bet the cultivators will then send more, at
which point we can get rid of a third one, right?” The dragon
turtle roared, “Let’s attack and kill these two!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three Autarch-class lifeforms spoke in thunderous voices, not
disguising their intentions in the slightest. Ning and Mogg exchanged
a glance upon hearing all of this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
sounds as though they have to kill a total of three cultivators,”
Ning sent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch-class
void dwellers aren’t easily managed. The Sithe probably reached
some sort of a deal with them,” Autarch Mogg sent back. “They can
be considered the true rulers of the vast Infinite Void which lies
beyond our Chaosverse, and they undoubtedly had to slaughter a path
through their fellows in order to reach their current heights. They
hardly understand the Dao at all, but they have such incredibly
powerful bodies that they are very difficult to deal with. Killing
three of them will be very hard!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
understand.” Ning nodded. All void dwellers possessed bodies that
were far stronger than even the bodies of Chaos Primordials… and
the Autarch-class ones were even more insanely powerful! What made
them truly dangerous was that they had so little understanding of the
Dao that the ‘rejection’ they suffered upon entering this
Chaosverse was almost meaningless to them, as they could hardly use
the Dao to begin with! They still remained terrifying forces to be
reckoned with.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
previously managed to kill two of these Autarch-class void dwellers,
but that was when we surrounded and outnumbered them,” Autarch Mogg
sent mentally. “There are only two of us right now. This is going
to be very difficult.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
chat with them first and see if there is a way we can avoid
fighting.” Ning could also sense the threat which these three
Autarch-class creatures posed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Gentlemen!”
Ning chuckled. “Why must we fight to the death? This war is a war
between us and the Sithe. Why don’t the three of you just leave our
Chaosverse and go back to your Infinite Void? Stay far away from the
war. I imagine it is unlikely the Sithe would be able to capture you
a second time. In fact, I’m surprised they captured you at all!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.
We let our guards down,” the cyclopean creature said coldly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
we escaped, the Sithe can forget about capturing us again.” The
fiery-scaled creature gritted its teeth, then howled furiously, “But
what’s the point of saying all this? Do you really think you have a
way to let us leave?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
dragon turtle stared intently at Ning as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was true that the three held no grudges against the local cultivators
at all. If they could return home safely, they would be more than
willing to do so. They might’ve been captured by the Sithe and
forced to accept some tasks, but they weren’t bound by lifeblood
oaths! Or, to be precise, there was no way for them to swear
lifeblood oaths at all. They were completely different from both the
cultivators and the Sithe!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">For
both the cultivators and the Sithe, both the Dao and the Dao-heart
were extremely important. All of them trained from young as
cultivators, slowly rising in power thanks to the Dao. These void
dwellers, however, were evil, chaotic, and berserk creatures by
nature. They didn’t even have Dao-hearts per se; the only law they
understood was the law of survival. They would fight to the death,
and the strong would live while the weak would die! They followed
only the most brutish and barbaric of ‘laws’, the law of
strength.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was much like how weak mortals were completely incapable of swearing
‘lifeblood oaths’ without the help of something like an
oathstone. They could swear until they were blue in the face, but
they would never have to face the fear of their truesouls being
destroyed. The same was true for these void dwellers! It was
impossible for them to swear lifeblood oaths.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thus,
the Sithe generally had two options when dealing with the void
dwellers they captured. They could either torture them into insanity,
or they could slowly manage to tame them! However, it was virtually
impossible to tame an Autarch-class void dweller, and so the only
real choice was to either torture them or to negotiate with them as
equals and come to an agreement.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
don’t the three of you just leave this hive?” Ning probed. “After
that, you can just leave our Chaosverse. I don’t think anyone would
or could stop you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Leave
the hive?” The cyclopean creature let out a cold laugh. “This is
a place which can only be entered, not exited! The only way to leave
is for the Sithe to voluntarily let you leave. If you don’t believe
me, try for yourselves! Let’s see if the two of you can leave or
not.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
no way out?” Ning was startled. Neither he nor Mogg had encountered
any impediments at all as they flew into the deep abyss.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Coming
in is easy, but leaving is impossible,” the cyclopean creature
said. “The three of us have tried to leave countless times, but
there is no way out!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had the feeling that the creature wasn’t lying. There wasn’t a
need to lie over something like this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Well,
that’s easily solved,” Ning said. “Once we destroy this thing
from the inside, we’ll be able to leave.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Destroy
it? You two?” the titanic fiery-scaled creature boomed mockingly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
should at least let us give it a try. Maybe we’d succeed,” Ning
said. “Just stand there and watch! You can always attack us later,
if we really aren’t able to destroy it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
goal was simple. He wanted for these three Autarch-class void
dwellers to not cause him any trouble as he tested out methods for
destroying this behemoth hive. It must be remembered that these
creatures had tremendous brutish force, but they couldn’t compare
to the cultivators when it came to understanding the Dao. There was
no way they could unlock the mysteries behind such an intricately
designed weapon, but that didn’t mean Ning and Mogg couldn’t do
so either.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Impossible.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
way.” The other two Autarch-class void dwellers instantly rejected
Ning’s suggestion.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Cultivator
leaders, let me speak plainly with you,” the dragon turtle said
coldly. “Long ago, we came to an agreement with the Sithe after our
capture. We made them certain promises. The first promise was that we
had to each kill at least one of the ‘leaders of the cultivators’,
while the second was that we had to protect this place for a full
chaos cycle. Once we complete both objectives, we’ll be released
and granted freedom.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
have to protect this place for a chaos cycle, so there’s no way
we’ll let you try and destroy it. If we stand back, we’ll have
instantly voided the agreement and the Sithe would never let us
leave,” the cyclopean creature said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
full chaos cycle?” Ning and Mogg both grew anxious. That was
unacceptable. Given how fast this thing was devouring energy, the
Chaosverse probably would’ve been reduced to a husk of itself by
then! The Sithe would’ve long ago taken control over the Chaosverse
after a chaos cycle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
are two paths available to us,” the dragon turtle continued. “The
first is for us to stand by the side of the Sithe. The second is for
us to stand by your side… but if we do so, we’ll have made an
irreversible choice! The three of us know just how terrifying this
hive is, and we have no reason to believe that you two will be able
to deal with it. We can’t just entrust our very lives to the two of
you, unless you can somehow prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that
you can destroy this hive.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and Mogg were both speechless. Prove beyond the shadow of a doubt?
They didn’t even know how the thing operated yet. How were they
supposed to do that?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.”
The dragon turtle snorted. “And here I thought you cultivators had
something really impressive up your sleeves.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
disappoint us. KILL THEM!” The cyclopean creature was the first to
attack. Whoosh! Its body blurred as it transformed into a strange
ripple that instantly appeared before Ning and Mogg. It was so fast
that even Ning was rendered speechless! Even when Ning used the Storm
Sword Dao, he was still considerably slower than this creature.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Leave
this one to me!” Autarch Mogg held a long saber in each of his six
arms, and he similarly transformed into a spatial ripple to fight
back. As the master of the Space Daobirth Essence, Autarch Mogg was
more or less able to stave off this cyclopean creature.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash!
Dimensional tears began to appear and disappear in the space around
the two. The cyclopean void dweller’s attacks were completely
suppressing Autarch Mogg in both speed and ferocity, but the
Autarch’s incredibly high level of insight ensured that his six
long sabers formed a completely airtight defense. He would probably
be able to hold on for quite some time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“These
Autarch-class void dwellers all became kings of their kind through
constant slaughter. None of them are easy to deal with.” Ning knew
all along that killing these things in sole combat would be extremely
difficult; in the past, the Autarchs had only accomplished it through
strength in numbers. Still… Ning was confident in his abilities.
Six million chaos cycles of training had been completely
transformative for him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Leave
this one to me, you old bastard?” the fiery-scaled void dweller
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fine.”
The dragon turtle was very patient and elected to silently watch from
afar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hey,
One-Eye! Let’s see who kills our opponent first!” The
fiery-scaled creature let out a roaring laugh, filled with such power
that when it blasted into Ning’s ears, Ning felt as though it was
trying to tear his head apart. Next, the vast creature exploded into
motion, transforming into a streak of fiery light that rammed
straight towards Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
haven’t had a chance to really have a good fight since mastering
the Eternal Omega Sword Dao and spending six million chaos cycles in
training.” Ning could feel his blood pumping with excitement. It
had been a long time since he got into a really good battle.
Previously, it was because his truesoul was collapsing and he didn’t
dare to fight with abandon. These days, it was because it was almost
impossible for him to find a good opponent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
wonder how long it’ll take me to beat him? Will ten seconds be
enough, or shall I need as much time as is needed to boil a kettle of
tea?” Ning manifested three heads and six arms, his six Northmoon
swords at the ready.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning’s body blurred, transforming to become 540,000 meters tall.
However, compared to the titanic fiery-scaled void dweller, he was
still a bit smaller.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Die!”
The creature lashed out at Ning with its terrifyingly sharp claws,
which its physical prowess ensured were deadlier than even Universe
treasures.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Bang!
Ning was instantly torn apart into countless pieces.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
The fiery-scaled void dweller was shocked. “An illusion!”
Everything it could see was nothing more than part of the illusions
created by Ning’s Sword Dao!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Storm
Execution!” Six streaks of sword-light howled forth, slashing
against the blazing flames covering the scaled creature’s neck. It
stumbled backwards, but nothing more than a few white marks were left
behind on the scales protecting the neck. However, right as Ning’s
swords connected with the creature’s neck, Ning used the Dao of
Karma to pour the power of the strike throughout the creature’s
body, causing internal destruction with abandon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
a powerful cultivator!” The scaled creature lifted its head up,
letting out a bellow: “But your illusions are useless against me!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
The flames covering its body expanded dramatically, its internal
flames pouring out from within to cover an area of a million
kilometers. The power of these flames was so great that it actually
managed to push back Ning’s Sword Dao Domain and his heartworld
projection.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
six strikes weren’t even able to break its scales! I was able to
injure its vital essence through karma, but as an Autarch-class void
dweller it has an absolutely prodigious amount of essence.” Ning
immediately began to consider what to do next. The flames the void
dweller had released were pushing back against the Sword Dao Domain.
Once it overtook Ning’s illusions, Ning would be forced to reveal
his true location and he would no longer be able to catch the
creature offguard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Kill
it through the Karma Sword Dao? That was too time-consuming! The
Autarch-class stone lifeform the Autarchs had encountered and slain
all those years ago had been indestructibly hard, as it truly was a
stone by nature. Not even the Autarchs were able to injure it, and so
their only option had been to exhaust it to death after tens of
thousands of years!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
Ning felt certain that this scaled creature wouldn’t be quite as
tough to deal with as that stone lifeform had been. There had to be a
flaw Ning could exploit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Its
body is unspeakably powerful, which is why it has Autarch-class
power. It has far more vital essence than actual Autarch’s; to kill
it using the Karma Sword Dao is going to be too slow. I’ll have to
come up with another idea for breaking through its defenses… but I
hit it six times in a row and merely left behind a few white marks on
its scales.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
pondered for a moment, then came to a conclusion.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Die,
cultivator! Die!” The towering scaled creature charged at Ning with
incomparable ferocity, its tail smashing apart anything which got in
its way.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Now
that Ning had some experience from their first clash, he immediately
changed tactics. Whoosh! Ning dodged in a ghostly manner,
transforming into the storm itself as he charged towards the scaled
void dweller.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
fast!” The scaled creature was shocked. “Only One-Eye is his
superior in speed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
wind and the lightning thundered in harmony, with the scaled
creature’s claws and tail completely unable to stop Ning’s
attack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill!”
Ning simultaneously chopped out with all six swords at the same time,
his swords spinning out like the spokes of a wheel! The edges of each
sword was covered in blurry light. A closer look would’ve shown
that the blurry sword-light was actually composed of countless
interspersed white and black specks of light that were connected to
each other. The specks of light were spinning in blaze, with the
white light blazing like fire while the black light hissed with dark
corrosive power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Dark Sword Dao – it infused corrosive darkness into the Dao of the
Sword</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Light Sword Dao – it infused blazing light into the Dao of the
Sword.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
joined together, they came to form the Cycle Sword Dao which Ning had
developed. Working in harmony, the two were able to support and
reinforce each other with tremendous synergy, allowing for blazing
strikes of corrosive power that ate through anything in its path! It
was like the merciless cycle of life and death itself, chopping
through all things in its path.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Six streaks of gray sword-light shot out at the same time, spinning
at the scaled creature like the blades of a giant windmill.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! The corrosive power of the Cycle Sword Dao was utterly
unstoppable. Even the fiery-red scales of the void dweller began to
crack. Moments later they broke apart entirely, with a gaping wound
appearing below them. Gold blood seeped out, followed by the flesh
quickly healing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
actually injured me!” The scaled creature went completely berserk.
A layer of red light appeared over its entire body, and its power
increased dramatically. It began to launch a furious counter-attack
while howling, “Hurry up and help me out, you old bastard!” Its
scales were its pride and joy. The fact that they had been shattered
caused it to feel that it was in danger.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Coming.”
The dragon turtle immediately came flying over.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Illusion
Sword Dao!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
scaled creature’s flames were only able to cover an area of a
million kilometers; beyond that, Ning’s illusions continued to
reign supreme. Countless Nings appeared within that area, and all of
them began to assault the scaled creature from afar at the same time.
The dragon turtle had no idea which one was the real one.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Whoosh! The light of the Cycle Sword Dao continued to spin out like
the spokes of a wheel, its strikes screaming through the air from a
million kilometers away. A million kilometers might seem to be a very
great distance, but it was actually extremely short for someone of
Ning’s abilities. All it did was give the scaled void dweller a
chance to react to Ning’s attacks, but there was no way the dragon
turtle would be able to actually help it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was completely dominant on a technical level. His Cycle Sword Dao
once more tore open a giant gaping wound in the scaled creature’s
body.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Aaaaaaah!
Die, die!” The scaled creature launched wild counter-attacks with
abandon, but Ning was far too nimble. Each time after he attacked he
retreated back into his illusions, making it impossible for them to
locate where he truly was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Old
bastard! Old bastard!” the scaled creature called out furiously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can’t locate the real one! Each time he moves into extremely close
range as he attacks, then retreats right away. I don’t have enough
time!” the dragon turtle responded anxiously as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“During
the last war we fought against the Sithe, two Autarch-class void
dwellers were on their side. The end result was that both of them
died, while all of us were untouched.” Ning’s voice rang out in
the air as he continuously launched more attacks, his terrifying
Cycle Sword Dao repeatedly ripping huge wounds into the scaled
creature’s body.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
scales were so extremely durable that Autarch-class attacks were
generally unable to breach them, but Ning’s Cycle Sword Dao was a
perfect counter and so Ning was able to breach through them. Given
how tough the scales were, they were equally difficult and
time-consuming to repair once destroyed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
you creatures can do is rely on the natural power of your bodies.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash!
Another wave of attacks from the Cycle Sword Dao chopped past the
scaled creature.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Even
if we cannot beat you, staying alive is simplicity itself… and once
we find your weaknesses, you are dead.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash!
Slash! The light of the Cycle Sword Dao left more and more gaping
wounds on the scaled creature’s body.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sithe put you here, yes… but did you really think they intending on
letting you survive? They simply wanted you to slow us down at the
cost of your own lives.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiiip!
The scaled creature’s long tail was actually severed midway
through!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ahhhhhhhh!”
The scaled void dweller’s titanic body was now covered with wounds.
Its tail had actually been chopped off, and even its arms were
half-severed. Its lacerated flesh was quickly healing, but its scales
wouldn’t be able to recover within a short period of time. It grew
increasingly frantic, as it could sense how death was impending.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“One-Eye!”
the scaled creature roared loudly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
skinny cyclopean creature was battling Autarch Mogg nearby and had
been keeping an eye on the situation. It called out anxiously in its
shrill voice, “I can’t find his true body, and he’s too fast!
Your flames aren’t able to cover enough area to force him to reveal
himself.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can’t expand my domain any further!” the scaled creature said
frantically. It had created this flaming domain from its own power,
and it wasn’t easy for him to strengthen those flames to a level
where it could simultaneously suppress both Ning’s Sword Dao Domain
as well as Ning’s heartworld projection! It could only maintain
enough power to do both up to a distance of a million kilometers;
this was the creature’s maximum limit! Alas, a million kilometers
was a short enough distance that neither of the other two
Autarch-class void dwellers would be able to interrupt Ning’s
incredibly fast attacks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Stop
that!” Both the Autarch-class creatures were turning frantic.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash!
One of the scaled creature’s arms was completely severed off.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
surrender! I surrender! Spare me!” The scaled creature finally
began to panic as those terrifying streaks of sword-light tore
through its scales once more. “Spare me and I’ll obey you in all
things!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Obey
me? I wouldn’t dare to place any faith in you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
was no way for these Autarch-class void dwellers to swear lifeblood
oaths. The only agreements they could make were oral agreements, and
they could go back on those agreements whenever they pleased!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No…!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
sword-light continued to chop down mercilessly. Ning only sped up the
pace after most of the creature’s scales had been destroyed, and
his sword-light flew about with abandon as he completely chopped the
scaled creature apart into countless pieces. A red gemstone suddenly
appeared, and it was able to survive even Ning’s furious blows of
sword-light. The faint outline of the scaled creature could be seen
within the red gemstone, and it was still begging Ning: “Don’t
kill me!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had unleashed a total of 3,220 strikes in destroying this
Autarch-class void dweller’s body. He immediately grabbed the red
gemstone, then cast a seal across it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
already captured this one, and I can destroy it with a thought.”
Ning turned to glance at the other two Autarch-class void dwellers,
his voice echoing within the area: “Are the two of you willing to
stand with us now? Or are you still going to stand with the Sithe?”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_43_Chapter_020__Fina"></A>
Chapter 20: Formation</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
dragon turtle and the cyclopean creature shared a glance. The two
Autarch-class void dwellers were unable to hide their shock. One of
their peers had been defeated in just a few short moments, its body
destroyed and its life-core taken?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
you keep fighting against us, the only result will be that you both
die,” Autarch Mogg said. “Stand with us. Once we deal with this
behemoth hive, you’ll gain your freedom.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Do
you really think you can threaten us just because you captured one of
us?” the dragon turtle snorted coldly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
cyclopean creature smiled coldly as it glanced at Ning and Autarch
Mogg. “We’re not like that idiot. I’m fast enough that you two
won’t even be able to touch me… and as for that tough old bastard
over there? It is even stronger than me! You have no chance of
defeating it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Mogg
frowned. The cyclopean creature was telling the truth; neither Mogg
nor Ning was a match for the creature in speed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
that’s the case, go ahead and die.” Ning didn’t want to waste
any time. This behemoth hive was continuously devouring the power of
this Chaosverse with each passing moment! Ning transformed into the
storm once more as he charged towards the dragon turtle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
must be remembered that Ning was extremely well-rounded and was
skilled in almost every Dao. Thus, he was capable of seizing upon his
opponent’s weaknesses and come up with a perfect counter each time!
Ning felt quite certain that he would be able to deal with the
seemingly-speedy Cyclops, and so he wanted to try out the dragon
turtle and see how strong it was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.”
The dragon turtle didn’t move at all. The grayish-white skin
covering its neck looked as tough as a rock, and it just watched
coldly as Ning approached it. Invisible waves of energy began to
manifest in the area around the dragon turtle, pushing back against
the Sword Dao Domain and the heartforce projection alike.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill!”
An absolutely dazzling streak of light shot out like a flaming meteor
that was crashing to earth. This was Ning’s terrifying sword-light,
and it was chopping straight at the dragon turtle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hiss…
the dragon turtle’s draconian head reared up, hissing like a viper
and moving with serpentine speed as it chomped upwards, with space
being continuously destroyed and recreated within its maw.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
The sharp sword-light came crashing down against the ears of that
draconian head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the dragon turtle began a furious battle against each other, with
Ning putting the terrifying might of his Sword Dao on full display.
He alternated between using overwhelming power to shut down the
dragon turtle’s savagery and using unpredictable sword-arts to
launch deadly stabs! He launched a thousand ferocious attacks in
succession that came crashing down like waves, used the deadly
corrosive power of his Cycle Sword Dao, and even use all of the
various elemental Daos of his Five Elements Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had completely suppressed the dragon turtle and was raining down
blows upon it!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
that powerful?!” the distant cyclopean creature was rather shocked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth
really has become the strongest of us seven,” Autarch Mogg mused
silently. “I’m only superior to him in the Dao of Space; in all
else, he is better. He’s simply skilled into many different Daos!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Gwaaaar!”
The dragon turtle was enraged by the beating it was taking. It
furiously tried to fight back, but it continued to be completely
dominated.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
terms of actual power, the dragon turtle was the strongest of the
three Autarch-class void dwellers. Its deceptively simple bites were
actually strengthened by an incredible innate ability that made those
bites more powerful than even Ning’s most powerful strikes! It was
all-enveloping and compressed space itself, making it impossible for
most enemies to dodge this attack. Alas, Ning was at such a high
level of insight that he was able to dissolve the attack with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning,
however, was feeling quite frustrated as well. “Its body is
completely flawless and impregnable.” He had used everything he had
and was beating the hell out of this dragon turtle, but he wasn’t
able to do any damage! He had even used his sword-light to stab
against the dragon turtle’s eyes, but he was unable to pierce
through the grayish-white eyelids. As for the rest of the body? None
of Ning’s attacks were able to injure it at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mogg,”
Ning sent mentally to Mogg, “Its body is completely flawless and
unbreakable. What should we do?” Mogg had been alive for much
longer than him, and was much more experienced.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“When
we fought the stone lifeform all those years ago, we similarly found
it to be indestructible. There’s really no real option aside from
slowly exhausting it to death,” Mogg sent mentally. “Use karmic
attacks to destroy its vital essence, and just keep on at it until it
dies! Last time, we bombared that stone lifeform for tens of
thousands of years before managing to kill it. This dragon turtle
seems to have a similarly powerful body, and I’ll wager it has just
as much vital essence. Your karmic attacks, however, are inferior to
those of Titanos. It’ll probably take you at least a million years
to exhaust it, or perhaps even longer!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
instantly felt helpless. This was the clumsiest method available, and
apparently the only method available! Karmic attacks ignored all
defenses, as they used the power of karma to attack someone at the
very core of their essence! Alas, Ning was still significantly weaker
than Titanos in this respect.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can’t kill you, but you can’t hurt me either!” The dragon
turtle finally abandoned its attempts to counter-attack and instead
just allowed Ning to uselessly rain down blows against it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
can any physical body be THIS tough?” Ning was secretly speechless.
He was so powerful that his attacks would easily cause even Universe
treasures or Chaos Primordials to crumble, but this Autarch-class
dragon turtle was so tough that Ning wasn’t able to do anything to
it at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
finish off the other one first, Mogg,” Ning sent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright,”
Mogg agreed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
Ning instantly transformed back into a storm of wind and lightning as
he shot towards the skinny cyclopean creature, which had been
watching him from afar this entire time. Thanks to Ning’s
illusions, the cyclopean creature had no idea that Ning was even
moving towards it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Even
so, the cyclopean creature’s attunement to space and wind allowed
it to realize that something strange was going on. “Eh?” Swish!
It suddenly dodged, and as it did so a streak of sword-light stabbed
straight through its after-image! The creature reappeared over a
hundred million kilometers away. It narrowed its eyes and said in its
shrill voice, “You want to sneak-attack me? You won’t even touch
me!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“As
far as I’m concerned, you are the weakest of the three.” Ning
stared at the cyclopean creature, then unleashed an awesome wave of
mana which he connected to the boundless power of the Dao. The mana
manifested in the form of countless swords that filled the illusory
region. Countless millions of streaks of sword-light appeared, with
each streak of sword-light filled with such power that they could
easily slay Otherverse Lords.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
Ning had been a mere Daolord, his Sword Dao Domain was created solely
through the power of the Dao itself. Now, however, Ning was using the
power of his mana to actively control the Dao, allowing his domain to
become even more powerful! The attacks might not be as mighty as
physical strikes unleashed with the Northmoon swords, but they were
still tens of times more powerful than in the past.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
sword-light is very weak.” The cyclopean creature glanced
disdainfully at the countless streams of sword-light, then let out a
shrill chuckle: “You won’t even be able to scratch me with these
things.” Although it was physically the weakest of the three
Autarch-class void dwellers, it was still far tougher than any Chaos
Primordial.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Formation,
assemble!” Ning called out coldly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Countless streams of sword-light began to flow together
rhythmatically within the domain, and moments later the entire scene
changed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
going on?!” The cyclopean creature stared in shock at its
surroundings, which had become transformed into a fragrant world of
grass and flowers. It was standing in the middle of a prairie, and
the dragon turtle was nowhere to be seen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“B-but…”
The dragon turtle stared at its own surroundings as well. The world
around it had been transformed into a vast sea. The waves of the sea
splashed around it, kicking up a few foamy bubbles. It was also
unable to see any other creatures around it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
formation!” The dragon turtle grew anxious. It instantly flew
forwards at high speed, sending its massive bulk hurtling through the
air while it furiously tore at the area around it with its four
stubby legs. Alas, the waves of the sea seemed to be completely
illusory; no matter how it attacked the waves, it remained unable to
see anything beyond them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
void dwellers do not understand the Dao. You are foolish! You can
overpower weaker creatures, but if you encounter a formation set down
by someone of equal power to you then you are completely helpless.”
Ning’s voice echoed throughout the illusory realms the two
creatures were in. “You will not be able to escape my illusions. I
can do with you as I please.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had long ago reached Hegemony in the Dao of Formations. He had then
infused it into his Dao of the Sword, creating the Sword Formation
Dao. Now, he was using the power of his mana and his insights into
the Dao to transform his countless streams of sword-light into
formation-bases, which he then used to construct an enormous
formation! Even people like Autarch Titanos or Autarch Mogg, who also
had a high level of insight into the Dao, would need to spend some
time to solve this type of formation. These Autarch-class void
dwellers, however, were completely incapable of doing so.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Their
advantages were obvious, but their weaknesses were obvious as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break!
BREAK!” The cyclopean creature was growing desperate. It was now
holding a long shuttle in its claws, and it was furiously attacking
the world around it. Alas, the world remained a fragrant world of
grass and flowers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiip!
A streak of sword-light suddenly appeared right behind the cyclopean
creature. It had appeared without any warning, and it instantly tore
through the creature’s fur and stabbed into its body. Then… the
sword-light began to spin! Slash! An enormous gaping wound instantly
appeared, followed by golden blood fountaining outwards. The
cyclopean creature frantically pulled back and tried to defend
against any new attacks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Do
you think your speed will be of any use to you within my formations?
I can approach you without a sound. A few more attacks and you’ll
be as good as dead.” Ning’s voice echoed out within the plains
once more: “The other two had tougher bodies to deal with, but
you’ll be easy to handle.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
should I do? Old bastard? Old bastard!!!” the cyclopean creature
screamed frantically.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Keep
screaming. Scream as loud as you want. It won’t hear you.” Ning’s
voice rang out once more. The beautiful world of flowers was like a
nightmare which had completely enveloped the void dweller.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No!
This is just a formation. I can break it. I can break it!” The
cyclopean creature could sense its doom impending, and the sensation
was driving it mad. It brandished the shuttle, furiously striking at
all directions with it. Slash! Slash! Space was churned apart into
tiny little pieces by his blows, but the overall environment remained
that of a fragrant world of grass and flowers. Ji Ning’s formation
wouldn’t be so easily defeated!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break!
Break!!!” the cyclopean creature yelled hoarsely.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the past, it had never viewed formations as something to be afraid
of. This was because it had long ago grown accustomed to bursting
through formations with its overwhelming power. Formations which
could successfully trap Autarch-class void dwellers were incredibly
rare to begin with! This one in particular was ensuring that it was
not able to put its speed to good effect at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Poor
bastard. He ended up running into you, Darknorth.” Autarch Mogg
shook his head as he watched from afar, then sent mentally to Ning,
“You can be described as the number one formations expert in all
the cultivator civilizations.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
only because I infused the Dao of Formations into my Sword Dao,”
Ning said with a smile. “Just a moment, please. I’m about to
capture the creature.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swish!
A streak of gloomy sword-light appeared in ghostly fashion, instantly
piercing through the cyclopean creature’s skinny body. One of the
creature’s legs went flying, with blood spewing everywhere. The
cyclopean creature frantically retreated, not paying any attention to
the heavy wound which was quickly beginning to heal. The severed leg
was regrowing as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
won’t be able to last. You Autarch-class creatures have very
powerful bodies, but that also makes it extremely hard for you to
truly heal.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Sword-light
flashed again. Ning’s attacks were coming from every single
direction. This looked like an extremely beautiful prairie, but it
was a death trap which could unleash sword-light from any and every
part of it! There was no way to dodge, and each time the cyclopean
creature would only detect the sword-light once the light was right
in front of it. The creature’s tremendous speed was rendered
useless here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Whoosh! Whoosh! Just three seconds later, a total of over sixty
attacks had appeared and then vanished without a trace. Finally, the
cyclopean creature’s entire body crumbled apart. Its healing speed
simply wasn’t able to keep up with the rate at which Ning was
causing damage, and it was now completely incapable of fighting back
at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
The creature’s body imploded. Ning reached out with his sword-light
to tug free a white and glossy pearl from the ‘corpse’, and it
quickly flew over to Ning. The pearl held an image of the furry
cyclopean creature within it, and it was begging Ning for its life:
“Please spare me! Spare me! None of this was of my own free will!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
waved his hand, grabbing the pearl and casting a seal over it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">So
long as his seal prevented the pearl from absorbing energy from the
outside world, the creature would be unable to revive! It could only
reconstitute its body if given access to enough energy, but even
without its body it would remain alive so long as its truesoul within
its life-core remained unharmed. Only when the life-cores were
destroyed would these Autarch-class void dwellers be truly ‘dead’!
However, Ning didn’t feel much of an urge to actually kill them. He
was going to simply imprison them for now.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">And
so… two of the three void dwellers had been captured by Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Congratulations,
Darknorth.” Mogg flew over, his scaled face split by an amazed
smile. “Thank goodness you came with me. Otherwise, we wouldn’t
have been able to deal with them so easily.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch-class
void dwellers are indeed very tough to deal with, due to their innate
gifts. However, their obvious weakness is that they do not train in
the Dao. They have a very low level of insight,” Ning said. “I’m
only able to attack their weaknesses and defeat them with such ease
because I’m fairly well-rounded.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Any
void dwellers capable of reaching the Autarch level of power have
very few weaknesses.” Autarch Mogg sighed. “These three were all
very powerful, with that cyclopean creature possessing unparalleled
speed. The only way to handle it is to do what you just did – trap
it in a formation, an extremely profound formation which it cannot
break through with raw power. However, such formations generally
require detailed and intricate preparations as well as for
formation-bases to be laid down in advance. Given how crafty the
creature is, it would never just watch us set down those formations
and then just step into them. Only you could’ve done what you did,
Darknorth. You created a formation with but a thought, making it
impossible for it to escape.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
scaled void dweller was even more difficult to deal with. It had
virtually no weaknesses at all! Thankfully, your sword-arts were able
to breach its armor of scales. I’m truly impressed that you were
able to capture both of them! As for this last one… it seems to be
completely invulnerable,” Autarch Mogg said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
sighed. “I really don’t have any idea what I’m supposed to do
with this last one.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
was very well-rounded, true, but Autarch-class void dwellers were
simply too difficult to handle. The cyclopean creature had an obvious
weakness, which was why Ning was confident in his ability to deal
with it! Ning hadn’t been sure if he could handle the other two,
and so he had to probe them in battle first. He had discovered that
his Cycle Sword Dao was capable of breaking the scaled creature’s
armor, but there was nothing Ning could do which affected the dragon
turtle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and Mogg both moved to the place where the dragon turtle was located,
then stared at it. The dragon turtle simply sat there, silently
inspecting its surroundings. It was trapped within an illusory
formation, but it showed no signs of fear whatsoever.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
what should we do?” Ning pondered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
we can’t kill it in a short period of time, we should just leave it
there for now,” Autarch Mogg said. “Let’s go locate the core
mechanisms controlling this behemoth hive first. We need to destroy
this hive as soon as possible. If it comes to bother us again, use
your formations to trap it. If need be, I’ll personally tie it
down.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
all we can do.” Ning nodded. “Let’s go.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
quickly led Mogg in advancing to the critical point he had discovered
earlier while analyzing the functionings of this behemoth hive. As
they left, the illusory formation Ning had established quickly
dissipated. There was no way to maintain it from afar! This was a
formation which Ning had to use all his power to cast and maintain, a
powerful Autarch-class formation which used up an enormous amount of
energy. Ning had used his mana to guide the limitless power of the
Sword Dao in setting up this formation. Now that Ning was gone, it
would be very difficult to use mere formation-base type treasures to
supply the necessary amount of energy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
must be remembered that not even Sithe Apocalypse-class formations
were as mighty as this one! Thus, it would take Ning an extremely
long period of time and many precious materials to create a physical
variant, far longer than Ning would need to simply use his Karma
Sword Dao to attrition the dragon turtle to death.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Two
of my old friends are gone, just like that.” The dragon turtle
sighed to itself. “These Autarchs who train in their ‘Dao’
really are hard to deal with. Ugh. It is our own fault for being
caught by the Sithe. We really were given no choices at all. Who the
hell would want to fight against these cultivators anyhow?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“…eh?”
The dragon turtle stared at its surroundings in surprise. The
illusory realm around it had vanished, revealing ordinary spacetime</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
left?” The dragon turtle grew anxious. “They’re still heading
for the core regions. I have to stop them!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
The dragon turtle immediately warped through spacetime in pursuit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
‘behemoth hive’ was in reality an intricately designed super
weapon, and it was filled with many separate spacetime continuums.
One of them was merely three hundred meters in size, and it held a
man who was seated in the lotus position, his long unbound hair. This
man’s hair was black on one side and white on the other. He looked
quite strange and mysterious.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
eyes looked like a series of concentric circles, and his gaze was as
deep as a bottomless abyss. He quietly stared at the images displayed
in front of him. The images shown were of Ning and Autarch Mogg
battling against those three Autarch-class void dwellers. However,
the images were blurry and indistinct. He was able to scry some of
what had happened due to the residue left behind by the various
attacks, but wasn’t able to truly ‘watch’ the battle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
no way for me to truly scry any of these cultivator Autarchs,” the
black-white haired man murmured softly. “However… judging from
their auras, they should’ve only sent two people.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarchs
were incredibly powerful. In their own Chaosverse, they were able to
summon nigh-limitless amounts of power, and it was almost impossible
to view them if they didn’t want to be viewed. The Sithe would only
sense energies blocking their scans; they wouldn’t actually be able
to see the Autarchs at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
The black-white haired man’s face suddenly turned pale. The battle
had just come to an end and both Ning and Mogg had vanished, leaving
behind just the dragon turtle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Only
one of those three void dwellers are left?” The black-white haired
man was stunned. Ignoring everything else, he immediately activated
the formation-base he was seated on.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
the formation-base slowly began to swivel in place, and a ripple of
power began to manifest and take form as a pillar of light. Slowly,
the pillar of light resolved into a humanoid figure. It was a
balding, barefoot, loose-robed man of great stature and size who had
a kind, sympathetic smile on his face. His eyes were absolutely
mesmerizing, and those who saw him would feel the unconscious desire
to submit to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Almighty
Iyerre,” the black-white haired man bowed respectfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
are things, Anitya?” Iyerre asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
cultivators have entered our super weapon, the ‘Annihilation Hive’,
but there are only two of them. Their auras are vast, preventing me
from seeing them clearly. However, two of the three Autarch-class
void dwellers we imprisoned within the Annihilation Hive have already
died. Only the defensively impregnable ‘Howler’ beast we captured
remains alive,” the black-white haired man said respectfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
frowned slightly. “Only two of them came?” The loss of two void
dwellers was a minor matter, but he was very disappointed that only
two of the cultivators had entered the Annihilation Hive. If five or
six had come in, the Sithe could’ve seized this opportunity to
immediately launch the final war!</P>

Chapter 22: The Central Nexus</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Just
follow the plan,” Iyerre instructed. “If those two void dwellers
died, they died. As long as the Howler beast is still alive, our
plans remain unaffected.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood,”
the black-white haired man said obediently.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Feel
free to contact me if anything major happens.” Iyerre’s lips
crooked upwards in a smile. “I’ve spent countless aeons and paid
an enormous price in order to create the Annihilation Hive. It won’t
be easy for them to defeat it… and if they just send in two
Autarchs, their chances are absolutely nil. If they send in more
Autarchs they might be able to eventually figure out a way to destroy
it… but in doing so, they’ll have lost the battle to us before it
even began.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
creation of the Annihilation Hive was Iyerre’s greatest
accomplishment. He was extremely confident in its prowess.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
place was filled with countless spacetime bubbles of varying size,
and they could be seen everywhere.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning continued to examine the inner workings of the entire hive as he
advanced, moving closer and closer to the critical point. After
roughly an hour, they finally reached the spot.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
central nexus point for the entire behemoth hive is located right up
ahead.” Ning let out a sigh of relief. Ning had been focusing his
full attention on inspecting the path before him, which had been
rather tiring.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
central nexus?” Autarch Mogg stared from afar as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Both
of them carefully inspected the distant, empty region in front of
them. At the very center of this empty region was a beautiful vortex
of astral clouds. The astral clouds swirled in a vortex-like manner
around the very center.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">These
astral clouds were composed of countless specks of light and seemed
almost illusory in nature. Ning and Autarch Mogg had such incredible
visual acuity that they were able to see through almost anything, so
long as there wasn’t a complete seal that blocked out all sight.
The two were able to gaze past the astral clouds and thus see the
black tower at the very center. The tower had to be ten thousand
kilometers tall!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
vast black tower was covered with swirls of strange power which
caused the vortex of astral clouds to appear around it. More than
that – it also caused countless ripples of spacetime to rise and
fall in the area around it, and it resonated with the entire
realmverse-sized hive! It was the source of that terrifying
swallowing power which was draining away all forms of energy from the
outside world. Not even the prime essences of the Chaosverse were
able to recover the energy lost.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was easy for Autarchs to enter this place, but if they tried to leave
they would also suffer from that powerful devouring force. There was
no way they could possibly escape!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
has to be the most central nexus point of the entire behemoth hive.”
Ning’s gaze was able to see through the vortex of astral clouds and
into the black tower within it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
tower was shaped like a pyramid, and it was completely pitch-black in
color.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
moved quite fast, cultivator leaders.” A deep, rumbling voice
suddenly rang out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and Mogg turned to stare off into the distance. Within the astral
vortex, there was an enormous entity which was lying in wait. It was
the dragon turtle! Ning had to slowly find the path to this location,
while the dragon turtle already knew the routes and so took the
fastest path here. It had arrived long ago.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
accordance with the agreement I made with the Sithe, I will not allow
you to damage this place,” the dragon turtle rumbled. “However…
I’ll wager that you aren’t even strong enough to get here.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh?”
Ning and Mogg exchanged a glance. “Attack!” They didn’t
hesitate at all. Ning manifested three heads and six arms, while Mogg
manifested six arms. Both charged straight towards the dazzlingly
beautiful vortex of astral clouds without hesitation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
The vortex of astral clouds continued to spin in place, causing
countless streams of light around it to twist and bend as it crushed
all in its path.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
a powerful obstructive force.” Ning and Mogg were respectively
covered by layers of sword-light and dimensional membranes as they
continued to fight through the clouds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Bang!
Bang! Bang! They smashed through one layer of astral clouds after
another. Ning was able to see that there appeared to be a total of
106 layers of these astral clouds, all assembled in that vortex
formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
power here is tremendous. Even Chaos Primordials would be crushed
into tiny bits if they came here.” Ning and Mogg began to
decelerate as they moved to defend themselves.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Open!”
Ning shot out a streak of sword-light. Slash! It swept out like a
wave, tearing a tunnel through the astral clouds and pushing the
specks of light aside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Ning and Mogg flew forwards at high speeds, using their sword-light
and saber-light to continuously carve a path forward for themselves.
In the blink of an eye, they flew past the thirty-fifth layer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
pressure here is ridiculously strong.” Ning’s face was grim. The
spinning astral clouds were like millstones grinding away at them; if
they didn’t manage to successfully defend themselves, they would be
crushed to pieces! Both had avatar-bodies, but this pressure was
still enough to crush them to death. They had to use their sword-arts
and Daobirth Essence, respectively, to clear a path through the
vortex, but both of them could sense how taxing it had become.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
dragon turtle is right past the fiftieth layer,” Ning sent
mentally, his ‘voice’ tinged with helplessness. “I didn’t
imagine that he would be spot on. It’ll be very hard for us to
reach the fiftieth layer; even if we do manage to somehow fight our
way there, we’d be constantly in danger of succumbing to the
crushing power of the vortex. There’s no way we’d be able to deal
with the dragon turtle as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Agreed.
We can’t advance any further. If we do, we won’t have enough
power left to fight against the dragon turtle. We might end up dying
there.” Autarch Mogg came to the same conclusion.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
they found the thirty-fifth layer somewhat taxing, they would still
be able to unleash 80% of their full power while reserving the rest
to keep the power of the vortex in check. There was no need for them
to fear the dragon turtle. But if they actually forced themselves to
the fiftieth layer, they probably would have less than 10% of their
power available for fighting. The dragon turtle would completely
dominate them, and they could very well die.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
pressure here really is terrifying. I can’t believe the two of us
working together aren’t even able to make it to the fiftieth
layer.” Autarch Mogg began to feel anxious. “But the black tower
at the center of this vortex is the central nexus of this entire
hive. That’s over a hundred layers down! We can’t even approach
it, much less destroy it. We aren’t even close to being able to
succeed. What should we do?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
agree.” Ning’s head hurt as well. Their bodies weren’t tough
enough to resist the crushing pressure of the vortex; they had to
beat the pressure back with their attacks! Although Ning was somewhat
stronger than Mogg, the two even when working together would only
barely be able to make it to the fiftieth layer. There was no chance
of going all the way.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
power of the vortex rises gradually, not exponentially. I estimate we
would need at least five Autarchs working together in order for us to
stand a chance of making it past the hundredth layer,” Autarch Mogg
said. “The two of us by ourselves won’t be able to go too far.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Even
if five Autarch avatars came in, they probably would still find it
very difficult to damage that black tower. They’d end up trapped
inside, while the Sithe would probably seize this opportunity to
launch the war.” Ning frowned. “We’d be in serious trouble.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
took time to build new avatars. Ning would need years just to create
a new avatar if his current one was lost, he would need many more
years for the new one to reach peak battle power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Once
the war began, the Autarchs simply wouldn’t have the time needed to
create and strengthen new avatars. Wasting even four or five days on
this process would result in the situation quickly turning grim.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
what should we do?” Autarch Mogg understood the problem as well.
“We absolutely have to destroy this hive. If we don’t, then it’ll
drain away more energy while becoming more powerful! Given enough
time, it’ll weaken the Chaosverse so much that the Sithe will be
able to take control over it. We’ll be finished, then!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
felt anxious as well. If nearly half of their Autarch-level
combatants were trapped here, they would probably lose the war. But
if they didn’t send in more Autarchs, this hive would continue to
drain away energy from the Chaosverse… which would still ultimately
result in defeat!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
try and think of another option,” Autarch Mogg said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
are no other options.” Ning shook his head. “I’ve been
analyzing the formations inside this hive the entire time. It has
just a single nexus point – the black tower inside that vortex of
astral clouds! If we want to destroy the hive, we’ll either need to
destroy its nexus or have enough power to blast the entire thing
apart.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
shook his head. “Destroying the entire hive is impossible. It is
too powerful. Nothing we can do would even shake it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and Mogg continued to ponder the question of what they had to do. As
for the massive, impregnable dragon turtle, it simply waited within
the fiftieth layer. The crushing power of the astral clouds was
unable to injure it in the slightest. It lifted up its draconian
head, then let out a booming shout: “Haha! I told you, you won’t
even be able to make it to me, much less wreck the nexus.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
wanted to lure Ning and Mogg closer. They’d have to deal with
ever-greater amounts of pressure, giving the void dweller a better
chance at killing them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and Mogg glanced sideways at the dragon turtle, not even bothering to
answer it. The two did rather envy its defensive powers, though. They
could at most fight to the fiftieth layer, but the dragon turtle was
able to reach that layer with ease by completely ignoring the
crushing weight of the vortex. Its body was simply ridiculous! No
wonder Ning hadn’t been able to do anything to the creature at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
calm down first and come up with a plan. We’ll have Titanos try and
help us come up with something as well. Let’s figure out a way to
charge past the astral clouds,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
agree. Let’s calm down and think. We’ll definitely think of
something.” Mogg tamped down his own nervousness as well. They
quickly spread word to the other five Autarchs, and all six of them
began to try and devise a way of passing through the vortex of astral
clouds.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_43_Chapter_023__Fina"></A>
Chapter 23: Titanos' Solution</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">An
ancient temple was hovering above an island located within the outer
perimeter of the Sithelands. There were six figures seated in the
lotus position within this ancient temple. They were Autarch Titanos,
Autarch Mogg, Autarch Stonerule, Autarch Skyfeeder, Autarch Bolin,
and Autarch Ekong. They were here either in person or in avatar form,
and they were all seated meditating. In front of Autarch Mogg, there
was an illusory image which displayed what was happening within the
Annihilation Hive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
insides of the hive are completely filled with countless spacetime
bubbles which are linked together in an extremely complicated
formation.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Mogg pointed at the images and explained, “There is a vortex at the
very center of the hive, and it holds a total of 106 layers of astral
clouds which surround a black tower. The black tower is the energy
wellspring for the entire hive. That’s essentially what we’ve
managed to discover thus far. Try and help us come up with an idea,
everyone.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hm.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Got
it.” The other five Autarchs all nodded slowly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
flowed on. Autarch Skyfeeder’s avatar kept time accelerated at a
rate of 500x for the Autarchs, buying them time to slave away at this
problem! The Annihilation Hive was constantly devouring energy, after
all. The more time they took, the more harm would be done to the
Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No,
that won’t work.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Anything
else?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
have to reach the nexus and destroy the black tower if we wish to
break the hive apart, but a hundred layers of astral clouds? It’s
too hard.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Autarchs pondered continuously. Every so often one of them would
voice a suggestion, but the others would quickly point out the flaws!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
passed, one day after another. The Autarchs spent more than three
years painstakingly analyzing the problem. Thankfully, the 500x
temporal acceleration meant that only two days went past in the
outside world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
a marvelously constructed weapon.” Autarch Titanos stared at the
illusory images in front of him. An illusory black tower took form,
followed by a vortex which took control over spacetime to generate an
even more powerful sucking effect. This effect resonated across the
entire behemoth hive, giving birth to that terrifying force which was
devouring everything around the hive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
far from being a match for the person who was able to create this
weapon.” Autarch Titanos shook his head slightly, then murmured:
“But if all I have to do is cause some damage, I should be able to
do it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
The other five immediately turned to look at him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Titanos,
do you have an idea?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
did you come up with?” All of them grew excited.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Titanos had been alive for an extremely long period of time, and he
had spent much of it analyzing Sithe weapons. The other five Autarchs
held great faith in his abilities in this regard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
fairly confident in my idea,” Autarch Titanos said, “But I need
to enter the hive first and inspect it personally before I can be
sure if it would work or not.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Titanos,
take the route which Darknorth and I used. The two of us will be
there to welcome you,” Autarch Mogg said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
bald Autarch Titanos was staring at the Annihilation Hive from afar,
watching as it swallowed and destroyed everything in an extremely
wide area around it. Time quickly began to accelerate around him
until it reached 100x the rate of normal time. He then waved his
finger, causing a black cauldron which was 300 meters long to appear
next to him. He then tossed many precious ingredients into the black
cauldron.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Just
six days later, a streak of light shot out from inside the black
cauldron. It was a white-robed avatar of Autarch Titanos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go
on.” This freshly created avatar of Autarch Titanos had just 20% of
his true body’s strength. It quickly flew towards the distant
Annihilation Hive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">For
now, he was just going to use this weak new avatar for exploring the
Annihilation Hive. As for his first avatar in the Sithelands, it
would begin to weaken now that Autarch Titanos was focusing his
energies on maintaining the second avatar, but the weakening was a
gradual process. If he didn’t spend too much time maintaining the
second avatar and quickly abandoned it to turn his efforts back to
his first avatar, the first avatar would quickly reach peak power
once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-robed Titanos dove into the tunnel which Ning and Mogg had
entered, flying into the hive. The tunnel was unfathomably dark and
deep.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Titanos.”
Two figures hailed him from afar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.
Mogg.” The white-robed Titanos revealed a smile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
new avatar of yours is really puny,” Mogg’s avatar said
teasingly. “You’d probably get wiped out in an instant if you got
into a fight with those Autarch-class void dwellers.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
just a temporary body. We’re in a rush for time, so I just used a
quick and dirty method to get this thing up and running,” the
white-robed Titanos said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three continued to fly forwards as they chatted together. Ning led
the way, warping through spacetime and moving them towards the vortex
of astral clouds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
beautiful.” Autarch Titanos stared at the astral clouds from afar,
an amazed look on his face. He then turned to look at the countless
spacetime bubbles off in the distance. “Impressive. Truly
impressive. Now that I had the chance to witness these things
operating in person, I feel even more admiration towards the Sithe
who set this all up. It had to have been the Sithe Lord of Chaos who
personally created this thing. This place’s creator is far more
talented than I am.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
more accomplished one was in understanding how complicated artifacts
and weapons were fashioned, the more one would understand just how
incredible this Annihilation Hive was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Do
you have any ideas?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Creation
is hard, but destruction is much easier.” The white-robed Titanos
smiled. “I came up with an idea after quite a long period of
pondering, and I’m sure it’ll be effective.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
the method?” Both Ning and Mogg were excited.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
rush me! I need to make some further improvements.” The white-robed
Titanos stared intently at the vortex of astral clouds, scrutinizing
how it functioned while pondering how to improve his technique
further. Of course, it was Autarch Titanos’ true body in the
outside world which was doing most of the real work.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Six
hours went past. Ning and Mogg had been waiting this entire time, and
finally they saw a smile appear on the white-robed Titanos’ face.
“I’ve finally completed it. Darknorth, I’ll teach you the
technique. You use it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
don’t you teach me instead?” Autarch Mogg’s avatar teased.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
are too weak when it comes to the Dao of Formations. You wouldn’t
be able to learn it even if I tried to teach you.” The white-robed
Titanos glanced sideways at Mogg, then looked at Ning: “Darknorth,
you are every bit my equal when it comes to formations. The only
reason why you weren’t able to come up with this idea is because
you aren’t very experienced in the creation of weapons and
artifacts.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Take
a look at this.” The white-robed Titanos gently waved a finger,
causing an illusion of the black tower to appear before him. “This
black tower is the nexus of the entire hive, right?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and Mogg both nodded. This much, they both knew.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is also the energy wellspring for the entire hive,” the white-robed
Titanos said. “But merely providing power doesn’t mean that much;
its real value lies in how it applies that power! This is why the
black tower is covered with countless runes. The energy wellspring
uses those runes to form the hundred-layered vortex, causing the
swallowing power to be increased dramatically.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
understood this principle. It was akin to using ten percent of your
full power to achieve a hundred percent of the effect you desired!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
vortex, in turn, links with those countless spacetime bubbles to form
an enormous formation of even greater power. This formation resonates
throughout the entire hive, generating that tremendous sucking power
towards the outside world around it,” the white-robed Titanos said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
other words, the vortex is an amplifier. The formation employing all
those spacetime bubbles is a second amplifier. The way in which the
formation resonates with the entire hive is the third amplifier!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“These
three amplifiers are the real reason why the black tower’s power
has been increased to such an inconceivable level that it can rip
away energy from the Chaosverse itself,” the white-robed Titanos
said. “If we can disrupt any of the three amplifiers, the hive
won’t be able to function properly. Destroying the hive’s
structure would accomplish this, as would destroying the black tower
or all the spacetime bubbles inside this place.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Mogg immediately said, “But we can’t! This hive is a weapon of
terrifying power; we aren’t able to even scratch the thing. As for
the spacetime bubbles, we were able to destroy some, but new ones
would almost instantly be created. As for the vortex, its composed of
countless specks of light. There’s nothing to destroy.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hah!
You dummy.” The white-robed Titanos glanced at Mogg, then chortled,
“It actually isn’t too hard to deal with the hundred-layered
vortex. All we need to do is set up an even larger vortex formation
around it, one which spins in reverse. My reverse-vortex formation
simply needs to weaken the power of the astral clouds vortex. In
doing so, it’ll dramatically weaken the effect the hive has on the
outside world. Once this happens, it probably won’t be strong
enough to plunder energy from the Chaosverse by force.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
reverse-vortex formation?” Ning began to understand.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is the reverse-vortex formation I came up with. Take a look,
Darknorth.” The white-robed Titanos waved a finger, causing an
illusory reverse-vortex to suddenly appear around the illusory astral
vortex in front of him. This was an inwards-focused formation that
pushed back against the astral vortex, weakening its power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
vortex of astral clouds is an outwards formation which uses the black
tower as its energy source.” Ning smiled. “Our reverse-vortex
formation will be an inwards formation which uses me as its energy
source. My power comes from the Chaosverse itself and is virtually
limitless! I don’t need to completely stop the astral vortex; all I
need to do is weaken it by 30%, and it’ll most likely be rendered
ineffective.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Here
are the insights I used to create this formation. Take a close look,
Darknorth.” The white-robed Titanos immediately began to explain
the finer details regarding the reverse-vortex formation to Ning, who
listened attentively. Mogg listened as well, but a mystified look was
on his face. In the end, he wasn’t even close to being Ning or
Titanos’ equal when it came to formations.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_43_Chapter_024__Fina"></A>
Chapter 24: Gaining Entry</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
reverse-vortex formation was unspeakably complicated and profound. Ji
Ning’s true body in the Three Realms had to spend quite a bit of
accelerated time in meditation before truly understanding it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Marvelous.
Absolutely marvelous!” Ning couldn’t stop praising it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha!”
The white-robed Titanos let out a proud laugh. “I wouldn’t dare
boast about other things, but I’m quite confident in myself when it
comes to artifacts. Darknorth, are you now able to set the formation
up?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
am indeed.” Ning nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Mogg’s
avatar just chuckled to himself. He had also tried to learn it, but
had made very little headway.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-robed Titanos said, “Then hurry up and use it!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Ning immediately flew over, warping through space to appear in the
‘skies’ above the vortex of astral clouds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Arise!”
Ning’s face was solemn, and an endless wave of mana energy began to
flow out from his body. He was using mana to guide the power of the
Dao into creating those formations! Waves of energy rippled through
the area above the astral vortex as countless streams of sword-light
manifested. It was like a vast world of the sword had appeared, and
it quickly began to spread outwards to encompass and cover the entire
astral vortex.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-robed Titanos and Mogg both watched nervously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
what are they up to?” The dragon turtle raised its head, staring
puzzledly from its position on the fiftieth level.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
are these cultivator Autarchs playing at now? Hmph. Do they think
saturating the area with an attack will be enough to disrupt my
vortex? How laughable! The Annihilation Hive is almighty Iyerre’s
proudest creation, and it took him untold years to create it.” The
black-white haired Exalt Anitya was responsible for watching over the
entire hive from the dark room he was in. He muttered confidently to
himself, but he still continued to watch intently.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
vast world of sword-light covered the entire astral vortex, with Ning
using an enormous amount of mana to keep it under control.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Time
for the reverse-vortex formation!” Ning immediately willed the
countless streaks of sword-light to become grains of ‘sand’ that
began to revolve around him. They first took shape at the outer
perimeter, then began to spin inwards! The power of the astral vortex
was weakest at the outside, and it was also easiest for the grains of
sword-light to infiltrate the outer perimeter. As the enormous vortex
of sword-light continued to spin, more grains of sword-light began to
take form and seep inwards.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
reached the tenth level… the twentieth level… the thirtieth
level…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right.
That’s the way to do it, to just seep straight through it.” A
smile was playing at the corner of Ning’s lips. The reverse-vortex
formation didn’t try to overpower the astral vortex; rather, it was
overwriting it and disrupting it!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
spokes of a wheel in motion possessed tremendous power, but if you
threw a bunch of rubbish into the axel you could gum up the works.
The astral vortex seemed to be formless and thus hard to disrupt, but
the reverse-vortex formation was similarly formless and simply
focused on disruption.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Success.”
Autarch Mogg watched from afar. He could sense how the awesome
suctioning power around him was beginning to slowly weaken, and he
couldn’t help but smile: “We succeeded.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
too early to celebrate just yet!” The white-robed Autarch Titanos
smiled. “Thus far, the influence is negligible. The behemoth hive
is continuing to swallow energy away from our Chaosverse.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Meanwhile,
the dragon turtle stared in amazement at the sight above it. “What
in the world?” The vortex of sword-light was continuously expanding
in size, spreading out in concentric circles that continuously
overlapped the astral clouds. By now, they had nearly penetrated all
the way to the fiftieth level.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
sword-light continued to gently reach deeper and deeper into the
astral clouds, moving past the sixtieth level… the seventieth
level…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
grains of sword-light were incorporeal. The power of the astral
clouds continually ground away at them and destroyed them, but the
reverse-vortex formation created even more! Ning’s mana energy was
truly boundless, and he continued to pour it all into the formation.
As more and more grains of sword-light poured into the vortex, it
caused the power of the vortex to grow weaker and weaker.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
outside world. The countless tunnels dotting the surface of the
realmverse-sized hive were continuing to suck in the energy of the
Chaosverse. The prime essences were doing their best to halt the
process, but they were unable to do so. This was why that enormous
vortex of silver ‘light’ had appeared in the area around it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
gradually, the sucking power of the hive began to weaken. The
weakening continued until it reached the point where the prime
essences of the Chaosverse were finally able to completely halt the
process.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
silver vortex outside the hive immediately began to dissipate.
Everything went back to normal. The Annihilation Hive’s countless
tunnels continued to strenuously ‘pull’ at the surrounding world,
but it wasn’t able to swallow so much as a single scrap of energy
no matter how hard it tried.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the hive. Ning was continuing to maintain the reverse-vortex
formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Whoosh. The avatars of Titanos and Mogg flew to the area above the
astral vortex, moving close to Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
the devouring process outside has come to a complete halt.” The
white-robed Titanos was all smiles. “Although the astral vortex
still has 60% of its full power, that’s not enough to overpower the
prime essences of the Chaosverse. It isn’t able to take any more
energy away.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha…”
Ning started to laugh. “After I’ve finished infiltrating the
entire astral vortex, it’ll become even weaker.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Just
a short while later, the reverse-vortex formation finally finished
seeping through the final layer of the astral vortex. In fact, the
grains of sword-light even brushed against the giant black tower. The
entire astral vortex was still spinning, but it was now being heavily
disrupted and had at most 50% of its original power. This wasn’t
nearly enough power for it to continue absorbing energy from the
outside world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
Ning, Mogg, and Titanos all quickly flew downwards. Now that the
power of the vortex had been so dramatically weakened, passage was
much easier as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
actually solved the vortex.” The dragon turtle continued to wait on
the fiftieth level, its booming voice filled with disbelief.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
the power of the Dao,” the white-robed Titanos said. “You do not
train in the Dao. You would never understand.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
chuckled. “We’ve already solved this vortex, which means the
sucking power of the entire hive has just been dramatically weakened.
I imagine it is no longer powerful enough to prevent you from
leaving! I strongly recommend that you leave right away. We’ll send
you outside our Chaosverse, at which point you can flee and find a
hiding place far away from here. Don’t let yourself be caught by
the Sithe again, and stay away from our war!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Leave?”
The dragon turtle was startled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Freedom?
Release? Emancipation? It was filled with such joy that it was rather
dazed. “Alright!” The dragon turtle finally let out yet another
rumble: “And what of my two friends?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They’ll
stay with us for now. We’ll release them once this war is over,”
Ning said. It was unlikely that these Autarch-class void dwellers
would be caught a second time, but it wasn’t completely out of the
question! The only reason why Ning was willing to let the dragon
turtle leave their Chaosverse was because he really had no way of
killing it. He wanted to reduce the number of variables which could
affect the war.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fair
enough.” The dragon turtle made no further objections. In the end,
gaining freedom for itself was already a blessing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Once
you leave, one of our fellows will come and guide you out,” Ning
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
I’m off.” The dragon turtle shot off eagerly. Now that the astral
vortex was nearly 50% weaker than before its remaining amount of
power, while still incredible, it was unable to steal more energy
away from the Chaosverse. As for the dragon turtle, this time it was
able to fight past the sucking power and continue to fly outwards.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
see it! I see it! That’s the exit!” The dragon turtle flew out of
the exit, absolutely delighted. It then turned to look at the
enormous hive which it had just exited, as well as the mighty
cultivator leader who stood far away from it – Autarch Titanos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Follow
me. I’ll send you outside our Chaosverse,” Autarch Titanos said.
Now that the vortex had been dealt with, the Annihilation Hive was no
longer a threat and there was no need for him to continue watching
over it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
dragon turtle followed him obediently, and the two quickly warped
away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning,
Mogg, and the white-robed Titanos continued to fly downwards, moving
closer and closer to the heart of the astral vortex. The astral
clouds had been dramatically weakened, but progress was still quite
difficult.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
two stay here. I’ll try it out alone,” Ning said. “The astral
vortex is still active, which means I need to keep the reverse-vortex
formation active as well. If brought to a halt, the hive will once
more begin to swallow energy away from our Chaosverse. In other
words, my avatar needs to stay here until we can come up with a way
to destroy that energy wellspring permanently. Only then can we
destroy the hive, at which point I’ll be free to go.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Agreed.”
Mogg and Titanos halted their advance. Titanos was here in the form
of a newly-created avatar, while Mogg was significantly weaker than
Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break!”
Ning continued to advance while following a path formed by the
sword-light generated by his reverse-vortex formation. Although the
destructive power of the astral vortex was great, the broken bits of
sword-light continuously reformed around Ning, making passage for him
slightly easier.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
continued to advance in three-headed, six-armed form, striking out
with all six swords to help carve a path outwards. The deeper he
went, the harder it became. In the end, Ning had to use all his power
while following the path of sword-light in order to reach the black
tower at the very center of the vortex.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiip!
The terrifying crushing power here continuously destroyed the
surrounding sword-light, but more grains of sword-light rose in their
stead. As for Ning, he also maintained his three-headed, six-armed
form to fight back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is the energy wellspring of the entire hive.” Ning stared at the
countless runes covering the black tower. The runes were profound
beyond all imagination. After analyzing them for a while, Ning
suddenly leapt forward to ram against the black tower. Right as he
hit the tower, he used a blinking technique and followed his senses
to teleport inside the tower.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_43_Chapter_025__Fina"></A>
Chapter 25: The War Begins</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Castles,
planets, towers… Ji Ning was able to penetrate any purely physical
barrier, no matter how indestructible it was, with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
blinking into the black tower, Ning could still sense the outside
world beyond it. Even his mana was able to easily pass through the
tower and continue to maintain the reverse-vortex formation outside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Who
would’ve thought the insides of the tower would look like this?”
Ning rose into the air, staring at the area before him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
black tower merely covered an area of ten thousand kilometers. At the
very center of this area was a shadowy black globe that was covered
with a veneer of light. It was furiously gobbling up everything being
sent to it. The energy that was circulating towards and through the
black tower wasn’t impeded by the tower itself at all, and when the
energy was absorbed by the shadowy black orb it caused the orb to
slowly grow more powerful.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
ticked on, minute after minute. Eventually, the shadowy globe
finished devouring the remaining vestiges of power which the
Annihilation Hive had swallowed, at which point it had nothing to
feed upon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
this is the energy wellspring of the Annihilation Hive?” Ning
nodded slowly. He could sense a strange Dao infused into the black
orb, one which was contrary to the Dao of their Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
emanates a terrifying aura of destruction. There’s no way this
destructive power came from our Chaosverse. It must have come from
the Infinite Void outside.” Ning was extremely certain of this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break!”
Ning was in his three-headed, six-armed form and wielded all six
Northmoon swords. Sword-light flashed in a dazzling manner, as though
six rainbows suddenly had shot out and simultaneously chopped down
upon the black tower. It was the black tower which was allowing this
engine of destruction to manifest the great vortex in the outside
world. If Ning could destroy the tower, the whirlpool itself would
instantly disintegrate!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
A series of loud explosions rang out. Ning’s sword-light was
powerful and dominating, but it only managed to cause the tower to
tremble. No actual damage was done.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
switched from one sword-art to another, trying them all. He tested a
soft and corrosive style, a blazing and concentrated style, and a
mixture of many other styles as well. None of his many sword-arts,
however, were able to do a thing to the black tower.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?
The black tower is absolutely invulnerable. That means I’ll have to
turn my attention to the energy wellspring.” Ning frowned as he
turned to look at the sphere of annihilation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was a dark, shadowy, illusory thing that continued to strive to
devour the outside world. Ning had the feeling that the destructive
Dao it contained was extremely odd, and he had the feeling that
breaking it would be extremely difficult.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
give it a shot.” Once more, Ning struck out with his swords.
Whoosh! The Northmoon swords expanded to become over a thousand
meters long as they furiously chopped down towards the shadowy black
orb.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Bam!
When the swords chopped down on the black orb, they instantly sensed
a power pushing back against them. The surface of the shadowy black
orb trembled and changed slightly, but once Ning withdrew his swords
it quickly went back to normal.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break!
Break! BREAK!” Ning tried out multiple sword-arts, sending
countless streams of sword-light crashing down upon the shadowy black
orb. Each time it shuddered and distorted in shape, but every time it
quickly regenerated and once more appeared completely undamaged.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
not strong enough. This sphere of annihilation is completely capable
of enduring the force of my sword-arts. I can’t truly damage it at
all! I can only make it collapse once my attacks surpass its limits.”
Ning shook his head. “The Sithe Lord of Chaos truly is incredible.
He’s able to manipulate this sphere of annihilation as though it
was a mere bauble and even figured out how to teleport it into our
Chaosverse. I, however, am not able to budge it in the slightest,
much less damage it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
he wasn’t able to break the sphere of annihilation, the only thing
he could do was keep his avatar here and maintain the reverse-vortex
formation indefinitely.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Dao within this sphere of annihilation is truly inscrutable.” Ning
glanced at the shadowy black sphere, seemingly capable of devouring
all things, then once more reached out with his senses to try and
understand the laws it contained.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
Dao is completely different from the Daos of our Chaosverse. Perhaps…
perhaps I’ll be able to study its Dao and create a brand new Sword
Dao from it!” Ning suddenly was inspired by it. He had once created
an Annihilation Sword Dao during his six million chaos cycles in
training! That Dao was a purely destructive Dao, but this ‘sphere
of annihilation’ was different; instead of simply destroying, it
devoured everything around it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Five Elements, Yin and Yang, darkness and light… it could swallow
literally everything the Chaosverse held, then use it to strengthen
itself! This was a strange yet terrifyingly powerful Dao! Ning had
the feeling that if he could figure out how to infuse it into his own
Sword Dao, it would probably produce an extremely powerful Sword Dao
that would be of great benefit to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
black tower was impregnable, while the sphere of annihilation was
similarly invulnerable. The Autarchs had no ideas either, and so Ning
was forced to leave his avatar here! It was better for them to keep
an Autarch-class combatant tied up here than to allow the
Annihilation Hive to continue its devouring rampage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
avatar spent all of its time staring at the sphere of annihilation,
attuning to the powerful destructive forces within it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
a dark part of the Chaosverse. Autarch Titanos and the dragon turtle
suddenly appeared out of nowhere and appeared here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
the various different spacetime continuums are interlaced together
here. We have reached the farthest reaches of our Chaosverse,”
Autarch Titanos said. Nothing was beyond this place save for endless
darkness. If one continued to fly, one still wouldn’t see a true
‘barrier’ signifying the end of the Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
borders of the Chaosverse could not be seen with the naked eye or
sensed directly. It was simply a place where many different spacetime
continuums were jumbled together. Only someone of Autarch Titanos’
caliber would be able to verify where it all came together. There
were actually countless nexus points like this, and all of them
together formed the vast, impregnable ‘line’ which separated the
Chaosverse from the Infinite Void!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
send you out,” Autarch Titanos said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you, Autarch.” The dragon turtle was very delighted and chose to
express it through great modesty.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Titanos waved a single finger. Slash! He tore through the darkness
before him as though it was parchment, revealing a dazzling scene
‘outside’…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was the beautiful and stunning Infinite Void, a place filled with
countless colors. It was truly vast without end and filled with
countless celestial bodies, with the Chaosverses merely being the
largest and most mysterious of those bodies. It was composed of
countless different intersecting spacetime continuums. Anyone could
quickly become lost when traversing them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Infinite Void.” The dragon turtle grew excited. Finally. It was
finally going home!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go.
Hide in a distant place and don’t let the Sithe catch you again,”
Autarch Titanos said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
dragon turtle gave Autarch Titanos a grateful nod, then sent its
massive bulk hurtling through the great rift within the darkness and
into the vast Infinite Void outside. This was its true home, the
place it loved. It was vast beyond measure and filled with infinite
possibilities and marvels.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
Autarch Titanos glanced at the dazzling lights and sights of the
Infinite Void, he couldn’t help but feel a hint of desire as well.
He very much wanted to go out and do some adventuring, but his
Chaosverse was in grave danger. Their Chaosverse didn’t even have a
Lord of Chaos to defend it. How could he be so selfish as to go out
exploring at a time like this?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
a vast palace of light. Almighty Iyerre was seated on a throne up
high, barefoot as always. He was dressed in gray robes which covered
his muscular frame, and his eyes were filled with warmth as he stared
downwards at his subjects. Before him was a teeming mass of servants,
all of them Exalts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Annihilation Hive has already been solved by the cultivators,”
Iyerre said slowly as he gazed at his servants.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Instantly,
there was a commotion amongst the many Sithe Exalts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
underestimated those cultivators.” Iyerre smiled. “I had thought
that I might be able to gain victory through the Annihilation Hive
alone! Now, it seems that taking control over this Chaosverse won’t
be as easy as I had hoped. Very well then. Since the simplest method
has failed… let us go to war! Let the final war begin.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
of the Exalts raised their heads to stare at the almighty Iyerre.
They felt nervousness, anticipation, excitement, and fear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Had
it finally begun? The final war?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Last
time was just a trial run! This time, we’ll fight for real! The
local cultivators have managed to produce a complete Eternal Omega
Sword Dao, which means they are going to become increasingly
powerful. Eventually, they’ll give birth to Omega Emperors! The
longer we wait, the slimmer our chances shall become.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
no way out. Let the final battle begin! If we win, you shall all gain
your freedom and receive countless gifts from me for having aided
me,” Iyerre said. “If we fail, all of you shall fall.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">By
now, Iyerre’s smile had vanished. A terrifying, shocking light
began to emit from his eyes. All of the Exalts below him could sense
his terrifying will and resolve. “Now go! The final war starts
now!” Iyerre commanded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood!”
Frenzied looks appeared in the eyes of all the Exalts. Fear was
meaningless at a time like this. All they could do was prepare to
fight! If they won, they would have everything they could ever dream
of… and in fact, the new Chaoslord Iyerre would give them more than
they could even imagine!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
of the Exalts departed, leaving Iyerre seated by himself atop his
throne within the palace of light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
was smiling again. He murmured softly to himself, “Cultivators, I
already know every trick you possess! You, however, have no idea what
I am capable of. The war starts today. I wonder, cultivators… how
long will you be able to hold out for?”</P>
