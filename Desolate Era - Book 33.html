Chapter 1 - Solesky and Ji Ning
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tens of thousands
of copies of Realmsoul Polo began to disappear from the skies above
the Waveshift Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go to
Crimsonwave Temple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The realmsoul has
already made it clear that only supreme Daolords are capable of
surviving Crimsonwave Temple. We’re not on that level of power yet.
If we go, we’ll die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I won’t be
satisfied if we don’t even go take a look! Plus, there’s always a
chance, no matter how slim. We might be able to seize that chance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if we don’t
go inside, we can wait around outside the palace. We still might have
a chance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the realmsoul
had made the situation perfectly clear, there were still many
Daolords who elected to head towards the Crimsonwave Temple. And of
course, none of the supreme Daolords hesitated at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shall we head to
Crimsonwave Temple together?” Winesage asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s. We’re
quite a ways away from Crimsonwave Temple, and there will be many
dangers along the path. If we join forces, we’ll move faster,”
Palace Lord Dawnstar agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m fine with
that. Badlands, what say you?” Ning looked at Daolord Badlands, who
smiled and nodded: “This is just an avatar. I’ve been prepared
for death this entire time. I might as well go to check out the
Crimsonwave Temple first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s move.”
Winesage smiled slightly. He had naturally heard of Daolord Badlands
long ago; the presence of Badlands’ would naturally be of help.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Winesage and Dawnstar simply flew, while Ning road aboard his flying
vessel as he wished to have a private conversation with Emperor
Solesky. At present, the only ones within that vessel were Ning,
Badlands, and Emperor Solesky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the flying
vessel. Badlands had long ago moved to the front deck to stare off
into the distance, allowing Ning and Emperor Solesky to stand at the
other end of the vessel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother
Solesky.” Ning spoke up. “When you were fortunate enough to
acquire the Voidsea Jadeseal, we agreed that although Ninedust and I
would do our best to protect you, if we were unable to do so you
would immediately hand the seal over. That way, we’d be able to
avoid a true disaster befalling us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Emperor
Solesky had a hint of embarrassment on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But in reality? Both
Ninedust and I were at the brink of death, but you entered secluded
meditation and surrounded yourself with many layers of wards and
barriers, refusing to allow anyone to disturb you at all.” Ning
looked at Emperor Solesky. “Tell me. Why?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Solesky was
now an Eternal Emperor, Ning still viewed him as a brother. He needed
an explanation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh…” Emperor
Solesky shook his head. “I admit, I’m at fault for what happened!
We did indeed agree that I would hide inside the estate while you and
Ninedust would flee while defending against the attackers! To tell
you the truth, when I saw the Voidsea Jadeseal I did indeed feel a
strong, selfish desire to keep it for myself and never give it up to
anyone else. There are no Verge-level Daolords who would be
completely immune to its allure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning simply listened.
He acknowledged this point; otherwise, why would so many incredible
Daolords have lost their lives here? Even the likes of King Gorsch,
Sectlord Timedream, and the Kingfreak had died due to this struggle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I made a certain
decision. I chose to immediately use the Voidsea Jadeseal,” Emperor
Solesky said in a low voice. “This was my plan. I was going to use
the Voidsea Jadeseal to simulate a Daomerge! Since it was a mere
simulation and not an actual Daomerge, I could stop it at any moment.
I didn’t go into true seclusion!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My original plan was
to finish using it up, then immediately notifying the two of you. I
would then be able to swear a lifeblood oath to the others that I had
already used up the Voidsea Jadeseal,” Emperor Solesky said. “Once
those pursuing Daolords were certain that I had already used it up…
although they wouldn’t be happy about it, they wouldn’t continue
the pursuit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “What
you say makes sense.” If the seal was used up, then Ning, Ninedust,
Badlands, and Solesky could’ve all sworn lifeblood oaths and
informed Daolord Shaka, Daolord Snowjoy, and the others that the seal
had been consumed. Their opponents would’ve been forced to give up,
as further battle would’ve been pointless; the seal would’ve
already been gone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After I came to that
decision, I began to use the Voidsea Jadeseal within a temporal
acceleration estate,” Emperor Solesky said. “Roughly a month
later, it was used up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A month?” Ning’s
face tightened. “Then why didn’t you tell me and Ninedust about
it?” Back then, he and Ninedust had yet to fall into danger! If
they had publicized the fact that the Voidsea Jadeseal had been used
up, the ensuing battles would not have occurred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really was
planning to make it public…” Emperor Solesky had an ashamed look
on his face. “But as I completed a full Daomerge simulation with
the Voidsea Jadeseal, the insights I gained were identical to the
insights I would’ve gained from the real Daomerge. Certain insights
I had spent countless years working on in the Dao of Water began to
deepen, and towards the end I entered a very special prajna-type
meditation state.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I… really did not
wish for that state to come to an end. Once the state ended, the flow
of insights would’ve ended as well,” Emperor Solesky said. “Thus,
I immediately separated myself from the outside world and began the
actual Daomerge, allowing myself to engage in the Daomerge while in
that prajna meditative state. In the end… I succeeded at one go
with my Daomerge and gained eternity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, I admit
that I was at fault,” Emperor Solesky said in an embarrassed
manner. “I was planning to listen to your call and hand it over as
soon as you told me to, or immediately publicize the usage of the
Voidsea Jadeseal if I was able to use it up, but… do you know how
rare it is for one to enter a prajna-state like that? I could sense
that I had a chance at succeeding in the Daomerge! I figured, since
you had been able to hold on for a full month, you’d probably be
able to hold on for another month…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well. I’ve given
you a lot of excuses, but in the end I was just selfish and excited.
I saw a chance at the Daomerge and so I risked everything to achieve
it,” Emperor Solesky said with shame.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned to stare
towards the outside of the vessel, where Winesage and Palace Lord
Dawnstar were flying at high speed. His feelings were very
complicated right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Should he be angry? He
simply wasn’t able to get worked up. The Voidsea Jadeseal had
belonged to big brother Solesky to begin with; there was nothing
wrong with him using it up! The Daomerge simulation could indeed be
disrupted, and Solesky hadn’t fully secluded himself; Ning simply
had to message him in order to have him come out! But he ended up in
that prajna-state, a state which was incredibly rare. Most likely, no
one who was about to attempt the Daomerge would choose to voluntarily
end a prajna-state upon entering it. Who knew when the next chance
would be?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Solesky
looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No one is completely
unselfish,” Ning murmured softly. “And the Daomerge is the
ultimate tribulation for all Samsara Daolords. I can’t blame you
for not wishing to halt a prajna-state upon entering the simulated
Daomerge!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the end, I still
went against my promise.” Emperor Solesky remained ashamed. “I
caused you and Ninedust to fall into a perilous situation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You don’t owe me.”
Ning shook his head. “You do owe Ninedust. He was poisoned by
Sectlord Timedream’s redscatter venom.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Redscatter?” This
name caused Emperor Solesky to feel puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is a terrifying
poison meant for dealing with Eternal Emperors. Ninedust is suffering
endless torment right now, and was in such pain that he screamed for
me to kill him,” Ning said slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Emperor
Solesky’s face turned pale. Ninedust was a supreme Daolord. How
much pain did he have to be in, for him to ask for death?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You were in that
prajna-state of yours and refused to end it, choosing to continue
with your Daomerge. I can’t blame you for that.” Ning looked at
Solesky. “But big brother… you owe him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I owe him, and I owe
you,” Emperor Solesky said. “I won’t forget either debts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I suppose the silver
lining for me is that I managed to make a breakthrough,” Ning said.
“And I didn’t really lose anything.” Ning spoke in a casual
manner… but in truth, he had lost quit a bit. He had been forced to
use up his final Sword Hegemon’s Dao-seal, after all. Not even the
likes of Sectlord Timedream or Daolord Shaka had Dao-seals like that!
That dominatingly offensive Hegemon Dao-seal was far more rare and
difficult to make than the more stable defensive-type Hegemon
Dao-seals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And in truth, Ning had
long ago reached the final bottleneck and was about to make a
breakthrough at any moment. Even without this near-disaster, he
would’ve soon broken through. To go from the second step to the
third step wasn’t all that hard, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. Now I know
the situation.” Ning nodded. “Realmsoul Polo won’t let you stay
here forever. You should leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Solesky
nodded. He really didn’t know what else he could say.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, right. Big
brother, I haven’t congratulated you yet.” Ning smiled.
“Congratulations on succeeding in your Daomerge! Countless Daolords
have fallen to this great tribulation, and its rare for even a single
powerful Eternal Emperor to emerge in each generation of Daolords.
Big brother, you are now strong enough to truly wander the universe
without fear for all eternity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Solesky revealed a
slight smile as well. In his heart, he also felt quite excited… but
the guilt he felt towards Ning and the others prevented him from
displaying any of it. “I’ll leave now. I’ll wait for you
outside the Waveshift Realm,” Emperor Solesky said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Emperor Solesky
immediately flew out of the flying vessel and towards the outside
world. A rainbow tunnel soon appeared above him; clearly, Realmsoul
Polo had opened it up just for him. Emperor Solesky immediately flew
into the rainbow tunnel and flew out of the Waveshift Realm.

Chapter 2 - The Fruits
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Less than half a day
after Winesage, Palace Lord Dawnstar, and Ji Ning joined forces to
travel together, Ning received a message from his servant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, I just
received an order from the Hegemon.” The green-robed alien located
within Ning’s personal estate called out respectfully to Ning. He
was responsible for maintaining contact between Ning and the
Brightshore Kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Hegemon?” Ning
asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. The Hegemon
ordered me to deliver a message to you,” the green-robed alien said
respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak,” Ning said
solemnly. In all these years, the Hegemon had only spoken to Ning
twice. The first time was when the Hegemon had asked himself,
Solewind, Greatjoy, and Firesurge to help protect Skyfire Brightshore
on his journey to the alternate universe. The second time was when
the Hegemon had given Ning that spacetime disc. Other than that, the
Hegemon had never reached out to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Hegemon said
that aside from the Voidsea Jadeseals, the Crimsonwave Temple also
contains many precious fruits. The Hegemon hopes for you, Master, to
harvest as many of those fruits as you can. The more the better!
After you do so, the Hegemon would be willing to buy them from you
using either chaos jewels, chaos nectar, rare ingredients, precious
Dao-seals, rare treasures… anything is up for trade.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning narrowed his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Hegemon also
said that any treasure within the Brightshore Kingdom is up for
trade. In fact, he’ll also help you negotiate for treasures held by
the other organizations, including Universe treasures! So long as you
have enough fruit, the Hegemon will help you trade for them,” the
green-robed alien said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” No matter
how calm Ning normally was, he was truly stunned now. Apparently the
Brightshore Hegemon was absolutely willing to pay any price for the
sake of the fruits within the Crimsonwave Temple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course, despite the
enticing offer there was still no way for anyone to forcibly bind a
Universe treasure. The Universe treasure had to approve of its next
master! The Brightshore Kingdom’s Sword Palace already had a
Universe treasure, the shattered sword in its storeroom. However, to
date no one had been able to bind it or be acknowledged by it. Thus,
in truth that Universe treasure was of very limited value.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Hegemon
emphasized for you to do your best to harvest as many of the fruits
within the Crimsonwave Temple as you can,” the green-robed alien
repeated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning pondered silently
for a moment, then nodded slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time went on, one day
after another. Ning and the others continued to advance before
finally, Ninedust completely recovered from the poisoning. In truth,
he had already stopped screaming in agony by the ninth day of his
torment. Clearly, his Dao-heart was slowly growing stronger in
response to the agony, allowing him to repress the pain and prevent
him from screaming by the ninth day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, come, come!
Brother Ninedust’s Dao-heart has been rendered truly incredible by
this misfortune. In the future, your chances at the Daomerge shall be
significantly better than they were before this. Cheers!” Palace
Lord Dawnstar offered a toast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aboard the flying
vessel where Ning, Dawnstar, Winesage, Badlands, and Ninedust. They
were seated in a circle and drinking together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, this journey
was quite an exhausting one for Dawnstar and Winesage. The closer
they moved to Crimsonwave Temple, the more dangerous the path became,
after all. Thankfully, Ning, Dawnstar, and Winesage all joined
together. This alliance of the top three Daolords allowed them to
advance much faster than they otherwise would have.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha.” Ninedust
roared with laughter. “This was indeed a blessing in disguise for
me. My Dao-heart was strengthened by quite a bit. However, to tell
you the truth… when I think back to the torment I suffered, I would
rather have gone without this ‘blessing’. Ugh. What torture that
was! Right, Darknorth. Where’s Solesky? Where the hell is he? I
have one hell of a bone to pick with that guy!” A cold light
flashed through Ninedust’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s succeeded in
his Daomerge and gained eternity,” Winesage said with a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He gained eternity?”
Ninedust stared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Envious, right?”
Palace Lord Dawnstar said. Clearly, he felt quite jealous as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, how did
he end up gaining eternity? Did he use up the Voidsea Jadeseal when
we were fighting for our lives?” Ninedust immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is what
happened…” Ning began to narrate the details of what had happened
to Ninedust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust ground his
teeth as he listened. “That son of a bitch. He entered a
prajna-state, then went into a secluded meditation and attempted his
Daomerge. There’s nothing wrong with that in principle, but he
completely screwed me over.” Although he was still quite furious,
the rage he felt towards Solesky didn’t blaze quite as hot as it
had in the past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’ll definitely
repay you for what he owes you,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, what happened
after that? Your aura seems to be far more powerful than it was in
the past! And how did you end up alongside Winesage and Palace Lord
Dawnstar? What the hell happened?” Ninedust asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After you were hit
by the poison, Darknorth immediately charged out to face those four
supreme Daolords by himself… and he broke through to become a
supreme Daolord as well, sweeping all four of them away! He beat
Daolord Shaka and Daolord Snowjoy into a retreat, with the Kingfreak
and Sectlord Timedream perishing to him,” Palace Lord Dawnstar said
with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whaaaat?” Ninedust
was shocked. He couldn’t help but turn and smack Ning on the chest,
then say with a laugh, “Not bad! You actually killed Kingfreak and
Timedream? Nice, nice, nice! At least you took revenge on my behalf.
Heeeey… doesn’t that mean you are now stronger than me?”
Ninedust stared at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The current Daolord
rankings have brother Winesage ranked as number one, Darknorth as
number two, and me having fallen to number three,” Palace Lord
Dawnstar said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The three of you are
the top three Daolords of all the Endless Territories. I’m now the
weakest one?” Ninedust rubbed his jaw, then glanced sideways at the
nearby Badlands. “Oh wait. There’s one guy weaker than me here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My skills lie in the
Dao of Numerancy, not in battle,” Daolord Badlands said calmly. “If
I chose to go into hiding, you wouldn’t even be able to find me,
Ninedust.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This group of Daolords
continued their advance. More than a year went by, with them moving
closer and closer to Crimsonwave Temple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Endless
Territories. Vastheaven Territory. Vastheaven Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.” A
sonorous voice boomed out within Vastheaven Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The
golden-robed avatar of Ning, along with the avatars of Emperor
Solesky and Daolord Battlemaster, all flew into the air and into the
skies. They saw a gold-furred alien slowly walk towards them, causing
space to tremble and ripple around him like streams of water. He
seemed to walk slowly, but his movements were terrifyingly fast, far
faster than the movements of Daolord Shaka or the Radiant King. He
reached Vastheaven Palace in the blink of an eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Milord Emperor…?”
Ning spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mind if we sit down
to have a chat?” the gold-furred alien said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course! Please
come in and sit down, fellow Daoist.” Emperor Solesky’s avatar
immediately felt a sense of pressure; clearly, this gold-furred alien
was far more powerful than them. Soon, Ning’s avatar and Solesky’s
avatar led the gold-furred alien into the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My name is
Goldisle,” the gold-furred alien said. “Solesky, now that you
have become an Emperor, I’m certain that you’ll soon be paying a
visit to the Palace of Immortals. Darknorth, as a supreme Daolord,
once this matter in the Waveshift Realm is over you should also come
pay the Palace of Immortals a visit. By then, you’ll both know who
I am.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Solesky
exchanged a glance. They knew that this person was most likely a
high-ranking member of the Palace of the Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The foundation of
the Palace of Immortals is far mightier than that of the other five
powers.” The gold-furred alien looked at Ning. “Darknorth, based
on my estimations, you should have already been contacted by Hegemon
Brightshore of the Brightshore Kingdom. He probably wants those
fruits in the Crimsonwave Temple very badly! I’ll tell you this -
the Palace of Immortal wants those fruits just as much.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why can’t you go
harvest it for yourself?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only Daolords are
able to enter Crimsonwave Temple,” the gold-furred alien explained,
then continued, “In truth, Crimsonwave Temple was sent here by
Emperor Waveshift. It should technically belong to our Dao Alliance,
but since Emperor Waveshift established a rule that only Daolords may
enter, we shall follow the rules he set. The Dao Alliance has the
most Daolords, and I am confident that we are able to pay the best
price.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Any treasure! We’ll
make available any of the treasures within the Palace of Immortal’s
treasury for you to choose from. So long as you have enough of the
fruit, you can trade for whatever you wish.” The golden-furred
alien continued, “Even if the treasure you seek is outside of the
Endless Territories and is in the hands of other organizations in
otherverses, we’ll work to help you find whatever it is you tell us
you need, no matter how rare it is. But of course, you have to
procure enough fruit for us.” The golden-furred alien looked at
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt stunned. This
was one hell of a struggle!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can promise to you
that the Dao Alliance will give you a higher price than any of the
other five organizations can offer.” The golden-furred alien
smiled. “Based on what I know, Darknorth, you are quite talented in
the [Heartsword] art as well, yes? Here’s a copy of the complete
[Heartsword] sutra; consider it a show of sincerity from the Dao
Alliance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
amazed. Not at being given a free copy of the [Heartsword]
sword-arts; although it was valuable, giving him a copy for free cost
the Dao Alliance absolutely nothing at all. For them to know that he
was skilled in the [Heartsword] sword-arts, however… this was
impressive. It must be remembered that he had relied on the
[Heartsword] sword-arts to attain the rank of Swordlord within the
Sword Palace! Very few people even in the Brightshore Kingdom knew of
this. The Dao Alliance’s intelligence network truly was incredible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dao Alliance
won’t force you to do anything. Let it all be of your own free
will,” the gold-furred alien said with a smile.

Chapter 3 - Separate Paths
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve said
everything I came to say.” The golden-furred alien rose to his
feet. “I’ll be waiting for you outside the Waveshift Realm,
Darknorth.” He then turned and took a single step forwards, space
twisting and distorting about him as he completely disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was quite
shocked. This sort of dimensional teleportation was something vastly
beyond his capabilities. He mused to himself, “This Eternal Emperor
named Goldisle has to be at least on the same level as the eight
lords of the Sacred Cities.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However… I really
will have to acquire as many of the fruits within Crimsonwave Temple
as I can. My protective divine ability, the Sword Hegemon’s secret
art, and the ingredients I need for the Northbow swords… most
likely, I’ll have to rely on the Crimsonwave Temple’s fruits to
procure what I need for them.” Ning calculated silently to himself,
“I need to upgrade my protective divine ability a bit more, while
the Northbow swords are currently only providing a significant
enhancement to the Blood Drop stance. My weaknesses are quite
glaring. A true Universe treasure is perfect in any manner.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And the Hegemon’s
secret art. My nine novessence arts are no longer cutting it; they
are of increasingly limited use to me,” Ning mused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine novessence
arts had been created by Daolord Allgod. When Ning had been at the
first step, he had no access to any formations and thus used them in
brute-force attacks of incredible power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon becoming a Daolord
of the Second Step, Ning’s Omega Sword Dao - Yin-Yang became of
tremendous use to him. Even when Ning didn’t actually use the nine
novessence arts, the sword-intent of the Omega Sword Dao - Yin Yang
had reached twenty to thirty percent of the power of the arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that he was a
Daolord of the Third Step, the might of his Omega Sword Dao -
Yin-Yang was roughly at sixty to seventy percent of the power of his
nine novessence arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning’s level of
insight increased, his Omega Sword Dao - Yin-Yang would grow
increasingly powerful. The nine novessence arts themselves, however,
wouldn’t change at all. He’d eventually have to discard them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m already a
Daolord of the Third Step! For now, the nine novessence arts are
still of use to me, but once I become a Daolord of the Fourth Step…
by then, they’ll be of negligible use,” Ning mused. “I need
stronger secret arts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My protective divine
ability… the Sword Hegemon’s secret arts… the Northbow swords…
all of them require rare materials!” Ning felt rather eager.
“Perhaps these fruits might even move me closer to reviving my
wife.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Reviving Yu Wei. This
was what Ji Ning truly wanted above all else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Waveshift Realm.
Ning, Ninedust, Winesage, Dawnstar, and Badlands made for a truly
formidable alliance. With Daolord Badlands helping guide them away
from many dangerous areas, they were actually the first group to
arrive before Crimsonwave Temple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There it is.
Crimsonwave Temple.” Ning and the other four raised their heads to
look at the ancient temple before them. The temple was a mixture of
gold and black, and they could sense the aura of age which emanated
from it. Three strange characters hovered in the air above the
temple, and they seemed quite similar to the azureflower seal script
as well as the Dreamdust script. Anyone who saw them would
immediately understand that the three characters represented the name
‘Crimsonwave Temple’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
three characters for a long period of time. He could sense that every
single character contained boundless mysteries within them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The azureflower seal
gave me access to the azureflower mist energy. The Dreamdust script
was of assistance to my mastery over illusions. As for the
Crimsonwave Temple… I can sense that these three characters are
also filled with endless mysteries. Analyzing them, however, will be
quite taxing.” Ning carefully examined them. The ‘crimson’
character seemed to fill the skies with a blazing red aura. The
‘wave’ character made Ning feel as though he saw an endless sea
of waves. The ‘temple’ character seemed to emanate an extremely
solemn and stately aura, almost as though Ning was standing at the
helm of an endless swarm of soldiers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This script was an
extremely advanced, high-level one that was far more advanced than
any language which was commonly used in the Endless Territories.
Every single one of these three characters contained extremely
high-level mysteries of the Dao within them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So we were the first
to reach Crimsonwave Temple.” Ninedust roared with laughter.
“Everyone, I imagine you all know by now how precious the fruits
within Crimsonwave Temple are! We Ancient cultivators also wish to
acquire these fruits. I hope that you’ll be willing to sell us any
of the fruits you find, but of course it’ll all be up to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone seems to
want the fruits within the Crimsonwave Temple.” Palace Lord
Dawnstar said casually, “But for us Daolords, what really matters
is still the Voidsea Jadeseals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Ning,
Winesage, Ninedust, and Badlands all nodded. The fruits were probably
of grave importance to Eternal Emperors, but Ning and the others here
were all Daolords! To them, the supreme Daomerge treasure known as
the Voidsea Jadeseal was what truly mattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, let’s go
take a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are the first to
arrive. We need to seize this opportunity to find the seals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First come, first
serve.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all laughed
merrily as they entered Crimsonwave Temple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crimsonwave Temple was
an incredibly vast place. As soon as the five of them entered, they
turned pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right in front of them
sat two incredibly large corpses, each 540,000 meters tall. Their
enormous black feet were pointed directly at the group, the toenails
looking dagger-sharp. The two corpses were completely black in color
and completely nude, covered only in light green fur. Their faces
were very ugly, while their eyes were flecked with a dark-gold color.
The skin on their heads, however, looked almost like a strange hat
formed by scales. The awesome auras emanating from the two corpses
were so powerful as to cause Ning and the others to tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are Hegemonic
auras!” Ning, Ninedust, Dawnstar, Winesage, and Badlands traded
glances, their faces pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Were the two of them
Hegemons?” Ninedust spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The auras are so
strong that even in death, they bring me a sense of pressure.” Ning
said solemnly, “They should be Hegemons.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why don’t they
have any armor or clothes on them at all?” Dawnstar was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Were they perhaps
looted?” The nearby Winesage chuckled. “The armor used by
Hegemons are undoubtedly extraordinary.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Something’s
wrong.” Daolord Badlands frowned. “These two corpses look
absolutely identical!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning and
the others noticed this as well. There were some members of the same
race who looked very similar to each other, and thus Ning and the
others hadn’t paid too close attention to their appearances. But as
Daolord Badlands had pointed out, these two corpses truly were
absolutely identical. Even the wrinkles on their faces were
identical!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Suddenly, a
streak of rainbow light appeared in front of the entrance to
Crimsonwave Temple, reforming into a towering white-robed man’s
figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Realmsoul Polo.”
Ning and the others turned to look at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your group was the
first to reach Crimsonwave Temple.” Realmsoul Polo weighed Ning’s
group with his gaze, then pointed to the two corpses. “As for these
two corpses… if you wish to call them ‘Hegemons’, I suppose
they could just barely qualify as having reached that level. They are
very close to being comparable to Hegemons in power, after all. On
the other hand, they truly can’t be considered ‘real’ Hegemons!
This is because they are the most powerful guardians which were
produced by the Sithe race. The Sithe created them at enormous
expense to watch over important locations, with Crimsonwave Temple
definitely being one of them. That’s why it had two of these
guardians here! They were eventually slain and Crimsonwave Temple was
conquered. After a series of twists and turns, it ended up in my
master’s hands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust were
secretly startled. These were the most powerful guardians produced by
the Sithe? It was possible to create Hegemon-level guardians?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust and Ning
couldn’t help but think back to that corpse they had seen within
that cave in the Terror Starsea. That corpse had been filled with
countless stone tunnels and many powerful planets. For the sake of
killing that thing, two of the Hegemons of the Endless Territories
had fallen!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the most
valuable possession my master has ever acquired, and he only gained
it after experiencing countless dangers and hardships.” Realmsoul
Polo looked quite proud. “The other organizations of the Endless
Territories could work together and still fail to acquire this
Crimsonwave Temple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. Now look
over there.” Realmsoul Polo pointed off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Previously, the
palace interior had been so dark that they were unable to see what
lay at the other side of it. Crimsonwave Temple was extremely large,
after all, and it was filled with many regions. Now, three tunnels
filled with dark blue light suddenly appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These three tunnels
lead to three different locations within Crimsonwave Temple. You can
try them out for yourself… and if you are lucky, perhaps you’ll
be able to obtain the fruits within Crimsonwave Temple.” Realmsoul
Polo said calmly, “However, acquiring those fruits is extremely
difficult, just as difficult as acquiring the Voidsea Jadeseals will
be.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
and the other four didn’t hesitate at all, immediately moving
towards the three tunnels. For now, it was still the Voidsea
Jadeseals which truly enticed them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, we should
part ways here. Otherwise, if we jointly acquire the jade seals,
there will be no way to divide them up,” Winesage said. “I’ll
choose this tunnel.” He chose one of the three and moved towards
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’ll be up to
your own respective skills.” Palace Lord Dawnstar chose the
leftmost tunnel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust, let’s
take the right one,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust hesitated.
“Darknorth, there should be a Voidsea Jadeseal in each tunnel. If
we go together, how should we split it?” They were good brothers,
but they had to agree on something in advance. Otherwise, this might
end up harming their relationship.

Chapter 4 - Nine Sections
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If it wasn’t for
you, there’s no way we would’ve been able to protect the first
Voidsea Jadeseal, and big brother Solesky wouldn’t have become an
Eternal Emperor,” Ji Ning said. “This next Voidsea Jadeseal will
be yours! Haha, but of course if we find a second one it’ll go to
me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust frowned.
“Darknorth…” There were only three Voidsea Jadeseals left. It
was virtually impossible for them to acquire two of them, especially
seeing as how Winesage and Dawnstar had already gone into those two
tunnels. Later on, even more supreme Daolords would arrive. For them
to even acquire a single Voidsea Jadeseal would be a stroke of
tremendous fortune. Two? Their chances were very, very low.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, you’ll
also need a Voidsea Jadeseal in the future when you attempt the
Daomerge in the future,” Ninedust said. “I think it’s better
for us to just leave it up to speed and strength. May the best man
win?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough, Ninedust. If
you view me as your friend, then stop standing on ceremony with me,”
Ning said seriously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust looked at
Ning. A moment later, he smiled. “Alright!” In this moment,
Ninedust felt true gratitude in his heart. The Daomerge was, without
question, the greatest tribulation any and every Daolord would ever
face! He firmly memorized this moment of grace and buried it deep
within his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning relaxed as well.
Finally, he had convinced the man! Ever since they had entered the
Waveshift Realm, Ninedust had been their mainstay in battle. The
fight against Fiendqueen Windrain, the escape with the Voidsea
Jadeseal in tow… each time, it had been Ninedust who had taken the
brunt of the fighting and done the most work. Was Ning supposed to
just take the next Voidsea Jadeseal for himself, now that he had
broken through in power? Ning simply couldn’t do such a thing! It
would violate his Dao-heart!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, of the
various supreme Daolords who had gathered here, Ning cared the least
about the Voidsea Jadeseals. This was because the Voidsea Jadeseals
were not omnipotent. Second-tier Daolords would be able to use a
Voidsea Jadeseal to fully simulate a Daomerge, but supreme first-tier
Daolords would only be able to do a partial simulation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning himself? He
was just a Daolord of the Third Step. When he became a Daolord of the
Fourth Step, his Omega Sword Dao would become even more overpowered;
he would most likely be at the same level of power as the eight lords
of the Sacred Cities. If he succeeded in his Daomerge, he would
eclipse even Hegemons in power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the Voidsea
Jadeseals weren’t able to do a full simulation for even the other
‘supreme’ Daolords, it probably wouldn’t even be able to
simulate a tenth of his own Daomerge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However… although he
cared the ‘least’ about the Voidsea Jadeseals, that wasn’t
saying much; he still cared immensely! Even though a jade seal would
only allow him to simulate a very small portion of his Daomerge, it
would still save him a bit of time when he attempted the real
Daomerge. That extra window of time and opportunity could well
determine whether his Daomerge would succeed or fail!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s find and
seize the Voidsea Jadeseal first. As for the fruits, we’ll worry
about them later after we learn more about them,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ninedust
nodded. Right now, even if Ning asked for all the fruits to go to
him, Ninedust wouldn’t mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! They
quickly flew deeper into the tunnel of dark blue light they had
chosen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… as they flew
through the dark blue tunnel, they felt almost as though they were
flying through a dimensional doorway. Whoosh! An enormous world
appeared in front of them as they flew out of the tunnel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous world had
a dimensional walkway within it, with countless armored soldiers
clustered on each of the two sides of the tunnel. At the end of this
levitating pathway was an ancient throne, while a golden globe of
light hovered above the entire pathway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning and
Ninedust traded a glance. A dimensional walkway?” Ning was
surprised. When he and Ninedust had been in the Eastroad Territory,
they had traversed a dimensional walkway and ended up being
teleported into that estate deep within the Terror Starsea. Who
would’ve thought they would encounter another one here in
Crimsonwave Temple?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are some
differences.” Ninedust stared off into the distance. The
dimensional walkway within the Eastroad Sect had been surrounded by
empty space, which was why it had been named the Void Pathway! But
this vast world before them seemed far more real, and its aura was
far more powerful. The area around this dimensional walkway was
covered with dark soil and dirt, with many strange trees sprouting
from the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The trees were all very
short and stooped, and the branches were twisted like the bodies of
sea serpents. Only a single tree would grow within a million
kilometer region, and every single tree only bore dark blue fruits.
The fruits emanated an enticing fragrance that spread out in every
direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This enormous world
has a total of 108,000 of these trees,” Ninedust said. As he spoke,
he reached out with his right hand. Whooooosh. His right hand
expanded to become a million kilometers long as he reached out
towards the closest tree, seeking to pluck some of the fruit..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a barrier of
light that seemed like the heavenly firmament itself sprang up. When
Ninedust’s right hand touched the barrier, he was completely unable
to move past it in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Realmsoul Polo
already said that harvesting the fruit will be just as hard as
acquiring the Voidsea Jadeseals,” the nearby Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This barrier is
quite strong. I wasn’t able to shake it at all with my attempt just
now.” Ninedust shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Rainbow light
gathered next to them, forming into a white-robed man. It was
Realmsoul Polo, who smiled. “So the two of you have reached the
first world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Realmsoul.” Nine
and Ninedust both looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look over here.”
Realmsoul Polo pointed towards the left, then waved his hand.
Instantly, the mist far off in the distance to the left began to
dissipate, revealing yet another dimensional hallway that was also
covered with countless warriors. Winesage was standing right there,
with a second Realmsoul Polo by his side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Winesage?” Ning
and Ninedust were both surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now look here.”
Realmsoul Polo now pointed towards the right, causing the mist off in
the distance to once more dissipate and reveal a third dimensional
walkway. This one was filled with just as many of those armored
warriors, with Dawnstar standing amongst them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Palace Lord
Dawnstar?” Ning and Ninedust were starting to understand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you,
along with Winesage and Dawnstar, have separately entered three of
the major sections within the first world of the Crimsonwave Realm,”
Realmsoul Polo said. “The different regions within the first world
are all linked together, and so the two of you should move to acquire
the Voidsea Jadeseals as quickly as possible. If you waste too much
time, the others might end up winning it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is the Voidsea
Jadeseal?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look at the throne
over there.” The realmsoul pointed towards the black throne at the
end of the dimensional walkway. “When you finish breaking through
the many waves of warriors barring your path and reach that throne,
you’ll be teleported to the second world. The Voidsea Jadeseals are
within the second world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.”
Ning’s eyes lit up, as did Ninedust’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then the fruits
here…” Ning immediately changed to the next topic of
conversation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you wish to
harvest the fruit, you must first acquire one of the command seals,”
Realmsoul Polo said. “The command seals are in the third world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust
exchanged a glance. The Voidsea Jadeseals were in the second world,
while the command seals needed to harvest the fruit were in the third
world? That meant that harvesting the fruit would probably be more
difficult than acquiring the Voidsea Jadeseals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s move.” It
didn’t really matter; they had to seize every moment. Winesage was
more powerful than both of them, and he would probably advance more
quickly. After he won a Voidsea Jadeseal, he’d probably go after
one of the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! A pillar of
golden light descended upon them, illuminating the six armored
warriors in the first row before them. The six warriors opened their
eyes, now glowing with golden light, then charged towards Ning and
Ninedust with weapons at the ready.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning transformed into
his three-headed, six-armed mode and drew all six of his Northbow
swords. As for Ninedust, he brought his longstaff to the ready and
immediately charged forwards as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! As
soon as the battle erupted, Ning and Ninedust felt a sense of
pressure. “Every single one of these warriors is comparable to a
second-tier Daolord.” Ning immediately came to this conclusion. An
attack from six second-tier Daolords was more than enough to cause
most supreme Daolords to feel a sense of pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heartworld
projection, descend! Novessence arts, manifest!” Ning didn’t
hesitate or hold back in the slightest. His mighty heartworld
projection came crashing down, suppressing his foes. As for his nine
novessence arts, they followed the principles of his Omega Sword Dao
- Yin-Yang as they furiously wrapped around the warriors, rendering
them almost immobile. However, right at this moment even more of the
golden light rained down from the skies. This time, it covered
virtually the entire dimensional walkway… and as it did, it seemed
to completely block off the power of Ning’s nine novessence arts
and his heartworld projection, rendering them useless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What the hell? It
actually blocked off my heartworld projection and the nine novessence
arts?” Ning raised his head to stare at the golden globe of light
above them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six armored
warriors let out furious, murderous shouts as they began to launch
attacks at Ning and Ninedust without any hesitation at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust
exchanged a glance. The warriors they had fought in the Void Pathway
within the Eastroad Sect had been much weaker. Even the warriors they
had encountered at the very end were merely equivalent to the
lowest-ranked second-tier Daolords in power, and they weren’t able
to ignore the nine novessence arts like this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even the first
warriors here are already comparable to second-tier Daolords,” Ning
sent mentally. “And they are clearly far more numerous as well. All
of them are fighting like madmen, seemingly intent on our deaths.
Even my heartworld projection and nine novessence arts have been
nullified. No wonder Realmsoul Polo said that only supreme Daolords
even stand a chance at surviving this place! It won’t be easy at
all for us to survive this first world.”

Chapter 5 - The Grovekeepers
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Ninedust
clearly surpass the six warriors in power, but the six warriors had
bodies comparable to top-tier Eternal treasures. Each time they were
knocked backwards, they would quickly regroup and charge towards the
two once again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why the hell are
they continuing to attack?” Ninedust sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re clearly
overpowering them, but they continue to press the assault.” Ning
frowned as well. “Let’s just keep advancing. Forget about them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning and
Ninedust clearly held the upper hand, and so they smashed their way
through and continued the advance. As they did, however, six more
rays of light shone down from that golden globe above them.
Instantly, six more warriors opened their golden eyes and began to
charge towards them. The six original warriors didn’t let up the
pursuit either, continuing to press the assault. Now, there were a
total of twelve warriors assaulting them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s not good.”
Ning and Ninedust both turned pale. “We’re clearly stronger than
them, but they aren’t even alive. Their bodies can’t be damaged
in the slightest. If they continue to harass us like this, if we
advance we’ll have to face eighteen of them, then twenty four of
them. More and more of them will come to life and start attacking
us.” Ninedust began to grow anxious. “Even if we work together,
we won’t be able to last for very long if a hundred of these things
attack us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Ning was
worried about the same thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Ning attacked in
a ghostly manner, his six arms striking out with six Northbow swords
and striking one of the warriors. That warrior was knocked flying
backwards until it flew outside the dimensional walkway. Its golden
eyes instantly dimmed. Moments later, some sort of invisible string
seemed to jerk it back into the dimensional walkway where it rejoined
the other warriors. This time, however, it no longer attacked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aha!” Ning’s
eyes lit up. “Knock them off the walkway. That’s all we need to
do!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, is that it?”
Ninedust was delighted as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! The
two of them were clearly much stronger. Now tha they knew what to do,
they began to focus on knocking the armored warriors out of the
dimensional walkway. In each case, the eyes of the warriors would go
dim before they were pulled back into the ranks of the other
warriors, now completely immobile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
continued to press the advance. Each time, they faced a total of six
warriors! Some specialized in sword-arts, some specialized in
whip-arts, some specialized in staff-arts, some specialized in
axe-arts, some specialized in long-distance attacks… Ning and
Ninedust were faced with all sorts of varied attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust
continued to press the assault for more than three days. Finally…
from this day forth, they had to fight seven warriors each time!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seven warriors… eight
warriors… the number slowly began to rise. Each warrior continued
to merely have the power of a second-tier Daolord, but the way they
worked together became increasingly intricate and marvelous! Knocking
them off the dimensional walkway became harder and harder, especially
given how incredibly large the walkway was. The width alone was
roughly a million kilometers! Each time, Ning and Ninedust had to
fight with their full power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nine months later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twenty-six of the
armored warriors were surrounding and assaulting the two of them in
perfect concert. Their bodies were completely invulnerable, allowing
them to focus on attacks without neededing to defend at all. Ning and
Ninedust worked together as well, slowly driving one warrior after
another to the ends of the dimensional walkway. They fought for more
than two hours before finally sending the last one flying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m so done right
now. I’m exhausted.” Ninedust slumped to the ground. “I need a
break. I can’t take any more, I really can’t.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat down as well,
staring at what lay ahead of them. They had only traversed roughly
half of the dimensional walkway, and the further they advanced the
more difficult it would be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is torture.”
Ninedust shook his head. “We’ve been fighting nonstop for nine
full months, and I’ve been using chaos jewels to replenish my
energy. Sure, I have plenty of them, but fighting at full power for
this long is mentally exhausting. I’m more tired right now than I
ever have been in my entire life. How about you, Darknorth?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m kind of tired
as well,” Ning said. In truth, he wasn’t nearly as bad off. He
was a Heartforce Cultivator, after all, and his close combat skills
were exquisite. This was why he wasn’t as exhausted as Ninedust
was. Still, Ning elected to rest alongside Ninedust for a time, as
the two were able to advance faster when fighting together. If he
tried to fight by himself, he’d move much more slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…”
Suddenly, a deep, rumbling laugh rang out from the distant black
soil. Ning and Ninedust sat up straight in surprise as they turned to
stare at the black soil off in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, the black,
earthy ground began to slowly bulge upwards, forming into a humanoid
figure of dark soil. The black earth golem was the size of a
mountain, and he cracked his mouth into a grin. “Haha! Tired
already, kids? Honestly, the two of you really don’t know your
limits. Why have you come to attempt this pathway by yourselves? You
should work in groups of four or five. Wouldn’t that be much
faster?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who are you,
senior?” Ninedust called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Me? I was
manufactured by the Sithe. I’ve been here my entire life, taking
care of these trees. The Sithe called me the ‘Grovekeeper’.”
The black earth golem boomed with laughter. “But the Sithe were
wiped out long ago, and my current master is Emperor Waveshift. Of
course, my mission remains the same - to take care of these trees.
The nine regions within Crimsonwave Temple have a total of nine
Grovekeepers, and I’m one of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust both
nodded slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior,” Ning
called out, “Who were the Sithe, exactly? They seem to have been
quite powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Powerful? Hah! Of
course they were powerful! Their war encompassed countless realms. I
don’t even know how many of you cultivators died as a result of
it.” The black earth golem continued, “But of course, the Sithe
were still defeated in the end. They were wiped out! The Crimsonwave
Temple experienced quite a few things before ending up in Emperor
Waveshift’s hands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust were
intrigued. So the great battle in the Terror Starsea known as the
‘Dawn War’ had been fought against the Sithe race?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Sithe paid an
unbelievable price to create Crimsonwave Temple,” the black earth
golem said. “Crimsonwave Temple holds more marvels than you can
imagine, and it was used to plant all of these divine trees around
us! The nine regions here represent nine different types of divine
trees, and each type is incredibly useful. The Sithe were completely
wiped out, with their most powerful experts being completely
slaughtered and their treasures taken away. That was also what
happened to Crimsonwave Temple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Their most powerful
experts were all wiped out?” Ning and Ninedust couldn’t help but
sigh. The Sithe had been incredibly powerful, so powerful that they
were able to create Hegemon-level guardians and locations like
Crimsonwave Temple! And yet, all of their supreme experts had been
wiped out, essentially driving their race to extinction. In the end,
for any race, what truly mattered was the presence and existence of
their supreme experts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Did Emperor
Waveshift set down the dimensional walkway, or did the Sithe?” Ning
asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Sithe, of
course.” The black earth golem explained, “Emperor Waveshift
certainly doesn’t have the ability to do so! The Sithe used these
dimensional walkways to train and temper their Daolords. All of these
varied golems here provide an excellent source of combat experience,
after all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust were
startled. Right. It made sense. This place was indeed a superb place
to train. Ning had only recently become a Daolord of the Third Step,
but he was lacking in actual combat experience. As he fought against
all of these warriors, Ning had accumulated more and more actual
battle experience and as a result was able to discover some of the
weaknesses still inherent to his sword-arts. Upon discovering those
weaknesses, he was able to find a way to improve his sword-arts and
thus more quickly move towards becoming a Daolord of the Fourth Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ninedust, he
would be able to come up with even more powerful techniques. Daolord
Shaka, the Radiant King… these ‘supreme Daolords’ all had
reached the same level of enlightenment into the Dao, so why was it
that they varied so much in power? It was because they all had
developed different attacks!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Dao was that
of the Omega, and thus it represented the true apex of what was
possible. This was why, whenever he wanted to truly upgrade his
technique, he would have to first reach a higher level of
enlightenment. This wasn’t true for the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I believe the Sithe
had many similar locations which they used to train Daolords,” the
black earth golem said. “Their Daolords were all extremely
powerful, with many reaching the ‘supreme’ level of power.
Unfortunately, their ambitions were too vast. They sought to enslave
all cultivators and take control over the destinies of all living
things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And so, in the end
they had to be wiped out.” The black earth golem shook his head.
“Let me give you another word of advice. It’ll be virtually
impossible for the two of you to fight through to the third world by
yourselves. I urge you to work together with a few more supreme
Daolords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. Thank you.”
Both Ning and Ninedust nodded. At present, what they really cared
about was the Voidsea Jadeseal in the second world. The command seals
in the third world were of secondary concern.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The various fruit
trees within the nine major regions all ripen at different intervals,
going from every 30,000 chaos cycles to every 100,000 chaos cycles,”
the black earth golem said. “This is why Crimsonwave Temple will
only be opened up once every 30,000 chaos cycles at most! However,
this is the first time Crimsonwave Temple has been opened up in a
very long time, and so all of the fruits in all nine regions are ripe
for the harvesting. Seize the opportunity! If you miss it, you’ll
have to wait another 30,000 chaos cycles… and by then, you’ll
only have access to the fruits in two of the regions.”

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_6___Command_Seals"></A>
Chapter 6 - Command Seals
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anywhere from 30,000
chaos cycles to 100,000 chaos cycles? Ji Ning and Ninedust exchanged
a glance, the same thought running through both their minds: when the
competition over the Voidsea Jadeseals concluded, the two of them
would definitely have to do their best to acquire some of the fruit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning felt
particularly eager. Although the Voidsea Jadeseal was perhaps more
valuable, Ning also knew that it would be of limited use to him. The
Daomerge for his Omega Sword Dao was simply going to be so incredibly
difficult that he felt zero confidence in his abilities to succeed in
it. As a result, he viewed the fruits with great importance as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given how badly the
various Hegemons and the Dao Alliance wanted the fruits, they might
be of use to him in reviving his wife. As for the Daomerge? If he
failed, he’d die. By now, Ning had seen past both life and death.
If he could revive his wife and then happily live together alongside
her and their daughter Brightmoon for over 100,000 chaos cycles, he
really wouldn’t mind failing his Daomerge. His greatest wish was to
bring his wife back. Ordinary mortals were only able to live for a
hundred years; to be able to spend over 100,000 chaos cycles
alongside his loved ones was a true blessing. What did he have to
complain about?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dare I ask, senior,”
Ning said, “How many of those fruit-picking command seals are
there?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A total of nine in
total, and they are each attuned to one of the nine regions,” the
black earth golem said. “Each of the nine regions holds a different
types of tree within them. Once you earn a command seal, you’ll be
able to see all of the divine trees and fruits located within a
certain region.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How much fruit is
within each region?” Ning and Ninedust were surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well… let’s use
this current region, the third region, as an example. If you can
acquired the third command seal, then I’ll harvest all 108,000
fruits on your behalf and give them to you,” the black earth golem
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
decided that he had to do his absolute utmost to acquire the command
seals! Every single command seal represented an enormous number of
fruits.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior,” Ninedust
immediately asked, “What good are these fruits? What can they be
used for?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pill-making!” The
black earth golem explained, “They can be used to forge certain
legendary pills that will drive any Eternal Emperors mad with
desire.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning asked, “Senior,
which of the fruits in the nine regions are the most valuable?”
Since there were nine command seals in total, he’d definitely have
to try and find the most valuable one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hey, this kid’s
pretty smart.” The black earth golem chortled. “Then I’ll go
ahead and tell you - the ninth command seal is the most valuable one.
The fruits in the ninth region ripen once every 100,000 chaos cycles!
The sixth, seventh, and eighth command seals are equivalent in value;
those fruits ripen once every 90,000 chaos cycles! The third, fourth,
and fifth command seals correspond to fruits that ripen once every
60,000 chaos cycles, while the fruits for the first and second
command seals are the least valuable, ripening once every 30,000
chaos cycles.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes lit up as
he memorized this. “Thank you, senior.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, if we
join forces we should be able to seize at least a few of those
command seals,” Ninedust said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…. quite a few
supreme Daolords will be taking part in this. Count your blessings if
you can even seize one of them,” the black earth golem laughed
merrily. He then quickly dissipated, his body reverting to chunks of
dirt that fell down to the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That little chat
with the Grovekeeper really brought my spirits up,” Ninedust
chortled. “Let’s keep charging.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning was
filled with eagerness as well. “Attack!” The two charged
forwards, side-by-side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After chatting with the
Grovekeeper, Ning now understood more about this place. This was a
place which the Sithe had used to train their Daolords and give them
more combat experience, helping them discover flaws in their
techniques. Naturally, there was no way they would allow heartworld
projections or secret arts to be used, as that would defeat the
entire purpose.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From this alone, it
seemed clear that the many varied techniques these warriors used
would indeed give Ning many new insights into his Omega Sword Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the entrance to the
Crimsonwave Temple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
One figure after another charged through the entrance, not even
wanting to waste time admiring the characters ‘Crimson’ ‘Wave’
‘Temple’ above them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” There were
seven figures in total, and they all stared in shock at the two
hideous, towering, black-skinned, green-furred, golden-eyed figures
in front of them. The aura in particular caused all seven of these
supreme Daolords to shudder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hegemons?” All
seven of them were stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Streams of rainbow
light manifested next to them, resolving into a white-robed man who
smiled at them. “Do not be alarmed. These two are not Hegemons, but
they did have power comparable to a Hegemon’s. They are the most
powerful guardians which were produced by the Sithe race, who created
them at enormous expense to watch over Crimsonwave Temple. However,
the two of them were killed and Crimsonwave Temple ended up in my
master’s hands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven supreme
Daolords were just as stunned as Ning had been when he had heard this
information. Realmsoul Polo couldn’t help but feel smug; he was
extremely proud of his master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where are Winesage
and Darknorth?” A silver-robed figure amongst the seven spoke out.
This was Palace Lord Cloudwalker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They’ve gone
inside to seek out the Voidsea Jadeseals. These three corridors head
to three different places, and there is a Voidsea Jadeseal at the end
of each.” Realmsoul Polo pointed towards three deep blue hallways
that appeared at the other side of the temple. The seven supreme
Daolords instantly turned anxious upon hearing this. The realmsoul
continued, “But don’t be impatient; the Voidsea Jadeseals are not
so easily won. Although you’ve arrived nearly a year later than
them, you still stand a very good chance at earning the seals. But of
course, that’s only if you work together.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Which tunnels did
they choose?” Daolord Dreamlord, bloodblade in his arms, spoke out
in a cold voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They separated and
chose to go through all three tunnels,” Realmsoul Polo said. “The
rest is up to you and luck.” After finishing his words, he
dissipated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven supreme
Daolords in the temple exchanged a glance. “Damn the two of them.
Winesage and Darknorth repeatedly used their heartworld projections
to slow us down, forcing us to gather together to resist them in
unison. Otherwise, we would’ve reached Crimsonwave Temple long
ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s cut the
crap. What should we do next?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have you decided
where we should go?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We arrived later
than them to begin with. If we work by ourselves, we won’t have any
chance at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven supreme
Daolords weren’t fools. They quickly decided to separate up into
two squads. The first squad consisted of Ninestone, Palace Lord
Cloudwalker, Shaka, and Snowjoy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second squad
consisted of Dreamlord, Tigrone, and Skyshatter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Which one should we
choose? They’ve already gone up ahead of us. I wonder which path
Winesage choose?” Both squads worried the most about running into
Winesage. Even someone as incredibly powerful as Ning, who was able
to suppress the ‘old’ Winesage in might, had been completely
crushed by Winesage when the latter had used his Universe treasure.
Ning’s only choice had to been to rely on the speed and concealing
properties of his Shadowless evasion art in order to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we run into
Winesage, we’ll be in serious trouble.” This is what both squads
were worried about.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Based on my
understanding of Winesage…” Daolord Skyshatter had an ugly scar
on his face, and his voice was very cold. “Although he looks calm
and collected, he’s an extremely arrogant and domineering person
who views himself as without peer amongst Daolords! Now that he has a
Universe treasure, he’s only going to feel even more arrogant than
he did in the past. He would naturally choose the central hallway.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. Then let’s
avoid that one.” There really was no other options; the Waveshift
Realm placed tight restrictions on spacetime techniques, and the
situation inside Crimsonwave Temple was even worse. It was completely
impossible for them to use temporal inversion to see what happened
here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then we’ll take
the left,” Palace Lord Cloudwalker said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll take the
right,” Daolord Dreamlore said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dimensional walkway
of the first world inside the Crimsonwave Temple. Ning and Ninedust
had already battled their way past countless warriors, but more waves
of those warriors continued to assail them. Right now, there was a
total of twenty-nine warriors surrounding and assaulting them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh. The Ninedust
Sectlord transformed into an enormous wave of water, his invulnerable
aquaform having transformed into a vast sea. If he so chose, he would
be able to easily transform into a sea that covered hundreds of
millions of kilometers, if not more. The vast sea swept through all
of the warriors, slowing them down and making it difficult for them
to effectively work together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of impeding
these armored warriors, the Ninedust Sectlord’s ‘invulnerable
aquaform’ was far superior than the techniques Ning had available
to him. No matter how strong Ning was, he was only able to block a
few of the warriors at once, whereas Ninedust’s invulnerable
aquaform was able to have an impact on all of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” This was a
site which the Sithe had used to train their Daolords; a mere
‘invulnerable aquaform’ wouldn’t be able to defeat it that
easily. The warriors moved closer to each other and the golden light
in their eyes shone even more brightly, causing golden light to
spring up amongst them and cause them to join together into a whole.
This caused the impact of the vast waves to be greatly lessened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he
remained the mainstay in this fight. He furiously and laboriously
seeking out opportunities to smash one warrior after another off of
the dimensional walkway, despite the formation the warriors were
using.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” After
knocking yet another warrior off, both Ning and Ninedust noticed
something behind them. Three more figures had suddenly appeared at
the other end of the dimensional walkway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first figure was a
red-robed youth who was carrying a bloodblade in his arms, surrounded
by a towering, baleful aura. This was Daolord Dreamlore, a man who
had been very low-key up until he had defeated the Radiant King in
his first major battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second man was a
muscular man dressed in extremely thick gray armor whose eyes glowed
with green light. This was the most powerful Daolord the Aberrants
had, Daolord Tigrone. His divine body was so tough that not even King
Gorsch had been able to injure him in the slightest. Daolord Tigrone
had been the main reason why King Gorsch had died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The last one was an
insidious, scar-faced man who looked extremely mysterious. All Ning
knew was that he was a Daolord of the Dark Kingdom known as Daolord
Skyshatter. His real level of power was a mystery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gazes of Daolord
Dreamlord, Daolord Tigrone, and Daolord Skyshatter all fell upon
Ning.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s them.” Ji
Ning’s face tightened slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, this will
be troublesome. Daolord Dreamlore’s power is unfathomable, while
Daolord Tigrone’s defenses are superior to any I’ve ever seen. As
for Daolord Skyshatter, he’s a Daolord of the Dark Kingdom but was
accepted by Daolord Dreamlore and Daolord Tigrone as a partner. He
must be incredibly strong as well.” The Ninedust Sectlord frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry about
them. They were a full year behind us. It won’t be that easy for
them to catch up to us,” Ning said. “Seize every moment and do
your best to push as many of the warriors out of the dimensional
walkway.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ninedust
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two paid no more
heed to the three Daolords behind them and began to focus on
attacking the warriors up ahead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Voidsea
Jadeseals are in the second world, while the command seals needed to
harvest the fruit are in the third world.” Realmsoul Polo once more
gave detailed instructions to the new arrivals. These supreme
Daolords were amongst the most incredibly talented figures alive in
the endless Territories; it was important for him to give them good
guidance. His master, Emperor Waveshift, was doing this for the sake
of tempering these supreme Daolords and make them even better. The
realmsoul naturally had to keep them fully informed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Got it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s move.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Tigrone,
Daolord Dreamlore, and Daolord Skyshatter began to advance as well,
and they immediately began to suffer the attacks of the armored
warriors in front of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. Darknorth and
Ninedust are fools. Why aren’t they using their secret arts or a
heartworld projection? Are they trying to use this as a training
exercise?” Daolord Skyshatter frowned. Instantly, he sent a
tri-colored surge of energy sweeping out to surround the area,
wrapping itself around the warriors around him. However, the golden
light covering the entire dimensional walkway immediately swirled
forwards to cover it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In raw power alone,
Daolord Skyshatter’s secret arts were actually slightly stronger
than even Ning’s nine novessence arts!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? My secret arts
were nullified?” Daolord Skyshatter was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust
ignored the three behind them. They were very experienced in fighting
against these warriors, and were able to work together perfectly.
Ninedust was responsible for tying down and slowing the warriors,
while Ning was responsible for delivering the final blow that knocked
them off the walkway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time continued to flow
on. Another year passed in the blink of an eye, with Ning’s team
slowly advancing. The further they advanced, the more warriors
assaulted them. Knocking the warriors off the dimensional walkway
became increasingly powerful, as there was now a total of thirty-two
warriors assaulting Ning’s team. This represented a force of
thirty-two second-tier Daolords who were able to work together
perfectly and who were invulnerable to all harm!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just beating them
wasn’t enough. You had to knock them off the dimensional walkway.
It was simply too difficult! By now, Ning’s team needed to spend
five or six days in battle before defeating a ‘wave’..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Ninedust
transformed into a massive wave, but the upper half of his body was
still visible. He continued to wield his longstaff, sending it
smashing through the waves and knocking one enemy aside after
another, doing his best to give Ning enough space to work in. As for
Ning, he was even fiercer than he had been in the past, with each of
his six Northbow swords containing astonishing amounts of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, Darknorth,
these warriors are becoming increasingly difficult to defeat, but
this process has been quite beneficial to my staff-arts. I’ve come
up with a supreme technique of my own!” The Ninedust Sectlord let
out a loud laugh as he swept out his longstaff. Whoosh! The water
around him instantly formed into a whirlpool that was centered around
his longstaff, causing layers of spatial illusions to appear around
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crimsonwave Temple
placed extremely tight restrictions on spacetime techniques, but
Ninedust was still able to cause spatial illusions to appear. In the
outside world, the power of this strike would’ve been
inconceivable!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The staff smashed
against an armored warrior, sending it flying away as if it was
nothing more than a tiny little shrimp.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come up with a few
more ‘supreme techniques’ like that,” Ning said with a laugh.
“Later on, you can let these other Daolords get a taste of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. I’ll make
sure they know that I’m not easy to deal with.” Ninedust had been
intoxicated by this life of battle. These fights were helping him to
discover many of his flaws and allowed him to perfect them. When he
was able to reach a certain level of perfection, he was naturally
able to come up with a new supreme technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The other supreme
Daolords have either fused two Supreme Daos or three Supreme Daos…”
Ning mused silently to himself, “But they still have room for
improvement. They can gain new insights and thus come up with more
and better supreme techniques. I, however, have already reached the
apex! It’ll be very hard for me to improve in the near future.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. I suppose I
should focus on the [Heartsword] for now.” Ning was beginning to
realize how hard it would be for him to upgrade his Omega Sword Dao
any further. None of his five stances had been able to reach the
fourth stage, and so he immediately chose to work on the [Heartsword]
sword-art instead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Heartsword]…”
A complete copy of the full [Heartsword] sutra appeared within Ning’s
mind. The golden-furred alien had given it to Ning’s avatar during
his visit to Vastheaven Palace, and Ning’s avatar had immediately
studied it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Heartsword] art
was an incredibly marvelous and miraculous sword-art! In importance,
it actually succeeded the legacies of Hegemons! Although it was
‘merely’ a sword-art, the Dao Alliance absolutely refused to
transmit it to any other organizations. Even the Brightshore Kingdom
was only able to procure the first ten stances after paying an
utterly enormous price. If you wished to learn the full thing, you
had to be a member of the Dao Alliance and pay an incredible price
for it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s performance in
the Waveshift Realm had been simply dazzling. He had risen to
prominence by slaughtering Sectlord Timedream and the Kingfreak, and
his power was second only to Winesage! The Dao Alliance was naturally
going to invest its resources in him. Given that they also had a
favor to ask of Ning, they chose to just go ahead and gift the entire
[Heartsword] to Ning! But of course, Ning was not permitted to
transmit this to any others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How marvelous.”
The more Ning learned regarding the [Heartsword] art, the more
stunned he felt. The [Heartsword] art was a supreme sword-art that
represented the perfect combination of Ki Refining principles,
Fiendgod Refining principles, and Heartforce Cultivation principles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Heartsword’s
sword-arts, on a stand-alone basis, were merely on the same level as
Emperor Mirrorsnow’s! However, this perfect combination of all
three paths of cultivation made it so that his rather unremarkable
sword-arts were able to unleash astonishing levels of power that
surpassed even the likes of the eight lords of the Sacred Cities,
putting him incredibly close to the Hegemon level! He was known as
the Emperor who was closest to the Hegemons in power! How terrifying
a concept was this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My current
sword-arts have already transcended both space and time, putting me
on par with Emperor Mirrorsnow’s level,” Ning mused. “If I can
master the fifteenth stance of the [Heartsword], I’ll have eclipsed
the eight lords of the Sacred Cities and be very close to the
Hegemons as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later, Ning
chuckled. That was nothing more than a fantasy. Ever since Emperor
Heartsword had departed, there had never been a second cultivator
capable of mastering the fifteenth stance of the [Heartsword]! This
was because this sword-art was simply too arcane and abstruse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first stance was
known as the ‘Heartsword’ stance. The second stance, the
‘Killsword’ stance. The third stance, the ‘Great Firmament’
stance. The fourth stance, the ‘Horizon’s Edge’ stance. The
fifth stance, the ‘Silent World’ stance. The sixth stance, the
‘Unicorn’s Heart’ stance. The seventh stance, the ‘Cosmic
Heart’ stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first six stances
were at least understandable. Starting from the seventh stance,
however, the technique became increasingly abstruse. Thankfully, Ning
was incredibly talented in sword-arts and thus he mastered the
seventh stance in the Sword Palace of the Brightshore Kingdom. It
could be said that he had gained an elementary level of mastery in
the [Heartsword].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, this was still
nothing more than an elementary level of mastery. The later stances
were even more difficult to comprehend!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighth stance was
named ‘Ineffable’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ninth stance was
named ‘Blissheart’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tenth stance was
named ‘Killheart’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eleventh stance was
named ‘Teardrop’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twelfth stance was
named ‘Swordtide’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thirteenth stance
was named ‘Snowland Blood’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fourteenth stance
was named ‘Remorseless Unto Death’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fifteenth stance
was named ‘One Sword, One World’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These stances were all
incredibly abstruse, but they could be divided into several different
tiers. The eighth stance to the tenth stance represented the first
‘tier’! Most cultivators skilled in the [Heartsword] were stuck
here in the first tier, unable to advance any further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eleventh and
twelfth stances represented the second tier. Supposedly, cultivators
who reached this level would see the power of the [Heartsword]
technique skyrocket, but in every generation the number of
cultivators who could reach this level could be counted on one hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thirteenth and
fourteenth stances represented the third tier. According to the
records, only a single major power aside from Emperor Mirrorsnow had
ever reached this level, but his name was a mystery! The records
stated that at this level, one’s level of power would skyrocket by
such a level that using the [Heartsword] art provided an even greater
boost in power than using a Universe treasure!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fifteenth and final
stance! Only Emperor Heartsword, the creator of this technique, had
ever reached this level! By relying on this stance, he had been able
to unleash quasi-Hegemon levels of power from his fairly mundane
sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I can even reach
the third tier, I might be able to give Hegemons a good fight once I
become a Daolord of the Fourth Step,” Ning mused. This truly was an
unearthly, incredible set of sword-arts, but it was also the hardest
of all sword-arts to train in. The actual movements to each stance
were not that important; what really mattered was the ‘heart’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to begin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the tallest of
buildings have to start from the ground floor. Ning held all six
Northbow swords as he fought, occasionally injecting some of the
‘Cosmic Heart’ elements into his stances. At other times, he’d
attempt to replicate the eighth stance, ‘Ineffable’. The
[Heartsword] art focused on the heart, not on the actual stances, and
so it was incredibly difficult to train in. Ning was incredibly
talented in heartforce and had the largest heartworld of all the
supreme Daolords in the Endless Territories, but he still found
training in this technique to be extremely laborious. Despite that,
he was still able to at least generate part of the ‘feeling’ of
the eighth ‘Ineffable’ stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ‘Ineffable’
stance couldn’t be manufactured intentionally. One had to follow
one’s own heart and completely infuse it into one’s sword-arts.
Everything had to follow the natural flow… and when you were able
to sense it, it would have been completed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighth stance
actually wasn’t that bad. The later ones were even more abstruse
and more difficult to study.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 8 - Ineffable, Blissheart
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ineffable.” When
this sword-stance struck out, an invisible current of heartforce
would naturally merged into it; there was no need to ‘force’ it
or do it on purpose.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A layer of thin,
invisible, mist-like heartforce appeared on the surface of the sword,
causing the power of the attack to immediately increase and even
speed up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a strange
feeling.” Ji Ning’s six Northbow swords howled forth, knocking
down all of the warriors before him. Some were sent flying backwards,
others were bowled over. “This is the first time I’ve felt
something like this. When I use this sword-art, I feel as though I’ve
transformed into a sword. What a wonderful, enjoyable feeling. I feel
as though the power of my sword-arts has risen by 20%.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mastering the seventh
stance, ‘Cosmic Heart’, merely represented gaining a basic grasp
of the [Heartsword]; it was of negligible benefit to him. The eighth
stance, ‘Ineffable’, already allowed him to increase the power of
his sword-arts by 20%! It must be remembered that Ning trained in the
Omega Sword Dao; improving upon the power of his sword-arts was
extremely difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, you found
a way to enhance the strength of your swords?” Ninedust had been
working alongside Ning, and he immediately sensed Ning’s
transformation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, you’ve found
ways to improve yourself. Why can’t I?” Ning was in a delightful
mood. After just five years of researching the [Heartsword] art, he
had become proficient in the eighth stance. This was actually much
faster than he had predicted. According to the records he had
reviewed, the [Heartsword] was supposed to be extremely difficult to
train in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had forgotten,
however, that his sword-arts were derived from the third-stage Omega
Sword Dao, while his heartforce made him the strongest Heartforce
Cultivator in all the Endless Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After entering
Crimsonwave Temple, I’ve developed two consummate techniques,”
Ninedust said smugly. “I’ve grown much more than you have.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You won’t be smug
for much longer.” Ning began to work on the ninth stance, the
‘Blissheart’ stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This feeling truly
is absolutely marvelous.” Ning actually closed his eyes as he
continued to execute his sword-arts, but he maintained in complete
control of himself and his surroundings. “I understand. This
sword-art really can throw the wielder into a state of utter
contentment and bliss.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He immersed himself in
this feeling. Just six short months later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blissheart.”
Ning’s sword-light transformed once more. In the past, every strike
had been covered with a mist-like layer of heartforce. Now, the mist
was clearly much denser than before, and with each strike it was like
a fog drifted in alongside it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh. No
sword-shadows could be seen around Ning; the only thing visible was a
series of mist-streaks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
Ning’s power increased dramatically, allowing him to blow through
the warriors like rotted wood. The warriors, however, gathered
themselves and continued their furious attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, y-you…
you grew stronger yet again?” Ninedust was flabbergasted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…” Ning
laughed loudly. “I told you a while ago that you won’t be smug
for much longer. Now do you know how badass I am?” He had mastered
the ‘Blissheart’ stance, and his sword-arts increased 50% in
power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can they be
advancing this quickly?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Tigrone,
Daolord Dreamlore, and Daolord Skyshatter were in the same
dimensional walkway, and they were also fighting the endless hordes
of warriors. They were stunned by what they saw. Given that the three
of them working together, they technically should’ve held the upper
hand over Ning and Ninedust! A while ago, they had been slowly but
steadily narrowing the gap between them and Ning’s team. Their
initial calculations had indicated that they would be able to catch
up in five or six years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s mastery of the
‘Ineffable’ stance didn’t have too much of an impact on their
calculations… but now that Ning had mastered the ninth stance,
‘Blissheart’, the difference was apparent!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth is
already incredibly strong. How could he have grown even stronger?”
Daolord Skyshatter frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth
has been training for less than a full chaos cycle, but he’s
already become a supreme Daolord.” Daolord Dreamlore said coldly,
“He naturally has plenty of room to improve. I imagine he’s come
up with a new supreme technique for himself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Radiant King,
Palace Lord Dawnstar, and the others had all slowly developed their
supreme techniques after becoming Daolords of the Fourth Step. The
same was currently true of Ninedust as well. As Dreamlore saw it,
Ning was most likely searching for the ultimate attack which would
fit himself the most.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth
truly is difficult to deal with,” Daolord Tigrone growled. “To
beat the two of them and seize the Voidsea Jadeseal won’t be easy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s only two
of them but three of us,” Daolord Dreamlore said coldly. “We
aren’t idiots like Kingfreak and Timedream.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. When we work
together, only Winesage is a threat to us.” Daolord Skyshatter felt
quite confident as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tigrone felt certain he
possessed the strongest defensive abilities of all the supreme
Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dreamlore felt certain
he possessed the strongest attacks of all the supreme Daolords; he
had actually beaten the Radiant King in a head-on fight!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Skyshatter was
equal to the other two in might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The deceased Timedream
and Kingfreak were ranked well below the top ten in close combat
power, while Timedream’s heartforce techniques were useless against
Ning. The Tigrone-Skyshatter-Dreamlore alliance was completely
different! The only one they worried about was Winesage; they didn’t
care about any other Daolords at all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Winesage has a
Universe treasure, but I have to admit that Darknorth is a truly
dazzling figure,” Daolord Dreamlore said coldly. “We have to
fight with all our power. Otherwise, we’ll probably be defeated by
the two of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Tigrone
and Skyshatter both nodded. Upon seeing how quickly Ning’s team was
advancing, not even Dreamlore dared to underestimate them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dimensional walkway
of the first world. Ning’s group was currently battling against a
final group of warriors. This time, there were thirty-nine warriors
surrounding and attacking them. This meant they had to deal with
thirty-nine second-tier Daolords at the same time!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ning was fighting by
himself, he would’ve been beaten long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… Ninedust
transformed into a vast wave that swept across all thirty-nine
warriors, his upper body still visible and wielding that longstaff as
he furiously assaulted those around him. The warriors, however, were
assembled into a war-formation and were valiant charging towards the
two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” Ning was
fighting the armored warriors head-on. Streaks of mist flew out with
his swords, and the warriors were knocked aside each time the mist
connected with them. Even the slightest scrape would cause them to be
sent flying backwards. Unfortunately, there were still thirty-nine of
them; when some were pushed back, others would immediately charge
forwards and take up their positions, allowing the ones who had been
pushed back to regroup and then charge as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had to find a
chance to create an opening!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust had
to battle furiously for more than a month before they were finally
able to knock the thirty-nine warriors out of the dimensional
walkway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aaaaaaaah.”
Ninedust stared at the black throne, then lifted his head up and let
loose a loud howl. “We finally beat’m!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Ning smiled
as well, but he felt a bit of regret in his heart. He had spent neary
ten years battling within the first world, but he still had yet to
master the tenth stance of the [Heartsword], the ‘Killheart’
stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Keep having fun back
there, the three of you.” Ninedust turned back to glance at Daolord
Skyshatter, Daolord Dreamlore, and Daolord Tigrone. The three of them
were surrounded by thirty-six armored warriors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They’ve made it to
the second world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These warriors are
too tough to deal with, and any Dao-seals we use are actually
cancelled out.” Daolord Skyshatter and the other two were starting
to grow anxious. They went so far as to use Dao-seals, but the
dazzling golden light radiated by the golden globe above them quickly
suppressed and wiped out all the effects of the Dao-seals they used.
The Sithe used this place to temper their Daolords; no cheating would
be permitted here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gave the three a
long, final glance. If he hadn’t been able to master the ninth
stance, ‘Blissheart’, it probably would’ve taken him another
ten years to traverse the dimensional walkway. The three probably
would’ve caught up to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those three cannot
be underestimated,” Ning mused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,
Darknorth,” Ninedust said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust both
walked straight towards the black throne. Instantly, the golden globe
above them shot down a streak of dense light which covered the black
throne and an area of thirty meters around it. Boom! Both the
sword-wielding, white-robed Ning and the staff-wielding, silver-robed
Ninedust disappeared without a trace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Faster, faster,
faster! Fight harder! We need to make it to the second world as soon
as we can!” Daolord Skyshatter and the other two were going crazy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world twisted and
changed around them before reality reset itself around Ning and
Ninedust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning glanced
at what was up ahead. In front of them was an enormous palace that
was held up by a series of black pillars. The pillars were covered by
many carvings and diagrams, including sword-arts diagrams, saber-arts
diagrams, flame diagrams, wave diagrams, golden light diagrams,
flaming chariot diagrams, animal diagrams… all sorts of diagrams
were here, and they all emanated auras of mystery and power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Six
golden-armored warriors were standing in front of them, with three
more crimson-armored warriors standing shoulder-to-shoulder off in
the distance. Very far away, a black-armored general was seated on a
distant throne. The general was playing around with a palm-sized
chunk of jade.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Voidsea
Jadeseal.” Ning and Ninedust both stared at the palm-sized chunk of
jade in the hands of the black-armored general who was seated on the
distant throne. They had both seen a Voidsea Jadeseal before and thus
recognized it right away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth.
Daolord Ninedust.” Rainbow light gathered next to them, coalescing
into a white-robed figure. It was Realmsoul Polo. The realmsoul
smiled and said, “Congratulations on making it to the second world…
but you two need to hurry it up. Winesage was able to make it to the
second world after just a single year in the first world.”
</P>

Chapter 9 - The Second World
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just one year?” Ji
Ning’s heart sank. After he had mastered the ninth ‘Blissheart’
stance, he and Ninedust had taken nearly ten additional years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus, your opponents
shall not merely consist of Daolords behind you like Dreamlore.
Winesage shall be your opponent as well. Once he acquires the first
Voidsea Jadeseal, he’ll definitely come for yours.” Realmsoul
Polo pointed in front of them. “This palace holds a total of 134
pillars, with each pillar containing multiple formations left behind
by the Sithe race. If you have enough time, you can go study them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust
glanced sideways at the realmsoul. Study? They were fighting for
every scrap of time. Who had the time to waste on studying? In
addition, the majority of supreme Daolords merely dabbled in non-core
techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In this palace,
you’ll need to defeat the six golden-armored warriors, the three
crimson-armored warriors, and then finally defeat the black-armored
general. Only then shall you be able to seize the Voidsea Jadeseal.”
The realmsoul smiled. “Oh, right. The runic cores at the center of
their chests are their weak spots. If you can stab it, they’ll
admit defeat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Move as fast as you
can. If you move fast enough, you might even be able to seize the
other Voidsea Jadeseals… and if you are too slow, you’ll lose
even yours.” The realmsoul grinned, then vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
and Ninedust transformed into two streaks of light that charged
straight forwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just two Daolords?
And you dare attack?” The six golden-armored warriors standing next
to each other shared a smile, then began to move in unison. Whoosh!
Each of them brandished a long golden halberd as they strode
forwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust wielded his
longstaff and charged straight towards them. As he reached them, he
instantly transformed into an enormous flood of water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning transformed into
his three-headed, six-armed form as he shot forward with all six
Northbow swords, then suddenly vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! The halberds in
the hands of the six golden-armored warriors struck out
simultaneously. Smash! Smash! Smash! The waters in front of them
exploded as an invisible burst of power spread out in every
direction, causing Ning to reveal himself after having used his
‘Shadowless’ evasion art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuck off!” Ning
flew forwards with incomparable valor, immediately using his Omega
Sword Dao - Heavenbreaker and sending six massive fog banks crashing
down. Boom! Boom! Boom! The strikes landed on the halberds of the six
golden-armored warriors, causing all of them to stagger backwards
from the strikes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s very strong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s able to
suppress us by himself?” The six golden-armored warriors shared a
glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful,” Ning
sent mentally to the Ninedust Sectlord. “All six of them are at the
supreme Daolord level of power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Six supreme
Daolords. Interesting.” The Ninedust Sectlord charged once more,
carrying the vast ocean with him. As for Ning, his actions were even
more dominating; his sword-light transformed into streaks of dense
fog and lashed out at his foes. It must be remembered that the
Northbow swords enhanced all of Ning’s sword-arts. Now that he also
had the [Heartsword] sutra enhancing them, his combat power was truly
astonishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust was able to
tie down two of the golden-armored warriors, while Ning battled the
other four by himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Every so often
he would suddenly disappear, followed by that strange, fog-like
sword-light emerging out of nowhere. This was the Omega Sword Dao -
Shadowless. A sword stabbed straight into the dazzling runic core
located over the golden-armored warrior’s chest!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The
golden-armored warrior’s face tightened. He lowered his head to
take a look, then let out a snort. “Nice sword-arts.” He
immediately stepped back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the six of them
worked together, they complimented each other very well and made for
a formidable team. Ning’s sword-arts, however, moved more than a
hundred times the speed of light and was unfathomably unpredictable,
making it difficult for even their tough defenses to withstand it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…”
Ninedust laughed loudly. “Darknorth, let’s move fast. We need to
get that first Voidsea Jadeseal quickly, so that we can go for a
second one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled as well.
Now that one warrior was down, beating the others would be much
easier. They quickly defeated the other five in succession. All six
of the warriors retreated, moving to one side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were six
golden-armored warriors, three crimson-armored warriors, and one
black-armored general. With the golden-armored warriors defeated, it
was the three crimson-armored warriors who now stood in Ning and
Ninedust’s path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You two are pretty
strong. You were able to beat those six idiots fairly easily,” one
of the tall, crimson-armored warriors snickered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are the idiot!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you try to fight
us six-on one, we’d beat you until you went crying to your mother.”
The six distant golden-armored warriors immediately began to unleash
a torrent of curses, while the three crimson-armored warriors just
smirked at them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve already
been beaten. Stop bragging.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Looks like it’ll
be up to us brothers. Hah!” The three crimson-armored warriors
seemed quite smug as they looked at Ning and Ninedust. “Let me tell
you a little story. In the other area, that ‘Daolord Winesage’
was able to beat the six golden-armored warriors in one strike, but
he was stymied by the three crimson-armored warriors for six full
years. Right now, he’s still trying to figure out how to deal with
the black-armored general.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning and
Ninedust traded a glance. They knew just how strong Winesage was.
Given his Universe treasure, there was no question that he could
crush the six golden-armored warriors effortlessly. Despite that, the
three crimson-armored warriors had held him back for six years?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,” Ning
ordered. Whoosh! Whoosh! Both he and Ninedust charged forwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! With the very
first strike, a crimson-armored warrior landed a cleaving blow with
his warblade, causing Ninedust’s body to crumble apart into a wave
of water. “Darknorth, I can’t block these hits. They are too
strong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Ning started
fighting against a crimson-armored warrior as well. That particular
warrior wielded a war club, and he delivered a furious blow downwards
at Ning, almost as though he was crashing down from a mountain. The
two collided head-on, and an incredibly dense wave of energy smashed
into Ning, causing him to stumble three steps back. As for the
crimson-armored warrior, he took a single step back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s face
tightened. “He’s just as strong as me?” He had grown
significantly more powerful, but even now he was merely on par with
the crimson-armored warrior. If the three joined forces… no wonder
Winesage had been stymied for six full years!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth
has a few tricks up his sleeve. Big brother, third brother, let’s
fight together!” the crimson-armored warrior shouted, and the other
two immediately charged towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… all three of
the three crimson-armored warriors were Ning’s equal in might, and
they were extremely skilled in working together. Ning was being
completely suppressed in this battle. Although Ninedust was able to
occasionally cause some trouble and disrupt the enemy formation, he
wasn’t able to have a material impact on the fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, their
teamwork is flawless. There’s no way for us to stab the runic cores
on their chests,” Ninedust said anxiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are too strong.
When the three of them work together, there’s nothing I can do to
them.” Ning frowned. “The only way we can win is through greater
numbers. If more Daolords come and work with us, we might be able to
find a chance to strike the runic cores.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They needed either
superior numbers or overwhelming power a la Winesage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps I’ll have
a chance to master the tenth stance, the ‘Killheart’ stance.”
Ning was surrounded and attacked by all three of the three
crimson-armored warriors, but his defensive sword-arts were very
strong and thus he was still able to hold on. He began to take
advantage of this enormous pressure to think on the tenth stance of
the [Heartsword], the ‘Killheart’ stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time continued to flow
on, with a half-year passing by in the blink of an eye. Ning and
Ninedust remained locked in combat against the three crimson-armored
warriors, but of course they continued to be at a disadvantage in the
fight. In short, they were being completely dominated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a thunderous
explosion caused the entire Crimsonwave Temple to shake. Everyone in
the temple heard and felt it, be it the Daolords battling in the
second world such as Ning, Ninedust, Dawnstar, Cloudwalker,
Ninestone, Shaka, and Snowjoy, or the Daolords still stuck in the
first world such as Daolords Dreamlore, Tigrone, the Starking, the
Radiant King, Skyaxe, Dustrain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolords.”
Realmsoul Polo’s voice boomed out, filling every inch of the
Crimsonwave Temple. “Winesage has already acquired one of the three
remaining Voidsea Jadeseals. Be careful - he’ll be coming for yours
next!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shit!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of Dawnstar,
Cloudwalker, Ninestone, Shaka, and Snowjoy all turned pale. The path
Cloudwalker’s team had chosen was the path which Dawnstar had
originally taken! The four of them joined forces upon entering the
first world and thus moved even faster than Ning’s group had. This
was the advantage of raw numbers! The fact that Ninestone and Snowjoy
were exceedingly strong defensive specialists made them very
well-suited for dealing with the first world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We need to move
faster.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We need to speed it
up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, let’s
work together.” The supreme Daolords who were still within the
three dimensional walkways of the first world were beginning to grow
anxious. They were still in the first world while Winesage had
already acquired a Voidsea Jadeseal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust felt
their hearts turn cold as well. They hadn’t even beaten the three
crimson-armored guards, while Winesage had already acquired a seal?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He might be headed
straight here for yours,” the three crimson-armored guards teased
in amusement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be worried
though. If Winesage comes we’ll attack him as well, and the two of
you can focus your attacks against him. The two of you plus the three
of us… that should shut him down, right?” the three
crimson-armored guards suggested. They had spent unfathomable lengths
of time being bored and lonely here in Crimsonwave Temple. The
happiest days of their lives were when supreme Daolords came to
visit.

Chapter 10 - Killsword
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, what
should we do?” Ninedust was anxious as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seize every moment
and try to beat these three crimson-armored warriors as soon as we
can,” Ji Ning said immediately. “Winesage’s actions have
probably driven all of the supreme Daolords into a panic. Seven,
eight, or even more of them might well work together to blow through
the first world as soon as possible. Once they reach the second
world, we probably won’t be able to deal with these three in
peace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ninedust
agreed with this assessment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Endless
Territories’ rankings of Daolords, there were over twenty publicly
acclaimed ‘supreme’ first-tier Daolords! If you factored in the
low-key ones that very few had heard of, there had to be at least
thirty or more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the warriors
in the dimensional walkway of the first world were tough to deal
with, they were still just equivalent to second-tier Daolords. If
seven or eight supreme Daolords joined forces against them, they’d
be able to burst past with ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We don’t have much
time left,” Ning said anxiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Both Ning
and Ninedust fought even more frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, the two of you
aren’t bad, but you aren’t strong enough to beat us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is useless! You
should wait for the other Daolords to arrive, then join up with
them.” The three crimson-armored warriors continued to crush the
Ning-Ninedust combination.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill! Kill! Kill!”
Ning only grew more and more frantic. He knew that they were running
out of time; his only chance lay in mastering the tenth stance of the
[Heartsword], the ‘Killsword’ stance. He had already spent many
years studying it again and again, but hadn’t been able to master
it thus far.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha… Winesage has
gone to Palace Lord Dawnstar’s dimensional walkway. However, five
supreme Daolords including Dawnstar have joined forces against him.
My guess is that Winesage is going to give up. He’ll be coming
straight for your walkway instead,” the three crimson-armored
warriors said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Palace Lord
Dawnstar’s tunnel has five supreme Daolords in it, but the two of
you are by yourselves. It’ll be quite tough for you to deal with
Winesage. He might actually take the Voidsea Jadeseal away from you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crimson-armored
warriors clearly knew exactly what was going on elsewhere as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are we out of time?”
Ninedust grew increasingly anxious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” Ning’s
streaks of foggy sword-light suddenly transformed. The foggy mist
suddenly condensed and solidified into clear streaks of sword-light,
and the power of Ning’s sword-arts once more skyrocketed! They
became even faster and were filled with even greater power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this is the
‘Killsword’ stance?” Ning finally understood the essence of the
tenth stance of the [Heartsword] - the Killsword stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It required one to not
only feel intoxicated and blissful, but to also feel a sense of
incomparable resolve and determination! Only when this determination
and resolve reached a certain level of strength could heartforce be
woven more perfectly into one’s sword-arts. One’s heartforce
would move in a more natural way and achieve a greater level of
harmony, allowing the power of one’s sword-arts to increase. This
was reflected in the real world by the dense fog solidifying into the
shape of a sword!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Slash! Ning
executed the Blood Drop stance. The Omega Sword Dao - Blood Drop!
This was Ning’s most powerful attack, as the Northbow swords
increased its power fivefold! Now that even more heartforce was
infused into it via the ‘Killsword’ stance, its power doubled yet
again!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ninth stance,
‘Blissheart’, increased his power by 50%.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tenth stance,
‘Killheart’, increased his power by 100%!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thanks to his
[Heartsword] and the Northbow swords, Ning’s Omega Sword Dao -
Blood Drop was now ten times more powerful than it had any right to
be! It was a technique that focused on obliterating everything in its
path with unstoppable speed, and now it had sped up even more and
reached an incomprehensible level of might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crimson-armored
warrior used his warblade to execute the same stance as he had in the
past to block Ning’s sword-arts, but his face suddenly turned pale.
He was able to just barely block two strikes from Ning, but he wasn’t
able to withstand the third strike. Slash! The tip of the sword
stabbed straight into the runic core at the center of his chest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I lost?!” The
crimson-armored warrior was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother!” The
other two crimson-armored warriors were stunned as well. Even when
the three of them were fighting together, their big brother had been
stabbed in his runic core? How were the two of them supposed to hang
on?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could this have
happened?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two remaining
crimson-armored warriors continued to struggle, unwilling to give up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent!” The
Ninedust Sectlord was delighted and surprised by this. Moments ago,
he had been at the brink of despair. Now, he felt as though he had
been given a new lease on life. A short while later, the runic core
on the chest of a second crimson-armored warrior was pierced through.
A heartbeat later, the final crimson-armored warrior was defeated as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too fast. His sword
is too fast!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Winesage is
overwhelmingly strong, but at least we could take his attacks
head-on. Darknorth’s sword is simply too fast, so fast that we
can’t even defend against it.” The three crimson-armored warriors
were thoroughly convinced by their defeat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Overwhelming strength
or overwhelming speed… which was better?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These represented two
extremes. If your power reached certain heights, you could
brute-force through anything you wished and nothing could stop you.
However, if your speed reached certain heights, your enemy wouldn’t
even be able to touch you while you would be able to launch attacks
with ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winesage relied on his
Universe treasure to reach incredible heights of power, allowing him
to actually send the crimson-armored warriors flying with each blow.
However, their defensive teamwork was so tight and perfect that even
when sent flying they could avoid giving Winesage the chance to stab
their runic cores. This was why Winesage had been stymied for six
full years by the three crimson-armored warriors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning? When he
had battled against Daolord Shaka, his attack speed had already
surpassed Shaka’s. Now that he had mastered the ‘Killsword’
stance, his speed once more broke through its previous bottleneck to
reach a brand new level!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was simply too fast,
making defending against him an incredibly difficult task. As a
result, the three crimson-armored warriors were all consecutively
defeated in short order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You won.” The
three crimson-armored warriors all retreated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impressive,
Darknorth. Impressive! Your sword is simply too fast, far faster than
Daolord Shaka’s. My guess is that not even the Radiant King is
necessarily a match for you in speed. Your attack speed might be the
fastest amongst all Daolords,” Ninedust said excitedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To be faster than
the Radiant King isn’t all that impressive! Only when I’m faster
than Daolord Dreamlore would I be the fastest of all Daolords,”
Ning said. Daolord Dreamlore’s usage of the bloodblade had
surpassed the Radiant King in attack speed, allowing him to gain
victory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s hurry up and
defeat the final black-armored general.” Ning didn’t have any
time to waste, and he immediately charged towards the seated
black-armored general.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ninedust
hefted his longstaff and charged towards the final challenge as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within another hall
within the temple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Palace Lord Dawnstar,
Palace Lord Cloudwalker, Ninestone, Snowjoy, and Shaka were here.
They had joined forces and had already fought their way to the
black-armored general, but the general was simply too fearsome.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, this
black-armored general is roughly on par with the eight lords of the
Sacred Cities. Even if the five of you work together, it’ll be
virtually impossible for you to stab his runic core,” Winesage said
with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Winesage, one
Voidsea Jadeseal is enough; don’t get too greedy!” Dawnstar and
the others were working together, assisting the three crimson-armored
warriors and preventing Winesage from advancing. All newcomers would
be assaulted by all of the warriors upon reaching the second world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Winesage, you have
no chance at all.” The combined forces of Dawnstar, Ninestone,
Shaka, Cloudwalker, and Snowjoy brought Winesage a tremendous amount
of pressure. Given the situation, there was no way he could defeat
the three crimson-armored warriors at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” After
battling for a short while, Winesage realized that he really had no
chance at all. He let out a calm laugh and said, “The black-armored
general is far too strong. You’ll need to find more helpers to work
with you. As a group, you have to exceed the level of the eight lords
of the Sacred Cities in at least one area, be it speed or power or
something else, if you wish to have a chance at succeeding.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In raw power, Winesage
was still somewhat weaker than the eight lords of the Sacred Cities,
but the Universe treasure brought him up to par. As a result, he was
able to battle the black-armored general for a long period of time
while seeking out a mistake or error. All he had to do was touch the
runic core across the black-armored general’s chest and he was able
to claim victory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a big
difference between just touching the chest and actually winning,
after all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, Ning and
Ninedust stood no chance of truly defeating those three
crimson-armored warriors. But merely touching the runic cores? Ning,
via the speed of his Blood Drop stance, was able to succeed in this
mission.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha. I won’t play
around with you any longer. I’m going to go see how Darknorth is
doing.” Winesage let out a laugh, then gracefully retreated and
moved towards the other region at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the second world,
the three major regions were all interlinked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew!” Dawnstar,
Cloudwalker, and the others all let out sighs of relief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Winesage is heading
towards Darknorth,” Ninestone said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth’s going
to be in trouble, but we don’t have any time to spare with helping
him,” Dawnstar said. “We need to try to seize every moment and
try to find a chance to strike the black-armored general on the
chest. As long as we can touch that runic core, we’ll have won.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” They all
understood that more and more supreme Daolords would begin to arrive,
which meant that their chances would grow increasingly slim.

Chapter 11 - Winesage Arrives
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Ninedust
jointly charged towards the black-armored general.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-armored
general seated on the throne was toying with the Voidsea Jadeseal
with one hand, seeming quite relaxed. He put the seal down next to
him on the throne, then rose to his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aside from Dao-seals
and similar treasures, you are permitted to use any secret arts or
domain-type effects,” the black-armored warrior said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning and
Ninedust were both stunned. Secret arts and heartworld projections
were both permissible? In their previous battles, all such techniques
had been suppressed! Ning had actually tried to use his heartworld
projection and secret arts against the golden-armored warriors and
the crimson-armored warriors, but alas the effects had been
neutralized.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Dao-seals, of
course those would always be forbidden. This place was created by the
Sithe to train and temper their Daolords; using Dao-seals would
completely and truly make the entire exercise pointless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nine novessence arts
and heartworld projection, descend!” Ning didn’t hesitate at all
in executing these two techniques, causing an awe-inspiring Yin-Yang
Sword Domain to descend along with the manifestation of his
heartworld projection. Both came crashing straight down against the
black-armored general.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-armored
general gripped the warblade by his side. “Your heartworld
projection and your secret arts aren’t bad.” The black-armored
general suddenly manifested a total of three layers of black light
over his body. The black light completely covered and protected him
from the might of the nine novessence arts and the heartworld
projection. “Unfortunately, they aren’t quite enough to do
anything to me.” He instantly drew his warblade.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! A streak of
dazzling black saber-light instantly sliced across the skies and
chopped towards Ning. It was simply too fast; as soon as the saber
was drawn, the saber-light had reached Ning! When Ning saw that
terrifying saber-light appear before him, he felt his heart tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s at the level
of the eight lords of the Sacred Cities.” When Ning saw the
saber-light, he instantly understood how strong the black-armored
general was. The streak of saber-light vastly surpassed a hundred
times the speed of light, and in power it was just as strong as a
strike from Winesage. It completely surpassed the level which supreme
Daolords were capable of reaching.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Ning suddenly
vanished without a trace. Slash! The saber-light sliced through the
position Ning had previously been in, carving a deep gouge within the
field of sword-intent generated by the Yin-Yang Sword domain. Moments
later, the gouge quickly disappeared but Ning was nowhere to be
found.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of Ning’s five Omega
Sword Dao stances, two were defensive while the other three
(Heavenbreaker, Shadowless, Blood Drop) had various special effects.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Shadowless stance
allowed him to turn completely invisible and evade even godsense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Blood Drop stance,
when used with the Northbow swords, was Ning’s most powerful
attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although his heartworld
projection and the nine novessence arts were unable to harm his
opponent, they at least rendered him unable to defeat Ning’s
Shadowless stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? Where’s he
hiding?” The black-armored general frowned as he immediately swept
out with his warblade, launching an omnidirectional attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha! You won’t
be able to find him.” Ninedust laughed loudly as he transformed
into an awesome wave that furiously surged out towards the
black-armored general and coiled around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-armored
general’s saber-light was impeded by Ninedust’s waves and also
slowed down by Ning’s heartworld and the nine novessence arts. With
Ning already knowing where the saber-light would land, he was
naturally able to avoid it with ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! A mist-formed
sword suddenly struck out from nowhere and stabbed against the
outermost layer of black light covering the black-armored general.
Slash! All three layers were pierced through, but the speed of the
sword was lessened as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning struck, his
strike would appear in front of you instantaneously!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The
black-armored general’s face tightened as he immediately struck out
with his own warblade to block Ning’s strike. His defensive
saber-arts were quite flawless, allowing him to block Ning’s strike
almost instantly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Slash! Slash!
Slash! Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the black-armored
general’s warblade clashed against Ning’s Northbow sword, the
other five Northbow swords suddenly appeared as well, having
transformed into five streaks of sword-shaped fog that stabbed
straight through the three layers of black light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Because
his warblade had just clashed against Ning’s first Northbow sword,
the black-armored general’s reaction wspeed was just a little too
slow… and Ning’s other five Northbow swords were just too fast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! The
black-armored general’s warblade sliced out a beautiful arc in the
air. As the defender he always held a certain advantage, because he
only had to defend a fairly small area, allowing him to deflect many
attacks from the enemy with ease. However… his warblade had been
weakened and slowed down by its impact against Ning’s Northbow
sword! This had an impact on his defensive stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! One of the
streaks of sword-shaped fog stabbed straight into the black-armored
general’s runic core.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” The
black-armored general was stunned. He just stood there blankly. “I
lost? I lost that fast?” He had lost so quickly that he couldn’t
even believe it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“B-but…” The six
golden-armored warriors and the three crimson-armored warriors who
had retreated early on all stared dumbly. The black-armored general
was on par with the eight lords of the Sacred Cities! But of course,
he had certain flaws compared to the actual lords… with the main
flaw being that he only had a single weapon! Most true Emperors would
manifest at least six arms to fight against foes, whereas the
black-armored general would only use a single warblade against his
foes as this was what had been designated by the Sithe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The difference in power
was too great, after all. Generally speaking, supreme Daolords would
be crushed by the black-armored general. Many ‘ordinary’ supreme
Daolords found it impossible to even penetrate the three layers of
black light!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Shadowless stance
made it impossible to predict where the attack would come from. As
soon as Ning attacked, his swords would have already gone through the
three layers of black light, making it difficult for the general to
defend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The worst part was,
Ning’s sword was incredibly fast. All six of them were incredibly
fast, and they were also extremely unpredictable! Given that the
black-armored general only had a single warblade to deal with the six
Northbow swords, and given that the Shadowless stance allowed Ning to
close in on him unhindered… alas, he was defeated at the first go.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can send you
flying with a single blow from my saber.” The black-armored general
shook his head in disbelief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But your saber-light
wasn’t able to touch me, not even once.” Ning shook his head as
well. In the end, the black-armored general wasn’t a true Eternal
Emperor; he didn’t even have domain-type secret arts. Winedust, for
example, was able to use both a heartworld projection and secret arts
to prevent Ning from moving too close to him via the Shadowless
stance; if Ning attempted to do so, he would be exposed by the
domain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m able to
silently approach you without giving you any hint as to where I am!
Given how fast my six Northbow swords are… if I’m still unable to
touch your runic core despite all these advantages then that would
mean I’m ridiculously weaker than the eight lords of the Sacred
Cities.” Ning was in quite a good mood, both at how strong he had
become as well as at his final success.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Voidsea
Jadeseal…” Ninedust stared at the jade seal atop the throne, his
eyes gleaming with excitement. This was a legendary treasure, the
most powerful Daomerge treasure available. It had drawn the attention
of virtually all of the supreme Daolords of the Endless Territories.
Today, it would become his?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What are you looking
at? Go take it!” Ning barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“T-then I’ll really
go grab it…?” Ninedust felt rather embarrassed, as Ning was
primarily responsible for their success. But in truth, he had played
a major role as well. His invulnerable aquaform was very tough for
foes to deal with, and the way in which he had transformed into waves
that hindered their foes made things much easier for Ning. Otherwise,
Ning by himself would’ve taken forever to overcome even the first
world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We agreed early on
that it’d be yours. Stop wasting time! If you delay any longer, I’m
gonna fight you for it,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Seemingly
panicked, Ninedust reached out with his right hand, moving
lightning-fast as he grabbed the jade seal atop the throne.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust, you…”
Ning stared at him. “Was it really necessary to grab it that fast?
You moved more than a hundred times the speed of light!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yeah, just keep
laughing. I really don’t care right now. Ahaha!” Ninedust was in
quite a good mood. Even if Ning was to stab him with a hundred
knives, he’d still continue to chortle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled as well. He
had felt quite guilty towards Ninedust this entire time, but now he
felt much better.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A streak of
light appeared off in the distance, then flew straight towards them.
It was Winesage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoists.” A
sonorous voice boomed out, echoing throughout every inch of the
Crimsonwave Temple. “The second of the three final Voidsea
Jadeseals has been acquired by Daolord Ninedust!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winesage trembled
slightly, looking almost like a bloodlusted mortal who suddenly had a
bucket of icewater poured over him. He landed on the ground, staring
dazedly at Ning and Ninedust and the throne next to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…” Winesage
couldn’t believe it. This was simply too fast! He had just acquired
his a short while. Somehow, Ning and Ninedust had successfully
acquired one as well?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, it’s on me.
Come and take it, if you can.” Ninedust was quite smug. Given his
invulnerable aquaform, he really didn’t fear any Daolords at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood by
Ninedust’s side, a smile on his face as he looked at Winesage.
“Winesage. You arrived too late.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 12 - The Third World
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winesage narrowed his
eyes, then let out a smile. “Darknorth, I truly admire you. Without
a Universe treasure and with just brother Ninedust assisting you, you
were able to defeat all of these warriors… and then you gave the
Voidsea Jadeseal to Ninedust!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The way in which
Winesage viewed Ning had changed. During the last competition, the
jade seal had ended up in Daolord Solesky’s hands. This time, Ning
had been the main contributory to their victory against the
black-armored general, but he had ended up giving the Voidsea
Jadeseal to Ninedust! Winesage knew that if Darknorth was able to act
in such a way despite the allure of the Voidsea Jadeseal, he would
definitely be a friend worth making.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You were literally
just a few seconds too late. Otherwise, Ninedust and I would’ve
been in serious trouble,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Palace Lord Dawnstar
and the others haven’t taken away their Voidsea Jadeseal yet. Why
don’t we join forces to take it from them? Neither of us have any
chance if we go by ourselves, but our chances are significant if we
join forces. The fastest one shall be the one to win the Voidsea
Jadeseal,” Winesage said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dawnstar and the other
four alone were enough to tie down Winesage! Once you added the three
crimson-armored warriors and the black-armored general into the mix,
it would be no easy feat at all. Even if he and Ning joined forces,
they only stood a chance and were not assured of victory. The main
reason why Winesage wanted to try working together with Ning was
because he had decided that Ning was a friend worth making.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need.” Ning
shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You aren’t going
to take part?” Winesage was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not taking part,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once someone ends up
with the Voidsea Jadeseal, it’ll be a hundred times more difficult
to pry it out of their hands,” Winesage said. Of all the Daolords
present, the only one he cared about was Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to try and
persuade me. I’ve already made up my mind,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then I won’t force
things.” Winesage transformed into a streak of light and flew
towards Dawnstar’s direction at high speed. He was a supreme
Daolord; a single Voidsea Jadeseal would only allow him to partially
simulate the Daomerge. He naturally felt that the more seals he had,
the better!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the eyes of
Daolords, although the local fruit was valuable it was of no use to
the Daomerge. None of those things truly mattered. The Daomerge was
what supreme Daolords like Winesage cared about the most, and so they
paid much less attention to the third world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
looked at Ninedust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are we really not
going to take part? Darknorth, if we go we’ll at least have a
chance,” Ninedust said. Now that he had acquired a Voidsea Jadeseal
for himself, he naturally wanted to help Ning fight for one as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“More and more
supreme Daolords are arriving. What they can’t have, they won’t
let others have either,” Ning said. “The fight over the last
Voidsea Jadeseal will be a furious one; our chances are less than one
in ten.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust argued, “But
even if our chances are slim, we should still give it a shot.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can do that
later. Push comes to shove, we can take it from the person who wins
it.” Ning walked straight towards the throne. Ninedust nodded then
followed him as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! A surge of power
spread out from the throne and encompassed both Ning and Ninedust.
Swoosh! The two of them vanished without a trace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were a number of
reasons as to why Ning had opted not to take part.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First of all, there
were simply too many supreme Daolords present. Even if they weren’t
able to beat Ning, they’d be able to obstruct him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Second, Ning belonged
to the Brightshore Kingdom. Brightshore Kingdom members had all sworn
oaths not to fight against other members of the kingdom! Ninestone,
Palace Lord Cloudwalker, Palace Lord Dawnstar… Ning wasn’t even
able to battle against them! In a wild group melee like this, it
would be like him fighting with a handicap. This further lowered his
chances of winning a Voidsea Jadeseal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Third, the Voidsea
Jadeseals were of very limited use to Ning. Once he became a Daolord
of the Fourth Step, the power of his Omega Sword Dao would reach an
incredibly terrifying level; most likely, the Voidsea Jadeseal would
only be able to simulate a tiny, tiny portion of the Daomerge for his
Omega Sword Dao. Other supreme Daolords would be able to simulate
half of the Daomerge, which would be of invaluable assistance, but
for Ning the benefit would be fairly minimal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fourth, Ning cared more
about reviving his wife Yu Wei. If he could reunite his family again,
he’d be satisfied with merely living 108,000 chaos cycles! The
Daomerge wasn’t something others could help him with, but saving Yu
Wei was. He needed to acquire enough treasure so that he could ask
some truly mighty figures to assist him! Given that even the Hegemons
and the Dao Alliance had gone crazy over the fruits of Crimsonwave
Temple, he naturally had to harvest as much as he could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Ning felt a
cold breeze stir past him. He hurriedly inspected his surroundings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He stood atop a cold,
ancient-looking stone island, and in front of him was an unfathomably
deep abyss. A long, icy set of seven-colored chains stretched off
into the distance, where it connected to another distant and
levitating stone island. That second stone island had a gold-black
octahedral command talisman levitating above it, with some strange
runes right above it. Ning immediately recognized the runes as
symbolizing the word ‘three’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Behind that stone
island was yet another deep abyss. A tri-colored set of chains
stretched out from the stone island and across the abyss to a
sacrificial altar that had another command talisman at the bottom.
This one had runes symbolizing the word ‘five’ hovering right
above it. The altar had a series of steps leading up to it, and at
the very top of the altar there lay a command talisman that had
strange runes symbolizing the word ‘eight’ above it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three, five, and
eight?” Ning was intrigued.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, the
Grovekeeper said that there are nine command talismans in total. The
ninth one is the most valuable, with the second most valuable being
the sixth, seventh, and eighth talismans. Next in value come the
third, fourth, and fifth talismans, while the first and second ones
are the least valuable,” Ninedust said. Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Rainbow light
coalesced next to them, resolving into the form of a white-robed man.
It was Realmsoul Polo, and he smiled at Ning and Ninedust. “The two
of you moved quite quickly. You came straight to the third world! The
battle in the second world is still proceeding quite fiercely; given
your power, the two of you might stand a chance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve decided to
try and acquire as much fruit as we can instead,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
Realmsoul Polo explained, “The rules in the third world are a bit
different. Each Daolord can only choose a single corridor to proceed
through.” As he spoke, he waved his hand and caused the mist at the
horizons to vanish, revealing two other places. Once again they saw
floating islands, abysses, and altars.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The third world has
three passageways,” Realmsoul Polo said. “Once you enter one of
the passageways, you cannot enter any of the other ones. This is a
mechanism to prevent any single Daolord from acquiring too many of
the command talismans.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust
nodded slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But can we take them
from others by force?” Ning suddenly asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha. If you are
strong enough to seize command talismans from other Daolords, go for
it. I won’t mind even if you manage to acquire all of them,”
Realmsoul Polo said. “The command talismans for these three
passageways are of varying values, but on the whole the difference
between the three passageways isn’t that great. Go ahead and choose
one of the passageways. Oh! As the first to reach the third world,
I’ll give you one piece of advice; the ninth command talisman is
extremely, extremely valuable.” After speaking, the realmsoul let
out a chuckle and vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth?”
Ninedust looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go take a
look at the other passageways to take a look,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
Ninedust and Ning immediately transformed into streaks of light that
flew towards one of the other passageways. Soon, they had passed
through the other two regions and reached their destination.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust
possessed astounding ocularity clarity and were thus able to see the
three command seals within this passageway right away. They were the
first, the fourth, and the ninth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ninth talisman
is here.” Ning said solemnly, “Then that means the final
passageway holds the second, the sixth, and the seventh talismans.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three passageways
were separated thusly:
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first passageway
held the first, fourth, and ninth command talismans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second passageway
held the second, sixth, and seventh command talismans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third passageway
held the third, fifth, and eighth command talismans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The total value in
each of three passageways is roughly the same, but since the fruits
harvested by the ninth command talisman ripen once every 100,000
chaos cycles, they are more valuable than all other fruits. The rarer
a fruit is, the more irreplaceable it is,” Ning said. “I choose
this passageway. I have to get the ninth command talisman.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After studying the
[Seven Leafpill Chapters], Ning knew a great deal regarding the Dao
of Alchemy. Some alchemical materials were interchangeable with
others, with just the price being changed slightly. The rarer an item
was, however, the more important it generally was as a principal
ingredient.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ninth command
talisman allowed the harvesting of the only fruits which ripened
every 100,000 chaos cycles. Most likely, it was of the most interest
to Eternal Emperors! They might be able to pay several times more
than the ‘market’ rate for it. Ning’s hopes of reviving Yu Wei
rested on this fruit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then I’ll choose
the other tunnel, the one with the second, sixth, and seventh command
talismans,” Ninedust said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we move
separately, then…” Ning was a bit hesitant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry.”
Ninedust smiled. “I have my invulnerable aquaform; no one can kill
me! And every single Daolord can only choose a single passageway; if
you choose this one, that means the two of us can at most acquire
three of those talismans. If we move separately, we can perhaps
acquire a total of six! Haha. So long as I acquire any of them,
they’ll all belong to you, Darknorth! You helped me acquire the
Voidsea Jadeseal; now, it is my time to help you acquire the command
talismans. Although these things aren’t nearly as valuable as
Voidsea Jadeseals to us Daolords, I really don’t have anything
better to offer you. There’s no way I’m handing out the seal I
acquired to anyone, you included.”

Chapter 13 - Speechless
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, done.” Ji
Ning understood what his friend was trying to do; Ninedust didn’t
feel comfortable accepting the Voidsea Jadeseal without doing
anything for Ning in return. At their level, Daolords were unwilling
to do actions that went against their basic nature and caused them to
feel guilty. They would strive to repay any favors that were owed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, there
were some truly vile Daolords whose Dao-hearts were as vile as they
were. Backstabbing, betrayal, robbery, deceit… they could do
anything, because this was the nature of their Dao-heart! As a
result, these evil Daolords generally had few to no truly good
friends. Timedream was a good example; he had relied on applying
heartforce techniques to the Kingfreak when the later was young and
weak, slowly guiding the Kingfreak into being utterly devoted to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll probably
spend quite a bit of time here in the third world,” Ning said. “You
can spend a month using up the Voidsea Jadeseal first. That way, you
can publicly swear a lifeblood oath that you’ve already used it and
thus will no longer be pursued or attacked by the other Daolords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ninedust
nodded. “Understood. I’ll be leaving now.” Whoosh. Ninedust
flew towards a different passageway, with Ning watching as he left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning then turned
towards his own passageway. This was what mattered the most to him;
he had to walk to the end of this passageway and acquire the ninth
command talisman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That stone pillar…?”
Ning stared at a rhomboid-shaped pillar at the edges of the abyss.
The pillar was covered with many dense runes. These runes didn’t
seem nearly as profound as the Dreamdust script, the azureflower
runes, or the ‘Crimson Wave Temple’ runes, but they were still
unlike any script that Ning had ever seen before. Despite that, Ning
immediately understood what they meant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I wish to pass
through the first abyss, I must first learn the [Vitalis] technique…”
Ning was dazed by what he read.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All living creatures
had their own, distinct life auras. These auras came from the
distinctive characteristics of their souls and truesouls. No type of
divine ability or transformation could truly disguse this. The likes
of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] and other similar techniques could
mask or simulate certain aura ‘leaks’, but the intrinsic life
aura itself could not be changed! The aura each soul and truesoul had
was the best way of verifying or attesting to who a person was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“B-b-b-but… this
[Vitalis] technique can actually change a truesoul’s life aura?”
Ning could hardly believe this. “If even a truesoul’s life aura
can be changed… then they could use a casual disguise and I would
be completely unable to recognize them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Terrifying, utterly
terrifying. For example, if someone transformed into Patriarch
Subhuti and appeared in front of Ning, if even the truesoul life aura
was imitated then Ning would be tricked. If caught off-guard in such
a manner, Ning could very well fall for a sneak attack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Sithe were
utterly terrifying. How could they have come up with a technique like
this? I’ve never even heard of such techniques in the Endless
Territories, but the Sithe put it within the third world. Clearly,
many of their supreme Daolords must’ve known this technique.”
Ning was secretly terrified. If even their Daolords were this
terrifying, how deadly had their Eternal Emperors had been?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No wonder the Sithe had
once sought to conquer and enslave all other cultivators. Apparently,
even the Terror Starsea was nothing more than one of many
battlefields where the Dawn War had occurred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Ning
quickly read and memorized the [Vitalis] technique. Only then did he
let out a sigh of relief. The [Vitalis] technique wasn’t completely
flawless; for example, close friends and loved ones could often tell
what their counterparts were thinking from a single glance or
gesture. If someone else had merely transformed and used the
[Vitalis] technique, that person would be unable to duplicate that
sort of tacit understanding. This was one of the most basic flaws.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, if one wasn’t
aware of the [Vitalis] technique and also sensed that the truesoul
life aura was that of a loved one’s, one generally wouldn’t think
too much of it even if their counterpart was acting rather oddly.
They’d think that their counterpart was probably worried or
frustrated about something and thus was acting rather differently.
This wasn’t that big of a flaw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The true, major flaw
with the [Vitalis] technique was that of karma!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Karma was a system of
cause and effect that linked all things! This was one of the highest
level and yet most understated webs that tied and bound all
individuals. There were some who were so skilled in karma that when
they slew a foe, they would be able to use their karmic senses to
trace down that enemy’s Primaltwin and avatars and wipe them out as
well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anyone you had
befriended or even so much as spoken to would be connected to you by
karma. Ning, for example, was very tightly bound to his friends and
loved ones by karmic threads. He was even connected by karma to the
Brightshore Hegemon and Emperor Goldisle of the Dao Alliance, as he
had met and spoken with both separately.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If anyone dared to
imitate Ning and appear before Hegemon Brightshore… given how
strong Hegemon Brightshore was, he was probably able of karmic
scrying! He would be able to instantly tell that there were no
pre-existing karmic ties between him and the person in front of him
and thus could be certain that it definitely was not Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are almost no
Daolords capable of sensing and scrying karma.” Ning shook his
head. “Not even the majority of Eternal Emperors are capable of
this. You have to be a specialist in karma or have reached an
incredible level of power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All Daos shared certain
commonalities. Ning didn’t specifically study the Dao of Time or
the Dao of Space, but he had reached such inconceivable heights in
the Dao of the Sword that he was able to transcend both space and
time. Similarly, the power within the Sword Hegemon’s Dao-seal was
so great that it could freeze and suppress both spacetime as well as
karmic scrying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This [Vitalis]
technique is still an incredible technique,” Ning mused to himself.
If he managed to learn this technique, he could for example imitate
someone else and go pay a visit to Hegemon Netherlily of the Ancient
cultivators! Since Hegemon Netherlily had never seen him before and
there were no karmic ties between them, Ning probably would be able
to deceive her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, this technique
was a superb and terrifying technique for disguising one’s self and
infiltrating other organizations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Sithe probably
relied on this technique to arrange for many Daolord spies to be sent
into the various cultivator organizations,” Ning mused. “However,
the Sithe have already been destroyed. Even their techniques have
fallen into the hands of us cultivators.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each of the seven
colors of the rainbow chains which stretched across the first abyss
represented a type of truesoul life aura! One had to be able to
transform one’s life aura to match those chains in order to safely
traverse them. If the truesoul aura was not imitated perfectly, then
one would be swept into that endless abyss and perish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sithe used very
brutal methods to train their Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Vitalis]…”
After learning this technique, Ning felt more and more certain that
the Sithe had reached truly inconceivable heights in certain areas.
For example, their mastery of truesoul-relaetd techniques clearly
surpassed that of the Endless Territories by a significant amount.
Otherwise, they would never have been able to create a technique such
as this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What Ning didn’t know
was that although the Sithe had been exterminated, the many treasures
and techniques they had left behind were furiously fought over in
countless places. Crimsonwave Temple was nothing more than one of the
many relic sites left behind by the Sithe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Focus.” Ning made
use of his temporal acceleration treasure. Years passed inside
although just half a month or so had gone by outside. He was now able
to use a tiny amount of his truesoul and godsense to form a
‘lifecloak’ around him, with the lifecloak capable of simulating
any truesoul aura Ning had met before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This amount of his
truesoul and godsense was of neglible impact to Ning. He was a
heartforce cultivator, after all, and a very high-level one at that.
Learning this technique was thus quite easy for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success.” Ning put
away the spacetime cabin and turned to stare at the stone pillar. He
sighed silently, “Their abilities were utterly unearthly, but their
ambitions were simply too vast. In the end, they were wiped out!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood that
the little he knew about the Sithe came from what Realmsoul Polo and
the Grovekeeper and told him. He realized that this was nothing more
than the tip of an iceberg, and that he still knew very little as to
what the truth was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grovekeeper had
merely been an artificial construct created by the Sithe race in
order to take care of the trees here in Crimsonwave Temple. He had
never been able to leave this place. As for Realmsoul Polo, he was
nothing more than a servant of Emperor Waveshift’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there atop
the seven-colored chains, every single colored chain containing a
different truesoul aura. The different colors all stretched out
across several meters, allowing the Daolords enough time to falsify
their truesoul auras.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continuously
transformed. First he was a terrifying demon, then he became a suave
and graceful cultivator. If they closed their eyes, not even
Brightmoon or Patriarch Subhuti would be able to recognize that this
aura came from Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, Ning traversed
the entire set of chains reached the giant rocky island on the other
side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first command
talisman.” Ning stared at the octahedral black-gold command
talisman levitating in the air, then reached out to grab it. The
command talisman’s surface was warm on one side but cool on the
other, and the temperatures on each side continuously alternated.
This first command talisman, along with the second command talisman,
were amongst the least valuable of the command talismans. However,
the fruit they gave access to only ripened once every 30,000 chaos
cycles. Given that the Sithe were willing to place such valuable
trees here in Crimsonwave Palace, the fruit would definitely still be
extraordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One talisman down.
Keep going.” Ning stared off into the distance towards the
tri-colored chains leading across the second abyss. At the end of the
tri-colored chains was the altar which held the fourth command
talisman at the bottom! At the very top of the altar was the ninth
command talisman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning stared
at the stone pillar which stood deep at the ends of the second abyss.
“If I wish to pass through the second abyss, I must master the
[Daoheart] technique…” This stone pillar was also covered with
dense runic script that explained yet another mysterious, ancient
technique of the Sithe race.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had been stunned
when he saw the [Vitalis] technique. This time, he had already
mentally fortified himself, but upon seeing the [Daoheart] technique
he was still completely dumbfounded.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 14 - [Daoheart]
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A cold wind
blew out from the deep abyss in front of Ji Ning. Ning however just
stood there blankly, not seeming to even notice it at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Vitalis] technique
allowed one to disguise one’s truesoul aura. It could merely be
described as a rare technique that wasn’t really of much use for
either the Daomerge or cultivation in general. This [Daoheart]
technique, however, was of enormous benefit to cultivators!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For cultivators, the
Dao-heart mattered more than anything else! Without a sufficiently
strong Dao-heart, you couldn’t even so much as become a Celestial
Immortal. Once your Dao-heart collapsed, you might even fail to
control the powerful Immortal energy coursing through your body,
resulting in death via self-detonation! All Samsara Daolords,
especially supreme ones, had incredibly formidable Dao-hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Usually, the stronger a
person was the more powerful his Dao-heart would be as well, which
meant that on average Eternal Emperors had stronger Dao-hearts than
Samsara Daolords did. But of course, there were a few extremely rare
exceptions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ninedust had been
poisoned by that redscatter venom, he had been in such agony that he
wanted Ning to kill him. The redscatter venom had originally been
devised for usage against powerful Eternal Emperors, who had very
strong Dao-hearts. It would weaken them, but it wouldn’t
incapacitate them to the point where they would beg for death. This
alone was a testament as to the difference in Dao-hearts between
Ninedust and powerful Eternal Emperors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, as more time
passed Ninedust’s Dao-heart had been tempered and strengthened by
the redscatter venom. Towards the late stages of his poisoning, he
had no longer screamed in pain. If someone was to apply redscatter
venom to him again, he might be dramatically weakened but he wouldn’t
beg for death. This signified that his Dao-heart had improved!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Redscatter venom is
terrifying, but it’s also a good treasure for tempering one’s
Dao-heart. Alas, the effect only lasts for twelve days,” Ning
mused. In the end, twelve days simply wasn’t long enough,
especially given how incredibly rare and expensive redscatter venom
was. When applied at the right time in a duel between Eternal
Emperors, it could allow in one being able to slay a foe outright.
Hence, no one would be so wasteful as to use it to temper the
Dao-heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This [Daoheart]
technique… once you use it, you’ll suffer such tremendous agony
that you’ll feel as though you’ve been hit by redscatter venom!”
Ning was truly stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It sounded quite
simple; it was nothing more than a pain technique, right? But it must
be understood that supreme Daolords had such incredibly formidable
Dao-hearts that they would calmly smile in the face of death itself!
To cause them to feel such agonizing pain that they would be at the
verge of suffering a mental breakdown was incredibly hard to do. That
was what made the redscatter venom so valuable! This [Daoheart]
technique, however, was able to cause increasingly terrifying levels
of pain. This sort of technique was completely unheard of in the
Endless Territories!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to the
records, the [Daoheart] technique was divided up into seven levels of
heart purgatories. Even the very first level was enough to cause
tremendous agony to a supreme Daolord, and the higher levels were
even worse. The seventh purgatory was so agonizing that supreme
Daolords could instantly see their truesouls shattered and destroyed
from the pain!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
stone pillar before him. “This stone pillar has only recorded down
the first three purgatories; only Eternal Emperors will have the
chance to learn the fourth to seventh purgatories! It seems as though
even the Sithe Daolords were only able to train in the first three. I
have to be able to master the first three purgatories if I wish to be
able to traverse the tri-colored chains.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each of the three
colored sections of the tri-colored chains in front of him would
cause an agonizing amount of pain to fill his body. One had to have
mastered the first three purgatories in order to safely cross the
chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to begin!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A cold wind howled past
the white-robed Ning as he waved his hand, causing the temporal
acceleration cabin to appear next to him. Ning entered the log cabin,
then began to train.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mo…ya…ta…”
Ning’s soul began to recite the words to this technique. This was a
soul voice with a strange cadence and profound melody to it. Slowly,
Ning began to feel an increasing level of pain. This pain filled
every inch of his body and began to grow stronger and stronger as
Ning continued the chant. The longer he chanted, the greater the pain
he felt. After an hour had passed, Ning’s forehead was creased in a
frown and a fierce look was in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…kong…la…luo…Sithe.”
Ning finished chanting through the first purgatory and opened his
eyes, his forehead matted with sweat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How terrifying. It
has been a long, long time since I’ve felt as much pain as this…
but it was still within the realm of what I could tolerate.” Ning
immediately shut his eyes and began to work on the second purgatory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was the most
powerful Heartforce Cultivator of the Endless Territories and the
master of the Omega Sword Dao. His Dao-heart was already incredibly
strong!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if he wasn’t a
Heartforce Cultivator, his Dao-heart still would’ve been quite
strong. Long ago, he had been stuck at the fourth stage of
heartforce, ‘mortal dust’, because of his stubborn attachment to
his parents. As a result, he had been unable to calm his mind and
heart enough to reach the fifth stage of heartforce, ‘truth’.
However, his determination to revive his parents was so strong that
his Dao-heart was still incredibly strong even then. Similarly, there
were many Eternal Emperors and even Hegemons who were not Heartforce
Cultivators but who had Dao-hearts of inconceivable strength.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course…
Heartforce Cultivators would by definition have extremely strong
Dao-hearts! Even then, however, there were variations amongst
Heartforce Cultivators. Some were stronger, some were weaker. Ji
Ning, Timedream, Cloudwalker, Winesage… their Dao-hearts naturally
were ranked in this order from first to fourth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…tian…fu…can…Sithe.”
Ning’s face was completely red, and his veins were bulging out of
his trembling body. Despite that, he still managed to forcibly and
fully recite the second purgatory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve finished the
second purgatory as well.” Ning wasn’t very happy. The fact that
he was able to master the first and second purgatories so easily
meant that they would be of little to no use to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time for the third
purgatory of the [Daoheart] technique… the Jinayi purgatory.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning took a deep
breath, allowing his protruding veins to settle back down and the
color of his skin to go back to normal. “Zi…mi…shi…ya…”
Ning began to recite the words to the third purgatory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Agony!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like a colossal
mountain of pain had just come crashing down upon his fragile body.
He almost immediately felt as though he was about to suffer a mental
breakdown. Although Ning had a powerful Dao-heart and things he cared
immensely about, he currently had a feeling of incredible weakness,
as though he wasn’t able to hold on for much longer and was about
to collapse.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clack clack clack
clack… Ning just sat there in the lotus position, but sweat was
pouring down his face and the bones in his body were clacking and
cracking. His muscles and his tendons were at the point of tearing
apart, and even his gums were beginning to ooze blood that began to
drip out from the corners of his lips. Ning, however, didn’t notice
any of this at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His Dao-heart was
completely focused on guarding his spirit and his beliefs while his
soul continued to chant the words to the technique. The pain
continued to increase! Everything in front of him began to turn black
as all sound disappeared from the world. There was nothing aside from
the endless pain!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah…” Ning
suddenly felt his entire mind go blank. His soul naturally stopped
chanting the words to the technique and the agony quickly receded,
allowing him to regain consciousness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He lowered his head to
look at himself. His arms and his crossed legs were all matted with
sweat, with a few rivulets of blood splattered in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was in such pain
that I couldn’t even continue to chant that mantra.” Ning
actually smiled delightedly at this discovery. “Hahaha! Good, good!
That means my Dao-heart isn’t strong enough yet. I wasn’t even
able to master the third purgatory of the [Daoheart] technique on my
first try. Since the Sithe used this to train supreme Daolords, that
means the most powerful Sithe Daolords had even stronger Dao-hearts
than me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha. At least the
third purgatory of the [Daoheart] technique is of use to me.” Ning
was delighted. If he had passed on his first try, that would’ve
meant that the third purgatory was similarly useless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s do this
again. The pain I felt was less than what Ninedust went through,”
Ning mused. It wasn’t that the third purgatory of the [Daoheart]
technique was weaker than the effects of the redscatter venom; Ning
wasn’t able to judge that. All pain, however, was relative. The
redscatter venom and the agony it brought had been enough to cause
Ninedust to scream in agony and beg for Ning to kill him! However, if
it had been Hegemon Brightshore who had been struck by the poison, he
would’ve been able to continue smiling and laughing without seeming
to feel a thing. Pain was a relative concept. The pain brought by the
third purgatory of the [Daoheart] technique was at most able to
prevent Ning from continuing his chanting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However… the
redscatter venom caused Ninedust endless pain without end, pain for a
full twelve days.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Continue.” Ning
once more began to chant the mantra. The seven stages to this
[Daoheart] technique were known as the seven purgatories of the
heart. Amongst the Sithe, even the most supreme of Daolords were only
able to master the first three purgatories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first three
purgatories were viewed as nightmares by even those supreme Sithe
Daolords! They generally would spend countless years training before
each abyss, suffering endless mental torment. If they were unable to
completely master the technique within a single chaos cycle, the
Sithe would forcibly remove them from this place. Only some of their
supreme Daolords were able to master all three of the purgatories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One attempt after
another. Ning’s soul continuously chanted the mantra to the
technique, enduring the endless agonizing that descended upon him.
Each time, the agony caused him to despair and drove him unconscious.
The pain was simply beyond what he could endure, and so he failed
again and again. Each time, his only goal was to increase his limit
further and further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While training, Ning
set up fairly simple barriers and wards around him. Once anyone came,
Ning would naturally be alerted by it. Thus, he was able to
completely invest himself in training.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time continued to flow
on. As Ning continued to suffer more and more torment, he was able to
recite the mantra for longer periods of time. After a total of
twenty-one years…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…qian…fu…la…jie…na…yi…Sithe.”
Ning finally completed his recital of the third purgatory’s mantra.
Although he was wracked by agony, he was at least able to maintain
the presence of mind to finish the recital.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success.” Ning
opened his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning waved his
hand, putting away the temporal acceleration cabin. He then stared at
the stone pillar for a moment, then walked towards the tri-colored
chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, a large group
of supreme Daolords had descended upon the second world, where the
furious fight over the final Voidsea Daoseal continued.

Chapter 15 - Nine Hundred Years
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ji Ning walked
across the tri-colored chains, he could sense throbs of pain reach
out to him from his feet and then spread throughout his body. He
continued to advance one step at a time, but his body began to
quiver. He gritted his teeth, enduring the pain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For these chains to
be able to cause so much pain for so many years to so many people…
they must be valuable treasures.” Although Ning was agonized, he
maintained enough clarity of mind to murmur softly to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, he finished
traversing the tri-colored chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fourth command
talisman.” Ning stared at the ancient black-gold talisman, then
reached out and grabbed it. Ning raised his head to stare upwards at
the steps that led to the top of the altar. At the very top levitated
the extremely precious ninth command talisman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning strode forward
towards, beginning to move up the various steps. There were a total
of 8003 steps to this great altar. Rainbow light suddenly manifested
at the very top of the altar, resolving into a white-robed figure.
Realmsoul Polo smiled as he walked downwards towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Realmsoul Polo?”
Ning was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The realmsoul glanced
at Ning, then smiled. “Darknorth, you are quite fast. You were able
to master both [Vitalis] and [Daoheart] quite quickly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are there any other
new techniques in this altar?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“None.” The
realmsoul shook his head. “You should celebrate the fact that you
learned two such exquisite techniques. How numerous do you take them
for? As for the altar… this altar has a total of 9000 wards and
barriers. If you can defeat all 9000 of them, you’ll be able to
acquire the incredibly precious ninth command talisman.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he spoke, he waved
his sleeves. Swoosh! Triangular motes of golden light immediately
appeared at the top of the altar. The light spread out to form
multiple layers of barriers that repeatedly folded in on each other,
forming a dazzling golden barrier. Ning could immediately tell that
there were indeed thousands of layers to this formation; although he
couldn’t count the exact number, 9000 was a distinct possibility.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Will the barriers
automatically regenerate?” Ning asked. If they were to immediately
regenerate, then he would have to break through all 9000 in a single
strike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, if they
automatically regenerated, you could be ten times as strong as you
currently are and still fail to break through.” Realmsoul Polo
relaxed off to one side as he watched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Ning
immediately manifested three heads and six arms. All six of the
golden swords on his back came flying out and landed within his
hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
willed it, and a barrier immediately appeared next to him which
quickly expanded to cover the entire altar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Temporal acceleration…
100x acceleration!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The altar was not alive
and thus it didn’t cause too much energy to be used up to
accelerate time for it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, quite clever.”
Realmsoul Polo smiled as he watched from the side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the final
challenge in the third world, after all. I’ll wager it won’t be
that easy to beat,” Ning said. Moments later, a sharp light flashed
through his eyes. “Suppress!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning willed his massive
heartworld projection to come crashing down. A heartbeat later, his
nine novessence arts came out in the form of energy dragons, coiling
together to form a Yin-Yang Chaos Domain in accordance with the
principles of the Omega Sword Dao - Yin Yang which furiously pressed
down against the altar. Even though the altar was now suffering the
combined pressures of the heartworld projection and the nine
novessence arts, the 9000 barriers were still able to easily endure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” Ning
immediately executed his Omega Sword Dao - Blood Drop while applying
the [Heartsword] technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light flashed
through the air as Ning’s mist-formed sword stabbed against the
barrier, moving faster than a hundred times the speed of light. The
first barrier was pierced through like paper, but the power of the
strike was greatly reduced. In the end, the mist-formed sword was
unable to stab through the second barrier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh, just so-so. This
speed indicates that it’ll take me perhaps one day to break through
all 9000 barriers. It seems setting up a temporal acceleration field
was overkill.” Ning spoke in an intentionally arrogant manner while
giving Realmsoul Polo a meaningful glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t get cocky.”
Realmsoul Polo watched from afar, an amused smile on his face. “The
ninth command seal won’t be so easily acquired.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Slash! Slash!
Slash! Slash! Ning struck out repeatedly against the barriers,
piercing through a total of 151 barriers. The next time Ning struck
out, he wasn’t able to break through the barrier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The barriers are
increasing in strength.” Ning frowned, then revealed a smile.
“Still, at least the barriers weaken each time I attack them. They
don’t regenerate even when they are weakened but not breached.”
For example, although the 152nd barrier was not destroyed by Ning’s
full-strength strike, it had dimmed and was clearly much weaker than
it had been previously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So long as the barrier
didn’t recover its energy, then he would eventually be able to
break through the 9000 barriers given enough time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break! Break!
Break!” Ning quickly struck out with his six Northbow swords,
applying the Blood Drop stance each time. The Omega Sword Dao - Blood
Drop’s greatest strength lay in its penetrative power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When dealing with
barriers, this sort of penetrating attack was the best type of attack
to use. In addition, the Omega Sword Dao - Blood Drop was Ning’s
most powerful attack! This naturally made the breaching process quite
fast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Slash! Slash!
The six Northbow swords continuously struck out as fast as illusions.
One mist-formed sword after another struck out against the barriers,
causing the barriers to quickly disperse under the weight of the
barrage of attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After roughly half a
day, Ning broke through the 1000th barrier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After roughly six days,
Ning broke through the 2000th barrier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After roughly half a
month, Ning broke through the 3000th barrier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After roughly nine
months, Ning broke through the 4000th barrier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After nearly half a
year, Ning broke through the 5000th barrier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I underestimated
these 9000 barriers.” Ning was furiously assaulting the 5001st
barrier with his six Northbow swords. This barrier was extremely
tough; when Ning first assaulted it, he felt as though he couldn’t
breach it at all, that the barrier wasn’t even weakening in the
slightest. Only after more than ten thousand strikes did the barrier
slowly begin to weaken, and once it did it began to weaken at a very
fast rate. In the end, it finally collapsed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These barriers…
they are strong enough that not even a full-strength blow from the
eight lords of the Sacred Cities would be able to breach them,”
Ning mused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The barriers were so
much more powerful than his attacks that his strikes were like drops
of water sprinkled across stones, having virtually no impact at all.
However, given enough time the wind and the rain could wear down even
the mightiest of mountains! When the barrier finally dropped down
close to Ning’s level of power, Ning would naturally be able to
sense it begin to weaken and break down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I still haven’t
been able to master the eleventh stance of the [Heartsword].” In
recent days, Ning had been working on the eleventh stance of the
[Heartsword] technique, the ‘Teardrop’ strike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighth to tenth
stances of the [Heartsword] represented a tier, while the eleventh to
twelfth stances represented a different tier. Each tier represented a
qualitative transformation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was so incredibly
talented that in just a few short decades he was able to go from the
eighth stance to the tenth stance, but these three stances belonged
to the same tier. The difficulty of the eleventh stance, however, was
on a completely different level from the tenth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was
over-confident. No wonder the records regarding the [Heartsword]
stated that the number of people in each generation who could master
the eleventh or twelfth stances could be counted on one hand! Even
the most talented of swordsmen who have been alive for 108,000 chaos
cycles find it hard to reach this level, while I’ve spent just ten
or so years on it.” Ning regained his normal calm, then smiled. “In
recent years, I’ve been focusing on my Omega Sword Dao - Blood
Drop. I feel as though I’ve gained quite a few insights into it.
Perhaps I’ll break through with it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past five years,
Ning had unleashed countless strikes with the Omega Sword Dao - Blood
Drop. By now, he had more insights into the Blood Drop stance than
any of the other four stances, and so it stood the best chance of
reaching the fourth stage. If he could reach the fourth stage with
his Blood Drop stance, then the power of his Omega Sword Dao - Blood
Drop would increase yet again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Continue.” Ning
continued to furiously strike out with his sword, even though he felt
almost like an ant trying to move a mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After nearly twenty
years, Ning broke through the 6000th barrier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After nearly a century,
Ning broke through the 7000th barrier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After nearly three
centuries, Ning broke through the 8000th barrier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s [Heartsword]
and his Blood Drop stance had yet to make any breakthroughs. Although
he had gained some insights, especially after having used the Blood
Drop stance so many times and after having spent so much time working
on upgrading it, he still hadn’t been able to reach the fourth
stage. His improvements were rapid, but it still wasn’t enough.
This was a sign as to how hard it would be to reach the fourth stage
with all five stances. As for fusing them together into a
fourth-stage Omega Sword Dao? How difficult would that be?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Slash! Slash! A
furious barrage of mist-formed sword energy lashed out in an illusory
fashion, stabbing against the final barrier. Finally, an explosion
boomed out!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After more than 900
years here at the altar, Ning had finally managed to defeat the final
barrier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I finally breached
it.” Ning revealed a delighted look. He had spent over 900 years
furiously assaulting the barrier nonstop. Ning had never done
something like this before!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ninth command
talisman.” Ning walked to the ninth command talisman, then reached
out and grabbed it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…”
Realmsoul Polo began laughing from up high, his voice echoing
throughout every inch of Crimsonwave Temple. “Daolords, the ninth
command talisman for harvesting fruit has already been acquired by
Daolord Darknorth! The rest of you need to hurry up!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You actually…”
Ning raised his head to stare at Realmsoul Polo, shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The command
talismans won’t be won that easily.” Realmsoul Polo looked down
at Ning, a smile playing on his lips. “You can rob others of them,
but others can rob you of them as well.”

Chapter 16 - Consecutive Deaths
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They can try.” Ji
Ning really wasn’t afraid at all. He then raised his head to look
at the realmsoul and asked, “Senior, how am I to return to the
second world?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Simple. Every single
world has a map diagram covering the ground.” Realmsoul Polo
pointed towards the great floating island Ning had started off on. It
was true that the floating island did indeed have a inky circular
diagram that was roughly nine meters in diameter, and the diagram was
covered with black runes that seemed quite mysterious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just step into that
diagram. In ten breaths worth of time, you’ll be transported
straight to the throne of the second world. The second world and the
first world both have similar diagrams in them,” Realmsoul Polo
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning thought
back to what he had seen. Indeed, it was true. However, since
Crimsonwave Temple was covered with so many sculptures, paintings,
and diagrams, at the time Ning hadn’t realized the inky circle had
meant anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To the second world,
then.” Ning put away the ninth command talisman, then immediately
transformed into a streak of light as he flew down the dais. He first
walked past the tri-colored chains, enduring the pain they bought
him, then continuously shifted his truesoul aura as he walked past
the seven-colored chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The last Voidsea
Jadeseal has been seized by Daolord Feich!” Realmsoul Polo’s
voice reverberated throughout every inch of Crimsonwave Temple. “All
three of the remaining Voidsea Jadeseals have been collected.
Daolords, hurry up and do your best to acquire the command talismans.
They are far more valuable than the Voidsea Jadeseals, and every
single talisman is more than valuable enough to drive Eternal
Emperors mad with desire. They represent enormous amounts of valuable
fruits… and right now, only five of them remain!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was still walking
on the seven-colored chains. When he heard Realmsoul Polo said this,
he couldn’t help but feel so angry that he ground his teeth until
they nearly broke. The realmsoul really wanted to just see the world
thrown into chaos!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the realmsoul
had merely spoken the truth. The fruits truly were more valuable than
the Voidsea Jadeseals! Even Hegemons grew excited over these fruits,
while the Dao Alliance was dazzled by the prospect of acquiring them.
In terms of price and value, they were indeed far more valuable than
Voidsea Jadeseals! To Daolords, however, supreme Daomerge treasures
were naturally more important than anything else, no matter how
valuable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only five of the
command talismans remain? It seems Ninedust has acquired one as
well.” Ning had been planning to head to the second world, but
after exiting the seven-colored chains he immediately flew like a
streak of light towards the Ninedust Sectlord’s location.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. “Ah, good.
They haven’t arrived yet,” Ning mused to himself as he reached
Ninedust’s passageway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At present, the only
person within the passageway was Ninedust and Ninedust alone! What
Ning didn’t realize was that when Realmsoul Polo had publicly
announced that he had acquired the ninth command talisman, all of the
supreme Daolords who had been fighting over the Voidsea Jadeseal in
the second world began to grow anxious. “That means Darknorth is
probably going to come here and fight with us over the Voidsea
Jadeseal as well. His assassination arts are extremely terrifying to
deal with. We need to end this faster!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battle had already
been ferocious to begin with. Once word that Ning might be arriving
spread, the battle reached a fever pitch before finally Daolord Feich
ended up seizing the Voidsea Jadeseal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he had managed
to acquire it, he was a low-key supreme Daolord who was only on par
with Fiendqueen Dustrain and the others. The other Daolords weren’t
willing to accept this result and so the battle continued.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning arrived
at Ninedust’s passageway. He immediately saw the rhomboid stone
pillar and the words atop of it introducing the [Vitalis] art. When
he then looked at the seven-colored chains and the tri-colored
chains, he immediately understood that all of the passageways
contained the same techniques with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been hoping
that perhaps the three passageways would all contain different
techniques!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust is still
inside.” Ning stared at the temporal acceleration cottage in front
of the tri-colored chains. Ninedust was inside that cottage. “It
seems he has yet to master the [Daoheart] technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of Dao-heart
strength, Ning was indeed significantly superior to Ninedust; Ning
was a Heartforce Cultivator, after all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third world,
Ninedust’s passageway. Ning sat there on the rocky ground in the
lotus position by himself. Due to the barrier in front of him, there
was no way for him to step onto the rainbow chains. Each supreme
Daolords was only permitted to choose one passageway; there was no
way to enter the other ones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After waiting for four
full hours, Ning suddenly opened his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! A streak of
light flew towards him, resolving into the form of a black-robed
figure who looked at the seated Ning. The black-robed figure said,
“Brother Darknorth, I must congratulate you. If I had known things
would end up like this, I would’ve joined you in fighting over the
command talismans.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Winesage, my
guess is that most of the other supreme Daolords have joined forces.”
Ning rose to his feet. “It looks as though you are still on your
own. Why don’t you join forces with me and Ninedust?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, why should I
join forces with anyone?” Winesage scanned the area. “Darknorth,
can you tell me which passageway still has all of its command
talismans?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That one.” Ning
pointed towards the third passageway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you.”
Winesage immediately flew in that direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just a short while
later, Ning saw a large group of individuals be teleported into the
third world atop the stone island before him. There were a total of
twelve supreme Daolords, with the leader being a devilish
violet-robed figure whose eyes gleamed with violet light and who had
long, unbound black hair. The other eleven supreme Daolords were
clearly following him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth?” When
the violet-robed devil saw Ning, he smiled a cold smile. “What a
coincidence. We actually ran into Daolord Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“King Paleos?” Ning
was surprised. After entering the Waveshift Realm, he had never heard
anything that indicated King Paleos was a particularly powerful
Daolord. King Paleos was a member of the Aeonian race! He was very
low-key, and everyone in the outside world belonged him to merely be
a second-tier Daolord. The most famous Daolord of the Aeonian race
had been King Gorsch… but now, it seemed, King Paleos was also
quite powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Rainbow light
swirled around the air above them, forming into the towering figure
of a white-robed man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All surviving
Daolords have reached the third world. Let me explain… the third
world has a total of three passageways! Every single Daolord is only
permitted to challenge a single passageway. Originally, each
passageway held three command talismans within them, with the total
value in each being roughly the same! But of course, only five
command talismans remain.” Realmsoul Polo’s voice echoed
throughout the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the realmsoul was
speaking, Ning received certain news from the Brightshore Kingdom.
“What?!” Ning was shocked. The Dao Alliance had issued a new
Daolord ranking!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In recent years, the
Daolord rankings had changed to a shocking degree.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Dreamlore
ranks number three?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“King Paleos ranks
number six?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Skyaxe
died?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“King Cliffbank
died?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was completely
stunned when he saw the new rankings. A total of six supreme Daolords
had died in the fight over the final Voidsea Jadeseal, and the
Daolord rankings had completely changed. The first was Winesage, the
second was Darknorth, the third was Dreamlore, the fourth was Palace
Lord Dawnstar, the fifth was the Radiant King, the sixth was King
Paleos, the seventh was Daolord Owlblack, the eighth was Ninestone,
the ninth was Daolord Skyshatter, and the tenth was Daolord Tigrone…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A brand new group of
supreme Daolords had arisen! Many had been very low-key in the past
and not very well known, but in the fight over the Voidsea Jadeseal
they had revealed their fierceness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Paleos’ violet
eyes were focused on Ning. He said coldly, “Only five of the nine
command talismans remain. You, Darknorth, should’ve acquired three
of them. Your ally, the Ninedust Sectlord, seems to have acquired one
as well… but the twelve of us haven’t acquired so much as a
single one, nor have we acquired any Voidsea Jadeseals. Daolord
Darknorth, don’t you think this is a bit unfair?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth.”
Fiendqueen Dustrain was behind King Paleos, and she spoke out in a
similarly cold voice, “We don’t ask for me. We can forget about
the other two talismans, nor will we force the Ninedust Sectlord to
hand over his. The ninth command talisman, however… you must hand
it to us! Hand us the ninth command talisman and we won’t cause you
any trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hand over the ninth
command talisman.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hand it over,
Daolord Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not even Winesage is
a match for us. Darknorth, you should go ahead and hand it over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Paleos and the
other supreme Daolords all stared at Ning. They were all supreme
Daolords. If they were in a smaller group of just four or five, they
might be very nervous when facing Ning, but there were twelve of them
right now; they wouldn’t be afraid of even Winesage! In fact, they
had already battled against Winesage earlier. Why would they fear
Daolord Darknorth?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus far, the twelve of
them had acquired nothing at all. If they were able to harvest the
fruits of the ninth command talisman, they would be able to split the
harvest and trade for some rare materials from the various Hegemons
or the Dao Alliance. In that way, at least, their visit to the
Waveshift Realm wouldn’t have been in vain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned. The
command talismans represented the fruits of the Crimsonwave Temple,
so valuable that the Dao Alliance and the Hegemons were going crazy
over them. The ninth command talisman was the most valuable and an
absolutely priceless item. Ning was planning on using them to rescue
Yu Wei!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang! Clang!
Ning’s body blurred as he manifested three heads and six arms. Six
streaks of golden light immediately shot out from his back and landed
in his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three-headed,
six-armed, white-robed youth stared coldly at the supreme Daolords,
six Northbow swords at the ready. “Cut the crap, you pack of fools.
Come and die!”

Chapter 17 - Furious Battle
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quite bold. Daolord
Skyaxe was similarly bold when facing me… but in the end, I killed
him. A pity. I haven’t had the chance to battle against the Radiant
King or Dawnstar yet. If I had, I wouldn’t be ranked merely number
six. Come and show me how strong you are, oh mighty second-ranked
Darknorth.” King Paleos manifested six arms as well, each arm
wielding a strange sawtoothed weapon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Surround him and
kill him,” Fiendqueen Dustrain barked coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth doesn’t
have an invulnerable form; it’ll be much easier to kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since he’s
courting death, let us give it to him. Once we kill him, we’ll be
able to take all of his command talismans.” The supreme Daolords
were all boiling with the desire to kill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face tightened
as a fierce light shone from his eyes. He glared at King Paleos and
said coldly, “So you were the one to kill Daolord Skyaxe?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. Otherwise, how
would I be ranked at number six?” King Paleos asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn you.” Ning
was infuriated. There were very few supreme Daolords he was friends
with, but Daolord Skyaxe was one of them. When he had been weak and
besieged by Daolord Shaka outside Skywood City, one of the eight
Sacred Cities of the Dao Alliance, he had begged the Brightshore
Kingdom for aid. Palace Lord Soleman and Daolord Skyaxe had
immediately come to his aid, and as a result Ning had become friends
with both of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the
relationship naturally wasn’t nearly as deep as the one he shared
with Ninedust, who he had shared life-and-death experiences with,
they were still good friends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Afraid?” King
Paleos smirked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“DIE!” Ning was
boiling with murderous rage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! A terrifying wave
of invisible force instantly lashed out towards them from Ning,
striking against the souls and truesouls of the twelve supreme
Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah!” “Ahhh!”
Two of the supreme Daolords instantly turned pale, followed by their
heads drooping downwards. The faces of many of the other Daolords
also tightened slightly, but at least they were able to maintain
their clarity of mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a terrifying
heartforce art.” King Paleos’ face tightened as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Just now,
Ning had used the [Heartforce Eradicator] art. It was linked to his
Omega Sword Dao, and so now that Ning had reached the third stage of
his Omega Sword Dao the power of his [Heartforce Eradicator] had also
significantly improved. However, to directly slay a supreme Daolord
was still no easy feat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And yet, Ning’s goal
wasn’t to actually slay any of them outright. His goal was to crush
their morale and douse their bravado.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Next, his vast
heartworld projection came crashing down. At the center of that
massive, illusory world was that enormous sword-shaped mountain, and
it came plunging straight down towards all of the supreme Daolords,
causing their bodies to stiffen. As far as heartworld projections
went, at present there was no Daolord who was a match for Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A heartbeat later, nine
energy dragons came howling out of Ning’s body, forming the
Yin-Yang Chaos Domain around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One person wants to
suppress the twelve of us by himself? He’s too arrogant.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He doesn’t know
his own limits.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Paleos and the
others used their own secret arts as well. Some were strong, some
were weak, but when joined together they vastly outstripped Ning in
power. The difference was, Ning’s heartworld projection and his
secret arts were able to merge together seamlessly! These supreme
Daolords weren’t able to merge their secret arts together; if they
tried, they would begin to interfere with each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, they had
gained some experience from their previous battle against Winesage.
There were some secret arts that could work together, such as Five
Elements arts or Yin and Yang arts. In this way, their secret arts
could be improved in power as they worked together to suppress Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, since Ning’s
heartworld projection was also capable of restricting and suppressing
part of the secret arts. The two sides began a battle of secret arts
and heartworld projections. Ning was forced to shrink the radius of
his secret arts, but he was still able to hold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Six
Northbow swords in hand, Ning charged straight towards the strongest
foe, King Paleos. King Paleos might be strong, but Ning held him in
no regard at all. Ning would dare to battle even Winesage in solo
combat; why would he fear King Paleos?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He didn’t pick the
weakest member but instead went after me?” King Paleos’ long
black hair fluttered behind him as he sent his six serrated blades
howling towards Ning. As he did, a thick black fog spread out from
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Swish! Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six streaks of
mist-formed swords appeared before him with incredible speed, so fast
that King Paleos’ face instantly turned pale. “How can he be this
fast? He’s even faster than the Radiant King. In fact, perhaps only
Daolord Dreamlore is a match for him in speed!” He had yet to truly
battle against the Radiant King or Daolord Dreamlore, but during the
previous fights over the Voidsea Jadeseals he had watched both of
them strike with despair-inducing speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Darknorth’s swords
were just as fast… no, they was even faster than the Radiant King’s
strikes! Perhaps only Daolord Dreamlore and his dazzling,
blood-streaked bloodblade strikes were on par with Darknorth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang! Clang!
King Paleos furiously defended himself against Ning’s onslaught.
His six serrated blades were quite strange and unpredictable. When
used for defense, they were quite formidable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” King
Paleos could sense that every single one of his blades were enduring
a terrifying amount of power with each strike. His fingers were
turning numb and his body was trembling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fast and furious!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Omega Sword Dao -
Blood Drop was the fastest and most penetrating attack Ning had to
muster. But of course, in raw power alone it wasn’t even close to
the Heavenbreaker in might. Although the Northbow swords boosted the
Blood Drop stance the most, this stance was still weaker than the
Heavenbreaker stance. Despite that, it still contained quite a bit of
power! This was especially true after Ning had mastered the tenth
stance of the [Heartsword], as this allowed Ning to infuse every
single strike with incredible weight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Paleos felt as
though every single strike brought him incredible pressure. If it was
just a matter of speed, he would have a solution. If it was just a
matter of power, he would also have a solution! The problem was, Ji
Ning’s swords not only surpassed the Radiant King in speed, they
actually surpassed King Paleos’ ultimate attacks in power as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is this
possible? How could he be this much stronger than me? I-impossible…
I’ve reached a perfect level of power. I’m not a match for
Winesage, but that’s because Winesage has a Universe treasure. None
of the other supreme Daolords could dominate me like this!” King
Paleos couldn’t believe it, nor did he want to believe it. He had
always been very proud of himself and had been very dissatisfied with
his ranking as the sixth Daolord. As he saw it, any Daolord who
didn’t have a Universe treasure would only be on par with him at
most.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Slash! Slash!
Slash! Ning’s swords were simply too fast! Mist-formed swords flew
everywhere, creating an almost illusory dreamscape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the sake of
destroying the 9000 barriers as quickly as possible, Ning had grown
accustomed to launching a furious barrage of attacks. Now that he was
boiling with the desire to murder the man before him, he was able to
strike 129 times with unmatchable speed. King Paleos’ defenses were
quite impressive and he used all six serrated blades to defend at the
same time… but perpetual defense would result in defeat. In the
end, one strike from Ning slipped past his guard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! A streak of
sword-light stabbed straight into King Paleos’ body, but King
Paleos transformed into a blood-tinged black fog.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An invulnerable
form?” Ning frowned. Dealing with cultivators who had invulnerable
forms was quite taxing. Ninedust was an example of someone who had an
invulnerable aquaform.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack together and
kill him!” With the billowing black fog, streams of bloody light
reformed to manifest into King Paleos. He bellowed loudly, “Daolords,
no one can beat him in a one-on-one fight. Join forces to kill him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Surround him and
kill him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t get greedy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Paleos had been
defeated in a single exchange by that furious barrage of sword-mist
and had only survived thanks to his invulnerable form. This instantly
frightened all of the other supreme Daolords. This Darknorth was
simply too terrifying! For him to be able to fight against four
supreme Daolords and kill both Timedream and Kingfreak was one thing,
but King Paleos was far stronger than the Kingfreak or Timedream in
close combat. Despite that, he had also been defeated in a single
exchange?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What they didn’t
realize was that Ning had mastered the tenth stance of the
[Heartsword] in Crimsonwave Temple. If it hadn’t been for this
technique, he still would’ve been able to beat King Paleos but he
wouldn’t have been able to do it just through a simple barrage of
Blood Drop stance strikes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful?” Ning
swept them with his gaze. “It doesn’t matter how careful you
are.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning vanished
without a trace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s his
assassination arts! Careful, he can appear anywhere!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful,
everyone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack! Attack!
Don’t let him get close to us!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The supreme Daolords
began to blindly launch attacks in every direction. Ning’s
heartworld projection and nine novessence arts ensured that so long
as he remained within their range, there would be no way for his
enemies to find him once he used his assassination arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning appeared
out of nowhere, then struck at the supreme Daolord closest to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Block, quick!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Join forces!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some used magic
treasures, others used secret arts. All of them threw attacks towards
Ning as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Slash! Ning’s
six Northbow swords executed varying sword-arts as he blocked the
attacks and continued his charge. His defensive abilities were far
stronger than King Paleos’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dodge, quick!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dodge!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The supreme Daolords
were so terrified that they frantically retreated, moving closer to
their peers. Only when five of them worked in unison would they be
able to resist Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s utterly
terrifying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth’s
sword-arts are completely flawless. He’s able to easily defend
himself against our combined attacks while continuing to charge at
us!” This was the first time these Daolords experienced the terror
of Ning for themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was already
incredibly strong to begin with. Now that he had the Northbow swords
and the tenth stance of the [Heartsword], Ning’s advantage over the
other supreme Daolords had only grown. Winesage was able to dominate
the other supreme Daolords, and so too was Ji Ning. The difference
was, Ning’s ‘Shadowless’ evasion art was so unpredictable and
mysterious that the other supreme Daolords were terrified of it and
him.

Chapter 18 - One Man Army
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” King
Paleos, Fiendqueen Dustrain, and the others were all shocked. Things
were turning out completely contrary to what they had expected. Not
even Winesage had put them in such dire straits! Although Winesage
was able to crush any supreme Daolord in a head-on fight, when the
twelve of them worked together they were able to dominate him. Faced
with their combined attacks, even Winesage was in rather bad shape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Daolord Darknorth
was actually beating them silly? Was Darknorth even more powerful
than Winesage?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What they didn’t
realize was that Ji Ning was indeed better than Winesage in dealing
with group attacks! Ning’s sword-arts were more perfect and
flawless, allowing him a truly airtight defense against mass attacks!
His Shadowless sword-arts allowed him to vanish without a trace,
making it so that his enemies couldn’t focus their fire against him
while he was able to launch counter-attacks as he pleased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of these factors
combined to ensure that at any given moment, no more than five
supreme Daolords were able to fight against Ning! This was why Ning
had the advantage and held the initiative. These supreme Daolords
were all so frightened that they began to cluster closer to each
other, no longer daring to launch attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, let’s
call it off,” King Paleos roared mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Call it off?” Ning
rebutted coldly, “Acceptable, but you need to get the fuck out of
this passageway.” Ning knew that not even Winesage would be able to
kill these twelve Daolords now that they were working together, much
less himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“By what right are
you denying us entry to this passageway? You can already harvest the
fruit you need; this passageway is meaningless to you. If we want to
force our way in, you won’t be able to stop us!” King Paleos said
furiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning came
to a halt as well. He just stood there, the area around him covered
by his heartworld projection as the nine energy dragons coiled around
him in accordance with his Yin-Yang sword-intent. “I cannot enter
this passageway, true, but if you wish to enter it you must first
master the [Vitalis] art… and so long as I am here, you can forget
about quietly meditating on it and mastering it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“King Paleos,
Darknorth is telling the truth. The rhomboid stone pillar does indeed
say that one has to master the [Vitalis] art and learn how to
disguise one’s truesoul aura before one can safely pass through
those seven-colored chains.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth isn’t
going to let us train in peace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” The twelve
supreme Daolords all felt resigned. Ning wasn’t able to kill them,
but he was entirely capable of disrupting them while they attempted
to train, making it impossible for them to master this technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” King
Paleo gritted his teeth. He had no choice but to retreat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Although the
other supreme Daolords felt insulted and humiliated, they all ended
up retreating. In truth, these Daolords were all ranked towards the
bottom of the first-tier, which was why they agreed to fight under
King Paleos’ banner in a group of twelve. In the past, Fiendqueen
Dustrain might’ve ranked in the top ten… but now? So many
powerful, low-key supreme Daolords had emerged that she had long ago
been shoved out of the top ten.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning
watched as the supreme Daolords flew away, then dispelled his
heartworld projection and his secret arts. He continued to silently
stand guard over this region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had to help
Ninedust… or to be precise, he had to help himself. Ninedust had
said early on that he would give Ning all of the command talismans he
acquired! Thus, Ning naturally had to do his best to prevent any of
the other Daolords from entering this passageway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth has
reached an incredible level of power. He and Winesage have clearly
surpassed the rest of us by a tremendous amount.” King Paleos’
group of supreme Daolords quickly arrived at a new passageway. This
was the passageway which Ning had already traversed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are we going to give
up, just like that?” Fiendqueen Dustrain sent mentally. She was the
second-in-command of this squad.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph…” King
Paleos let out a cold snort. His eyes suddenly lit up when he stared
at the rhomboid stone pillar. “The [Vitalis] art.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fiendqueen glanced at
it as well, then shook her head. “The command talismans in this
passageway have already been taken. It must have been Darknorth who
did it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Doesn’t matter.
The [Vitalis] art can be learned here.” King Paleos pointed at the
rhomboid pillar. “Let’s memorize the technique then begin to
train! Once we master it, we’ll head to the passageway the Ninedust
Sectlord took. So long as we can make it past the rainbow chains,
Darknorth won’t be able to attack us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“King Paleo speaks
the truth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them agreed with
this plan. They could learn the technique but decline to actually
enter the passageway. Later on, they could choose to challenge the
Ninedust Sectlord’s passageway or perhaps a different on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three passageways. More
than thirty supreme Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because Ning’s
original passageway had already been cleaned out, everyone’s
attention turned towards the other two passageways.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.
Whoosh. Four figures came flying over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the stone island,
Ning raised his head to look at them. His eyes narrowed. The new
arrivals were Daolord Dreamlore, Daolord Tigrone, Daolord Skyshatter,
and Daolord Owlblack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The four of them?”
Ning didn’t dare to feel the slightest bit of arrogance. All four
of them were ranked in the top ten, and the current top ten was much
stronger than the previous top ten. Many Daolords who had been
previously low-key had emerged, and every single one was difficult to
deal with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dreamlore was ranked
number three and was second only to Ning himself. Both Dawnstar and
the Radiant King had been defeated by him, a testament to his power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You wish to stop us
and to assist your good friend Ninedust?” Daolord Dreamlore smirked
as he glanced at Ning. “Darknorth, you’ve already helped him
acquire a Voidsea Jadeseal; are you going to help him again? What a
selfless man you are.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m actually
helping myself,” Ning said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What, you actually
plan on stopping the four of us?” the heavily-armored and muscular
Daolord Tigrone spoke in a deep, rumbling voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heh heh heh…”
Daolord Owlblack laughed, his voice grating and piercing to the ear.
“He really doesn’t know his own limits.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s one of me
and four of you… but you still won’t be able to do anything to
me,” Ning said icily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dreamlore and the
others frowned. The four of them could suppress even Winesage in a
frontal attack, but they had to admit that if Ning wished to hide
they wouldn’t even be able to track him down. He had a heartworld
projection, his nine novessence arts, and even that assassination
art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So long as I am
here, there’s no way you’ll be able to train in the [Vitalis] art
in peace,” Ning said. “Leave. Go somewhere else.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nice one,” Daolord
Owlblack smiled coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s a nasty
move.” Daolord Skyshatter ground his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There really was
nothing the four of them could do. Cultivation required silence and
focus; if Ning was causing trouble for them, how could they possibly
train?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, there are
only three passageways in total. You’ve already cleaned out one of
them, so there really are only two left. The other is current being
challenged by Winesage, Dawnstar, Ninestone, and Cloudwalker, and the
others. The other Daolords probably won’t be able to catch up to
them and so many of them will come here instead. They’ll master the
[Vitalis] art and then charge through in mass. I want to see how many
of them you can stop!” Daolord Dreamlore said coldly, “We’re
leaving now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four of them smiled
coldly as they flew away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew that a ‘one
man army’ like himself wouldn’t be able to hold everyone off
forever. However, every moment he held them off for was an extra
moment for Ninedust. Ninedust was helping him out, after all; the
more command talismans he acquired, the more fruit he would be able
to harvest and the better his chances of reviving his wife were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning
radiated an eager desire to do battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time continued to flow
on, with Ning standing a silent guard. As for the Ninedust Sectlord,
he was still stuck on the [Daoheart] technique. More than a month
went by.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh. An
awe-inspiring group of figures flew over from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised his head,
his face tightening. The arrivals were Daolord Dreamlore’s group of
four and King Paleos’ group of twelve.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Charge onto the
seven-colored chains!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixteen supreme
Daolords charged forwards, executing their secret arts and sending
out a flood of magic items to attack. Ning’s face had turned solemn
long ago, and he hurriedly used his heartworld projection and his
nine novessence arts to attack while using his Shadowless evasion art
to vanish without a trace. In the face of such a gathering of power,
he didn’t dare to fight head-on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tigrone, Skyshatter,
the two of you stand guard for now while the two of us charge through
the chains. As agreed, the four of us will evenly split any fruit we
acquire,” Dalord Dreamlore sent mentally. He knew very well that he
himself wouldn’t be able to keep a command talisman safe by
himself. The four of them would have to continue to work together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Daolord
Tigrone and Daolord Skyshatter both nodded as Owlblack and Dreamlore
both charged towards the seven-colored chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop right there!”
Ning’s heartworld projection and nine novessence arts were
compressed to a smaller region, serving as a ‘bottleneck’ in
front of the seven-colored chains. If anyone wished to cross through
the chains, they would have to first cross this region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning revealed himself,
six Northbow swords at the ready within the ‘bottleneck’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You wish to block
all of us?” Dreamlore smiled coldly. “King Paleos!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s attack!”
King Paleos’ led six of his supreme Daolords to press the assault
as well. It had only been a month or so, after all. Even though they
had temporal acceleration treasures, only some of them had mastered
the [Vitalis] art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You won’t be able
to stop us.” King Paleos led the six supreme Daolords, joining
Daolord Dreamlore and Daolord Owlblack as they charged towards Ning.
</P>

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Paleos, Fiendqueen
Dustrain, Daolord Owlblack, and Daolord Dreamlore led the group of
nine supreme Daolords in charging straight towards Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One against nine? Not
even Winesage would be able to pull that off, to say nothing of Ji
Ning. Not only that, even the other supreme Daolords hanging back
such as Daolord Tigrone and Daolord Skyshatter were charging towards
Ning, seeking to tie him down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He won’t be able
to stop us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nobody can stop this
many Daolords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, we’re going
to make it through.” The supreme Daolords were filled with
confidence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three-headed,
six-armed Ning stood there by himself at the beginning of the
seven-colored chains. His six Northbow swords were at the ready,
while the nine novessence arts and the heartworld projection covered
the surrounding area. He just watched calmly as the host of supreme
Daolords charged towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Ning suddenly
vanished without a trace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful, don’t let
him ambush you. His assassination art is extremely unpredictable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all began to
wildly blast the entire area while sending their own secret arts and
heartworld projections to contend with Ning’s head-on. As they did
so, they continued their charge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We made it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I made it as well.”
One supreme Daolord after another landed on the seven-colored chains.
As soon as they did so, they were able to sense an invisible force
wrap around them that protected them from the battle raging just
outside. No combat was possible on the chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go!” King
Paleos charged forwards as well. Clang! Suddenly, a black hole
appeared directly in front of him. A moment later, he was blasted
backwards with a huge booming sound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Daolord Owlblack
fought in a barehanded style and was extremely strong in close
combat, but just like Paleos he was blasted backwards with an
explosion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful! That’s
Darknorth!” King Paleos and Daolord Owlback were both furious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had to briefly
reveal himself while attacking, and he swept the group with a cold
gaze. A heartbeat later, he vanished once more. It was very difficult
for Ning to kill them, but his defensive sword-arts were so
superlative and the [Heartsword] technique so formidable that it was
very easy for him to stop them in their tracks and knock them flying,
one after the other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I refuse to believe
it.” Daolord Dreamlore’s youthful face had a look of cold malice
on it as he struck out with his massive two-handed bloodblade.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuck off.” Whoosh!
An incomparably dazzling streak of bloody light suddenly appeared. It
was like a scene of peerless beauty that would cause those who saw it
to be intoxicated by it. Even Daolord Dreamlore himself was
completely absorbed and entranced when he executed this attack. This
‘bloodblade’ was a very mysterious and unique weapon. He had been
entranced by it, and his Dao was able to truly and fully merge with
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fast! Even faster
than me!” Ning was shocked. His swords were incredibly fast, but
when he saw that dazzlingly beautiful streak of bloody light he knew
that his attacks were still significantly slower in comparison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s six Northbow
swords struck out in unison. Ning had been able to use merely a
single sword to knock Daolord Paleos, Daolord Owlblack, and
Fiendqueen Dustrain back, but he didn’t dare to be the slightest
bit overconfident against Daolord Dreamlore’s dazzling strike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six streams of
mist-formed swords struck out, each of them moving faster than a
hundred time’s the speed of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang! Clang! In
the end, he had an advantage in that he only needed to focus on
defense. Although the Radiant King and Palace Lord Dawnstar had been
defeated by Daolord Dreamlore, they were still able to preserve their
lives. In comparison, Ning’s close combat abilities could be
described as truly perfect and flawless!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he was using
the Omega Sword Dao - Blood Drop, in the instant that his sword-light
collided it transformed into the Omega Sword Dao - Soleheart. After
truly developing the Omega Sword Dao, Ning’s offensive techniques
could transform into defensive techniques, and vice versa. All
techniques could be instantly converted into different techniques
without even the slightest trace or opening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Daolord Dreamlore
only felt an enormous shockwave sweep past his body, sending him
stumbling backwards. A look of shock appeared on his face. This was
the first time that his attack had been crushed head-on!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Dawnstar and
the Radiant King had been able to survive his assault, they had been
left in very bad shape. Even if Winesage was to face off against this
attack of his, Winesage would be forced to simply defend, given that
Winesage was just too slow. Darknorth, however, was able to crush
him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible.
Impossible!” A berserk look appeared within Daolord Dreamlore’s
eyes. “Again!” He was filled with the utmost devotion and
sincerity towards his bloodblade.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Yet another
dazzling streak of bloody light filled the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning’s
six streaks of mist-formed sword energy once more appeared as well.
They were like the spokes to a giant wheel, and when they stabbed out
the quickly began to swivel together to form a massive black hole
that smashed directly against bloody streak of light, destroying it
and knocking Daolord Dreamlore flying backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Dreamlore,
you might be faster than me… but you only have a single bloodblade.
If you had six, I’d probably find it much tougher to deal with
you.” Ning’s voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His sword wasn’t as
fast as Daolord Dreamlore’s, but at least he was closer to
Dreamlore’s speed than any other Daolord. The difference wasn’t
as great as it was for the likes of Winesage and Dawnstar! Given that
he was able to defend with all six Northbow swords at the same time
while using incredibly tough defensive sword-arts, he was naturally
able to endure the blow and knock his opponent backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn that
Darknorth.” The nearby King Paleos, Daolord Owlblack, and
Fiendqueen Dustrain all began to grow anxious. Dreamlore was knocked
flying back, an ugly look on his face. After he had defeated the
Radiant King and Dawnstar, he had felt extremely confident in being
able to challenge the second-ranked Daolord Darknorth… but reality
had just slapped him in the face! He could sense the enormous
disparity in power between the two of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What he didn’t know
was that ever since Ning had mastered the tenth stance of the
[Heartsword] art, Ning had already closed the gap between himself and
Winesage! This meant there was now a huge gap in power between Ning
and all other supreme Daolords which was only worsened by how
balanced and flawless Ning’s sword-arts were!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The other Daolords
have already made it across. The only ones left here are us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn that Darknorth.
He’s quite crafty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dreamlore, King Paleos,
Owlblack, and Fiendqueen Dustrain were all frantic with impatience.
Nine of them had started this charge, and Ning truly wasn’t able to
stop all of them at once… but he was more than capable of tying
down four of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning once more
reappeared in front of the seven-colored chains. “You shall not
pass.” Ning looked at the four of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should we do?
When we attack, Darknorth just hides and ignores us.” Tigrone,
Skyshatter, and the others who were holding back and not planning to
cross the chains began to grow anxious as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning completely ignored
them. His attention was focused on the four.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew that it was
fairly hard to master the [Daoheart] technique. As for defeating the
9000 barriers? Those weaker first-tier Daolords wouldn’t pose
Ninedust any risk at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this very moment,
Ninedust was within the floating stone island in front of the second
abyss. He was training in the [Daoheart] technique with his temporal
acceleration cottage. He had failed time and time again, and thus he
knew exactly what was going on outside thanks to those moments of
clarity. “I n eed to speed up. Darknorth is buying me as much time
as he can. I need to speed it up!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.
Five supreme Daolords appeared before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust, hand over
the Voidsea Jadeseal!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hand it over,
Ninedust!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five supreme
Daolords immediately surrounded and attacked Ninedust. To them, the
Voidsea Jadeseal was what truly mattered. The command talismans might
technically be more valuable, but they were only of use to Eternal
Emperors. No amount of treasures the Eternal Emperors might give them
would make any difference if they weren’t able to complete the
Daomerge! To them, all nine command talismans weren’t as valuable
as a single one of those Voidsea Jadeseals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The temporal
acceleration cottage vanished, while Ninedust transformed into an
endless sea of water that filled the surrounding area. Part of the
sea coalesced into a humanoid figure that spoke out: “I, Ninedust,
swear on my very life itself that I have already used up the Voidsea
Jadeseal I acquired. If I violate or betray this oath, may my soul
and truesoul be shattered and dispersed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His booming voice
filled the entire world around them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five supreme
Daolords who had been permitted by Ning to enter this island were all
stunned. Even Daolord Dreamlore and the others on the first island
were all stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He already used it up?
One of the main reasons why they had so frantically attempted to make
it onto the second island was because they wanted to take Ninedust’s
Voidsea Jadeseal from him! This was what truly drew their attention.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of them wanted to
believe it, but Ninedust had already sworn a lifeblood oath. That
meant this was definitely true.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damnit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually used
it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just what I was
afraid of…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He must’ve used it
up when we were busy fighting over the final Voidsea Jadseal in the
second world…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sly bastard.” All
of them felt resentment and regret. Still, all that resentment was of
no use. Since Ninedust had already used it up, they didn’t want to
waste any more time on him. He had an invulnerable aquaform, after
all; he wouldn’t be easily defeated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This [Daoheart]
technique… it’s absolutely marvelous. Absolutely inconceivable!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Daoheart]
technique?” After a brief moment of disappointment, the five
supreme Daolords turned their attention to the [Daoheart] technique.
All of them were stunned and wildly delighted, and they quickly began
to memorize and train in the technique. Techniques which could be
used to strengthen the Dao-heart were truly priceless. This technique
alone made their visit to Crimsonwave Temple worth it.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s a
[Daoheart] technique?” King Paleos called out loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A technique that can
be used to enhance the Dao-heart,” one of the five supreme Daolords
immediately shouted back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Paleos, Daolord
Dreamlore, and the others instantly grew excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gentlemen, if you
are willing to choose a different passageway I’d be willing to
transmit the [Daoheart] technique do you,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need. They’ve
already sworn lifeblood oaths to share any and all techniques we
find,” Daolord Tigrone said in a gravelly voice. The reason why he
was willing to forgo charging into the passageway was precisely
because the others had all sworn lifeblood oaths to share any
techniques they found as well as to split any fruit they acquired.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning said
calmly, “It doesn’t matter. The four of you can forget about
making it across.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s defensive
prowess was such that not a single attack had landed on him yet. In
truth, even if he had been hit his Hegemon armor would’ve been able
to absorb the blow. Tying down four supreme Daolords was entirely
within Ning’s capabilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The four of us won’t
be able to make it across,” King Paleos sent mentally. “Tigrone,
Skyshatter, the two of you need to train in the [Vitalis] art as soon
as possible. Once you master it, you can join the four of us in our
attempts. If all six of us work together, he probably won’t be able
to stop us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The main
reason why Tigrone, Skyshatter, and the rest didn’t join the
attempt was because they hadn’t mastered [Vitalis]. Ning could
simply ignore them and thus was able to easily focus his efforts on
stopping just the other four.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a time, the
battlefield grew silent. Ning continued to stand there by himself in
front of the seven-colored chains, a single man who could stop even
an army in its tracks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another five days went
by.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” Loud
laughter rang out as the Ninedust Sectlord stepped onto the
tri-colored chains and began to stride across them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” The faces
of Daolord Dreamlore, King Paleos, and the others all turned pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent.” Ning
revealed a delighted look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust walked across
the tri-colored chains. Although the level of pain increased as he
continued to advance, he was still able to endure it and make it
across to the altar, where he acquired the sixth command talisman at
its base.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, Darknorth, it
took me forever to master the ‘Dao-heart’ challenge. I really
feel a bit embarrassed.” Ninedust turned to stare at Ning, calling
out to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop wasting time
and words. Hurry up and crack the altar open! Remember, use a
temporal acceleration treasure! This challenge is the hardest of
all,” Ning called out loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Got it!” Ninedust
responded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although King Paleos
and the others were very anxious, there was nothing they could do.
Ning had focused on the four of them with laser-like precision. Given
that the heartworld projection and the nine novessence arts were all
aimed at them, there really was no way for them to get across.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another half month went
past. Finally, Tigrone and Skyshatter both mastered the [Vitalis] art
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go
together.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to see how
he’ll stop this many of us!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dreamlore, King Paleos,
Owlblack, Dustrain, Tigrone, and Skyshatter joined forces to charge
towards the seven-colored chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh? What’s going
on?” Daolord Tigrone found out that… nothing happened at all. No
one impeded him as he charged onto the seven-colored chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? I made it?”
Fiendqueen Dustrain was stunned as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two hurriedly
crossed the seven-colored chains. However, Dreamlore, King Paleos,
Daolord Owlblack, and Skyshatter were all stopped by Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The four of you
aren’t allowed to cross.” Ning’s voice rang out. He had
specifically decided on which Daolords he could let across. In the
end, he just wasn’t strong enough and wouldn’t be able to block
everyone, and thus he had to pick and choose who he would and would
not let cross.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five he had
initially let onto the seven-colored chains were all supreme Daolords
who ranked at the back of the line. They posed no threat at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Fiendqueen
Dustrain? When Ninedust had first arrived at the Waveshift Realm, he
had already been on par with her! However, back then Ninedust had
only recently become a Daolord of the Fourth Step and hadn’t come
up with any ultimate attacks for himself yet. Thanks to the legacy of
the Ancient Hegemon as well as his experiences in Crimsonwave Temple,
he had already come up with a total of three killer attacks and had
definitely surpassed Fiendqueen Dustrain in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be remembered
that breaking through the 9000 barriers was all about attack power!
Ninedust’s attack power was definitely above Fiendqueen Dustrain’s,
and so she wouldn’t prove to be much of a threat. As a result, Ning
let her across.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Daolord Tigrone?
His defensive prowess was truly unrivalled, but his attacks were much
weaker. He also wouldn’t be much of a threat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Dreamlore,
Owlblack, Skyshatter, and Paleos were the four most dangerous
Daolords present. Ning naturally would have to stop them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You fight dirty,
Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Tigrone and
Fiendqueen Dustrain, do your best to acquire that command talisman.
If you can kill Ninedust, all the better.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’ll be up to the
two of you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dreamlore and the
others had to give up, even though they didn’t wish to.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go find the
Radiant King, Daolord Feich, and the others. The final Voidsea
Jadeseal is on Daolord Feich,” Daolord Dreamlore ordered. He
immediately led Owlblack, Skyshatter, and King Patreos as well as the
other Daolords in leaving. These nine supreme Daolords began to
charge towards the other passageway in search of Daolord Feich.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everything fell silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dustrain, Tigrone, and
the rest of the supreme Daolords were all focused on the [Daoheart]
technique. As for Ninedust, he had already reached the altar. He
first used the temporal acceleration treasure to cover the entire
thing, then began to assault the 9000 barriers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No one’s coming?”
Ning’s life was now quite relaxed. “Maybe I should go take a look
and see how the other passageway is doing.” Ning flew towards the
direction of Winesage’s passageway. When he reached the edges of
the passageway, he stared at the distant islands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wow!” Ning was
stupefied by what he saw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The situation in this
passageway was far more chaos. Winesage, Dawnstar, Cloudwalker, and
Ninestone were at the peak of the altar, working together to assault
the 9000 barriers while also assaulting each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the situation on
the levitating stone island in front of the second abyss? It was even
more chaotic! The Radiant King, Daolord Snowjoy, Daolord Shaka, the
Starking, Daolord Feich, and a number of other supreme Daolords were
battling each other, with Daolord Snowjoy and Daolord Shaka working
together but surrounded and assaulted by the other five.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Feich!” A
furious shout rang out, followed by King Paleos, Daolord Dreamlore,
Daolord Owlblack, and Daolord Skyshatter arriving. They easily
traversed the seven-colored chains and joined the wild melee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” The faces
of the Radiant King and the others turned pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It really was a wild,
chaotic battle. The wild battle at the top of the altar was over the
third command seal in that passageway, while the wild battle in front
of the second abyss was over the Voidsea Jadeseal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only peaceful place
was at the outermost region, where the supreme Daolords were all
trying to calmly train in the [Daoheart] technique and thus couldn’t
be bothered to fight with each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This passageway
really is quite chaotic.” Ning stood at the intersection between
the two regions, keeping a watch on both sides. He couldn’t be
bothered to take part in the battle, as once he did everyone would be
wary of him. In fact, they might gang up on him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on. In the
blink of an eye, another year went by. The wild battle continued,
with two more supreme Daolords perishing. Both were fairly weak ones,
and both died by Daolord Dreamlore’s hands. His bloodblade was
simply too vicious and cruel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! A sonorous
explosion rang out as the 9000 barriers atop the altar simultaneously
shattered. Ninestone howled with rage as he charged towards Winesage.
Much like Tigrone, Ninestone possessed terrifying defensive
abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get it!”
Cloudwalker and Dawnstar simultaneously charged forwards as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Beat it.” Winesage
was doing the same.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha… brother
Winesage, you’ve already acquired the other two command talismans
in this passageway. You are being a bit too greedy, don’t you
think?” Palace Lord Dawnstar was the one to seize it, delighting
Cloudwalker, Ninestone, Snowjoy, and Shaka. The five of them were
part of the same time; they had agreed long ago to split the fruits
they acquired evenly!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” Winesage
frowned. He had been the first to arrived and had long ago mastered
the [Vitalis] art and acquired the first command talisman. He had
also been able to master the [Daoheart] technique with a single try,
as the tempering process the Dark Kingdom subjected its Daolords to
was utterly terrifying. Given that he was also a Heartforce
Cultivator who had been alive for an extremely long period of time,
his Dao-heart was indeed superior to Ning’s. This was why he had
been the one to acquire both of those talismans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the 9000
barriers were simply too difficult to deal with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dawnstar, Cloudwalker,
and Ninestone had quickly arrived at the altar as well. By then,
Winesage had already shattered the first 8000 barriers… but alas,
in the end it was Dawnstar who picked up the trophy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The eighth command
seal has already fallen into the hands of Palace Lord Dawnstar.”
The towering image of a white-robed man appeared above the chaotic
battlefield, staring down at the Daolords as his voice echoed
throughout the Crimsonwave Temple. “At present, only a single
command talisman remains unclaimed, the seventh talisman. Daolords,
this is the last one! If you miss it, you probably won’t have
another chance like this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning heard the
realmsoul’s voice, he hurriedly looked towards Ninedust’s
passageway. Right now, Ninedust, Daolord Tigrone, and a little-known
Daolord were simultaneously attacking the 9000 barriers together.
Ning truly hadn’t expected that Daolord Tigrone and that fairly
weak first-tier Daolord would both have such powerful Dao-hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These command talismans
mattered to Ning more than anything else right now. He had already
done everything he could for Ninedust. The rest would be up to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust…” Ning
watched anxiously. These fruits would be the basis for his
negotiations with the major powers. The more he could acquire, the
better.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thankfully, Winesage
and the others didn’t take part in the fight over the final command
talisman. In truth, there was no way for them to take part even if
they wished to. Every single Daolord could only choose a single
passageway, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In their eyes, the
Voidsea Jadeseal mattered the most!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Voidsea
Jadeseal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go for it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As if by silent
agreement, Winesage, Dawnstar, Cloudwalker, and Ninestone all hurried
onto the tri-colored chains and charged back to the flying stone
island in front the second abyss, taking part in the wild battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the five Voidsea
Jadeseals, one had been used up by Emperor Solesky, one had been used
up by the Radiant King, and one had been used up by Ninedust. Only
two remained untouched. One was in Winesage’s hands; everyone knew
that there was no way to take it from him. The last one was in
Daolord Feich’s hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go for it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more chaotic a
battle became, the more berserk the weaker Daolords grew. They knew
that their only chances would be during wild battles like this. As
supreme Daolords, they all had tough life-preserving abilities,
ensuring that if they acquired the seal they would stand a good
chance of keeping it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on and the
battle continued.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Feich was
indeed good at staying alive. He was aided by the fact that some of
the Daolords had long ago sworn oaths to join into true alliances
together and help each other resist their foes, no matter who won the
seal. Thus, even though another five supreme Daolords perished,
Daolord Feich remained alive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The altar within
Ninedust’s passageway. By now, a total of four supreme Daolords
were assaulting the 9000 barriers. Finally, with a loud explosion,
the barriers came crashing down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh. A flood of
water instantly swept towards the talisman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha!” Ninedust
roared with laughter, his voice echoing in the world around him.
“Darknorth, I have it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the distant Ning
saw this, he was so excited that his aura flared mightily, causing
energy waves to appear around him. He laughed loudly, “Haha, the
heavens have chosen to aid me! The heavens have chosen to aid me!”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_21___Harvesting_The_Frui"></A>
Chapter 21 - Harvesting The Fruit
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given Ji Ning’s
personality, he generally wouldn’t lose control of himself like
this. The fact that he did was a testament to how excited he was.
Ninedust had been competing against three other supreme Daolords;
there was a very high chance that he would fail. Of course Ning was
excited by his success!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was actually the
one to obtain it?” Daolord Tigrone was so angry he gnashed his
teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was just about to
stop him when he transformed into an endless wave.” Fiendqueen
Dustrain ground her teeth angrily as well. She had arrived at the
altar at just the nick of time, but she still hadn’t been able to
intervene.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. After acquiring
the talisman, the Ninedust Sectlord transformed into a vast wave that
surged out and reformed into human form atop the tri-colored chain.
He endured the pain as he quickly walked across the tri-colored
chains to the seven-colored chains where Ning was awaiting him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t let you
down, Darknorth. Haha! I, Ninedust, am quite capable,” Ninedust
said smugly. As he spoke, he handed the three command talismans he
had in his position over to Ning. “Here, take’m.” Ninedust was
in an excellent mood right now. He had owed Ning a huge favor when
the latter had let him take the Voidsea Jadeseal; given his arrogant
temperament, he really felt rather uncomfortable owing Ning so much.
Now that he was able to make some reparations, he immediately felt
much better.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you.” Ning
immediately accepted all three talismans without being shy. They
truly were quite important to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Rainbow light
appeared in the skies above them, condensing into the towering and
white-robed figure of Realmsoul Polo. The realmsoul stared down at
them and boomed, “Daolords, the Voidsea Jadeseals and the command
talismans needed for harvesting the fruit have all been taken. If you
wish to fight each other for them, feel free. Those who wish to
harvest the fruit can take the command talismans to the corresponding
Grovekeepers, who have already come. If you wish to leave, you can do
so upon exiting the Crimsonwave Temple. I’ve already set up a
spatial tunnel outside Crimsonwave Temple that lets you exit from the
Waveshift Realm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have to be
careful. Let’s go trade for the fruit right away,” Ning said
cautiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, let’s go.”
Ninedust nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s worry was that
everyone else would fight him over his command talismans, as he had a
total of six of them. However, his guess was wrong. Those weaker
supreme Daolords were not capable of tying him down; they simply
weren’t powerful enough to take things from him. As for the
stronger ones, all of them went to fight over the Voidsea Jadeseals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So even the final
command talisman has been taken? I need to speed this up.” Winesage
frowned. A large number of Daolords had gathered atop the stony
island before the second abyss, including the likes of Palace Lord
Dawnstar, Palace Lord Cloudwalker, Ninestone, Snowjoy, Shaka, King
Paleos, Daolord Skyshatter, Daolord Owlblack, Daolord Dreamlore, and
even the Radiant King, who had returned to try his luck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In short, a large group
of the most elite Daolords in the Endless Territories had arrived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winesage had been
shoved to the sidelines. He was so powerful that no one else wanted
to work with him, putting him in an awkward situation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the right
moment!” Winesage suddenly produced an extremely ordinary-looking
dart that was roughly half the size of his palm. The dart didn’t
seem unusual in any way; in fact, none of the battling Daolords
sensed anything amiss at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dart suddenly shot
out, bringing with it a terrifying aura of power that caused all of
the many battling supreme Daolords to feel their hearts tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dodge!” The
subconscious terror they felt caused all of them to know that
something bad was happening. By now, all of them saw the object which
had inspired terror in them… that streak of dazzlingly fast light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as the dart had
shot out, Winesage had shot out as well behind it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!” Daolord
Feich’s face turned ashen as he stared at the terrifying dart fly
towards him. He almost instantly produced a round, glowing mirror in
his hands. Crack! The surface of the mirror shattered, causing a much
larger mirror to appear right in front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since he had
acquired the Voidsea Jadeseal, he had been hunted by others. Although
the Radiant King and the other Daolords in his group had all sworn
lifeblood oaths to defend each other regardless of who acquired the
seal, there was a limit to how hard they had to fight. As a result,
Daolord Feich had encountered quite a few dangerous situations. This
was his very last life-saving treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! The streak of
light shot into the mirror. The mirror instantly cracked and then
completely shattered into tiny pieces. The streak of light continued
to shoot forwards, stabbing straight into Daolord Feich’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Daolord Feich’s
immediately transformed into a mass of gray mist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahhhhhhh! W-what the
hell is this?!” An agonized scream rang out from the gray mist,
followed by the mist reforming into a corpse. Daolord Feich’s
corpse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winesage had been
flying directly behind that streak of light. As soon as Daolord
Feich’s corpse appeared, Winesage waved his hand and immediately
collected it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. You should
feel proud to have died to my ‘cycleseed dart’.” Winesage
hadn’t really been willing to use this treasure, as it was the most
powerful killer weapon he had at his disposal. Even people as
powerful as the eight lords of the Sacred Cities would probably be
heavily wounded if struck! After he acquired the Universe treasure in
the Terror Starsea, the Universe treasure had guided him to another
ancient battle-site of the Dawn War, where he had acquired two mighty
relics. The ‘cycleseed dart’ was one of the two, and it was an
extremely venomous and insidious treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Feich hadn’t
been strong enough, and so he had almost instantly died once hit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For the sake of the
Voidsea Jadeseal, everything is worth it.” Winesage only felt a
sense of jubilation. He had been alive for far too long, over a
hundred thousand chaos cycles. He had braved many dangers over these
years for the sake of his Daomerge! Now that the Voidsea Jadeseals
had appeared, he would be willing to pay any price to acquire them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With the help of two
Voidsea Jadeseals, my chances at succeeding with the Daomerge shall
be greatly improved.” Winesage turned to sweep his gaze across the
many Daolords. All of them, including Dawnstar, the Radiant King,
Dreamlore, and Paleos were all staring at him nervously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That treasure he had
displayed was far too terrifying! Although Daolord Feich only had an
imperfect ‘invulnerable form’ which had merely been on par with
that of Timedream, one must remember that Ning had spent an
inordinate amount of time before he had killed Timedream! Just now,
however, Daolord Feich had been slain in an instant. How could
everyone not feel stunned?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s impressive
that he had even a single treasure like that. I refuse to believe
Winesage has another one,” the Radiant King sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And we’re much
stronger than Feich.” Daolord Owlblack’s eyes glowed with savage
light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I would’ve knocked
that streak of light aside with just a single strike.” Daolord
Dreamlore’s eyes gleamed with madness as well. “Winesage has TWO
of the Voidsea Jadeseals, and he hasn’t had the chance to use any
of them. Both of them are still on him. Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the Daolords moved
at the same time. They didn’t care about Ji Ning at all right now.
Six command talismans? Even if Ning had all nine, they would still
view a single Voidsea Jadeseal as being far more valuable… and
Winesage had two of them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They actually are
attacking?” As soon as the Daolords began to attack, Winesage
gritted his teeth and began to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black earth golem was
chatting with Ning and Ninedust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, here is the
ninth command talisman.” Ning produced the relevant talisman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The
Grovekeeper lowered his head to look at it, then reached out to
accept it. Instantly, one arm after another began to emerge from the
vast black earth back in the first world and started to harvest the
fruits from the many large, semi-translucent trees nearby. The black
arms pulled the fruit into the earth, then caused them to reappear
next to the Grovekeeper. Every single tree only had a single fruit.
The fruit was semi-translucent as well, with a faint reddish tinge to
them. When Ning and Ninedust looked at the red glow, they felt their
hearts grow peaceful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A total of three
hundred fruits.” The Grovekeeper looked at Ning. “These are known
as the coldflame cauldron fruits, and they are priceless beyond
compare. Even in unique places like Crimsonwave Palace, they take
100,000 chaos cycles to ripen.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
stared at the three hundred fruits flying towards him, then waved his
hand and collected all of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, let’s go
over there.” Ning led Ninedust towards yet another one of the
Grovekeepers who had appeared in the third world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">‘Darknorth, look over
there!” Ninedust hurriedly pointed off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wow.” Ning was
surprised. “What’s going on with Winesage? How’d he piss off
all the Daolords and get them to attack him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single Daolord
was pursuing and attacking Winesage! This was primarily because
Winesage had never chosen to ally with any of the other Daolords.
Ning had once invited Winesage to join forces with him, but Winesage
had been too proud to do so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Poor Winesage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forget him. Let’s
go harvest that fruit,” Ning said. As he spoke, he and Ninedust
flew towards the seventh Grovekeeper and asked him to harvest the
fruit from the seventh command talisman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Winesage was
incredibly strong, and his Universe treasure gave him the strength he
needed to endure. With each clash, four or five supreme Daolords were
sent flying. However, the other supreme Daolords continued their
pursuit, even tossing out Dao-seals and other treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to stand
within this diagram for ten seconds before I’ll be sent back to the
second world?” Winesage ground his teeth. “Why do I have to wait
this long?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Winesage, there’s
no chance you’ll be able to stand there for ten seconds.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You won’t be able
to escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many supreme
Daolords were all working together to assault Winesage, giving him no
chance to defeat them individually at all. Given how many people were
assaulting him, it was simply impossible for Winesage to stand there
without moving for ten seconds. How was he supposed to escape? If
this continued, he’d eventually be defeated. But was he supposed to
actually hand over the Voidsea Jadeseal? He wasn’t willing to!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winesage suddenly saw
two figures off in the distance who were chatting with the
Grovekeeper in a leisurely fashion. It was Ning and Ninedust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, give me a
hand!” Winesage sent frantically.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 22 - Ji Ning’s Request
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here are five
hundred and sixty of the golden sandsifter fruit.” The Grovekeeper
delivered one gleaming golden fruit after another to Ji Ning, who
waved his hand and accepted them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, give me a
hand!” Winesage’s voice rang out within Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning frowned
as he turned to look at the furious battle raging off in the
distance. There were more than twenty Daolords encircling and
attacking Winesage, but Winesage was so incredibly strong that he was
able to ensure his enemies weren’t able truly work together
flawlessly. Each time, Winesage ‘only’ had to deal with ten of
them at most.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s wrong,
Darknorth?” Ninedust asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s Winesage. He
asked me for assistance.” Ning smiled. “He’s just barely
hanging on right now, but with so many Daolords attacking him he’s
unable to remain within the teleportation diagram for ten seconds.
There’s no way for him to leave the third world, much less
Crimsonwave Temple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust laughed. “It’s
his own fault for hogging two of the Voidsea Jadeseals, and not even
rushing off to use them! He was too self-confident.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Ning
nodded. In truth, using the seals in the Waveshift Realm was indeed a
bit wasteful. Daolords would generally make plentiful preparations
before using up the Voidsea Jadeseal, but for safety’s sake
Ninedust had used his up long ago. That way, he could ensure that he
wouldn’t be attacked by everyone else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, give me a
hand! Just tell me what you want!” Winesage sent frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why should I help
you?” Ning and Ninedust stood off in the distance, watching
relaxedly from afar. Ning sent back placidly, “You are being
assaulted by numerous Daolords, and you aren’t able to escape them.
You are locked into combat. Before you die, you’ll probably be able
to kill a few of them. I could simply go in then and mop up the
rest.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Before I die? I’m
not going to commit suicide for the sake of these seals,” Winesage
sent back. “If the situation truly turns dire, I’d rather offer
one of them up and ensure that I stay safe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then go ahead and
hand me one of the Voidsea Jadeseals, both of your command talismans,
and some of your other treasures. If you do, I’ll help out,” Ning
sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s a bit much,
isn’t it?” Winesage replied mentally, “All I need to do is hand
a Voidsea Jadeseal over to King Paleos! If I do that, King Paleos and
his group of eight Daolords will be willing to swear lifeblood oaths
not to attack me and even help me out! With the eight of them helping
me instead of attacking me, I’ll be able to escape with ease.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but nod when he heard this. Right. The attacking Daolords weren’t
all on the same page either; they were divided up into multiple
‘factions’. The Daolords under King Paleos constituted one
faction, the Radiant King led a second faction, Daolord Dreamlore’s
four-man team made up a third faction, while Palace Lord Dawnstar’s
five-man squad made up a fourth faction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Any of the four
factions could be bribed using a Voidsea Jadeseal! So long as one of
the four joined Winesage, Winesage would be able to break this
stalemate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems I won’t
have a shot at winning the Voidsea Jadeseal,” Ning mused to
himself. In truth, he didn’t even really want it that much; he had
intentionally started off with a very high ask. “Well, give me all
the treasures you own, aside from the Voidsea Jadeseals and your
weapons. Do that and I’ll help you,” Ning sent back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All my treasures?
Those two talismans are enough!” Winesage was growing rather angry.
“Darknorth, I’ve been alive for more than a hundred thousand
chaos cycles and have experienced countless dangers. Am I supposed to
just give you all of my treasures? Don’t you feel that you are
asking for a bit much?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not at all. Compared
to the Voidsea Jadeseals, those things are worthless.” Ning shook
his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two command
talismans. That’s it.” Winesage ground his teeth. “There’s no
way I’ll give you anything else! I need to at least be able to keep
myself safe. There’s no way I can just give you all of my
treasures. Those treasures are enough for me to bribe a few of those
Daolords into joining me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” A cold
light flashed through Ning’s eyes. “True, you need to stay alive.
Fine! I can agree to let you keep two life-preserving treasures.
Aside from those two treasures, the Voidsea Jadeseals, and your
weapons, everything else you own now belongs to me! If you agree,
I’ll immediately come over and help out. If you refuse… then I’m
going to join in and attack you as well!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…!”
Winesage’s face turned gray. Ning was going to attack as well? Ning
was a tremendous threat to him. When Ning had defeated the
black-armored general in the second world, Winesage had immediately
understood that Ning had grown much more powerful and was now close
to him in might! Once Ning intervened, the situation would
immediately turn even grimmer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can keep the
Voidsea Jadeseals, your weapons, and two life-preserving treasures.
I’ll wager that you only have a few valuable ones anyhow,” Ning
sent back. “Letting you choose and keep two of them isn’t a bad
offer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winesage ground his
teeth. What a nasty piece of work this Darknorth was, kicking him
when he was down! However… Winesage belonged to the Dark Kingdom,
while Darknorth belonged to the Dao Alliance and the Brightshore
Kingdom. They belonged to enemy organizations to begin with, and
Winesage had even attacked Ning previously! Everyone was doing this
for the sake of the treasures they wanted. Personal feelings had
nothing to do with it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Winesage
gritted his teeth and accepted Ning’s offer, but his heart was
bleeding.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was the number one
Daolord of the Endless Territories and had braved many dangerous
areas, earning even a Universe treasure for himself. He had naturally
accumulated an enormous number of treasures! Now, he had to hand
nearly ninety percent of them over to Ning… how could he NOT feel
heartache at the prospect?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still… his lifespan
was coming to an end. The Daomerge was what truly mattered!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Ning
revealed a smile. “Shall we swear a lifeblood oath?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course we have to
swear a lifeblood oath!” Winesage said frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew that
acquiring a Voidsea Jadeseal was rather unlikely. In truth, he was
different from the other Daolords; he never really wanted one of the
seals that much to begin with. He was perfectly happy earning two of
the command talismans. For him to earn the many other treasures which
Winesage had accumulated over the years made him even happier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust, I just
negotiated a little something with Winesage.” Ning quickly
explained what had happened to Ninedust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?!” Ninedust
revealed a delighted look. “Hah! Savage! Too bad, though, that you
weren’t able to get one of those Voidsea Jadeseals. Still, if he
was willing to part with one of them he wouldn’t hand over all
these other treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of us will
split those treasures once we get them,” Ning sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Split them?”
Ninedust was startled. “No way. No way! You go help him out. I
won’t be of much use.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Both of the command
talismans are mine, but we’ll split all the other treasures. I’ve
already taken the lion’s share,” Ning said with a calm smile.
Winesage certainly had many treasures, but all of them combined
probably weren’t worth as much as the fruits! Even Hegemons and the
Dao Alliance had gone crazy over those fruits! Winesage had ‘only’
been alive for a hundred thousand chaos cycles; compared to the
mighty Hegemons, that was nothing. The Hegemons certainly had far
more treasures by far! Thus, his treasures were probably worth just a
fraction of what the fruits were worth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust had already
given Ning three command talismans. How could Ning not give him some
treasure in compensation?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, it was
likely that they would acquire a number of life-preserving treasures
from Winesage. As good friends, splitting them was nothing. Even
Sectlord Timedream had given quite a few treasures to the Kingfreak!
In addition, at Ning’s level these treasures were generally of very
little use to him. What he needed was truly stunning treasures such
as the Crimsonwave Temple fruits, treasures which would drive even
Hegemons wild with lust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go. Follow
me.” Ning transformed into a streak of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to attack?”
Ninedust immediately grew excited. Thanks to his invulnerable
aquaform, he was even better at staying alive than Ning was. He
naturally felt eager to take part in this fight!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t think
that’ll even be necessary,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Ning transformed
into a streak of light that charged over from afar. His heartworld
projection came crashing down, as did his nine novessence arts. Ning
was like an enormous comet blazing through the skies towards the
battlefield, while the Ninedust Sectlord roared with laughter by his
side. “Daoloooooords! I’m coming for you all!” He transformed
into a vast wave of water that swept through the world like a tidal
wave towards the enemy Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that Darknorth?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s Daolord
Darknorth!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of the many
Daolords assaulting Winesage all tightened, with Dawnstar,
Cloudwalker, and Ninestone in particular frowning unhappily. These
three were of the Brightshore Kingdom and thus weren’t worried
about Ning attacking them, but they wouldn’t be able to attack Ning
either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth,
we didn’t go to cause you any trouble. Why are you getting
involved?!” King Paleos roared angrily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, we don’t
want your command talismans. Don’t interfere!” Daolord Dreamlore
snapped.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were
furious. Darknorth had already acquired quite a few command
talismans, attracting their envy. They all knew just how valuable
those things were! However, for the sake of the Voidsea Jadeseal,
they didn’t want to get into a lengthy altercation with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So what if I DO
interfere?” A thunderous voice rang out from the heavens as the
vast comet of heartforce and energy came crashing down into the
battlefield. The Yin-Yang Chaos Domain began to merge together with
Winesage’s secret arts as the two joined forces, striking out at
their foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Ning disappeared
into thin air. He had just used his Shadowless evasion art to move
within range of Winesage’s secret arts! Winesage and him were in
the same region now. Although Winesage knew that Ning had entered
that region, he didn’t force Ning to reveal himself; instead, he
aided Ning as best he could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He vanished.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth just
vanished. Be careful!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other Daolords all
had ugly looks on their faces.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 23 - Adventure’s End
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They would rather
surround and attack Winesage than have to deal with Darknorth.
Although Winesage was slightly stronger than Darknorth, he fought in
a direct and aboveboard manner. The Daolords all knew where he was,
at least! This made surrounding him and attacking him much easier. If
Winesage wanted to attack one of them, the others would see it coming
and be able to prepare for him accordingly. Daolord Darknorth,
however, was another story.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had assassination
arts that allowed him to vanish without a trace, keeping all of the
Daolords on their toes. This sort of feeling was quite uncomfortable!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning appeared
out of nowhere close to two of the Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s over there!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Retreat, quick!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t take him
head-on!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two Daolords were
so terrified that they turned pale. By now, everyone knew that
Winesage and Darknorth stood at the very apex of power amongst the
supreme Daolords. Even the third-ranked Daolord Dreamlore had been
blasted back by a single strike from Darknorth! The difference in
power was quite apparent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Ning charged
straight forwards, easily deflecting the secret arts and treasures
that were assaulting him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Two
streaks of mist-formed sword energy tore through the air. Although
those two supreme Daolords strove to defend, they were still both
knocked flying back from this single clash. One had been struck on
the body while the other had been able to block with a shield-type
treasure, but even then he was sent flying from the tremendous power
of Ning’s sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, let’s
pause for a moment.” Ning’s voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twenty-plus
attacking Daolords all had ugly looks on their faces, but they did
indeed pause as they all stared at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Only now did
the vast waveformed Ninedust reach Ning’s side, where he quickly
returned to his human shape once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winesage, Ning, and
Ninedust stood shoulder-to-shoulder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled as he
looked at the Daolords before him. “Daolords, you should know quite
well that with Winesage, myself, and Ninedust working together, we
would be able to defeat even ten supreme Daolords… and given my
assassination arts, I imagine that it wouldn’t be too hard to
actually kill a few of you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” These
supreme Daolords were extremely unhappy to hear this, but they all
knew that Ning was telling the truth. Just now, he had merely struck
out with two swords against those two supreme Daolords. If he had
focused all six swords on one of them, he probably would’ve been
able to smash that supreme Daolord to death! By himself, he might not
be that grave a danger, but with Winesage and Ninedust assisting him,
Ning would be an utter terror to deal with. This was only worsened by
the fact that Dawnstar, Ninestone, and Cloudwalker couldn’t even
attack Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth,” Palace
Lord Dawnstar called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Dawnstar,
treasures go to the strong and the deserving,” Ning said. “All of
us have come here to compete over the treasures, and we do that based
on how strong we are as well as how lucky we are. Winesage has
promised me enough treasures to agree to help him out. If this battle
continues… you won’t be able to harm us, but some of you will
probably die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Daolord
Dreamlore and the others all had ugly looks on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth ended up
taking advantage of the situation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Winesage won two of
the Voidsea Jadeseals, while Darknorth acquired almost all of the
command talismans. These two bastards.” The supreme Daolords felt
rather resentful at this outcome.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What, do you really
want to keep fighting instead of bringing this to a close?” Ning
said calmly, “I really don’t care one way or the other.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gentlemen, shall we
keep fighting?” Winesaid said coldly
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Daolords
were prepared to act without remorse for the sake of these treasures…
but alas, they had encountered the even more remorseless Ji Ning and
Winesage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The supreme Daolords
exchanged glances. Although they didn’t want to accept this, they
could read the writing on the wall. Winesage himself was far stronger
than all other Daolords. As for Darknorth, he had already been strong
prior to entering Crimsonwave Temple, and he had now grown to become
even more terrifying. Once these two terrifying Daolords joined
together, they truly would be a deadly force to reckon with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You two really are
nasty pieces of work.” Daolord Dreamlore turned and started to walk
away. “Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s leave.”
One supreme Daolord after another began to step into the
teleportation diagram.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninestone looked at
Ning. “Darknorth, I imagine you ended up making a killing off of
Winesage. Impressive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“King Nine.” Ning
nodded. “It was all luck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to have your
luck,” Palace Lord Dawnstar muttered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go. We have
some fruit to harvest as well,” Palace Lord Cloudwalker said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were a total of
nine command talismans. Ning had eight of them, while Dawnstar’s
group had acquired one as well… the eighth command talisman!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daolords were all
quite intelligent. They’d only fight if they felt that had a chance
at victory. If their chances were nil, who would be so foolish as to
get into a fight and possibly die? Thus, once Ning and Ninedust
showed themselves, Ning only had to display a bit of his power in
order to let them know that it was time to leave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You utter savage.”
Winesage turned to look at Ning, a mixed look on his face. “You
didn’t have to do a damn thing, but now I have to give you all my
treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cut the crap. Hurry
up and hand’m over,” Ning said with a grin on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was nothing
Winesage could do. Still, although he looked quite helpless and
unhappy, he was actually in an excellent mood. His lifespan was
coming to its end, after all! If he failed his Daomerge, what would
be the point of keeping all those treasures? If he succeeded, he
would become a Hegemon, making the treasures of even less use to him!
This was why the Voidsea Jadeseal and the Universe weapon truly were
the only things that really mattered to him right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take it. I’ve
killed quite a few supreme Daolords and collected all of their
treasures. Now, all of it will belong to you.” Winesage handed over
a round disc.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning accepted the disc.
Once he scanned it, he immediately revealed a look of delight. Due to
the lifeblood oath binding them, Ning didn’t worry about Winesage
holding anything back at all; if Winesage had, he would’ve already
seen his truesoul shattered by the lifeblood oath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, come, come!
Ninedust, this portion is yours.” Ning swept through the disc with
his godsense, then quickly split the treasure up into two portions.
One portion, Ning put into a storage gourd which he then handed to
Ninedust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Ninedust
didn’t decline, electing to accept the gourd. Once he scanned it:
“My goodness, that’s a lot of treasure! That’s far more than I
had originally.” Ninedust was delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is Winesage
we’re talking about! How could you and I compare to him when it
comes to wealth?” Ning smirked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Winesage
couldn’t help but let out a cold snort when he heard this. Still,
he chose to stay next to Ning and Ninedust. Only by travelling
alongside them would his safety be guaranteed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Ninedust, and
Winesage travelled together to each of the Grovekeepers, using up the
various command talismans to acquire the fruit they needed.
Crimsonwave Temple had a total of nine types of fruit, and Ning
managed to acquire eight of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, this was
primarily because he had chosen from the beginning to give up on the
Voidsea Jadeseals and instead focus his time and attention on the
third world. That was why he had acquired so many command talismans…
especially seeing as how it was his decision to let Ninedust take a
jade seal that resulted in Ninedust giving him all three command
talismans! But of course, the other reason was that Ning was indeed
strong enough. He and Winesage completely eclipsed all other Daolords
in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Three streaks of light flew out of Crimsonwave Temple. They included
a white-robed youth with a golden scabbard on his back, a black-robed
man, and a silver-robed man bearing a staff.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We finally made it
out.” Winesage smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go. Let’s
leave this place.” Ning stared forwards towards the giant spatial
tunnel in front of them that traversed the skies. Clearly, the
realmsoul had established this tunnel as a way out of the Waveshift
Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to leave.”
Ninedust revealed a delighted look as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All three of them had
won many things here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winesage had acquired
two of the Voidsea Jadeseals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust had won a
Voidsea Jadeseal and had also acquired many treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning hadn’t
acquired any of the seals, but he had harvested the priceless fruits
of eight command talismans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go.” The
three transformed into streaks of light that soared into the skies,
quickly departing from the Waveshift Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A large host of figures
were waiting outside the spatial tunnel that exited the Waveshift
Realm. These were all ancient Eternal Emperors. They normally were
secluded in different parts of the Endless Territories, but they had
all gathered here today.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the very front of
the vast host, there were six groups of tremendous power. These were
the leaders of the Dao Alliance, the Brightshore Kingdom, the
Aeonians, the Aberrant special lifeforms, and the Ancient
cultivators. All of them stared towards the tunnel with anticipation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.
One Daolord after another flew out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They’re coming
out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here they come.”
Quite a few of the ancient Emperors had been waiting anxiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Owlblack,” a
white-ahired elder called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah? Patriarch!”
Daolord Owlblack immediately called out respectfully upon seeing this
man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you know who
ended up with the coldflame cauldron fruits?” the white-haired
elder immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The coldflame
cauldron fruits. Who took them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where are they?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who acquired the
coldflame cauldron fruits?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quite a few ancient
Eternal Emperors echoed this question. However, the truly high-status
figures like the Hegemons were quite calm, because they had received
word long ago that Ning was the one to acquire the ninth command
talisman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.
More Daolords continued to arrive. Finally, three more streaks of
light flew out. They were Winesage, Ninedust, and Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This entire time, the
three awesome Hegemons known as Netherlily, Windrain, and Brightshore
had been quite calm and quiet, as had the leaders of the other three
major powers. Upon seeing the white-robed youth who had a golden
scabbard on his back appear, they immediately flew in unison towards
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, my young
friend.” One call after another rang out. The most supreme Emperors
of the Endless Territories were all staring at Ning, smiles on their
faces and looks of incomparable friendliness in their eyes. Even the
leaders of the Dark Kingdom and the Aeonians were beaming towards
him.
