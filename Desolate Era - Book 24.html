Chapter 1 - Leaving the Three Realms
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An Immortal estate
located within the primordial chaos. This estate was a few kilometers
in size, and it was filled with creeks, small streams, flowers, and
grass.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, will you
live here permanently in the future? Won’t you return to the Three
Realms?” Brightmoon held onto Ji Ning’s arm as she looked
curiously at the area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. I plan to enter
secluded meditation.” Ning nodded and smiled. “It will be a long
time before I return to the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lifeblood oath he
had sworn was that he would leave the Three Realms within a thousand
years of becoming an Elder God. Once this part of the oath became
active, his soul would instantly become bound by its power. Even his
Primaltwin would be affected. This was why, even though Ning intended
to have his Primaltwin stand guard over the Three Realms, it couldn’t
actually live within it. It had to reside in a part of the primordial
chaos that was right next to the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only when he finished
his lifeblood oath and actually carried Northrest’s final message
to Vastheaven Palace would he be released from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh. That works as
well, I guess. I’ll just spend a lot of time here in the future.
This is actually my first time journeying into the primordial chaos.”
Brightmoon was rather excited. “Father, I’m going to go take a
look at some other places.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go ahead.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
Autumn Leaf and Uncle White had accompanied Brightmoon here. They
knew Ning very well…and they knew it made no sense that he had to
remain within the primordial chaos while engaging in secluded
meditation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son, are you
keeping things from us?” Uncle White asked, and Autumn Leaf looked
towards Ning as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A few things.”
Ning nodded. “There are some things I have to do. During the past
period of time, I’ve been slowly working on rebuilding my
Primaltwin. Now that its been restored and now that everything has
been settled, I have to go take care of things. Don’t worry. My
Primaltwin will remain here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His true body would
keep a spare clone behind as well, safely ensconced within the
prisonworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for his Primaltwin’s
spare clone, it would be kept safe within the Crescent major world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the Endwar, his
Primaltwin had self-detonated. It was at the Ancestral Immortal
level, and thus an absolutely inconceivable amount of chaos nectar
would be needed if he wanted to immediately revive it. His only
choice was to slowly rebuild it naturally. Ning had already mastered
the Heavenly Dao of Water and had thus gained a certain degree of
insight into the Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos. He was now capable
of absorbing chaos energy and was thus able to constantly absorb a
large amount of it, making the rebuilding process fairly quick.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His true body was a
dual refiner and would need ten thousand years to rebuild. His
Primaltwin was merely a Ki Refiner; only three thousand years was
necessary. Thanks to the Heavengazer Tower, Ning was able to easily
maintain a rate of time that was twenty times faster than normal.
Thus, his Primaltwin had been rebuilt long ago. The only reason he
had taken so long was because he had needed to spend a bit more time
settling his affairs in the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master…”
Autumn Leaf said worriedly, “Let me go with you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need.” Ning
shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was no joking
matter. Even the mere process of leaving the Three Realms via that
spatial vortex would be incredibly dangerous. No one could say what
would happen on such a journey. To have Autumn Leaf accompany him
into such great danger would be completely pointless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His Immortal estate in
the primordial chaos had already been set up. Ning had invited some
friends and family over to tour through it, with the guest list
including the likes of his junior apprentice-brother Mu Northson, his
own apprentice Bluecliff Xiaoyu, his senior apprentice-brothers Sun
Wukong and Crazi Ji, as well as many other figures. He even invited
Lu Dongbin, Kuafu, and other major powers to visit this new home of
his as well. Everyone knew that if they wished to meet with Ning in
the future, they would have to enter the primordial chaos and visit
this Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciple, the
primordial chaos is a place where experts are as common as the
clouds. Our Three Realms is just a tiny little corner of it. You have
to be careful.” Subhuti looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
master.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Today was the day for
Ning to set off on his journey. He hadn’t informed anyone of his
departure save his master Subhuti.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When Mother Nuwa
left, she never returned. We haven’t heard any word of her at all.”
Subhuti said softly, “You have to be careful, careful, careful. If
you ever encounter Mother Nuwa, notify me right away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will.” Ning
nodded. His Primaltwin would remain close to the Three Realms within
the Immortal estate, and it shared memories with his true body.
Whatever his true body experienced, his Primaltwin would also share
in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go then.” Subhuti
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A deep azure flying
boat suddenly appeared in midair. Ning boarded the flying boat. A
series of spatial ripples spread out around it, and a few moments
later the flying boat teleported away through the Void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful.”
Subhuti watched silently and hopefully as Ning left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Long, long ago, Mother
Nuwa had left the Three Realms. Now, Ji Ning had left the Three
Realms as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of them were the
most supreme figures of their times in the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure boat
continued to blink through the Void, advancing continuously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The insides of the
flying boat weren’t that large. Ning sat in the lotus position, his
gaze passing through the walls of the boat and focusing on the
primordial chaos outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going to leave
the Three Realms and wander through the primordial chaos, all by
myself…” Ning shook his head. “A pity that to this very day, I
still don’t have the power I need to break the chains of the
prisonworld.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The prisonworld
contained a large number of prisoners within it, including even Elder
God and Ancestral Immortal prisoners.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The manacles that held
them could only be broken by those who were at the World God or Chaos
Immortal level of power. In fact, someone at that level of power
could shatter the prisonworld itself. Ji Ning was now extremely
powerful, but even when he struck at the manacles with full force
using Violetjewel, he was still only able to leave behind a few
scratches behind, with the scratches quickly being automatically
repaired. Clearly, he was still quite a ways off from being able to
sever the manacles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, if one
thought about it in detail, it made sense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why did the King of
Pangaea arrange for Overseers to watch over the prisonworlds? It was
precisely to oversee them and ensure that they would be able to make
a report if any World Gods appeared. This meant that even prisoners
who ascended to become World Gods would need a fairly long period of
time in order to break apart those manacles and the prisonworld. The
King of Pangaea would have more than enough time to hasten to the
prisonworld! This was the entire point of having an Overseer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had just barely
reached the World God threshold of power. He was able to just barely
cause a bit of damage to those manacles now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still…those Elder
Gods and Ancestral Immortals were quite wealthy.” Ning nodded
secretly to himself. This flying boat he was on, for example, was a
top-grade Chaos treasure that was knowing as the Godwood Moatship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The prisoners of the
prisonworld, including the wild dog Elder God, had all been beaten
and plundered by Ning. Even the incredibly savage wild dog Elder God
could just barely be considered a supreme Elder God. Ning didn’t
even need to use Violetjewel; the ‘Heartsword stance’ alone was
enough to easily defeat all of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I was able to
break apart those manacles, I would gain quite a few retainers.”
Ning shook his head, casting those thoughts aside. With another
thought, he caused the 3600 Goldstar Beads of the Heavens to appear
around him, swirling around him like countless glittering stars.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since he had
mastered the Heartsword stance three hundred years ago during the
Endwar, he had spent a good deal of his time quietly training and
meditating upon it. As a result, Ning had made continuous
improvements into his insights regarding the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had insights into
primordial chaos…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had insights into
space…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had insights into
water and lightning…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had insights into
the sword…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, Ning had even
mastered eight of the Nine Chaos Seals. He was at the same level of
mastery as Mother Nuwa had been, prior to her becoming a World God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ninth Chaos
Seal…I have the feeling that if I am able to master it, something
special will happen.” Ning could sense that the various insights he
had gained were building atop each other in a cumulative fashion.
Once he fully mastered the ninth chaos seal, all nine of the chaos
seals would merge together into a whole, then completely transform.
Ning was quite eager to see this happen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He spent more than half
a month flying through the primordial chaos aboard the Godwood
Moatship. Finally, he reached the area which the star map marked as
containing the spatial vortex.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this is the
spatial tunnel?” Ning sat aboard his Moatship, staring in front of
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An utterly enormous
spatial wormhole lay in front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gigantic vortex
tore at the surrounding primordial chaos, causing it to swirl around
it in multiple rings. Even Ning felt a sense of pressure and dread.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The most dangerous
vortex of them all.” The alien Outsiders who had been lucky enough
to survive passage to the Three Realms had written down extremely
detailed records regarding this dangerous vortex.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It doesn’t matter.
I have nowhere else I can go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In we go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s divine power
completely filled the Godwood Moatship. In this moment, the Moatship
seemed to have transformed into a sword, and Ning commanded it fly in
as though he was flying atop a giant sword. Swoosh! After having
hesitated briefly before the spatial vortex, the Moatship finally
plunged deep inside of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vortex was filled
with an incomparably powerful tearing force that was instantly
applied towards the Moatship, dragging it deeper inside. Ning
commanded the Moatship to follow that dragging power inside while
doing his best to keep stable and ablate its power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a truly supreme
Sword Immortal, Ning had reached a truly inconceivable level of
finesse when it came to controlling and ablating power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the ripping
power of the spatial vortex was quite terrifying, the Moatship was
able to quite easily and safely make its way deeper inside of it. No
problems were caused for Ning at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope I can safely
pass through this spatial vortex and reach the Badlands Territory,”
Ning murmured to himself softly. “Given my abilities with the
sword, I should be able to stay alive. But if I get lost…all bets
are off.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In front of Ning was an
absolutely enormous spatial tunnel that was filled with countless
spatial tears, some pitch-black and some ashen-white.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Moatship flew
forward, making its way through that enormous spatial wormhole.
</P>

Chapter 2 - Spacetime Transfer Array
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were three
possible outcomes when one flew through this spatial vortex.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first was that one
would be able to safely reach the other side and enter the Badlands
Territory. This was the ideal outcome.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second was that a
spatial rift would suddenly appear in front of you and suck you
inside, resulting in you being teleported into an unknown territory
of the primordial chaos. Ji Ning knew at least a few things about the
Badlands Territory, thanks to the detailed star maps which the Three
Realms had acquired long ago. The Mindlord which Ning intended to
slay also resided in the Badlands Territory. If he ended up in a
completely foreign part of the primordial chaos, he would have to
slowly figure everything out from scratch. Still, this wasn’t the
worst case scenario; he’d still be alive, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third possible
outcome was that the spatial rift would teleport him straight into a
death trap of some sort.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really need to
stay away from those spatial rifts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Moatship flew
forward at high speed like a sword, agilely dodging and avoiding the
suddenly appearing rifts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous,
savage-looking rift of violet light suddenly appeared in front of
Ning, instantly covering a very large region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Backwards.” The
Moatship quickly reversed and flew backwards, then curved around the
rift and flew away from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had to be able to
make up to a thousand corrections every moment. This was an even
deadlier process than actually fighting with the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s complete
attention was focused on controlling his ship, but he was also able
to maintain total control over an area of ten thousand kilometers
around himself. This was the ‘Heartsword Realm’ which Ning had
developed some time ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six days later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A flying boat suddenly
flew out from the mouth of an enormous spatial vortex.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I made it.” Ning’s
face was rather pale with exhaustion, but he now revealed a look of
delight. “I finally made it through safely!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These six days had been
an absolute nightmare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those spatial rifts had
appeared and disappeared with incredible speed, and some of them were
simply enormous. If Ning was just a bit unlucky, it was entirely
possible that rifts would simultaneously appear in every direction
around him, making it impossible for him to dodge them. When that
happened, the only choice would be to take a chance and choose a rift
at random.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the past six
days, there was one time when Ning had actually been drawn into a
spatial rift. Thankfully, it had quickly dispersed, allowing Ning to
just barely escape from it and return to the spatial wormhole. If he
hadn’t been able to do so…not even Ning himself knew what area he
would’ve been sent to.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, the more
powerful a person was, the better his chances would be of
successfully passing through the vortex.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been lucky in
that he had only been sucked into a spatial rift once. This naturally
meant that it had been fairly easy for him to survive passage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godfiend Witherspike,
by contrast, had been drawn into rifts on nine different occasions.
However, he had been fairly lucky; all nine times, he had been able
to fight his way back out of the rifts before being drawn into the
other side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Badlands
Territory.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seated within his
Moatship, Ning stared at the vast primordial chaos around him. “Here
I am.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thanks to his star
maps, Ning knew exactly where this end of the spatial wormhole lay.
Thus, without hesitating at all, Ning immediately began to move
towards the spacetime transfer array which was closest to him. The
primordial chaos was simply too vast; if he was to slowly fly through
it while relying on his own power, even a trillion years wouldn’t
be enough to finish travelling through every part of the Badlands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five months after Ning
reached the Badlands Territory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There we are.” His
Moatship flew out from the Void towards an enormous ellipsoid world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
massive ellipsoid world, then let out a sigh. “This is the ninth
chaosworld I’ve seen thus far. According to my star maps, I’ll
need to travel past another twenty-six chaosworlds before I’ll
reach Earthdrake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The spacetime transfer
array which was closest to Ning was centered around the Earthdrake
planet. There were so many celestial bodies in the primordial chaos
that the vast majority were nameless. Only stars and planets with
certain special qualities about them would be given names.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had travelled past
one chaosworld after another. Every so often, Ning would sense others
scanning him with coresense. Each time, he would send his own
dominatingly powerful coresense right back at them. When their
coresenses ‘collided’, the other side would be so terrified that
they would immediately stop their scrying attempts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thanks to his half-step
World God body, Ning’s coresense was extraordinarily powerful!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After entering the
Badlands Territory, there had been one occasion where Ning had
encountered an incredibly powerful soul-sweep conducted by a World
God. Ning had been so terrified that he had immediately Void-blinked
far away, fleeing without a second thought. Although World Gods
generally wouldn’t act against Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals
without a good reason, Ning still felt that it would be better to
stay a safe distance away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One year and nine
months after entering the Badlands Territory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On this day, Ning
finally reached the spacetime transfer array located closest to the
Three Realms. For him to be able to reach an array after less than
two years was actually quite fast; this would be considered an
extremely close array.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The primordial chaos
was so vast that even in an area like the Badlands Territory, it was
common for individuals from backwater chaosworlds to spend up to ten
years in order to reach a spacetime transfer array.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Earthdrake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Moatship hung there
in empty space. Ning stayed inside of it, staring at the utterly
stunning sight before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The primordial chaos in
front of him had long ago been torn asunder, revealing eight utterly
dazzling stars that glowed with layers of light. These eight stars
all revolved around a final planet located in their center. These
eight stars were the ‘servants’, while this ninth planet was the
‘master’! These nine celestial bodies came together to form an
enormous ‘spacetime transfer array’, and their light was far more
dazzling than even the Solar Star of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of raw size?
The formation was probably comparable to the entire Three Realms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could a single
formation be so large?” Ning let out a sigh. “I really can’t
imagine how powerful the person who set up this formation was.”
According to his records, not even World Gods or Chaos Immortals were
even close to being powerful enough to construct spacetime transfer
arrays. These arrays had all been passed down from the most ancient
of days.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the question of
who built them? No one even asked any longer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go over there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. The Moatship
quickly flew towards the enormous spacetime transfer array.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The core star
surrounded by the eight other stars was the Earthdrake planet. Even
before landing on Earthdrake, Ning could sense the ripples of power
emanating from atop it. These were ripples that emanated from
powerful experts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come back.” Ning
put away his Moatship, then quickly descended upon the star.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Earthdrake was an
enormous planet that was comparable to the Solar Star or the Lunar
Star in size. However, the entire planet had been refined and
retrofitted, making it more like an utterly enormous magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many experts…”
As Ning sensed the powerful ripples emanating from the star, he
immediately transformed into a Ninehorn Lightning Serpent as he flew
towards the very center of Earthdrake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninehorn Lightning
Serpent was quite fast. While flying forward, Ning encountered quite
a few other cultivators. Some looked similar to humans, while some
looked extremely different. As they saw the Ninehorn Lightning
Serpent fly past them and sensed the undisguised aura of dominating
power radiating from Ji NIng, they all revealed looks of wariness on
their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning landed on
the ground, a miniature spacetime transfer array located directly in
front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although spacetime
transfer arrays were utterly enormous, their most important cores
were just a few hundred kilometers in size. These miniature spacetime
transfer arrays actually had buildings located in side of them. Elder
Gods and Ancestral Immortals were stationed in these buildings to
keep the array safe. There were also many True Gods and True
Immortals here, along with a vast number of Empyrean Gods and
Celestial Immortals. All of them were responsible for maintaining the
spacetime array and keeping it in good shape for any future uses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where are you
going?” An Elder God dressed in golden robes with a scaly reptilian
tail was seated in the lotus position in front of Ning. His body was
utterly massive, and he peered down as he looked at Ning. When he
sensed how powerful Ning’s aura was, his attitude improved slightly
and he even put a smile on his face. Earthdrake was primarily
populated by Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals. World Gods and Chaos
Immortal were incredibly exalted figures, after all; they generally
wouldn’t deign to handle such low-level matters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sevenwater Star,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sevenwater Star was
naturally a star that was located at the heart of a different
spacetime array.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually finding and
reaching Vastheaven Palace would be too hard. Ning’s first goal was
to deal with the Mindlord, who was one of the Nine Divine Generals of
God Emperor Blacklotus. The records the Three Realms had regarding
God Emperor Blacklotus stated that he was an incredibly powerful
World God who had five other World Gods serving him. Together, they
dominated a wide swathe of territory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The area around
Sevenwater Star was dominated by God Emperor Blacklotus, the Starlord
of Fogstone, Sovereign Eastvictor, and several other hegemons. God
Emperor Blacklotus was just one of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sevenwater Star?”
The Elder God nodded. “If you want to go right now, we can activate
the transfer array just for you, but that’ll cost you a total of
120 bottles of chaos nectar. If you are willing to wait…if you are
lucky, in around eight years or so there will be another group
activation of the array for transference to Sevenwater Star. Only a
single bottle will be required.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eight years?” Ning
nodded slowly. “Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This spacetime transfer
array was the size of the entire Three Realms. Activating it required
a significant cost, and a payment of 120 bottles of chaos nectar was
quite standard. However, Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals usually
wouldn’t be willing to act in such a wasteful, extravagant manner.
The total networth of most Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals
wouldn’t even necessarily be that much!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, eight years.”
The Elder God nodded. “There’s a stone stele over there with
detailed information regarding transfers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
walked over to the stone stele, giving it a glance. It was filled
with detailed information regarding how long one would have to wait
for transference to each other spacetime array.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I wanted to go to
the Badlands Everworld, I wouldn’t have to wait nearly so long.
That destination is a much more frequently visited place,” Ning
mused to himself. “Still, there’s nothing for it. I’m simply
too far away from Sevenwater Star; if I wanted to fly there by
myself, I wouldn’t be able to get there in a trillion years. I
might as well wait for eight.” Although Ning had acquired the
treasures of the Elder God and Ancestral Immortal prisoners of the
prisonworld as well as around 120 bottles of chaos nectar, Ning had
left a hundred of those bottles to the Three Realms. He had left them
behind for the sake of his daughter and Autumn Leaf.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for himself? He was
strong enough and capable enough to acquire more on his own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quickly flew away
from this place. He found and selected a beautiful, secluded mountain
peak within Earthdrake. He waved his hand, causing an Immortal estate
to descend upon the peak. Ning then entered the Immortal estate and
began to quietly wait.

Chapter 3 - Fogstone Planet
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heavengazer Tower
of the Heavens had been placed within the Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was seated
inside the tower in the lotus position, as still as a lifeless rock.
He had activated the ‘solitude’ technique of the [Solitary World
God] while using the [Nine Elements Annihilation] to work on the
[Starseizing Hand].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ‘solitude’
technique would allow a cultivator to reach an extremely calm state,
with the inner heart becoming far more sensitive and nimble. It was
meant to allow one to find the secrets of the body, but it also made
it easier for one to visualize and hypothesize certain techniques.
Buddha Jueming, who had already sacrificed himself, had perpetually
stayed in the ‘solitude’ state, which was why he had been able to
come up with a divine ability that was just as strong as Lord
Tathagata’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now…Ning was
researching and developing the Seventh Cycle of the [Starseizing
Hand]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first six cycles
all served as guides for this project. Previously, when he didn’t
have any golden starstone, he had actually used the [Nine Elements
Annihilation] to disassemble and overhaul the [Starseizing Hand],
allowing him to create a brand new Sixth Cycle. Now, he naturally
wished to come up with an even more profound Seventh Cycle!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A True God body can
train in the Sixth Cycle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I already have an
Elder God body. Logically speaking, I should be able to train in a
Seventh Cycle…but to develop it truly is difficult.” Ning
continually visualized and worked on this project but was only able
to make a tiny bit of progress.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To train in a Seventh
Cycle, one had to first come up with an even more profound way to
allow divine power to blast out. In addition, one also needed to come
up with a way to transform the palms and make them comparable to Dao
weapons. Only then would they be able to withstand the bursts of
divine power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of these
requirements would be extremely difficult to fulfill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daoist Threelives,
as a True God, was able to develop the Sixth Cycle. As an Elder God
who has the [Nine Elements Annihilation], I should be completely
capable of developing a Seventh Cycle.” Ning was completely
absorbed in his meditations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thump.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His soul trembled
slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The aura of life slowly
began to return to Ning’s unmoving, rock-like body. As his aura
began to strengthen, color began to return to his skin. Finally, his
eyes opened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“160 years passed in
the blink of an eye. It has been eight years in the outside world.”
Ning rose to his feet. “Time to head out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was time to journey
from Earthdrake to the distant Sevenwater Star.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They really know how
to make money. A single activation of the formation nets them a
hundred bottles of chaos nectar.” Ning shook his head as he walked
out of the spacetime transfer array and glanced at the cultivators
who were scattering in various directions. “Although each
activation of a spacetime transfer array does require a certain
amount of resources, they are making at least a 50% profit. They are
making money at an insane rate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Every single
cultivator has to pay a bottle of chaos nectar each time the array is
activated. No wonder only Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals take
part.” Ning couldn’t help but sigh to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Gods and True
Immortals simply couldn’t play around like this. The price was too
high. True Gods and True Immortals would generally just wander around
nearby chaosworlds or follow Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals and
servants.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Any World God or
Chaos Immortal would love the chance to take control over a spacetime
array like this. A pity that these are all controlled by the Badlands
Court.” Ning sighed. The greatest power in the vast Badlands
Territory was the Badlands Court. It was an organization that rivaled
Vastheaven Palace in power! In the Badlands Territory, the Badlands
Court held supreme, unchecked power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where should I go?”
Ning stood in the air above Sevenwater Star, staring into the endless
primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“God Emperor
Blacklotus established his Blacklotus chaos-kingdom and has five
World Gods supporting him. He controls a total of fifty-three
chaosworlds.” Ning pondered for a moment on some of the ancient
information which the Three Realms had collected in the past. “God
Emperor Blacklotus is a local hegemon. He has a few neighbors who he
is on poor terms, including the Starlord of Fogstone and Sovereign
Eastvictor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Starlord of
Fogstone has eight World-level experts serving him and commands
ninety-six chaosworlds.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sovereign Eastvictor
has six World-level experts serving him and commands sixty-one
chaosworlds.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Should I join the
Starlord of Fogstone? Or should I join Sovereign Eastvictor?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was pondering on
this question.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had never
entertained the foolish thought of going straight for the Mindlord
all by himself. He had to verify whether or not the Mindlord really
was Old Man Yuan! In addition, not even World Gods would rashly
charge into the headquarters of an enemy force. That was just
suicide.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Starlord of
Fogstone and Sovereign Eastvictor are on hostile terms with God
Emperor Blacklotus. If I join one of these two sides, I’ll seek out
an opportunity to kill the Mindlord when they engage in battle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll also be able
to rely on their power to strengthen myself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Vastheaven Palace was
too far away!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Northrest was
an extremely exalted figure, yet had hadn’t even heard of the
Badlands Territory. This meant that the distance between the
Vastheaven Territory and the Badlands Territory was so vast that
World Gods would almost never travel between these two locales. If
Ning remained a mere Elder God, he’d probably die while attempting
to find Vastheaven Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was best if he
became a World God first, then embarked on the journey.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had a full chaos
cycle. Just a tenth of a chaos cycle would be more than enough time
for him to grow strong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Starlord of
Fogstone and Sovereign Eastvictor…the intelligence I acquired about
them is all quite old. Perhaps there have been changes within their
respective organizations. Mm…Fogstone is closer by, I’ll go visit
it first. I’ll take a good look then make up my mind.” Ning
immediately commanded his Moatship to begin flying through space in
that direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six months later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Moatship had
arrived before a distant, beautiful planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s the planet
of Fogstone.” Ning stared at the beautiful planet. According to his
intelligence reports, a total of nine World-level experts resided on
this planet, along with thousands of Elder Gods and Ancestral
Immortals. From this planet, they ruled over and governed a total of
ninety-six chaosworlds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quickly flew
towards the planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than half of
Fogstone was perpetually covered with blurry shadows. Clearly, it was
protected by some sort of formation. The other half, however, was not
covered by any formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right there.” Ning
immediately saw a series of islands within the seas of Fogstone. He
immediately flew straight towards it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning drew closer to
those islands, a figure suddenly flew out from one of them. It was an
azure-armored man whose aura was that of a True God’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, senior.”
The azure-armored man said respectfully, “Senior, this should be
your first visit to Fogstone. Do you need me to guide you around?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very well.” Ning
nodded and smiled. “Are you in charge of welcoming Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals? Do many come to Fogstone?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fogstone rarely has
visits from unaffiliated Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals.” The
azure-armored man smiled. “This junior was ordered to guide the
path for any who do come. During the past thousand years, I’ve only
welcomed around a hundred.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was in keeping
with what Ning knew.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A core planet that was
responsible for governing a chaos-kingdom would generally have
certain areas that were meant for trade and business. Cultivators
needed to purchase treasures, divine abilities, spells, secret arts,
golems, and other things. Thus, there was always a need for trading
posts. Empyrean Gods, Celestial Immortals, True Gods, and True
Immortals rarely had good treasures. Thus, there generally wouldn’t
be any people responsible for receiving them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Elder Gods
and Ancestral Immortals who served Fogstone, there was no need to
guide them around either; they knew the place well enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only first-time
visitors like Ji Ning who were at least Elder Gods or Ancestral
Immortals would merit a guide! If a World God was to arrive, the
entire world of Fogstone would be put on high alert. Most likely, a
World God of Fogstone would be assigned to welcome and greet such a
visitor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them
descended upon a spacious cloud street.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This street was
completely formed from clouds. It led from the vast seas to the
various islands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you need any
servants, senior?” The azure-armored man pointed towards a distant,
enormous island. “That’s the slave island. Many slaves are
imprisoned there, ranging from Celestial Immortals and Empyrean Gods
to Ancestral Immortals and Elder Gods! So long as you are willing to
pay the price, you can purchase as many slaves as you wish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Imprisoned
Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals would often be sold off as slaves.
Generally speaking, they were enemies who had been captured during
conflicts against other organizations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t need any
for now,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two walked forward
through the cloud path. There were many other cultivators on this
path, but almost all of them were below the Elder God level of power.
This was why they all hurriedly parted before Ning when they saw him.
In this world, the difference in status between the strong and the
weak was very obvious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place
specializes in selling formations. Yes, that island over there! We
also have shops that specialize in selling Ki Refining techniques,
divine abilities, secret arts, sword-arts, lightning arts…” The
azure-armored man warmly pointed at one island after another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword-arts?”
Ning’s eyes lit up..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
azure-armored man said hurriedly, “That island is known as the
Sword Pavilion! The Sword Pavilion has many sword-arts within it, at
least ten thousand! Some are weak, some are strong. Even the [Skystar
Sword] which our Starlord of Fogstone made famous throughout the
Badlands Territory is available for sale, so long as you are willing
to pay the price.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Skystar
Sword]?” Ning was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is one of the
most awe-inspiringly famous sword-arts of the entire Badlands
Territory. Once you master it, you might even be able to become a
World God through the Dao of the Sword.” The azure-armored man let
out a sigh. “That really would be incredible.”
</P>

Chapter 4 - Joining Up
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ji Ning was
intrigued.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His own [Nameless]
sword-art was something which even World God Northrest of Vastheaven
Palace had been mesmerized by. Just by mastering three of its
stances, one could become a World God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This [Skystar Sword],
however, needed to be fully mastered in order for one to become a
World God. It seemed as though it was quite a bit inferior to the
[Nameless] sword-art. Still…Ning knew very well that since the
Starlord of Fogstone was willing to sell it, it probably wasn’t the
best technique he truly possessed. From what Ning had heard, the
Starlord of Fogstone was actually quite shockingly powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can I ask what the
price of purchase would be?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ten cubes of chaos
nectar,” the azure-armored man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ten cubes?” Ning
was speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A bottle of chaos
nectar contained ninety-nine drops.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A thousand bottles of
chaos nectar made up a cube! Ten cubes represented ten thousand
bottles!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There aren’t even
many World Gods who would be willing to pay such a price. Not just
anyone can learn a peerless sword-art that allows you to reach the
sixth stage of swordforce.” The azure-armored man smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When I first arrived
at Fogstone, my plan was to purchase a detailed star map of the
region around Sevenwater Star,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come this way,
please.” The azure-armored man knew that most newcomer Elder Gods
and Ancestral Immortals would first wish to get a better idea of the
situation in the area. They soon traversed another cloud street and
arrived at a quiet island that had a single pavilion atop it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were several
female Celestial Immortals located inside the pavilion, each of whom
was incomparably beautiful. There was also a truly ravishing female
True Immortal who headed straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Respectful greetings
to you, senior.” The female True Immortal smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bring me a star
map,” the azure-armored man instructed a female Celestial Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The female
Immortal immediately brought a furled scroll over, respectfully
handing it over to the azure-armored man, who then smiled and
respectfully handed it over to Ning. “Senior, this star map
contains a detailed breakdown of the various powers and regions
around Sevenwater Star. It only costs ten chaos jewels.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very well.” Ning
handed over ten chaos jewels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos gems and chaos
nectar were a form of common currency, with chaos nectar having more
marvelous properties but coming in smaller amounts. Chaos gems were
able to contain more energy within them, with the result being that
many powerful formations and golems made use of them as energy
sources. Generally speaking, a single chaos jewel was considered
equivalent to a drop of chaos nectar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning sent his
divine energy into the scroll. Instantly, a large amount of
information was transmitted to Ning, who memorized it all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So not much has
changed.” There were very few differences between this intelligence
report and the report which the Three Realms had acquired long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">God Emperor Blacklotus
had increased his territory and now commanded a total of sixty-one
chaosworlds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord of
Fogstone still commanded ninety-six chaosworlds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sovereign Eastvictory’s
territory had lessened and he now commanded just fifty-eight
chaosworlds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The information in this
star map regarding the Badlands Territory was a bit more detailed
than the information the Three Realms had, but it was still limited
to just this territory. There was no information regarding any other
territory, to say nothing of Vastheaven Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. Judging from
this, I should probably join the Starlord of Fogstone for now.”
Ning made up his mind. Still, he wasn’t in a rush. He first said to
the azure-armored man, “Come, lead me to see a few other places.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This way please,
senior.” The azure-armored man was quite friendly as he guided the
way forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After walking about for
a long period of time, the azure-armored man began to secretly
grumble to himself. “This senior’s been walking around forever,
but the only thing he purchased was a single map. This sucks. I ran
into a skinflint of an Elder God. I probably did all this work for
nothing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anyone who came all the
way here via a spacetime transfer array generally did so with a
specific purchase in mind, such as buying some of the unique products
that belonged to this planet. It cost a bottle of chaos nectar to use
the array, after all; anyone who was willing to pay that price to
come here would generally be willing to spend even more to buy the
desired items. But…this Elder God before him was clearly an
exception. All he had purchased was a star map, nothing else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And what’s this
island? It looks quite impressive.” Ning pointed to an enormous
island up ahead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That? That island is
our mustering grounds.” The azure-armored man was beginning to
become a bit casual in his speech. “The Fogstone Dominion commands
a total of ninety-six chaosworlds, which means we have many
cultivators, quite a few of whom wish to join the Fogstone Army.
Ordinary cultivators are naturally not permitted to go into the
interior regions of the planet of Fogstone; only this trading region
is open for all. Cultivators who wish to join our ranks have to first
go to the mustering grounds and be tested before being granted
entry.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But of course.”
The azure-armored man smiled at Ning. “If you wished to join the
army, it would be much simpler, senior. As an Elder God, there’s no
need for you to be tested.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He said these words
quite casually, but they were true. Elder Gods and Ancestral
Immortals could be considered powerful experts, and to raise a new
crop of them was very difficult. The Fogstone Dominion controlled
many chaosworlds and had many legacies and training techniques to
offer its geniuses, but it only had a few thousand Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals within its ranks, despite the passage of
countless years. All organizations, including ones that were even
more powerful than the Fogstone Dominion, were willing to recruit and
retain Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals. Frankly speaking, the
Fogstone Dominion wasn’t that powerful of an organization within
the Badlands Territory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the azure-armored
man was able to recruit an Elder God or Ancestral Immortal into their
ranks, his reward would be quite considerable!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning nodded.
“Let’s go take a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh, y-you can’t
just go randomly wandering around the mustering grounds. It is an
important place,” the azure-armored man said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Didn’t you say…I
would be able to join your army?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior…” The
azure-armored man stared. “Senior, are you saying you wish to join
the Fogstone Army?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“G-g-great!” The
azure-armored man was shocked and delighted. He immediately said,
“The Fogstone Army is very welcoming towards Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals who have journeyed and adventured through the
primordial chaos. Although you’ll be given certain restrictions,
since you are an Elder God the restrictions will be quite lax. The
only requirement will be for you to take part in critical battles,
while you’ll be given many benefits upon signing up. You’ll get
chaos nectar, treasures, and all sorts of other things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning followed the
azure-armored man forward. They passed through more cloud streets as
they moved towards the mustering grounds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Mu, this is
the mustering grounds.” A black-armored True God who was leaning
relaxedly against a boulder while drinking some wine gave Ning a
glance, then snapped at the azure-armored man, “You should lead
this senior away from here.” Although Ning was an Elder God, he was
still an outsider. The True God soldier really didn’t care about
him at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You imbecile, this
senior is planning to join our Fogstone Army!” The azure-armored
man hissed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s joining the
Fogstone Army?” The True God’s eyes bulged out and he hurriedly
jumped to his feet, his attitude markedly more respectful than
before. He had acted arrogantly because he was a member of the
Fogstone Army and really didn’t care about outsiders, but if this
Elder God was to truly join the Fogstone Army, he would clearly
become one of the core members of it. The Elder God would become one
of his superiors, at which point it would be very easy for this Elder
God to punish him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This way please,
senior.” The black-armored True God hurriedly spoke with respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, we’ll part
ways for now.” The azure-armored man smiled merrily. He was quite
pleased. Today, he had just earned a bundle for himself!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
immediately followed the black-armored True God forward. As he did,
he began to hear cries ringing out from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How much longer do
we have to wait? We have to go through nine rounds of testing, but
this is just the third round. This is so pointless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you aren’t even
patient enough to wait, what makes you think you are qualified to
join the Fogstone Army? My senior apprentice-brother told me that
last time, the nine elimination rounds took a total of a thousand
years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hey, what’s going
on over there?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why is that
white-robed youth being led into the restricted area?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were quite a few
True Gods and True Immortals waiting in the mustering grounds. They
had come from the ninety-six chaosworlds and were taking part in the
elimination trials. The nine rounds of eliminations would usually
take quite a long period of time, mainly because the Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals in charge of the trials were usually quite
relaxed and lazy about them. They might end up going into seclusion
for a hundred years between rounds, which was why the trials often
ended up taking forever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Island master.”
The black-robed True God immediately ran over to the side of a
gray-robed elder who was fishing in a relaxed manner. “This senior
wishes to join our Fogstone Army.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gray-robed elder
put down his fishing rod, rising to his feet as he looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at the
gray-robed elder as well. This elder had a closed vertical eye-slit
on his forehead; most likely, he was an Elder God as well. The Elder
God waved his hand, dismissing the black-armored True God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My name is Fushe,”
the gray-robed elder said. “The master of this island, the
mustering grounds.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth,
do you truly wish to join our Fogstone Army?” The gray-robed elder
asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I do.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gray-robed elder
smiled. “Elder Gods do not need to go through the elimination
process. They can directly join the Fogstone Army. However…even
Elder Gods have different statuses within the army. There’s a great
difference between an ordinary Elder God and a supreme Elder God,
after all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Elder God
soldiers of the Fogstone Army can be promoted based on their military
accomplishments; with enough military successes, they will be
promoted to very high levels. A second possibility is for them to be
promoted based solely on power. If you are strong enough, you can be
promoted to a high rank even if you haven’t fought in battle yet.”
The gray-robed elder looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Generally speaking,
you have to fight against and defeat certain golems in order to prove
your strength. We have three types of golem on this island; they
represent ordinary Elder Gods, elite Elder Gods, and supreme Elder
Gods. The golems aren’t that skillful, but beating the first golem
means you have the power of an ordinary Elder God. Beating the second
golem proves that you have the power of an elite Elder God. Beating
the third means that you have the power of a supreme Elder God.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is quite rare for
new entrants to the Fogstone Army to be able to defeat the third
golem. I’ve only encountered two during my tenure here as master of
the island,” the gray-robed elder said with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning asked, “Just
these three types?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you are strong
enough, there’s no need to even go through the golem testing. You
can ask a World-level expert to come here and attest to your power.”
The gray-robed figure continued, “However, there are very few
figures that have transcended even supreme Elder Gods in power.
Although the Fogstone Army does have a few such figures, they only
became that powerful after spending quite a bit of time improving
themselves after joining us. There have been none who have requested
a World-level expert come and testify to their power immediately
after they join our ranks.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had inherited the
legacy of World God Northrest and was quite familiar with some of the
unspoken rules of the primordial chaos. He truly did wish to
establish himself here on Fogstone and receive the resources he would
need in order to grow more powerful! In the future, he would go out
and battle on behalf of the Fogstone Army and find a chance to slay
the Mindlord. This was why Ning had decided long ago that he would
shock them all upon arriving, ensuring that the World Gods of
Fogstone all knew his name.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please invite a
World-level expert to come, then.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Invite a World…”
The gray-robed figure stuttered. “W-what did you just say?” His
mind went blank.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to bother
with the three golems,” Ning said. “I wish to invite a
World-level expert to come here and attest to my strength.”

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gray-robed elder
stared blankly at Ji Ning, as though he was staring at some bizarre
monstrosity. He then murmured in a low voice, “Brother Darknorth,
it’s not that I look down upon you, but I would still recommend
that you go fight the third golem. That’ll be enough! If you are
truly powerful, you’ll have chances to prove it once you enter the
army. But if you insist on asking a World-level expert to verify
it…you should know how high the standards of World-level experts
are. If you are over-confident in your powers, you can easily cause
the World-level expert to feel dissatisfied with you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand.”
Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was no joke. Ning
knew exactly how powerful he was. Even an ordinary Elder God who used
the ‘Heartsword stance’ would instantly become comparable to a
supreme Elder God! Ning, however, was a half-step World God. When he
used the ‘Heartsword stance’, he could dominate supreme Elder
Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he also used
Violetjewel…he would be at the World God threshold of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Or, as Godfiend
Witherspike had put it…Ning ranked amongst the top three Elder Gods
and Ancestral Immortals he had ever seen! Not one Elder God in ten
thousand would be a match for Ning. The Fogstone Army only had a few
thousand Elder Gods and Chaos Immortals. Although they were a fairly
elite force, Ning felt confident that he could probably dominate all
of them even without using Violetjewel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll ask you one
more time. Are you sure you wish to ask a World-level expert to come
and attest to your strength?” The gray-robed elder said solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The
gray-robed elder nodded as well. “Since you’ve made the request,
I’ll report it to my superiors! Still…as you can probably guess,
most World-level experts spend the majority of their time in
seclusion, while others will often go out adventuring. If a
World-level expert is available, he or she will come and test you
out. I can’t say exactly who it will be or when this will happen.
It’ll all be up to the World-level experts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “Of
course. Should I just wait here on the mustering grounds island?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need for that.”
The gray-robed elder shook his head. “The mustering ground is
really for True Gods and True Immortals. How about this? I’ll give
you a set of silverscale armor on loan. That’ll allow you to enter
the city alongside me. When the World-level expert comes and tests
you out, we’ll make a decision on what your actual military rank
will be.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was now dressed in
a set of silverscale armor, and he was flying through the air
alongside the gray-robed elder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The core of the army
generally consists of Elder Gods and first-tier Ancestral Immortals,”
the gray-robed elder said with a laugh. “There are essentially
three ranks; silverscale warriors, goldscale warriors, and generals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ordinary Elder Gods
and elite Elder Gods are generally silverscale warriors.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Supreme Elder Gods
are generally goldscale warriors.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for generals, all
of them have transcended supreme Elder Gods in power.” The
gray-robed elder continued, “Our Fogstone Army has a total of five
generals, and they are able to style and color their armors as they
see fit. Other soldiers have to wear the assigned armors.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded while
feeling surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This silverscale armor
was a top-grade Protocosmic armor that had protective properties!
This was a treasure that was comparable in value to a Chaos treasure
because protective armors were extremely rare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This armor of yours
is merely a suit of top-grade Protocosmic armor. The goldscale armors
are all Chaos armors.” The gray-robed elder chuckled. “Goldscale
armors will generally be able to block against most ordinary attacks.
In all the Badlands Territory, there are just a few organizations
that are willing to give their soldiers such valuable suits of
armor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If someone with a weak
divine body who wore a suit of Chaos armor was struck, the shockwave
from a sufficiently powerful blow could still cause some damage. By
comparison, being capable of reinforcing the body to make it as tough
as a treasure was far more useful! Still, these powerful suits of
armor were at least able to help ablate 99% of the incoming damage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Fushe,”
Ning said, “You just told me that the Fogstone Army has five
generals. Might I ask how strong they are compared to the Nine Divine
Generals of God Emperor Blacklotus?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
gray-robed elder smirked. “Those nine aren’t even qualified to be
mentioned in the same breath as our generals! They actually came up
with their ‘Nine Divine Generals’ because they envied us for
having our five. All they did was promote certain supreme Elder Gods
with special skills into the ranks of their nine. All nine of them
combined are actually a bit weaker than our five.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed. Judging from
his fight against Old Man Yuan, Old Man Yuan was probably just an
‘ordinary’ supreme Elder God; his main advantage lay in the fact
that he was incredibly skilled in heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two continued to
fly forward together, chatting the entire time. They quickly arrived
at a major continent, and Ning stared at a towering citadel that had
appeared in front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a large city,”
Ning marveled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The city emanated
ripples of absolutely incredible power. Chaos energy swirled around
it, so dense as to seem almost solid. The city was furiously
devouring the chaos energy, using it to maintain the enormous
formation that protected the entire planet of Fogstone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is Fogstone
City.” The gray-robed elder pointed towards the citadel. “The
military camps are located inside, as are various entertainment
venues. True Gods and True Immortals generally required to reside
within the city, while Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals are given
more freedom to wander around. They are permitted to choose a
residence of their choice on Fogstone and just occasionally go to the
army camps to meet with the others.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two slowly began
their descent as they flew through the enormous citadel gates of
Fogstone City. Ripples of power swept past them but no one came out
to bar their path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The army camp is
over there. The army camp is divided into two major regions. The
nicer-looking region is where the Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals
usually gather together, while the other one is meant for True Gods
and True Immortals. Go in and take a look for yourself. I need to
make a report on your behalf. I trust that a World-level expert will
soon come over to test your strength out,” the gray-robed elder
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go ahead.” Ning
smiled at the gray-robed elder, who quickly flew away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he
transformed into a streak of light as he flew towards the entrance of
the army camp. There were two black-armored soldiers standing guard
at the entrance, but upon seeing the silver-armored youth move
towards them they both simply bowed slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning entered the army
camp.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After doing so, he saw
two main paths. These two paths led to two separate drill areas. One
area had quite a few soldiers within it, almost all of whom were True
Gods or True Immortals. The other drill area had far fewer people,
just a few dozen or so Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals. The vast
majority of them were dressed in silverscale armor, with just one
dressed in goldscale armor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? Who is this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Anyone know him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t know’m,
never seen’m.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He should be new.”
The Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals all watched as Ning moved
towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The one dressed in
goldscale armor rose to his feet. He was rather skinny, and he had
some jade-green tattoos around the corners of his eyes. He smiled in
quite a radiant manner. “Are you new, my friend?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I just joined.”
Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My name is
Skyleave.” The goldscale soldier smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth,” Ning
replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth,
which squad do you belong to?” The goldscale soldier asked
curiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t know yet.
I just joined. I haven’t really been assigned to anyone,” Ning
said. This was true. The island master had to first report Ning’s
request to the World God, at which point he would be assigned a rank
and a position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, I’m the
captain of the tenth squad,” Skyleave said. “You might end up
assigned to me. All of you, come over here. This new friend of ours
is Darknorth, a new member of our Fogstone Army.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A new brother?
Captain, we have to hold a feast to welcome him.” A rather chubby,
smooth-faced soldier dressed in silverscale armor immediately called
out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, Captain!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We need to have a
feast.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The others all called
out excitedly as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You guys…ugh.
Blackpeak is about to attack us, but all you care about is eating and
drinking. Fine, fine. We’ll feast, we’ll feast,” Skyleave said
with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha, brother
Darknorth, my name is Baiwu.” The chubby silverscale soldier
slapped his arm around Ning’s shoulders, then said with a laugh,
“Our captain is rarely this generous. He almost never treats us to
meals. This is your first time here; you need to taste some of the
delicacies of Fogstone as well. Ah, man…I’ve lived for ages but I
still as much of a glutton as ever. But the thing is, the better
something tastes the more expensive it is. Ugh…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals had access to good techniques and tutelage, they
would usually either break through to become a World God within a
single chaos cycle or never be able to become a World God at all.
Most of these soldiers had been alive for quite some time, and none
of them had much hope of breaking through. Thus, all of them liked to
enjoy life instead. Some liked food while others had other hobbies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals were all immediately led towards a lavish,
semi-translucent building located nearby.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three basins of
dragon meat first!” Once the soldiers sat down, the chubby Baiwu
was the first to call out and make an order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You bastards.” The
goldscale soldier, Skyleave, just shook his head helplessly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, all sorts of
strange delicacies and dishes began to make their way to the seated
soldiers. The most impressive were those three giant basins of dragon
meat that were each thirty meters long. The dragon meat was tinged
with a dark-red color and emanated an aura of absolute fragrance.
Even Ning couldn’t help but drool once he caught a whiff of it. The
soldiers all stretched out their hands to grab at the pieces of
dragon meat, pulling them out from the basins and chewing on them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chomp, chomp, chomp.
The Elder Gods chomped through meat and bone alike, enjoying the food
and the wine.
</P>

Chapter 6 - Elder God Blackpeak
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is it really that
good?” Ji Ning picked up a large chunk of meat that was as thick as
his arms, then gave it a bite. A blissful feeling filled his entire
body as a surge of pleasure went through him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dragon meat is one
of the top ten delicacies of the entire Badlands Territory. There’s
no way for dragons to be raised in captivity; they can only survive
and thrive in certain special areas…and capturing them isn’t
easy.” The goldscale soldier Skyleave laughed. “I usually end up
spending more than half of my chaos nectar on food.” For Elder Gods
and Ancestral Immortals, other types of entertainment might be quite
cheap, but top-quality food was very hard to find.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals chatted, drank, and laughed amongst themselves.
Ning began to learn more and more about them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughly two hours into
their feast…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“SKYLEAVE!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“SKYLEAVE!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous roar
blasted out like thunder, echoing throughout the surrounding area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The Elder
Gods had been eating and drinking happily, but they now all came to a
halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s here.” The
goldscale soldier rose to his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The other dishes
don’t matter, but make sure you take away the dragon meat. We’ll
eat it later.” The soldiers all quickly packed up the dragon meat.
They had been eating quite slowly, enjoying every mouthful of it.
Clearly, they didn’t want to waste it by gulping it all down too
quickly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Captain, you don’t
even need to bother with Blackpeak.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. That idiot
caused the deaths of more than twenty of our fellow soldiers. So what
if you lectured him a bit?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Idiot.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other soldiers were
all cursing the man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I said what I said.
If he wants to fight, we’ll fight. Does he think I’m afraid of
him?” Skyleave laughed coldly. “Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The soldiers all
hurriedly followed behind Skyleave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?
Who is this ‘Blackpeak’ you guys are talking about?” Ning
followed behind as well while chatting with Elder God Baiwu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwu pursed his lips.
“Blackpeak was once a captain as well…but he was too arrogant and
proud. Not too long ago, we had a clash with the Blacklotus Empire.
Because of his arrogance, twenty-three of his soldiers paid the
ultimate price. Twenty-three Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals! Even
the Starlord of Fogstone was notified of this. He was punished by
being demoted to be an ordinary silverscale soldier. However, quite a
few of the dead Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals had friends in the
other squads, all of whom were quite angry with Blackpeak. Our
captain once cursed him out, causing a bit of friction between the
two. They decided to have a duel with each other today.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blackpeak is
arrogant and prideful, but he is also quite strong.” Baiwu said in
a low voice, “The number of captains stronger than him in the
Fogstone Army can be counted on one hand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As they chatted, their
group arrived at the drill area once more. Quite a few Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals had arrived here, all for the sake of watching
this battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The tallest one over
there? That’s Blackpeak,” Baiwu said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced over. The
man was dressed in silverscale armor, but his body was incredibly
slender. He had a total of four arms and the parts of his skin that
were exposed were all completely pitch-black. He had a pair of cold
and narrow golden eyes, and a mocking look could be seen within them.
He spoke out and said with a cold smile, “Skyleave. How is it that
an imbecile like you would consider yourself qualified to lecture me?
Today, I’ll let you know exactly how great the difference in power
between us is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cut the crap.”
Skyleave’s face was cold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to the
rules of our Fogstone Army…” Blackpeak strode forward, a cold
smile on his face. “Duels have to be fought for stakes. How many
treasures can you bring out? I’ll match any stakes you issue.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A hundred bottles of
chaos nectar,” Skyleave said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oho! You are
actually willing to risk that much? It must’ve been hard for you to
store up that much chaos nectar. If you insist on giving it all to
me, how could I possibly refuse? I accept.” Blackpeak licked his
lips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the Elder Gods
and Ancestral Immortals were here in support of Skyleave. The rest
were just here to watch. Blackpeak had come all by himself; clearly,
he didn’t have many friends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the battle began
between these two Elder Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha, you really
think you are a match for me?” Blackpeak held four great warhammers
in his four arms, and they all glittered with earthen yellow light as
they smashed downwards like mountains in an utterly dominating
fashion. Although there were many who disliked Blackpeak, all had to
admit that he was incredibly powerful, even amongst his fellow
captains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Skyleave
held a pair of shuttles in his hands as he moved around like a blur.
He let out a furious growl, then his body suddenly manifested four
more arms, giving him six arms and six shuttles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Useless. I won’t
even have to use any divine abilities against you,” Blackpeak
bragged loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fall down!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fall down!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“FALL DOWN!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackpeak fought in a
crazed fashion as he furiously smashed down with his warhammer, each
blow containing utterly shocking amounts of power. Fortunately, this
arena was protected by formation spells which ensured that Elder Gods
and Ancestral Immortals could fight at full power without any qualms.
The Starlord of Fogstone was happy to have his subordinate Elder Gods
and Ancestral Immortals compete against each other, so long as none
of them ended up dying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skyleave endured six
heavy hammer blows in a row. Finally, upon receiving the seventh
hammer, he spat out a mouthful of blood as he was sent flying
backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackpeak instantly
chased after him, smashing his warhammer against Skyleave’s chest.
Although Skyleave was protected by his goldscale armor, the
concussive power of the blow was still quite tremendous and enough to
instantly and completely shatter his chest. Blackpeak tapped another
hammer against Skyleave’s head, then smirked. “You lost, you
idiot.” As he spoke, he stomped down on Skyleave’s face with his
foot. Boom! Skyleave’s face was instantly caved in and reduced to
mush.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A stream of divine
power quickly reassembled far off in the distance, reforming
Skyleave’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blackpeak.”
Skyleave’s face was ashen. He had just had his face stomped on so
hard that it had been destroyed. How could he not be enraged by this
sort of insult?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blackpeak, our
captain had already lost. You went too far.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blackpeak…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skyleave’s soldiers
were all furious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In our duels, the
only rule is that we are not allowed to kill our opponents.
Everything else goes, right?” Blackpeak’s face was a mask of
innocent confusion. “All I did was was cave his chest in and stomp
his face in. He’s an Elder God! That’s not nearly enough to kill
him. I didn’t break the rules, right? Even if you reported it to
Starlord Fogbeast, he’d find me innocent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the soldiers had
ugly looks on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but secretly sigh in surprise. When these two had fought, they had
controlled their power in an extremely meticulous way, with no wasted
energy or movements. Both Blackpeak and Skyleave were more powerful
than Lord Demonheart had been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The chubby Elder God
Baiwu had been standing next to Ning. Now, he stepped forward.
Everyone fell silent as they all turned to look at Baiwu. Baiwu said
in a cold voice, “I’ll duel you next.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You?” Blackpeak
said disdainfully, “You are a silverscale soldier. I can’t be
bothered.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aren’t you a
silverscale soldier yourself?” Elder God Baiwu said coldly, “What,
do you still take yourself to be a goldscale soldier? If you forget,
take a look at the armor you are wearing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackpeak’s face
instantly changed. Clearly, Baiwu had just hit him where it hurt. He
was an incredibly proud person. Even though he had been demoted, he
still felt himself to be a goldscale soldier, an equal of the other
captains. Blackpeak stared at Baiwu coldly. “Very well. Since you
insist on giving me your treasures, I have no choice but to accept.
But if you want to duel me, you need to prepare at least fifty
bottles of chaos nectar. Otherwise, don’t even bother taking your
stakes out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I lose, I’ll
give my Ninestar Skyhooks to you.” Elder God Baiwu’s body blurred
momentarily as he manifested a total of six arms, each of which held
onto a curved hook.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A set of Ninestar
Skyhooks? I’ll be generous and value that as being worth sixty
bottles,” Blackpeak said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Elder God
Baiwu looked at him coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Baiwu…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Baiwu, don’t do
this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blackpeak is
incredibly strong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His fellow soldiers
quickly began to send mental messages urging him to back down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quite a few Elder Gods
and Ancestral Immortals were watching this happen from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blackpeak is quite
strong; he was one of the strongest goldscale captains we had. Even
Skyleave lost to him. For Baiwu to challenge him is just
foolishness.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Baiwu is definitely
going to lose.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Skyleave, you should
talk your soldier out of this. It isn’t worth it for him to lose a
set of Chaos treasures just like this,” a spectator purposefully
called out in a loud voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Captain Skyleave was
just doing just that. He sent mentally, “Baiwu, I’ll eat my loss
and swallow my pride for now. When I become more powerful, I’ll
come back and challenge him again. If you go, all you’ll do is lose
your treasure. It isn’t worth it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Baiwu completely
ignored everyone as he marched straight towards Blackpeak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackpeak smirked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two transformed
into streaks of light and clashed against each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Baiwu fellow is
really strong!” All of the spectating Elder Gods and Ancestral
Immortals were rather surprised, because Baiwu had just shown himself
to possess the power of a supreme Elder God. The two were actually
fighting to a standstill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Baiwu, you made a
breakthrough?” Skyleave revealed a look of surprise and joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Baiwu, kick
his face in!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Teach him a lesson,
brother Baiwu!” Skyleave’s soldiers were all hollering excitedly
on his behalf.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The pudgy Elder God
Baiwu continuously struck out with his six hooks. No matter how hard
the warhammers struck at him, he was able to easily deflect every
single attack. His pudgy body was like a ball of meat that
continuously rolled everywhere, easily absorbing and deflecting the
force of the Blackpeak’s blows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…so you
actually have a bit of power after all. Pity for you that it won’t
make a difference.” The warhammers suddenly vanished from Elder God
Blackpeak’s hands, only to be replaced by six slender swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both his body and his
swords were extremely slender. His movements became ghostly and
unpredictable as he launched a furious barrage of blows with his
slender swords against Baiwu. Previously, his attacks had been
dominating and savage. Now, they were strange and unpredictable.
These were two diametrically opposed styles of combat, and this
sudden change caused all of the watching Elder Gods and Ancestral
Immortals were quite shocked as Blackpeak quickly seized the upper
hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwu vomited out a
mouthful of blood as he was knocked flying by a hard kick.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He lost.” The
soldiers next to Skyleave all shook their head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The spectators all
shook their heads as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a black
streak of lightning flashed past, covering Baiwu and quickly moving
him away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Blackpeak had
been about to trample over Baiwu, but he immediately came to a halt.
Frowning, he stared off into the distance where a silverscaled youth
was holding Baiwu in his arms. A moment later, the youth released
Baiwu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If he lost, he lost.
No need to keep hitting him,” the silverscaled youth said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Baiwu, why haven’t
you given me your Ninestar Skyhooks yet?” Elder God Blackpeak
smirked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwu gritted his
teeth, then waved his arm and sent his six hooks flying over. Elder
God Blackpeak accepted them smugly, then began to laugh with delight.
He pointed at Skyleave, Baiwu, and the rest of the Elder Gods. “I’ve
been pretty pissed lately. Thanks for presenting yourselves before me
and letting me beat you up. That really felt good. And you gave me
quite a few treasures as well! Ahaha…and just look at the looks in
your eyes! Do you want to keep dueling me? I’ll take on any of you.
If you want to give me your treasures, I’d hardly refuse.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a voice rang
out. “I want to compete against you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackpeak glanced over,
puzzled. It was the silverscaled youth who was standing next to
Baiwu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You?” Blackpeak
laughed. “What’s going on with the silverscale soldiers? All of
them are getting too big for their britches. For yet another one to
challenge me…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are a
silverscale soldier as well,” the youth said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackpeak’s face
instantly turned ugly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If the bet is too
small, I can’t be bothered,” Blackpeak said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If the bet is too
big, I’m afraid you won’t dare to accept,” Ning replied.
</P>

Chapter 7 - The First Battle
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Won’t dare to
accept? A bet with you?” Elder God Blackpeak’s face turned even
uglier as rage began to burn within his heart. Ever since he had
returned after losing a few Elder Gods, the soldiers of the Fogstone
Army had all treated him in a completely different way. In fact, some
would actually curse at him to his face or mock him, with Elder God
Skyleave being one of them. These insults and this mockery caused him
to feel quite unhappy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had lived for more
than a chaos cycle and had no hope of breaking through to become a
World God. For people like him, face mattered more than anything
else. In recent days, he had been stewing angrily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For Skyleave to duel
him was one thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a silverscale
soldier like Baiwu to challenge him as well? Bah, forget it. He was
still a figure with quite the reputation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now, a silverscale
soldier he had never even met before was also daring to challenge
him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. A bet with me.”
Ji Ning looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s the bet?”
Blackpeak smiled coldly. “No matter how much you bring out, I’ll
match it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three hundred
bottles of chaos nectar,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three hundred
bottles?” Blackpeak blinked, then let out a cold laugh. “Do you
even have that much? Take it out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Supreme Elder Gods
would generally be able to take out a hundred bottles of chaos
nectar. If they also added their magic treasures into the mix, they
might just barely hit three hundred bottles worth….but how many
would generally be willing to add their most important treasures to
the stakes of a duel?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
causing more than ten thousand chaos jewels to appear next to him.
“There are 160 sets of chaos jewels here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the primordial
chaos, chaos jewels and chaos nectar were the most commonly used
currencies. A single drop of chaos nectar was equivalent to a single
chaos jewel, with a set of chaos jewels being equivalent to
ninety-nine gems!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had pillaged all
of the Elder Gods of the prisonworld. He had acquired some chaos
nectar as well as quite a few chaos jewels from them. The total
number of chaos jewels he had acquired was over 160 sets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These two Chaos
treasures should be worth at least 140 bottles of chaos nectar.”
Ning waved his hand again, causing a pair of Chaos treasures to
appear. One was a pair of flying scissors that was shaped like a
Flood Dragon, while the other was a set of nine flying needles. These
were both quite valuable top-grade Chaos treasures which Ning had
acquired.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So you have some
treasures after all.” A cautious look appeared in Blackpeak’s
eyes as he looked at Ning. This unremarkable little silverscale
soldier appeared to be hiding quite a few secrets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Screw’m. I’ve
made a few breakthroughs lately, and I daresay none of the supreme
Elder Gods of the Fogstone Army are definitively stronger than me
now. Only the five generals are definitely more powerful than me and
can beat me. What, can this silverscale soldier possibly have the
power of a general?” The flames of rage within Blackpeak’s heart
began to burn brighter and brighter, and his aura began to increase
in might as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine. Three hundred
bottles of chaos nectar. I’ll take that bet.” Blackpeak waved his
hand, causing 240 black jade bottles to appear alongside the Ninestar
Skyhooks. A hundred of the bottles had come from Skyleave while the
hooks had come from Baiwu. Only the 140 of the bottles really
belonged to him. He had actually prepared the chaos nectar for the
sake of this duel, but he had all but wiped out his savings in doing
so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ning had chosen to
wager five hundred bottles, Blackpeak really wouldn’t have been
able to provide enough chaos nectar. He probably would’ve been
forced to throw his most important treasures into the mix.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A bet of three hundred
bottles of chaos nectar…this was quite the wager!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Supreme Elder Gods
rarely made wagers of this magnitude. As for ordinary Elder Gods or
even elite Elder Gods, most of them wouldn’t be able to come up
with that much money, even if they pawned everything they had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three hundred
bottles?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t think I’ve
met that silverscale soldier before. Any of you know him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No clue.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Never met him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t know him
either.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Fogstone Army
only has so many Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals. Where did this
guy come from? He probably is quite strong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If he dares to make
a bet of this size, of course he must be strong enough to back it
up…but so what if he’s strong? Blackpeak might be an idiot, but
he really is powerful. In the past, he’s always used warhammers,
but just now he switched to using those slender swords. I bet
Blackpeak is hiding even more techniques that we don’t know about.
I’ll wager that none of the supreme Elder Gods of the Fogstone Army
are definitively stronger than him. Do you really think a silverscale
soldier will be able to beat him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed. He’s just
a silverscale, after all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The spectating Elder
Gods and Ancestral Immortals all chatted amongst themselves. Clearly,
in their eyes there was a limit to how impressive this
unremarkable-looking silverscale soldier could be. They refused to
believe that someone with the power of a general would be so bored as
to pretend to be a silverscale soldier. Even if the man wanted to be
low-key, there was no way he would be THAT low-key.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t do it,
brother Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth,
this Blackpeak guy is hiding his true power. I suffered due to it
just now!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth…” The
soldiers under Elder God Skyleave all hurriedly sent mental messages
to him, urging him to stop. They had feasted alongside him just now
and were rather friendly towards him. In addition, it could be said
that Ji Ning had stood up for them just now. They didn’t wish for
Ji Ning to lose his treasures to Blackpeak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to worry, my
friends.” Ning turned his head and smiled towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skyleave and the others
felt helpless. Cultivators at their level wouldn’t be so easily
dissuaded!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth
probably has some certain special techniques that he is confident
in…but what he doesn’t realize is that the soldiers of the
Fogstone Army all have access to the various legacies and techniques
of Fogstone. They won’t have any glaring weaknesses in any areas.
It’ll be hard for him to achieve victory using whatever special
skills he has. Ugh…he’s too new. There’s too much that he
doesn’t know.” Skyleave and the others all shook their heads in
worry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more powerful a
legacy was, the fewer flaws it would have.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, for example.
He was skilled in soul defense, heartforce scouting, resistance to
illusions, and had powerful protective divine abilities. He was quite
formidable in every single aspect, all because of the many techniques
included in World God Northrest’s legacy. Dealing with someone like
him, who had no glaring weaknesses, would be an incredibly difficult
task. Blackpeak was a supreme Elder God of the Fogstone Army; he
naturally had learned quite a few formidable techniques of his own as
well. The chances of successfully using a special technique to defeat
him would be very, very low.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The drill area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackpeak and Ji Ning
stared at each other from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For you to gift me
with so much chaos nectar…ahahaha…” Blackpeak held four heavy
warhammers in his hands as he boomed out with laughter, his powerful
aura rolling out in waves around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he just
stood there in a very placid manner, his aura the same as it normally
was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had been planning to
familiarize himself with this army camp first, which was why he had
kept his aura in check this entire time. His aura was merely that of
an ordinary Elder God’s. If he was to allow his true aura of a
half-step World God leak out, he probably would’ve immediately
become the focal point of the entire planet. Ning wasn’t the
flashy, ostentatious type. He preferred to keep a low profile
whenever possible…and now an unexpected benefit of that was that he
was going to earn some chaos nectar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was going to teach
Blackpeak a lesson at the same time as he earned some money. Wasn’t
this just perfect?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful now. I
kicked your captain’s face in just a few moments ago,” Blackpeak
said. As he spoke, he also attacked with his full power, not daring
to be negligent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just show me what
you have.” Ning stood there without moving.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This silverscale
soldier isn’t even taking out his weapons? Is he actually planning
to use his hands?” Blackpeak mused to himself. It was quite common
for experts to use their hands to fight as hands were even more
dexterous and nimble than most weapons. One could strike with a palm,
a fist, a finger, or a claw. There were also some special
body-enhancing techniques that could refine one’s hands to make
them as powerful as magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Blackpeak
instantly transformed into a streak of light and shot towards Ning.
As he flew over, he lashed out with his giant warhammers, causing the
air to shudder as though the heavens themselves had come crashing
down to earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“FALL!” Blackpeak
roared loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Starseizing Hand].”
Ning immediately struck out with his right hand. His palm was filled
with tremendous power, as though it was the gigantic axe which Pangu
had used to cleave Heaven from Earth. It became three hundred meters
large as it smashed towards Blackpeak like a gigantic black
stormcloud. Ning’s hands were comparable to Chaos treasures and
were completely capable of withstanding the tremendous amount of
divine power which was instantly unleashed by his [Starseizing Hand].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had the body of a
half-step World God. When he allowed his [Starseizing Hand] to burst
forth with power, he was overwhelmingly stronger than almost any
supreme Elder God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“FALL!” Blackpeak’s
words continued to echo in the air, and his eyes were filled with
madness as he sent his great warhammer in a vicious blow towards the
giant palm. So what if he makes his palm huge? Even if he makes it
ten thousand kilometers long, I’ll still smash it into meat paste.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The warhammer smashed
against the giant palm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like swatting a
mosquito. When the giant palm came crashing down, it smashed
Blackpeak down to the point of imprinting him into the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning withdrew his palm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone present was
silent. All of the Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals turned to look
at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackpeak crawled out
of the Blackpeak-shaped impression in the ground, an ugly look on his
face. He growled out, “I haven’t lost yet!” As soon as they had
exchanged blows, he had instantly realized how terrifyingly strong
this silverscale soldier was. In a head-on collision, there were very
few supreme Elder Gods who would be a match for him…but in a real
battle, raw strength alone wasn’t worth that much.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The warhammers
disappeared from Blackpeak’s hands, replaced by those thin swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish. He transformed
into a streak of light and shot towards Ning once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shameless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You got the crap
smashed out of you just now. If he had pressed the attack, you
would’ve been finished.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The spectators all
shook their heads, but they didn’t say anything. This was because
in a normal duel, the duel would proceed until one side was
completely unable to fight back, had his body completely smashed
apart, or perhaps had his protective magic treasures knocked far
away. Only then would the duel be considered lost. Simply being
knocked down didn’t really matter that much. Blackpeak’s body was
comparable to a top-grade Protocosmic spirit-treasure; it wouldn’t
be so easily damaged. If he didn’t want to admit defeat, there was
nothing that could be said or done about it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking, he
would’ve voluntarily admitted defeat for the sake of saving
face…but the thing was, Blackpeak still thought he could win!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s just
physically strong. I won’t compete against him in strength.”
Blackpeak’s four slender swords struck out towards Ning in a
ghostly, unpredictable fashion.

Chapter 8 - Chaos Immortal Abyssus
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Ji Ning once
more struck out with his palms. If a supreme Elder God wanted to
avoid competing on raw strength, he would have to use some of his
true abilities if he still wished to win. As far as raw strength
went, even Old Man Yuan’s ‘Blacklotus Guard’ had been beaten by
Ning to the point of collapse. This was a testament to Ning’s raw
strength. As for technique? Ning hadn’t even used any of his
sword-arts yet!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s palms once
more transformed into a pair of giant black stormclouds that covered
the skies, but this time the stormclouds moved even faster than
before. They moved faster than the limits of the Heavenly Daos, and
they carried a strange aura of destruction about them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Brightmoon] sword-art,
Heavenbreaker stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had reached such a
high level in sword-arts that his Heavenbreaker stance possessed
truly shocking amounts of power. It had become even faster than
before, and it also carried a terrifying aura of utterly crushing
annihilation that made it difficult for an enemy to dodge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can he be this
fast?!” Elder God Blackpeak couldn’t even dodge in time. All he
could do was stare wide-eyed as the giant black stormclouds came
smashing down towards him once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” He
hurriedly used the four slender swords in his hands to block.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackpeak staggered
backwards but was still able to block the attack in a stable manner.
He was skilled in every aspect; furious attacks, strange sword-arts,
and defense. The reason why he had been knocked down the first time
was because he had overestimated himself and competed against Ning in
raw strength. Despite that, he had been able to endure the full brunt
of Ning’s attack. Now that he was using four swords to ablate the
force of Ning’s strikes, he was able to hold his own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Blackpeak’s
defensive powers are actually a bit inferior to Old Man Yuan’s.”
After this second clash, Ning became certain of his victory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan was able
to use palm-strikes to set up a completely airtight defense. Ning had
to use the ‘Heartsword stance’ in order to achieve victory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackpeak was more
skilled in offensive attacks. Although he did understand certain
defensive arts and mysteries, he was still a bit inferior compared to
Old Man Yuan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blackpeak is
actually losing?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blackpeak is
completely focusing on defense. He isn’t able to launch any attacks
at all. The difference in power between the two is quite obvious.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This silverscale
soldier’s palms are able to strike faster than the limits of the
Heavenly Daos. How impressive! He’s also incredibly powerful as
well. Blackpeak focuses on physical strength, but even he isn’t
able to withstand the silverscale’s blows.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the watching Elder
Gods and Ancestral Immortals sighed in amazement. This was too
incredible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fall down!” Ning
suddenly let out a roar as he manifested three heads and six arms.
All six of his arms suddenly stretched out, transforming into six
enormous black stormclouds that all moved faster than the limits of
the Heavenly Daos. He once more used the Heavenbreaker stance of the
[Brightmoon] sword-art, striking out with incomparable ferocity as
his palms smashed down towards Blackpeak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six massive palms
struck out in a furious, consecutive series of blows that seemed to
have no end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s terrifying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who could possibly
withstand such a furious barrage of palms?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fast and furious.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Elder Gods
and Ancestral Immortals, including the ones under Captain Skyleave
who had chatted and feasted with Ning, felt a cold chill. They could
tell that almost no supreme Elder God could compete against Ning’s
palms in raw power. For it to also surpass the limits of the Heavenly
Daos in speed…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six palms continued
to furiously rain down upon Blackpeak with tremendous power and great
speed. Ning’s techniques seemed simple, but all of the Elder Gods
and Ancestral Immortals present felt as though they couldn’t even
breathe. There was no way to defeat this at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sometimes, the simpler
something was, the more it could drive someone to despair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackpeak was drowning
in palm-shadows. He was only able to withstand the attack for a brief
moment before finally falling down. In the end, his defenses simply
weren’t good enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as he fell
down, Ji Ning struck him with a giant palm. His body went completely
limp, then Ning seized him and lifted him up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning dispelled the
[Three Heads, Six Arms] divine ability, hoisting Blackpeak up with
one hand. Blackpeak struggled forcefully with his four arms, but Ji
Ning was simply too strong. He was completely unable to break free.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Give up?” Ning
looked at the captured Blackpeak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…” Blackpeak
gritted his teeth. Three hundred bottles of chaos nectar!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head.
“It seems as though you are going to force me to seal you away and
then slowly refine you…” Blackpeak’s body was comparable to a
top-grade Protocosmic treasure. If Ning wanted to actually break his
body apart, he would either have to use Violetjewel or seal the man
away and slowly refine him to death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I admit defeat.”
Blackpeak lowered his head and spoke these words with extreme
reluctance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you think?”
Two figures were standing at the very edges of the area. One was the
gray-robed elder Fushe, the master of the mustering grounds. The
other was a handsome, white-haired, white-robed man. The handsome man
was carrying a box on his back as he quietly watched the battle
proceed between Ji Ning and Blackpeak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s quite
ferocious.” The white-robed, white-haired man sighed softly. “He
must have trained in an extremely formidable divine ability. How else
could he be this dominating in raw strength?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His palm-arts are
quite formidable as well. Every palm-strike surpasses the limits of
the Heavenly Daos,” Fushe said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The
white-robed man nodded slowly. “Still, if this is all he has,
there’s no need for us to have my master get involved.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This might be just
part of his true power,” Fushe said. “I have the feeling that he
wasn’t lying to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed man
nodded as he continued to watch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning withdrew his
palms, allowing Blackpeak to fall to the ground. Blackpeak rubbed his
throat, then gave Ning a hard look. “I’ll remember you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The stakes?” Ning
said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The stakes!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder God Blackpeak,
hand over the stakes!” Captain Skyleave and the other Elder Gods
and Ancestral Immortals all grew excited and ran over to stand next
to Ning. Elder God Baiwu excitedly slapped Ning on the shoulders and
sighed in amazement, “Impressive. Given how strong you are, why the
hell are you wearing silverscale? You should at least have a set of
goldscale armor. Blackpeak, don’t just stand there like an idiot.
Hurry up and hand over the stakes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackpeak let out a
snort, then waved his hand, causing the 240 bottles of chaos nectar
and the Ninestar Skyhooks flew over to Ning. He then turned his head
and left, his body blurring as he disappeared into the army camp.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
collecting the items.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Baiwu,
here’s your treasure.” Ning handed the Ninestar Skyhooks over to
Elder God Baiwu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I c-can’t…”
Baiwu hurriedly waved in refusal. “I lost it to Blackpeak, while
you won it from him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is something
you actually use in battle. You’ve used it for many years; I
imagine you must be quite used to it by now,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwu hesitated a
moment. This set of treasures had indeed accompanied him for a long
period of time, and he was emotionally attached to them. He gritted
his teeth, then nodded. “Alright, I’ll accept them back. Brother
Darknorth, I owe you one. If there’s anything you need me to do in
the future, just let me know.” Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals
generally weren’t willing to be in the debt of another; the only
reason why Baiwu had accepted the treasures was because he truly had
used them for a very long period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Captain Skyleave.”
Ning waved his hand, causing a hundred bottles of chaos nectar to
float over towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need.” Skyleave
laughed and shook his head. “If I lost some chaos nectar, so be it.
I won’t go so far as to take it back. No need to even discuss
this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Accepting the chaos
nectar meant accepting a favor from Ning. Baiwu might’ve accepted
his treasures back, but he was planning to repay Ning as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, come!
Darknorth won so much that we really need to feast in celebration. We
stopped halfway through the last one. We didn’t even get to
finish!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, right! Let’s
go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals were all quite happy. To make Blackpeak suffer a
loss like this was a happy thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be in such a
rush, everyone.” Two figures walked towards them from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is Imperius.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Imperius.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed,
white-haired man and Fushe walked over towards the group.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Fushe.”
Ning smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is Imperius.”
Fushe made the introductions. “He is the senior disciple of
Immortal Abyssus.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The handsome man known
as Imperius was dressed in long robes and carried a box on his back.
He smiled and said, “On my master’s orders, I’ve come to invite
you to the Abyssus Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals nearby were all shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, hurry up
and go. A Chaos Immortal has summoned you!” They all secretly sent
mental messages over to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt his heart
clench in nervousness as well. One of the nine World-level experts
resident on Fogstone was known as Immortal Abyssus. He was a Chaos
Immortal who had joined from outside the region. He had been a
wanderer of the primordial chaos, but he had decided to take up
residence on Fogstone, possibly because he was tired of wandering or
for some other reason.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Almost all of Immortal
Abyssus’ disciples had originally been his followers who had
decided to join him on Fogstone. All of them were outsiders. After
taking up residence on Fogstone, he had only accepted a grand total
of two disciples over the course of countless years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though
Immortal Abyssus will be the one responsible for verifying my
strength,” Ning mused. “I’ve heard about the power of
World-level cultivators for so long, but I’ve never actually met
one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Abyssus would
be the first World God or Chaos Immortal Ning would meet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, I’ll
head to the Abyssus Palace first.” Ning turned to nod towards
Skyleave and the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Escorted by Island
Master Fushe and Ancestral Immortal Imperius, Ning departed from the
army camp. The citadel was quite large, and the nine World-level
cultivators all resided in their own palaces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s Abyssus
Palace over there.” Imperius pointed towards a distant, towering
palace that was almost completely black in color. The palace emanated
golden ripples of power in every direction, with the ripples being so
strong as to cause even Ning to feel secretly shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Abyssus Palace is a
Dao treasure.” Imperius laughed. “When we followed Master in
adventuring through the primordial chaos, we went to countless
dangerous areas. In many cases, we had to rely on the Abyssus Palace
to survive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a guard at
the entrance of Abyssus Palace. Upon seeing Imperius, Fushe, and Ning
fly towards him, he stepped aside and didn’t try to stop them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The insides of the
palace were quite spacious. Beautiful women belonging to many
different races could be seen everywhere, as well as valuable beasts
and birds. There were also springs of water that emanated auras of
intoxicating spirituality; clearly, these were extraordinary holy
springs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master is in the
main hall.” Imperius pointed towards the front, then smiled. “After
he learned of your presence, he was quite curious about you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eldest
apprentice-brother, eldest apprentice-brother!” A lively young
maiden dressed in gauze came running out. When Ning saw her, he was
secretly puzzled. She was merely a True Immortal! For a True Immortal
to become apprenticed to Immortal Abyssus was no easy feat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it, junior
apprentice-sister?” Imperius asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“World God Blackmist
has arrived.” The maiden hurriedly lowered her voice and whispered,
“He’s right there inside the hall. Master is accompanying him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart thumped.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Blackmist?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the nine World-level
experts on Fogstone, three were World Gods. World God Blackmist was
one of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” A thoughtful
look seemed to flash past Imperius’ eyes as he grinned at Ning. “It
seems you’ve attracted quite a bit of attention, brother Darknorth.
Come, let us have you pay your respects to Master and World God
Blackmist.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Elder God
Imperius, and Island Master Fushe walked towards the gates of the
hall together.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 9 - Sword-Arts
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After entering the main
hall, Ji Ning felt as though he had entered a completely different
world. He had heard nothing when he was outside the hall, but upon
entering it he could clearly hear the sound of music reverberating
throughout it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning swept the hall
with his gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were female
Immortals dancing within the hall, as well as musicians who were
playing all sorts of various instruments. There were nine separate
musical groups spread throughout the hall, each separated by curtains
of brocade cloth. There had to be several hundred musicians present
as well as several hundred dancing female Immortals. All of them
merely fluttered about at the margins, providing just a bit of extra
festivity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings to you,
senior Blackmist,” Ancestral Immortal Imperius said respectfully.
“Master, I’ve brought Elder God Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced upwards.
There were two tables placed at the front of the great hall. On the
left sat a white-haired elder dressed in loose white robes, while on
the right sat a black-haired man who looked rather sloppy and poorly
dressed. Both of them emanated ripples of power that were so great,
they felt as though they were the ripples that would emanate from
entire chaosworlds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“World God. Chaos
Immortal.” Ning could sense that these two posed a deadly threat to
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he had just
barely reached the World God threshold when using Violetjewel, the
difference in power between him and these two figures who had long
ago crossed that threshold was still quite apparent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Respectful greetings
to you, seniors.” Ning and Fushe both spoke out with respect. As
Elder Gods, they had enough status to speak while remaining on their
feet, as opposed to True Gods and True Immortals who had to kneel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So you are
Darknorth?” The old man dressed in loose white robes spoke out
slowly. He was Chaos Immortal Abyssus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am,” Ning said
respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You seem quite
confident in your skills. You asked for a World-level expert to
attest to your strength as soon as you joined the Fogstone Army.”
Chaos Immortal Abyssus smiled gently. “You’ve made an impression
on all nine of the World-level experts of Fogstone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Island Master Fushe had
made the report to all nine of the World-level experts, including the
Starlord of Fogstone. Immortal Abyssus was the first to respond, but
all nine of them knew about this matter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mmhmm.” World God
Blackmist glanced downwards as well while sipping from his winecup.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” A
red-lipped, red-robed standing off to one side suddenly spoke out
loudly. “We don’t even know where this Elder God Darknorth came
from. Are we supposed to trouble you with every random Elder God or
Ancestral Immortal, master? Your disciple is willing to test him out
first and see how much power he actually has. If he can’t even beat
me, there’s no need whatsoever for you to intervene.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Abyssus
chuckled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Blackmist
played with his wineup, a drunken look in his eyes. “Brother
Abyssus, this disciple of yours is pretty strong. You can let him
have the first go with this Darknorth fellow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Might as well.”
Immortal Abyssus nodded, then instructed, “Disciple, have a little
contest with Darknorth. Neither of you are to kill the other.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,” the
red-robed youth said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,” Ning
said as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two World-level experts
had made their wishes known. How could he possibly disagree?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both Immortal Abyssus
and World God Blackmist were watching the proceedings from their
tables.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s your
impression of Darknorth?” Immortal Abyssus asked with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He seems quite calm
and confident,” World God Blackmist said. “He should have a bit
of strength.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Abyssus nodded
in agreement. “Then who do you think will win, Abyssus?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s watch and
see.” World God Abyssus had a look of curiosity on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Restrictive spells
automatically sprang into place within the hall, completely covering
both Ji Ning and the red-robed youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the red-robed
youth stared at each other from within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Listen up. My name
is Shadesoar.” The red-robed youth produced a pair of swords within
his two hands. “My area of expertise is sword-arts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My area of expertise
is also sword-arts.” Ning also produced a pair of Darknorth swords.
Previously, he had merely used his palms and the [Starseizing Hand]
to crush Elder God Blackpeak. Now that he was performing in front of
a pair of World-level experts, Ning felt it was best to be cautious.
He was still able to perform sword-arts better with his swords, after
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword was both
sharper and faster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His area of
expertise is sword-arts?” Ancestral Immortal Imperius and Island
Master Fushe were both surprised. Ji Ning had fought in a tyrannical,
dominating fashion earlier. He was actually a sword-user as well?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He also uses the
sword?” World God Blackmist let out a laugh. There were two
World-level experts on Fogstone who were extremely skilled in using
the sword. One was the Starlord of Fogstone, who had devised and was
willing to sell his ‘Skystar Sword’ manual to those who were
willing to pay the right price. The second was World God Blackmist.
World God Blackmist was very good friends with the Starlord of
Fogstone; it could be said the he had watched as the Starlord of
Fogstone slowly grew up and rose to power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Blackmist had
actually taught the Starlord of Fogstone his sword-arts. But of
course, Fogstone was now far more powerful than Blackmist by now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A competition
between two swordsmen. This will be interesting.” Immortal Abyssus
smiled. “Blackmist, if Darknorth is skilled you can choose him as
your disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I told you, I’ll
never accept a disciple,” World God Blackmist said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Abyssus
secretly shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Long ago, World God
Blackmist had a disciple. After that disciple died, Blackmist refused
to accept any more disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, both Ning and
the red-robed youth made their moves as they charged towards each
other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both had reached
extremely high levels of expertise in sword-arts and were able to
control their divine power freely, letting none of it leak out or go
to waste.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fifth-stage
swordforce? His sword-arts are quite impressive as well.” Ning
immediately felt a hint of pressure as he started to fight against
the red-robed youth. The youth’s sword-arts were nimbler and more
agile than his, like an antelope galloping through the woods or a
pegasus flying the skies. Every single strike of the sword moved
faster than the limits of the Heavenly Daos; clearly, he had also
learned and mastered a technique similar to the [Five Treasures].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of this surprised
Ning. This was a disciple of a Chaos Immortal, after all; it made
sense for him to possess this type of technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By comparison, Ning’s
sword-arts were more unpredictable and formless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was using the
‘Shadowless’ stance of the [Brightmoon] sword-art. The red-robed
youth found that this stance was extremely difficult to block.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your sword-arts
aren’t bad, but if this is all you have, you aren’t qualified to
exchange blows with my master,” the red-robed youth barked out
while fighting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then you had best be
careful!” Ning let out a loud roar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s two fluttering
swords suddenly exploded with might. His swords had previously moved
in strange, unpredictable ways. All of a sudden, they grew
dramatically more powerful than before. Prior to this, Ning hadn’t
been using the [Starseizing Hand], while the red-robed youth had
actually already used his own divine abilities. Only by doing so was
he able to match Ning, a half-step World God, in might. Now that Ning
was using the [Starseizing Hand], the power of his blows increased
dramatically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fast, strong, bizarre…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword-light
brought such tremendous pressure upon the youth that his face
changed. His body blurred as he manifested a total of six arms, but
Ning immediately manifested six arms of his own as he continued to
press the assault.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
Ning’s sword-light struck with incredible weight and savagery,
causing the nimble sword-arts of the red-robed youth to be completely
disrupted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A streak of sword-light
slammed against the red-robed youth’s body. The youth was knocked
flying backwards and fell to the ground, causing even the palace hall
itself trembled slightly. The red-robed youth couldn’t help but
vomit out a mouthful of blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s just a bit
stronger than me, that’s all.” The red-robed youth didn’t want
to accept the loss and wished to charge towards Ning once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A voice rang out from
on high. “If you lost, you lost.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.”
Rather embarrassed, the red-robed youth assented in a respectful
voice. He had wanted to defeat this unknown Elder God, but instead he
himself had been defeated. In terms of sword-arts, he was actually
one of the top three Fogstone soldiers…and yet, he had been
defeated by this Darknorth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you think?”
Immortal Abyssus looked towards World God Blackmist. “You are more
qualified to judge him than I am.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Blackmist
looked downwards at Ning, a hint of praise in his eyes. “This
Darknorth has reached a very high level of skill in sword-arts. It
seemed as though the two were on par with each other, with Shadesoar
only losing because he was a bit weaker, but…in this fight,
Darknorth’s techniques came out in a steady, unbroken stream. His
techniques were very well-rounded and perfected, allowing him to
battle in a very natural, unrestrained manner. If my guess is
correct, Darknorth has revealed just a hint of his true prowess with
the sword. He hasn’t shown his most formidable techniques yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Immortal
Abyssus was rather surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Blackmist had
long ago reached the ‘Sword World’ level in the sword. He was
better equipped to evaluate sword-arts than almost anyone else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although he hasn’t
revealed his most formidable techniques yet, he isn’t able to hide
the slick perfection of the techniques he has revealed.” World God
Blackmist smiled. “It is very hard for a weakling to pretend to be
an expert of the sword, but it is also very hard for an expert of the
sword to pretend to be a weakling. Every single stance he uses is
extraordinary, as is his sword-intent. Abyssus, I have a rather
unreasonable request to make.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? What is it?”
Immortal Abyssus asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me be the one to
compete with him instead.” World God Blackmist put down his cup of
wine. “Only when I personally test him out will I be sure as to
exactly how strong he is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, my attainments
in the Dao of the Sword are quite average. You are actually the best
choice possible.” Immortal Abyssus nodded in agreement.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos Immortal Abyssus
and World God Blackmist both suddenly turned to look towards the
outside of the hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another figure suddenly
walked into the hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, the red-robed
youth, Ancestral Immortal Imperius, and Island Master Fushe all
turned their heads to look. The new arrival was a man who was dressed
in a robe of stars. He had long black hair, with every single strand
of hair glimmering with the light of the stars. His gaze caused Ning
and the others to feel an uncontrollable desire to drop their eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This aura…”
Ning’s heart trembled. Upon seeing this man who had just arrived,
he felt as though he was seeing the planet of Fogstone itself
glittering within the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Starlord.”
Immortal Abyssus had already risen to his feet. He immediately waved
his hand, causing a third table to appear in the center of the hall.
He and World God Blackmist quickly seated themselves to either side
of the table.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Starchild.” World
God Blackmist rose to his feet as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The starry-robed man
moved to the front of the hall, then sat down in the lotus position
as well. He smiled. “Second Uncle, Abyssus, please take a seat.
Don’t stand on such ceremony. I just heard a short while ago that
an Elder God named Darknorth wishes to join our Fogstone Army. I just
so happened to leave my meditations and had nothing to do, so I came
over to take a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, Blackmist was
just about to personally test this Darknorth’s power.” Immortal
Abyssus smiled. He was very respectful towards the Starlord of
Fogstone because the Starlord was an incredibly powerful figure.
Compared to him, even the other two nearby hegemons such as God
Emperor Blacklotus and Sovereign Eastvictor were a bit lacking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Abyssus truly
admired him, which was why he was willing to take up residence here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second Uncle, you
plan to personally test him out? Haha, it seems like my decision to
come here was the right one.” The Starlord laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth seems to
be quite talented in the Dao of the Sword.” World God Blackmist
nodded his head and smiled. The little kid really had grown up and
become powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord of
Fogstone, Immortal Abyssus, and World God Blackmist chatted amongst
themselves. None of the others could hear a thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that the Starlord
of Fogstone?” Ning and the others, including the disciples of
Immortal Abyssus, all felt breathless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord of
Fogstone was a legend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Strictly speaking,
every single Starlord of Fogstone had been a figure of incredible
power. Fogstone had a long, ancient history that stretched even
further back than the lineage of the Badlands Court itself! Whenever
a successor became powerful, the previous Starlord of Fogstone would
depart and go out to adventure through the primordial chaos. They
would search for their own paths, and as a result many of them would
die on other worlds during their adventures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After adventuring for
many years, some would come back and visit their old home. Thus,
although every so often the Fogstone lineage would be wiped out, in
every case it had been quickly restored to power once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, whenever
any of the successors formally assumed the mantle of ‘Starlord of
Fogstone’, they would suddenly become dramatically more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the reasons why
Ning had decided to join Fogstone was precisely because the Starlords
of Fogstone had very deep roots. They could rely on the power of
Fogstone itself to quickly improve themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.”
Immortal Abyssus spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Present.” Ning
replied with respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It shall be World
God Blackmist who tests you out,” Immortal Abyssus said. “World
God Blackmist has long ago reached the ‘Sword World’ level in the
Dao of the Sword. Don’t waste this opportunity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
grew excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword World?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixth stage of
swordforce? The stage which allowed one to become a World God through
the Dao of the Sword?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My second uncle
rarely shows his power. You need to treasure this,” the Starlord of
Fogstone said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I won’t take
advantage of you, kid.” World God Blackmist waved his finger,
causing a drop of blood to fly towards Ning and manifest into an
identical clone of Blackmist. However, this clone’s aura was
noticeably weaker. “This blood incarnation is a bit weaker than an
ordinary Elder God. Use your most powerful attacks against me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning’s
eyes lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Blackmist’s
incarnation stared at each other from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackmist’s
incarnation was rather weak in both speed and strength for an Elder
God, while Ning was a half-step World God. This gave Ning a huge
advantage…but Ning knew that his opponent was at a much higher
level of skill and enlightenment than himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Blackmist,
this is the most powerful sword-art I have developed to date. Please
provide me with some advice,” Ning said solemnly, holding a single
sword with a twohanded grip. The entire hall suddenly seemed to echo
with his sword-intent as Ning took complete control over the entire
area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Nameless] sword-art,
Heartsword stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had gone into
seclusion for three hundred years after the Endwar, which translated
into six thousand years in the Heavengazer Tower of Radiance.
Although he had spent much of the six thousand years restoring his
bodies, most of his attention had been spent on meditating on the Dao
and on the Sword. His sword-arts were even more formidable and
perfected than they had been when he had slain Old Man Yuan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Ning flew
forward, his entire being seeming to have transformed into a sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This
sword-intent….he really is a true expert in the Dao of the Sword.”
Blackmist’s incarnation let out a laugh as he produced a sword and
began to fight against Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang! Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tens of thousands of
sword-shadows appeared as the two furiously battled against each
other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning possessed
tremendous power, formidable divine abilities, and shocking
sword-arts. World God Blackmist’s sword, however, was even more
unpredictable and ephemeral, causing each of Ning’s strikes to fall
empty and miss their mark.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second Uncle, you
probably won’t be able to do anything to Darknorth with just an
incarnation. He has gained certain insights into the true essence of
the sword. Although he’s lacking in other respects, his control and
mastery over the sword has reached a level of perfection.” The
Starlord of Fogstone was even more skilled in the Dao of the Sword
than World God Blackmist. Upon seeing this battle, he immediately
laughed and gave his input.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He shows no openings
or weaknesses at all. With every step he takes, he crushes down upon
me, taking advantage of the fact that I don’t have enough divine
power.” The incarnation of Blackmist simply didn’t have enough
divine power to fight. “I need to take part with my true body.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Blackmist
suddenly flew away from his seat, dispelling his clone and instead
charging forward to battle against Ning personally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? World God
Blackmist has engaged with his own body?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The incarnation of
World God Blackmist wasn’t enough to deal with Darknorth?” All
the spectators, including Island Master Fushe and the disciples of
Immortal Abyssus, were stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Abyssus
himself was also puzzled. “Brother Blackmist is tremendously
skilled with the sword. Although his incarnation is a bit lacking in
physical strength, brother Blackmist should be talented enough in
sword-arts to defeat Darknorth despite being physically weaker.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s where you
are wrong,” the Starlord of Fogstone said. “The Dao of the Sword
is a Dao meant for battle and slaughter. Thus, when most swordsmen
reach a sufficiently high level of insight into the Dao of the Sword,
they will first gain insight over the sword-intent of slaughter. This
Darknorth, however, didn’t gain insight into the sword-intent of
slaughter; instead, he gained insight into something else, a sort of
absolute control over the sword. He’s able to unleash the maximum
power of every single stance he uses while showing almost no
weaknesses or flaws, making it extremely difficult for anyone on the
same level of power as him to actually defeat him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Absolute control?”
Immortal Abyssus didn’t really understand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord of
Fogstone chuckled calmly. “The true essence of the sword is a vast,
endless sea. Different experts in the Dao of the Sword will gain
different insights when they study the essence of the sword. The
insights Darknorth gained pertain to control, control over the sword.
His sword isn’t the fastest, nor is it the sharpest, but he has the
most perfect control over his sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The deceased World God
Northrest had left behind ninety-eight stone steles for his
successor, so as to help his successor master the concept of the
‘hidden edge’. This was a concept that centered around control,
not an all-out attack. Later on, Ning had finally mastered the
‘Heartsword stance’ during the Endwar. The [Nameless] sword-art
required its practitioners to have absolute control over their
Immortal swords. If one couldn’t fully control the sword as one
wished, then one would never be able to become truly powerful, no
matter how strong one’s blows became.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a level
which many experts of the Dao of the Sword dream of reaching. If you
are completely flawless, then when you encounter an enemy of the same
level of power it will be very difficult for that person to defeat
you.” The Starlord laughed. “I only reached this level after I
became a World God. My second uncle still has yet to reach this level
of mastery. He’s embarked on a different path in the Dao of the
Sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Blackmist
suppressed his own power as he fought, strictly competing against
Ning in sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light flashed
throughout the hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt as though he
had been trapped in a web of countless sword-shadows, all of which
were crushing down upon him. He couldn’t even see any of the other
people in the hall. All he could see were those attacking streaks of
sword-light, each of which seemed to emerge from a black mist of
sword-shadows. Every single blow was ghostly yet brutal and
overbearing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kid, this here is my
Sword World. Take a good look!” World God Blackmist’s voice
echoed in the hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was using every
inch of power he had to defend. Supported by the ‘Heartsword
Realm’, his [Brightmoon] sword-art was executed in a perfect,
intricate manner…and yet, he still was at the verge of being
defeated. All he could do was fight with full power, infusing all of
the insights he had gained into his sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In recent years, Ning
hadn’t been able to meet a truly skilled opponent in the Dao of the
Sword! He had been painstakingly training on his own this entire
time. Now, however, a World God who had mastered his own Sword World
was sparring against him in person, giving him a chance to see a
completely new world and gain an even deeper glimpse into the true,
vast essence of the sword. In fact, Ning was actually beginning to
gain more and more insights into the second stance of the [Nameless]
sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Six thousand years
of training wasn’t as useful as this single battle.” A berserk
look appeared in Ning’s eyes as he did everything he could to
continue fighting against World God Blackmist. He tested out many of
the insights he had gained into the Dao of the Sword, hoping that
this battle against World God Blackmist would persist for a bit
longer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, his sword-arts
were improving at a rate which was visible to all the spectators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s growing more
powerful?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord of
Fogstone continued to watch from his position, and his eyes lit up
when he saw this. “It seems that this Darknorth has never
encountered true experts in the Dao of the Sword in the past. Second
Uncle, spend some extra time sparring with him! It’s quite rare for
us to acquire such an expert in the Dao of the Sword.”

Chapter 11 - The Sixth General
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only when competing
against a grandmaster of the sword would one truly be able to see
one’s own weaknesses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ji Ning’s
‘Sword Realm’ was very formidable, allowing him to perfectly
control every single sword-strike he used, its weakness was that it
was too balanced. His sword wasn’t fast enough, unpredictable
enough, savage enough…it was lacking in many respects. When World
God Blackmist used his sword-arts against Ning, Ning was completely
suppressed in every respect. Blackmist’s sword-arts were truly
terrifying and contained an entire system within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sword World level
represented a systemized understanding of the true essence of the
sword, allowing one to form an entire world with it. World God
Blackmist clearly had already reached that level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s how it
should be.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second stance of
the [Nameless] sword-art…no wonder I always felt something was
off.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During this battle,
many of the questions and mysteries that had puzzled Ning were
dispelled one after the other, causing Ning to feel quite excited. In
his homeland of Earth, there was a saying; ‘Listening to a word of
wisdom from a master is more effective than ten years of reading.’
When competing against such a formidable master of the sword such as
World God Blackmist, Ning found that he was improving at a shocking
rate. He had trained for many years but had never encountered someone
as terrifyingly formidable in the Dao of the Sword before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Blackmist had
clearly suppressed his own level of power, allowing just a little bit
of it to be put on display. If he was to allow the power of his Sword
World to fully explode, it would be effortless for him to destroy an
entire chaosworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning continued
to make improvements, he was still very puny compared to the true
might of this Sword World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A killing stance…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. This stance
doesn’t focus on stability; it focuses on attacking and killing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning slowly began to
understand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Nameless] sword-art,
first stance - Heartsword stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Nameless] sword-art,
second stance - Killsword stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He truly is talented
in the Dao of the Sword.” Immortal Abyssus watched from on high as
World God Blacklist dueled against Ji Ning. Every single streak of
sword-light from Ji Ning was more powerful and fiercer than the last
as his Dao of the Sword noticeably grew sharper and deadlier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He is improving
quite quickly. My guess is that Darknorth hasn’t been training for
that long,” the Starlord of Fogstone said with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Immortal
Abyssus nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one didn’t reach
the World-level in a single chaos cycle, it was almost guaranteed
that one would never reach that level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For Ji Ning to improve
so quickly when dueling with a master of the Dao of the Sword meant
that he was clearly still in his early growth period. And in truth,
the reason why his rate of improvement was this fast was primarily
because he had never before had the chance to duel such an expert of
the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“B-but…” As the
red-robed disciple of Immortal Abyssus watched this fight, he felt
more embarrassed than anyone else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now do you
understand the difference between the two of you?” Ancestral
Immortal Imperius laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please don’t make
fun of me, eldest apprentice-brother.” The red-robed youth said
hurriedly, “Only now do I realize that Elder God Darknorth was
taking it easy on me. If he had revealed such terrifying sword-arts
from the very start, I probably would’ve been instantly defeated.
His sword-arts have completely eclipsed the sword-arts of so-called
‘supreme Elder Gods’. He should be comparable to our five
generals. Most likely you, eldest apprentice-brother, are the only
one who is definitely capable of defeating him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If eldest
apprentice-brother fights, of course he’ll win.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No question.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the fellow
disciples agreed on this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos Immortal Abyssus
had only joined this place after adventuring for many years in the
outside world, and as he did so he was accompanied by his eldest
disciple, Ancestral Immortal Imperius. Imperius was unfathomably
strong, but he had never joined the Fogstone Army. He was a very
low-key figure, but the disciples of Chaos Immortal Abyssus and the
high-level members of Fogstone all knew that the most powerful figure
below the World-level on this planet was actually Imperius. In fact,
the five generals had once joined together to challenge him in
secret, but all five of them had been defeated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Imperius was simply a
low-key man who didn’t like to fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because he had been
training for far more than a chaos cycle, his master and the Starlord
didn’t force him to go out and adventure, allowing him to live his
low-key life on Fogstone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Beating him wouldn’t
be easy.” Imperius watched as Ning continued to battle against
World God Blackmist. “All of you are underestimating him. When
World God Blackmist first used an incarnation to fight, his
sword-arts were actually incredibly powerful. Despite that, he still
wasn’t able to do anything to Darknorth. World God Blackmist has
now used his Sword World, but Darknorth is still able to keep
fighting. Although World God Blackmist is taking it easy on him,
Darknorth’s defensive sword-arts truly have reached a terrifying
level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s too stable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His defense is
airtight and completely flawless. The other five generals each have
their own special techniques, but when faced with Darknorth’s
airtight defense…eventually, all of them will be defeated. Even I
am not confident in being able to defeat him,” Ancestral Immortal
Imperius said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Completely
flawless?” The other disciples, all of whom worshipped their eldest
apprentice-brother, were all shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given how terrifying
his sword-arts are…if he was to acquire a Dao sword…” Ancestarl
Immortal Imperius shook his head. “That would make him truly
dangerous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” All of
the other disciples nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Darknorth was already
incredibly powerful and an expert of the Dao of the Sword. If he had
a Dao sword as well…how deadly would he become?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s ‘Heartsword
Realm’ was a technique allowing him absolute control over himself
and his sword. Even those more powerful than him would find it
difficult to break his sword stances, unless the difference in power
was truly enormous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Nameless]
sword-art was simply too formidable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even someone like World
God Northrest, who had access to the resources of the mighty
Vastheaven Palace, had been smitten by this sword-art. And even to
the very day of his death, he had still been far from completely
mastering the entire [Nameless] sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Blackmist
ceased his attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there, his
face covered with sweat. His eyes, however, were blazing with
excitement. He had been mentally exhausted just now, but he didn’t
care at all. This was his first time fighting against such a
formidable master of the Dao of the Sword; Ning naturally valued and
cherished this opportunity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, senior,”
Ning said gratefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning truly was
extremely grateful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had been a long
battle. At first, his sword-arts had continuously improved, but
towards the end he was unable to improve any further. He had already
made full use of all the insights and experiences he had gained
during six thousand years of meditation in the Three Realms. No rate
of explosive could be maintained forever. Clearly, the insights Ning
had gained in recent years weren’t enough to allow him to truly
master the ‘Killsword stance’ just yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, he now
comprehended the majority of the ‘Killsword stance’. The parts he
had yet to comprehend were the hardest parts…but of course, the
power of Ning’s sword-arts had increased significantly as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s rare to
encounter someone on Fogstone who understands the Dao of the Sword.
You can come seek me out whenever you wish,” World God Blackmist
said with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
was overjoyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Blackmist had
said ‘whenever you wish’, Ning wouldn’t be so foolish as to
actually seek him out all the time. When training in the sword, one
had to have both insights and actual combat experience! Only when he
had enough insights would he seek Blackmist out for another duel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Based on how quickly
I’m improving…I should be able to master the second stance in
about ten thousand years.” Ning mused to himself, “If I use the
Heavengazer Tower, it should only take me a few centuries.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If it wasn’t for
World God Blackmist, Ning would probably need a hundred times as much
time in order to succeed. In fact, it was entirely possible that Ning
would encounter a bottleneck that would stymie him, no matter how
hard he tried to breach it. With a capable teacher providing
guidance, he would be able to easily make his way past those
bottlenecks. A good teacher could make a tremendous difference.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.” The
Starlord of Fogstone spoke out as Immortal Abyssus and World God
Blackmist both looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Starlord.” Ning
looked at him respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are quite strong
indeed. Fogstone has a total of five generals. As of today, you are
now the sixth.” The Starlord smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was slightly
startled. ‘General’ was an important rank; not only did one have
to be powerful, one generally also needed to have rendered
accomplishments for the organization.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,” Ning
hurriedly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since you are a
general, we won’t place too many restrictions on you,” the
Starlord said with a smile. “If my guess is correct, you probably
haven’t been training for too long.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. Since you’ve
only trained for a short period of time, I imagine you are definitely
working hard to try and break through to the World-level.” The
Starlord continued, “That means in the future, you’ll go out
adventuring. This is the lifeblood oath I need you to make in order
to join the Fogstone Army. It is a fairly loose one.” As he spoke,
he waved his hand, causing a scroll to fly down towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning accepted the
scroll. Anyone who wished to join an organization would have to swear
a lifeblood oath. However, if one merely joined as a ‘guest
retainer’, the terms of the lifeblood oath would generally be much
looser.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced through
the scroll. Indeed, this lifeblood oath was a fairly relaxed one. It
placed almost negligible constraints on Ning, only requiring him to
be loyal to Fogstone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Starlord,” Ning
said respectfully. “Can we make a slight alteration to this oath?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alteration?” The
Starlord frowned. This oath was already an extremely loose one. “What
part needs altering?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the future, my
journeys will most likely take me beyond the Badlands Territory,”
Ning said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave the Badlands?”
The three World-level experts were all puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Badlands Territory
was a vast place with many World-level experts. A territory of this
size was more than large enough for an Elder God or Ancestral
Immortal to adventure through.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t have a
choice. I’m bound by another lifeblood oath. In the future, I’ll
definitely have to leave the Badlands Territory and seek out a place
known as Vastheaven Palace.” Ning immediately asked, “Might I ask
the three of you, seniors, if you know where Vastheaven Palace is?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no need for
him to hide the fact that he had to seek out Vastheaven Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These three World-level
figures were all much more experienced than him. Perhaps they might
know where Vastheaven Palace lay.

Chapter 12 - Sentinel
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Blackmist,
Chaos Immortal Abyssus, and the Starlord of Fogstone were all
slightly startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Vastheaven Palace?”
The Starlord glanced towards the other two, puzzled. “I haven’t
gone to many places, just the Badlands Territory, the Cicada
Territory, and three other territories. You two have been to many
more places.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve never heard
of it either.” World God Blackmist shook his head. “Abyssus,
you’ve journeyed through the primordial chaos for quite some time.
Have you heard of Vastheaven Palace?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos Immortal Abyssus
glanced downwards dubiously. “Elder God Darknorth, what is this
Vastheaven Palace? Is it a region, the name of a palace, or an
organization?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An organization. It
should be quite a powerful one,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haven’t heard of
it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Abyssus was rather
puzzled. “I’ve spent countless years traveling in the territories
surrounding the Badlands as well as quite a few distant territories.
I’ve been to many places and collected many star maps, but I’ve
never heard of an organization known as Vastheaven Palace!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The other
World-level members of Fogstone have been to far fewer places than
Abyssus has. If not even Abyssus has heard of this place, it must be
located extremely far away or in a very remote area. In fact, it
could’ve been wiped out many chaos cycles ago,” the Starlord
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A chill entered Ning’s
heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Northrest,
what did you do? You ran around in such a crazy manner that even a
sword like Violetjewel was nearly destroyed, ending up in a place you
didn’t recognize.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was going to be
even harder than he thought!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Northrest had
never heard of the Badlands Territory, while the Starlord of
Fogstone, World God Blackmist, and Immortal Abyssus had never heard
of Vastheaven Palace! It must be understood that Vastheaven Palace
controlled the entire Vastheaven Territory, which meant that it
should be a fairly famous organization. And yet, even someone like
Immortal Abyssus who had journeyed through many territories had never
heard of the place. From this, one could imagine just how far the
Badlands Territory was from the Vastheaven Territory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Will I be able to
find it within a single chaos cycle?” Ning began to worry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll help you ask
the other World-level experts about Vastheaven Palace. I’ll also
ask my friends if any of them have heard of it,” the Starlord said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you,
Starlord.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord gazed
downwards at Ning, then shook his head and laughed. “That’s all I
can really do. However…if not even Immortal Abyssus has heard of
the place, it’s unlikely that any of my friends would have heard of
it. Mm, right. Yes, we can make a slight alteration to the lifeblood
oath you need to swear in order to join the Fogstone Army.” As he
spoke, he pointed at the scroll. A twinkling little sparkle of star
light instantly descended, covering the scroll in Ning’s hands and
changing its contents.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you think?”
The Starlord asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning lowered his head
to look at it. There were now even fewer restrictions than before,
and once he became a World God there would be virtually no
restrictions on him whatsoever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you are willing
to accept this, you can swear the lifeblood oath now,” the Starlord
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” Ning said
respectfully, scroll in hand. This scroll effectively acted as an
oathstone on its own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I swear on my very
life itself…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From this day forth,
Ning was now a formal member of Fogstone. Even if trillions of years
passed and he became far more powerful than he was now, he would
still be a member of Fogstone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Ning swore the
lifeblood oath, the gazes of the Starlord, World God Blackmist, and
Immortal Abyssus all turned warmer as they looked at him. They were
now on the same boat, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Per our usual rules,
you should be bestowed with some treasures and techniques now that
you have joined the Fogstone Army,” the Starlord said. “In a
short while, I’ll arrange for Fushe lead you to the treasury and
get your things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, be aware
that Fogstone has many cultivators; we can’t just give you all of
our treasures,” the Starlord said. “Thus, if you wish to acquire
more than just the base package, you’ll have to render merits to
the organization. Would you prefer to remain here on Fogstone, or
would you prefer to venture outside and do battle on our behalf?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m willing to go
out and do battle,” Ning said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord smiled and
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Starlord,” Ning
immediately said, “I’d like to ask you a question. How many
people in the Badlands Territory know the ‘Blacklotus Guard’
technique, are Heartforce Cultivators, and are at least at the
supreme Elder God level of power?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ‘Blacklotus
Guard’ is one of the consummate techniques of God Emperor
Blacklotus. He will never teach it to an outsider, much like how we
won’t teach outsiders our truly supreme skills either. Only the
less important techniques will be transmitted to others.” The
Starlord of Fogstone chuckled. “A Heartforce Cultivator who knows
the ‘Blacklotus Guard’ and is at least a supreme Elder God…the
only one who fulfills all of these requirements is one of his Nine
Divine Generals, the Mindlord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Does the Mindlord
have a Primaltwin?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He did.” The
Starlord nodded. “Based on what I know, the Mindlord’s Primaltwin
headed off to the Earthdrake area roughly a chaos cycle and ended up
dying there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled. The
Earthdrake area? Wasn’t that the area he was from? Died a chaos
cycle ago? Wasn’t Old Man Yuan possessed during the Primordial Era?
There couldn’t be that many coincidences.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So it really is the
Mindlord.” A flicker of a killing intent appeared in Ning’s eyes.
It made sense. He had the feeling that Godfiend Witherspike was
telling the truth. As an extremely powerful cultivator who was
skilled in heartforce, he was generally able to tell when others were
lying to him or not. Perhaps true Heartforce Cultivators like Old Man
Yuan would be able to deceive him, but people like Witherspike didn’t
have skills in this area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have a feud with
the Mindlord?” The Starlord of Fogstone asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I do,” Ning said
respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh…” The
Starlord pondered a moment, then said, “How about this? Of the
chaosworlds under my command, the Windsource Chaosworld lies closest
to God Emperor Blacklotus’ domain. Combat occurs quite often there,
which is why we have more than three hundred Elder Gods and Ancestral
Immortals stationed there permanently. You can go to the Windsource
Chaosworld.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We already have a
leader for our forces there,” World God Blackmist said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord waved his
hand, manifesting an insignia that glimmered with starlight. He
tossed the insignia to Ning, who hurriedly reached out to catch it.
The insignia had the word ‘Sentinel’ on it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the Sentinel
insignia,” the Starlord said. “From this day forth, you are my
designated Sentinel. When you reach the Windsource Chaosworld, you
will be my representative. All the cultivators of the Windsource
Chaosworld will obey your commands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” Ning said
respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Also, I’ll send
the word and make sure that the news of your arrival is kept quiet,”
the Starlord said. “You’ve just joined us a short while ago; very
few people know of your presence. I imagine that God Emperor
Blacklotus and his forces don’t even know about you yet. Their
ignorance of your allegiance to us will make it easier for you to
strike out against them and take revenge. The Nine Divine Generals of
God Emperor Blacklotus often travel to the Windsource Chaosworld.
You’ll definitely find a chance to fight the Mindlord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you,
Starlord.” Ning was overjoyed. This was a perfect arrangement. To
be the Starlord’s Sentinel was quite a lofty position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful.” World
God Blackmist instructed, “The armies of God Emperor Blacklotus
aren’t so easily dealt with.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning was
still filled with eagerness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-arts were meant
for battle. Only in battle would his sword-arts be tempered and
improved! Ning’s [Nameless] sword-art in particular needed both
time and actual combat experience.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fushe, go ahead and
lead Darknorth to the treasury. After he has his items, he can
immediately head off towards the Windsource Chaosworld,” the
Starlord instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” Island
Master Fushe said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Fushe then
departed the hall together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you think?”
The Starlord looked towards the other two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An excellent
choice.” Immortal Abyssus chuckled. “We’re lucky to have such a
formidable expert in the Dao of the Sword join us. My guess is that
this Darknorth holds an enormous grudge against the Mindlord, which
is the reason why he decided to join Fogstone to begin with.
Otherwise, given his sword-arts he could have easily joined any
organization aside from the Badlands Court.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s why I
arranged for him to be in the Windsource Chaosworld,” the Starlord
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The border regions
between two major organizations served as a meat grinder. Elder Gods
and Ancestral Immortals often died there. As far as both sides were
concerned, the border regions were a good place for the cultivators
of both sides to gain experience through life-and-death battles. Only
then would they be able to grow more quickly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
brother Darknorth. You are now our sixth general.” Island Master
Fushe flew alongside Ning as they left the Abyssus Palace. “When
you go to the Windsource Chaosworld as the Starlord’s Sentinel,
you’ll be the undisputed leader of our forces there. Being the
leader of a chaosworld is quite an excellent position. All of the
cultivators in the Windsource Chaosworld will try to curry favor with
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Curry favor with
me?” Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course. You will
be guarding the place as the Starlord’s representative. You can
easily cause problems for any of them. They wouldn’t dare to NOT
curry favor with you.” Fushe laughed. “Look, the Starlord’s
estate is over there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned to look,
only to see an enormous, city-sized estate appear in the distance.
The estate was surrounded by countless sparks of star light, as
though it was the very center of the entire planet of Fogstone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ordinary Elder God
soldiers might exhaust themselves for an entire chaos cycle without
being able to acquire the treasures and techniques you are about to
get.” Fushe had a look of envy on his face as he led Ning into the
Starlord’s estate.

Chapter 13 - Statues
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord’s estate
was tens of thousands of kilometers in size. It was filled with
countless edifices and emanated an aura of supreme power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What are…?” Upon
entering the estate, Ji Ning immediately stared off into the distance
in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as he had
entered, the first things he saw were those grayish-white statues,
all shaped like humanoids. There was a statue of a dominating man
whose hair was flying about, a statue of an icy, beautiful woman, a
statue of a crazy old man who was roaring with laughter, a statue of
a youth who was filled with a murderous aura…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single statue
seemed to be almost alive. However, they were clearly just lifeless
stone sculptures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What are those?”
Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those are all
World-level experts.” Upon seeing those distant statues, a
complicated look entered Fushe’s eyes. He said softly, “Deceased
World-level experts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Deceased?” Ning
instantly understood. “So when World-level experts of Fogstone die,
they are memorialized here in the form of stone sculptures?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Island Master Fushe
slowly shook his head. “These are their corpses!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Corpses?” Ning was
stunned. He turned his head to stare at the statues once more. There
were dozens of them, and all of them were completely lifeless. They
had no aura of life, divine power, or Immortal energy. It must be
understood that even the corpse of an ordinary Fiendgod would radiate
an aura of divine power. If a Chaos Immortal was to die, his corpse
would continue to emanate an aura of extraordinary power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But these stone
statues…Ning couldn’t see anything special about them at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are all the
World Gods of Fogstone who have died since time immemorial,” Fushe
said softly. “They all used the [Fogstone Apocalypse] divine
ability to fight against their foes, then perished in battle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Fogstone
Apocalypse]?” Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fogstone’s lineage
is an ancient one, even more ancient than the lineage of the Badlands
Court, the most powerful organization in the Badlands Territory.
Although the Badlands Court is more powerful, Fogstone actually ranks
as one of the three oldest lineages of the Badlands Territory and is
far older than the Badlands Court. Actually, there are many
organizations in the Badlands Territory which are older than the
Badlands Court, but quite a few of them were wiped out. In the end,
power is what matters. The Badlands Court was established by Daolord
Badlands; it naturally is the ruler of the entire Badlands
Territory.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Island Master Fushe
continued, “The most powerful divine ability the Fogstone lineage
possesses is the [Fogstone Apocalypse] technique. Only Fiendgod Body
Refiners can train in it, and only World Gods can fully master it.
This divine ability is never taught to outsiders.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning had
purchased a star map and learned a bit of information about the
region, the star map had included very little information about the
truly peerless techniques which existed here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When you use this
divine ability, your body will slowly transform into fogstone. If you
completely master it and use it, your entire body will become
transformed into fogstone.” Fushe shook his head. “During the
petrification process, you will become terrifyingly powerful…but
there’s always a catch. If you run out of divine power after you
complete the transformation process, you will transform into a
fogstone statue and perish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” Ning was
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This will only
happen to the World Gods of Fogstone in the most dire of situations.
Generally speaking, if you halt the divine ability once your divine
power begins to run low, you’ll be able to stay alive. These World
Gods all died in battle,” Fushe said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
stone statues.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were all World
Gods who had died countless years ago…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had been forced
into dire situations where they had no choice but to go all out. Some
of the World Gods died laughing, some died while furious, and some
died calmly. This truly stunned Ning. It reminded him that the path
of cultivation was one which was filled with countless dangers which
could fell even a World God. World God Northrest was another classic
example.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,” Fushe
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning bowed
respectfully towards the statues, then followed behind Fushe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first thing Ning
acquired was a suit of armor. As the sixth general of the Fogstone
Army, Ning was given a suit of top-grade Chaos armor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are the
abridged jade slips which hold information about the many techniques
Fogstone has to offer.” A series of jade slips floated out from the
deep recesses of a dark hall. There were thousands of them, and all
of them glowed with light. “The dimmer ones are the more ordinary
techniques, while the brighter ones hold the elite techniques. As for
the brightest slips, they hold the consummate techniques that cannot
be taught to outsiders.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there within
the dark room, staring at the levitating jade slips. There were only
twelve of the brightest jade slips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The consummate
techniques that cannot be taught to outsiders can only be learned by
the generals of the Fogstone Army, as well as the personal disciples
of our World Gods,” Fushe said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately sent
his coresense forward, scanning those twelve jade slips with it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was immediately
shocked by what he found.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fogstone truly had a
deep foundation! Of the twelve jade slips, three were sword-arts…and
all three were extraordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most powerful was
the [Illusory Starsword] technique. It had a total of nine stances,
and by training to the fifth stance one would reach the Sword World
stage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although it is quite
formidable, it’s still a bit lacking compared to my [Nameless]
sword-art. The [Nameless] sword-art is even more profound and
exquisite.” Ning was an expert of the Dao of the Sword; naturally,
he was able to tell which was better and which was worse. The
[Nameless] sword-art’s creator had to be at an incredibly,
incredibly high level of mastery. This was why even his first stance,
the ‘Heartsword stance’, was so profound as to allow cultivators
to completely and fully control each stroke of the sword. The further
one delved into the [Nameless] sword-art, the more profound it
became.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for other
sword-arts, they might be quite powerful as well, but their visions
and their intents were more limited in scope, making them inferior.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll continue to
focus on the [Nameless] sword-art.” Ning actually ignored all three
of these sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[World of Dust],
[Eternal Demonheart], [Violet Smoke Diagram], [Fogstone Apocalypse]…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These divine abilities
and secret arts all made Ning sigh in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Incredible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Simply incredible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Northrest was
a member of Vastheaven Palace, but he was unable to transfer its most
consummate skills to Ji Ning. All the skills he had given Ning were
the ones which he himself had acquired through his dangerous
adventures. The [Nameless] sword-art and the [Golden Statue] divine
ability were two extremely formidable techniques, but the rest of the
techniques he had handed over were somewhat weaker. As for the
consummate arts of Fogstone, they were superior to all but the
[Nameless] sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The partial scroll of
the [World of Dust] was a good example. This was a technique for
devising seals and tags of tremendous power. Although the scroll was
incomplete, Ning could sense from the abridged version of jade slip
that this technique should be on the same level as the [Nameless]
sword-art. Unfortunately, it was incomplete. According to the
records, no one was even able to gain a basic level of expertise in
it; it was nothing more than an incomplete, fragmentary record of a
seal-devising technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning’s
[Nameless] sword-art was also incomplete, at least the first stance
through seventh stance were included in their entirety. Even World
God Northrest had been able to train to the fifth stance, which
proved that the [Nameless] sword-art was something which Ning could
train in for a long, long period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Fogstone
Apocalypse…what a powerful divine ability.” Ning sighed in
amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Fogstone
Apocalypse] technique was divided into three stages.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first stage allowed
minor parts of the body to transform into fogstone, such as the hair.
The transformation was a fairly minute one, but it still allowed
one’s divine power to increase dramatically in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second stage
allowed for large-scale transformation of the body, allowing even the
bones to transform into fogstone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the third stage,
it completely transformed the entire body into fogstone, giving one a
perfect fogstone body. When a World God’s body was completely
transformed into fogstone, his body would become as tough and as
resilient as a Dao weapon. A body like this was capable of
withstanding tremendously powerful explosions of divine power. The
[Starseizing Hand] only allowed the hands to withstand such
tremendous power; the [Fogstone Apocalypse] allowed every single part
of the body to burst with absolutely inconceivable might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first stage alone
was already comparable to the Sixth Cycle of the [Starseizing Hand].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Choose wisely,”
Island Master Fushe said “You are a general. You may choose either
ten of the more ordinary techniques, one of the elite techniques, or
part of the consummate techniques.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The consummate
techniques would not be taught in their entirety at once.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning carefully went
through the jade slips. A long while later, he made his decision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I choose this, the
[Fogstone Apocalypse],” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?” Fushe was
rather surprised. He had actually told Ning about the fogstone
statues earlier, after all. He couldn’t help but ask, “Are you
sure?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This divine ability was
extremely powerful. The second stage of it was comparable to a
theoretical Seventh Cycle of the [Starseizing Hand], which Ning
hadn’t even been able to develop yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had chosen this
divine ability for two reasons. He wanted to train in it, but he also
wanted to analyze it and use its mysteries to help him in his quest
to develop the Seventh Cycle of the [Starseizing Hand]. After that,
Ning would want to develop an Eighth Cycle and perhaps even a Ninth
Cycle!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
Ning received the full jade slip. Within this jade slip was recorded
the first part of the [Fogstone Apocalypse] technique. The first part
included just the first stage and the second stage, which could both
be used by Elder Gods. Only World Gods could train in the third
stage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Fushe, I’ve
been given orders by the Starlord. I’ll head out towards the
Windsource Chaosworld right away.” Outside the Starlord’s estate,
Ning was bidding Fushe farewell.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Windsource
Chaosworld is a place where we often clash with God Emperor
Blacklotus’ troops. Be careful, brother Darknorth,” Fushe said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, then
soared into the skies and headed towards the direction of the
Windsource Chaosworld.

Chapter 14 - Windsource Chaosworld
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Windsource
Chaosworld was an enormous, ellipsoid sphere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A boat flew into the
Windsource Chaosworld, carrying three cultivators within it. These
three cultivators didn’t disguise their auras in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why have the three
of you come to Windsource?” The air shimmered momentarily before a
black-robed Ancestral Immortal appeared. This Ancestral Immortal had
a pair of wings on his back and a white horn growing out of his
forehead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The three of us have
come here to scavenge for ancient relics.” All three of the
cultivators rose to their feet. They had powerful auras and were
either Elder Gods or first-tier Ancestral Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here are three
bottles of chaos nectar.” One of the three, a silver-haired
cultivator, waved his hand and sent three bottles of chaos nectar
over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed
Ancestral Immortal accepted the bottles, then said calmly, “Very
well. I trust the three of you understand that this is a border world
which lies between Fogstone and the Blacklotus Empire. Don’t get
caught up in our problems.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We understand,”
the three cultivators responded, then quickly departed on their boat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An old man whose body
was surrounded by waves of blood suddenly appeared next to the
black-robed Ancestral Immortal. The old man said with a smile,
“Whitehorn, was that another group of treasure hunters?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The
black-robed Ancestral Immortal waved his hand, revealing the three
bottles of chaos nectar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those ancient relic
sites have attracted quite a few Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals
over the years. We’ve collected so much chaos nectar that my hands
are starting to go limp.” The old man shook his head. “A pity
that we have to offer all of it up to our superiors. It’d be
wonderful if we could keep it for ourselves.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you think all of
those Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals would obediently hand over
those bottles if they were meant for you?” The black-robed
Ancestral Immortal smirked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Windsource
Chaosworld…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It wasn’t a
chaosworld that had been created through completely natural means.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Pangu Chaosworld
and the Seamless Chaosworld had started out as Worldhearts which gave
birth to Fiendgods. The strongest of the Fiendgods had established
the chaosworld, then perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Windsource
Chaosworld, however, had been artificially created by an ancient and
enormously powerful figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That ancient figure had
taken over nearly half of the chaosworld for his own use,
transforming it into his own Immortal estate. After he had died, his
Immortal estate had become a relic site.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The home of a powerful
cultivator, even a deceased one, was an extremely dangerous place.
The cultivator would have set down many layers of traps in order to
ensure that it would be difficult for anyone to invade. Thus, even
though this ancient figure had died, his estate remained filled with
layers of dangers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the techniques
and treasures which the deceased figure had left behind were also
powerful enough to drive countless cultivators wild.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Windsource Ruins
was an incredibly famous place. Even World Gods and Chaos Immortals
had lost their lives there. To this very day, the Windsource Ruins
was still filled with mysteries. However, the cultivators that
managed to survive it and come back with treasures ensured that there
would forever be a steady stream of fortune seekers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Want to try your luck?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No problem. Just pay
the entrance fee!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When using a spacetime
transfer array, you had to pay a bottle of chaos nectar. This relic
site belonged to Fogstone, and so if one wished to visit it one would
have to pay the fee. World Gods and Chaos Immortals naturally didn’t
have to pay anything, but Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals did.
Otherwise, they would be surrounded and attacked by the Fogstone
Army, which would be a rather miserable ending.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most profitable
enterprise in the Badlands Territory lay in operating spacetime
transfer arrays, but all twenty-one of them had been taken over by
the Badlands Court! The other powers could do nothing besides envy
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Has the Sentinel
arrived yet?” A muscular goldscale Fiendgod suddenly appeared next
to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not yet.” The
black-robed Ancestral Immortal shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve been
watching for him this entire time.” The old man surrounded by
bloody waves was a bit worried. “I wonder what sort of a
personality this Sentinel has. Whitehorn and I have been managing the
Windsource Chaosworld for several chaos cycles. I hope this new
Sentinel won’t rip us off too badly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Windsource
Chaosworld was a world which had been established by an ancient
power. Naturally occurring chaosworlds were only able to survive for
a single chaos cycle before they would decay and then be reborn. The
Windsource Chaosworld was protected by the Windsource Ruins within it
and thus had been able to exist for an extremely long period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard that this
Sentinel is a new general.” The goldscale Fiendgod lowered his
voice. “Our Fogstone Army only had a total of five generals, with
him becoming the sixth. I’ve never met this guy either. I have no
idea what he is like. Keep praying, you two.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The other
two both felt rather nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sentinels were
responsible for overseeing certain region. They were given tremendous
amounts of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as the three of
them were discussing this new Sentinel…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A tear suddenly
appeared in the skies on the opposite end of the Windsource
Chaosworld. A streak of light flew out from the tear, then came to a
halt. It was Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? Something just
happened.” The black-robed Ancestral Immortal, the old man, and the
goldscale Fiendgod all hurried over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As they teleported
over, they saw a white-robed youth appear in midair, staring
downwards towards this vast chaosworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He looks identical
to the painting we were given.” The three of them didn’t hesitate
at all, immediately flying over towards Ning. The black-robed
Ancestral Immortal immediately asked, “Are you the new Sentinel?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
producing an insignia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The insignia emitted a
wave of overwhelming power that had an aura identical to that of the
Starlord’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We bow in greetings
to you, Sentinel.” The three of them hurriedly called out
respectfully to Ning. There was no way the Sentinel insignia could be
counterfeited, and once the Starlord gave it to Ji Ning, he would
become the only person capable of using it. No other Elder Gods or
Ancestral Immortals would be able to use it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning nodded.
“The three of you are…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m Whitehorn.
He’s Bloodsea. The two of us are responsible for managing all
affairs of the Windsource Chaosworld, great or small.” The
black-robed Ancestral Immortal hurriedly answered the question.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am Elder God
Mountain Eater.” The goldscale soldier was incredibly muscular, but
he had a simple, honest look in his eyes. He said in a low voice,
“The 321 Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals stationed in the
Windsource Chaosworld all obey my commands. Per the Starlord, from
this day forth I shall obey the Sentinel’s commands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled and nodded.
Given how many chaosworlds the Starlord commanded, it only made sense
that he had designated certain individuals to manage them. Generally
speaking, he would arrange for two Elder Gods or Ancestral Immortals
to watch over each chaosworld as well as each other. In addition, the
Starlord would also occasionally send out a Sentinel to oversee
certain areas and ensure that the local managers weren’t plundering
the worlds they were supposed to oversee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Windsource
Chaosworld was under the management of Ancestral Immortal Whitehorn
and Elder God Bloodsea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The three of you can
simply refer to me as Sword Immortal Sunrise,” Ning said. Since the
Starlord was helping him to disguise his identity, Ning naturally was
going to use a false name as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword Immortal
Sunrise,” the three called out respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is the
Fogstone Army stationed? Take me there,” Ning instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right over there.”
Elder God Mountain Eater pointed at a distant chain of mountains. “We
all live there in the Eastcalm Mountains.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The mountain range
stretched out for thousands of kilometers. The Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals had all chosen mountain peaks that they liked,
then settled down on their respective peaks. The distance between the
mountain peaks was negligible to them; once battle began, they would
be able to almost instantly gather together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning nodded
and smiled. “Then I will live there as well. Brother Mountain
Eater, overseeing the Windsource Chaosworld is just a minor part of
my duties. The real reason I’ve come here is to battle against the
Blacklotus Empire by your side.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With you by our
side, general, our victory is assured.” Elder God Mountain Eater
chortled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard that the
Windsource Ruins here are quite famous.” Ning turned his head to
glance at the Bloodsea and Whitehorn. “Do you have any reports on
the Windsource Ruins which you can share with me? If you do, give me
a copy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We do.” The
black-robed Ancestral Immortal immediately waved his hand, producing
a jade slip which he respectfully offered to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. Very well then,
that’s all I need from you. Go do whatever you need to do,” Ning
instructed. “Just keep cooperating with the Fogstone Army. If
there’s nothing urgent, no need to come speak to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.”
“Understood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both Whitehorn and
Bloodsea assented respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You may leave,”
Ning said. Only then did the two depart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He let us leave,
just like that?” Elder God Bloodsea murmured in a soft voice,
“Whitehorn, I thought we’d have to offer him some of our
treasures. I even prepared mine already.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know, right? This
Sentinel is a general; he definitely has very high standards. I was
really worried about this. I never would’ve thought he’d let us
leave, just like that.” The black-robed Ancestral Immortal let out
a sigh of relief as well. “It sounds like he doesn’t really want
us to bother him unless there’s something urgent. It seems as
though this one really isn’t planning on extorting treasures out of
us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Bloodsea
felt jubilant as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“General, all you had
to do was say the word and they would’ve offered up their treasures
like good little boys.” Elder God Mountain Eater grinned at Ning.
“Managing a place like the Windsource Chaosworld is a wonderful
assignment. Not just any Elder God will be assigned here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head.
Given how powerful he now was, why would he need to extort his
subordinates?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned his head to
stare at the distant Eastcalm Mountains. For a long period of time,
perhaps ten thousand years or even longer, he would be living in this
place.

Chapter 15 - Adventurers
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The day after Ji Ning
arrived at the Windsource Chaosworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning alighted upon an
ordinary-looking planet in the midst of the primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This planet is
perfectly ordinary. There are trillions of planets like this one in
the primordial chaos.” Ning nodded slowly. “Ordinary is perfect.
I’ll put the prisonworld right here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
causing a stone stele to sink down into an unfathomably deep crevice.
It fell tens of thousands of kilometers, then sank deep within a dark
underground river that carried it deeper into the earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was going to
adventure through the Badlands Territory and perhaps even leave it
one day. Something dangerous might happen. He had to have a backup
plan that would ensure that he would have the chance to recover! The
backup clone for his true body would remain here. Even if he lost his
true body, his clone would be able to eventually recover and rebuild.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, according
to the legends, there are some terrifyingly powerful secret arts that
can simultaneously slay all of a person’s clones at once.” Ning
was still quite wary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lifeblood oath was
one example. If one violated a lifeblood oath, one’s true body,
Primaltwin, and clones would all be devoured and killed by it! This
was because the true body and the Primaltwin were linked together in
a very special manner that the lifeblood oath could access.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the endless
primordial chaos, there were supposedly certain terrifying figures
who could use special secret arts to achieve the exact same effect,
killing all the clones belonging to one’s true body or Primaltwin!
It didn’t matter how many clones you had; you would still die!
This, too, was part of the information which World God Northrest had
left behind for Ning. However, these powerful secret arts were
extremely difficult to train in and also incredibly rare. Less than
one in ten thousand World-level experts was capable of such a
technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals? The vast majority weren’t even aware that such
techniques existed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even though I’ll
have a clone here, I still need to be careful,” Ning reminded
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning flew away from
this planet. This planet was quite far away from the Windsource
Chaosworld, and Ning had to spend more than half a day before he
could finish teleporting back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Windsource
Chaosworld. The Eastcalm Mountains. The Sunrise Courtyard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a quiet,
peaceful, ordinary-looking little courtyard. This was the place where
Ning would live.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A streak of light flew
in from afar, alighting within the courtyard. It was Ji Ning, who had
just returned from that distant, desolate planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“General.” A voice
rang out from outside the courtyard gates.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced towards
the gates, then smiled. “Come in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gates were pushed
open and three goldscale soldiers walked in from outside. These three
were all goldscale captains of the Fogstone Army. The leader of the
three was Elder God Mountain Eater, who Ning had met the previous
day. Next to him was an alluringly beautiful woman who had a bushy,
snowy-white tail, and a jade-haired man who emanated a freezing aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“General, you headed
out early in the morning. These two didn’t have a chance to come
pay their respects to you,” Elder God Mountain Eater said with as
mile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So these are the
other two captains?” Ning looked at the other two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mountain Eater quickly
made the introductions. “This one here is Immortal Soulflight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, General.”
The alluring female goldscale captain who had a bushy white tail
spoke out, her voice tinged with mesmerizing charm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And this is Elder
God Tearwell.” Mountain Eater then introduced the icy-looking
jade-haired man next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, General.”
Elder God Tearwell was quite respectful as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The three
hundred-plus Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals stationed here at the
Windsource Chaosworld are usually divided up into three squads. The
three of us are the captains of the squads, with the Starlord having
originally assigned me to be the leader.” Mountain Eater continued,
“Now that you are here, General, we will of course obey your
commands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded and smiled.
“Soulflight, Tearwell, this is our first time meeting each other.
In the future, we’ll often be fighting by each other’s sides.
Please sit! Let’s chat while sitting down.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four seated
themselves around a wooden table within the courtyard. Ning waved his
hand, causing some fine wine to appear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m new here and
don’t have a good understanding of the situation between our forces
and the forces of the Blacklotus Empire. Tell me a bit about the
situation,”Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“General.” Immortal
Soulflight’s voice was very pleasing to the ear. “This is a
border world. The closest Blacklotus Empire border world would be the
Songbug Chaosworld. Sometimes, they’ll ambush us; sometimes, we’ll
ambush them. Generally speaking, the battles are kept fairly
small-scale. Large scale battles which involve hundreds of Elder Gods
and Ancestral Immortals are very rare.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning nodded
slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still, they usually
ambush us more than we ambush them.” Soulflight shook her head. “We
control the Windsource Chaosworld and its Windsource Ruins. Every
single unaffiliated Elder God or Ancestral Immortal has to pay us a
bottle of chaos nectar if they wish to test their luck. Over the
course of a chaos cycle, we will usually collect a cube of chaos
nectar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A cube of chaos nectar
represented a thousand bottles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a sum that
would make any World-level expert turn green with envy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s why the
Blacklotus Empire deeply desires to take over our Windsource
Chaosworld and why they launch repeated ambushes against us. However,
we’ve long ago set up many layers of formations around the Eastcalm
Mountains. This chaosworld is our territory. When they try to ambush
us, they usually end up suffering more losses than we do.”
Soulflight continued, “When all of our Elder Gods and Ancestral
Immortals join forces, we can hold off even an enemy World God. Thus,
the Blacklotus Empire has never been able to do anything to us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning
understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Blacklotus Empire
lusted after the Windsource Chaosworld, but they would most likely
need to mobilize their World Gods if they wanted to actually take it
over. But once their World-level experts made a move, the war would
instantly escalate to a dramatically different level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fogstone had a long
history, deep roots, and more World-level experts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Blacklotus Empire
didn’t dare to launch a large-scale war against such a powerful
organization without a very good reason. That’s why the conflicts
between the two were usually contained to the Elder God and Ancestral
Immortal level. In truth, these ‘conflicts’ were primarily meant
to help train and temper their subordinates, as only through engaging
in life-and-death battles would they be able to grow and improve.
Almost none of the Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals stationed here
had been alive for more than a chaos cycle. But of course, the
Blacklotus Empire probably also hoped that they might eventually get
lucky and successfully take over the Windsource Chaosworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chatted with three
captains for a long period of time, gaining a general understanding
of the disposition of the three.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Elder God Mountain
Eater looked like a violent hulking brute, but he was actually a very
steady figure. This was probably the reason why the Starlord of
Fogstone had ordered the others to follow his lead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ancestral Immortal
Soulflight was a very excitable individual. Each time the
conversation turned to warfare and combat, her eyes would gleam with
excitement. She was most likely the type that loved to fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Elder God
Tearwell, he was a taciturn man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time continued to flow
on. More than a hundred years had passed since Ning had arrived at
the Windsource Chaosworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why have you come to
the Windsource Chaosworld?” The black-robed Ancestral Immortal
appeared within the skies, staring towards a golden-robed man that
was sitting within a giant warship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cut the crap. I’m
here for the ruins.” The golden-robed man said lazily, “Take your
bottle of chaos nectar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He tossed out a bottle
of chaos nectar. The black-robed Ancestral Immortal caught the bottle
and frowned, but remained silent. These cultivators were willing to
pay the fee of a bottle of chaos nectar in order to avoid offending
Fogstone, but they wouldn’t necessarily be polite about it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Space rippled like a
curtain. Moments later, Ji Ning appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning glanced
at the golden-robed man within the large warship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, Sentinel.
He’s an adventurer,” the black-robed Ancestral Immortal said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Ning nodded.
This was his first time encountering an outsider during the century
he had spent here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-robed man on
the warship glanced sideways at Ning, then muttered softly to
himself, “Sentinel? Hmph.” He waved his hand, causing an entire
host of Immortals and Fiendgods to appear next to him, all of whom
had the auras of either Elder Gods or Ancestral Immortals. There had
to be over a hundred of them, and all of them were extremely
respectful, addressing the golden-robed man as ‘master’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” The
golden-robed man seemed quite relaxed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The great warship flew
off into the distance, disappearing in the horizons as it flew
towards the ruins.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually has that
many retainers?” Ning was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s a rather
famous figure amongst the Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals who go
out adventuring. His name is Elder God Skysouth. He’s a supreme
Elder God, but during one of his adventures he lucked into a large
trove of treasures. He used those treasures to purchase over a
hundred Elder God and Ancestral Immortal slaves.” The black-robed
Ancestral Immortal explained, “After buying all those slaves, he
then purchased an Elder God Formation! With that formation and with
those Elder Gods, he’s able to use his slaves to defend against
even a World-level expert for a brief period of time. That’s why he
is so arrogant and brash.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals enjoyed very long lives. They knew that if they
didn’t reach the World-level during their first chaos cycle, they
essentially would have no hope of ever reaching that level. Upon
realizing that they wouldn’t be able to make any more
breakthroughs, many of them would decide to go out ‘adventuring’
and exploring the ruins left behind by ancient powers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They loved to court
death, loved the feeling of adventure. A single successful expedition
could result in enormous rewards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Elder God Skysouth was
a classic example. Because of one enormously successful trip, he had
ended up being able to purchased over a hundred Elder Gods as well as
an Elder God Formation, becoming an often-discussed figure amongst
the adventuring cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s time I pay a
visit to the Windsource Ruins myself,” Ning mused to himself. On
the first day he had arrived, Ning had acquired a detailed report
regarding the Windsource Ruins from the black-robed Ancestral
Immortal. The Three Realms was a place that was somewhat lacking in
opportunities, but the Badlands Territory was a place with many
legacies left behind by ancient powers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had been countless
years, but the Windsource Ruins still had yet to be fully
investigated. Even World-level experts had died within it. Clearly,
the ancient power who had left behind the Windsource Ruins was
someone who surpassed World Gods in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given that Ning had a
clone located in the prisonworld, Ning definitely had to give this
place a good look.

Chapter 16 - Entering the Ruins
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three days later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this is the
Windsource Ruins?” Ji Ning stood atop a cloud, staring downwards at
the vast world before him. He saw an unfathomably large area that was
completely covered by clouds. It must be understood that the
Windsource Ruins was once the Immortal estate of that ancient power,
and as such it took over nearly half of the space of the entire
chaosworld. One could imagine how enormous it was!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning flew deep into the
cloud-shrouded world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could sense space
twisting around him. Suddenly, Ning’s legs went soft. Ning’s face
changed and he hurriedly try to fly back up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous bloody maw
suddenly appeared below him, delivering a fierce chomp towards him.
Fortunately, Ning was able to fly quite quickly and thus was able to
dodge the bite.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was actually
teleported straight towards the swamp.” Ning glanced downwards as
he continued to fly high up in the air. The region below him was an
incredibly vast swamp, and there was a mud-covered beast below him
that was staring straight at him. The creature had a savage look in
its eyes at it slowly crawled out from the muck, revealing a
lizard-like body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to my
records on the Windsource Ruins, as soon as you enter you’ll be
teleported to the swamp. It doesn’t matter where you enter from;
you’ll still be sent straight here. The swamp is filled with
countless bugs and beasts, some powerful and some weak. The weak ones
might be merely as powerful as a True God, while the most monstrously
powerful ones might be as powerful as a World God.” Ning glanced
downwards once more at the beast who was now tracking him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was normal for
powerful cultivators to rear bugbeasts within their estates.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ancient power who
had build this estate had intentionally created an enormous swamp
within it for the sake of rearing certain bugbeasts. In fact, he had
established a breeding loop that would ensure that the bugbeasts
would continue to kill and eat each other, becoming stronger and
stronger without him even needing to worry about them. Thus, even
though the estate’s owner had died countless years ago, there were
still a shocking number of bugbeasts in the swamp.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These bugbeasts were
reared for the purpose of becoming the guardians and protectors of
the estate. Thus, all outside invaders would suffer attacks from
these bugbeasts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Growl…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lizard-shaped
creature opened its mouth even wider as it suddenly soared into the
skies, its body coiling upwards for many hundreds of meters as it
‘crawled’ upwards through the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A dazzling streak of
sword-light slashed through the bugbeast’s army.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snick! The bugbeast’s
body was chopped into two halves. Blood sprayed everywhere as it
died, and as the blood came crashing back down to the swamp it kicked
up a few small muddy waves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Brightmoon] sword art,
Shadowless stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning held a Darknorth
in his hand, shrinking it from being three thousand meters in length
to merely three meters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are way too
many bugbeasts in the swamp. I need to get out of here.” Ning
immediately transformed into a black lightning serpent and began to
fly away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Windsource Ruins’
outermost region was the swamp region. Everyone had to start from the
swamp and work their way in if they wished to reach the other regions
of the ruins. Even Ning found it difficult to tell north from south
after he had entered the ruins. All he could do was just choose a
random direction and begin flying at maximum speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning could
sense some ripples of power from afar. He immediately began to
stealthily fly in that direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
Ning was able to see what was happening in the distance. There was a
desolate hill off in the distance, and atop the hill coiled a
two-headed serpent whose body was more than ten kilometers long. Its
head was raised as it stared upwards at an enormous winged scaly
monster that was right above it. Both creatures had auras of
tremendous power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have the feeling
that in raw strength alone, both have reached the World-level of
power. Still, they are fairly weak in terms of technique. It’d take
me a bit of effort to kill them, but it wouldn’t be too hard.”
Ning mused to himself, “I’ll wager these two are two of the
bosses of the swamp.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“GRWAAR!” The
two-headed serpent let out a thunderous roar as it suddenly charged
upwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the scaled
monster, it plunged downwards as it attacked as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire swamp seemed
to shake. Thankfully, spacetime in the Ruins was incredibly stable;
even if World-level experts fought here, they wouldn’t be able to
shatter it. If these two creatures were battling in the outside
world, they would probably cause entire chaosworlds to shatter in
their wake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that…?” Ning
suddenly saw a filthy looking boat appear in the distance. The boat
was filled with sabers, swords, suits of armor, pearls, banners, and
all sorts of other magic treasures that emanated powerful auras.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many treasures?
And almost all of them are Chaos treasures!” Ning was delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Over the course of
countless years, an equally countless number of Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals had died in the swamps. The bugbeasts weren’t
capable of using the treasures the slain cultivators had left behind,
and so the more powerful ones simply piled them together as spoils of
war!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suppressed his
aura and bent light around him, making it so that the bugbeasts
couldn’t see him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In order to
completely repair Violetjewel, I’ll need to acquire an enormous
amount of Five Elements essence. I have to get these treasures.”
Ning immediately came to this decision. “Ideally, these two
creatures will kill or maim each other.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the heads of the
two-headed serpent was seized by the sharp claws of the scaly
creature, but the other head had managed to latch its maw around the
scaly creature’s own head. The scaly creature struggled furiously,
beating its massive wings and causing waves of mud to kick up around
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The scaly
creature’s head suddenly exploded. Its aura began to grow weak and
its struggling wings slowly began to sink downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the two-headed
serpent’s heads had been completely crushed, but its remaining head
let out an excited roar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“GRWAAAR!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Its roars echoed in the
skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It then lowered its
head, beginning to dine on the flesh of the scaly creature. This was
how these bugbeasts lived; they would fight each other and consume
each other, constantly growing and transforming. As the serpent
continued to feed, its destroyed head began to slowly grow out anew.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A figure suddenly drew
close to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two-headed serpent
was enraged, and its undamaged head immediately turned to stare
angrily at the white-robed figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Its tail
suddenly moved, lashing out lightning-fast towards the offender.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heartsword Realm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light flashed.
The enormous tail was deflected towards one side, with the
sword-light itself stabbing straight towards the one remaining head
of the two-headed serpent. The enraged two-headed serpent opened its
giant maw, revealing a pair of crystalline fangs that glistened with
translucent venom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! The venom shot
out from its fangs as fast as lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! The sword-light
blurred, easily deflecting the stream of venom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stab! The sword-light
pierced straight through the two-headed serpent’s head. The
serpent’s body trembled, then slowly began to turn limp. As it fell
down into the swamp, it caused the surrounding mud to tremble
violently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Brightmoon] sword-art,
Blood Drop stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thankfully, this
bugbeast had already been heavily injured and had less than a third
of its maximum power. Otherwise, killing it wouldn’t have been so
easy.” A look of delight was on Ning’s face. The most dangerous
aspect to killing a bugbeast was the possibility of the bugbeast
summoning its kin! Once a bugbeast encountered a powerful invader
that it couldn’t defeat, it would often let out a loud cry to
summon more of its ilk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thankfully, the
two-headed serpent had been heavily injured and Ning had been very
fast. Ning hadn’t brought Violetjewel with him on this excursion to
the Windsource Ruins, as that was his most important treasure. If he
died within the Ruins…losing the other treasures didn’t matter,
but losing Violetjewel would be a tremendous blow. It simply wasn’t
worth the risk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Violetjewel was a sword
which even World Gods and Chaos Immortals would go crazy over. So
long as Ning had enough Five Elements essence, he would be able to
reforge Violetjewel and allow it to reveal its true power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The treasures.”
Ning immediately shot towards the distant hill. Next to that hill was
the large, muddy boat that was filled with treasures. Those were the
many treasures which the two-headed serpent had acquired over the
years. Some had come from slain cultivators while some had come from
slain bugbeasts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Twenty-one Chaos
treasures. Perhaps the storage treasures will also have fine items
within them.” Ning swept through the treasures with his heartforce,
then waved his hand and collected the entire boat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a streak of
light flew towards Ning from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned his head to
look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well, well. Isn’t
this our Sentinel? Ahaha! Hand over those treasures and I’ll spare
your life.” A golden-robed man was standing atop the warship, and
an entire host of Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals stood behind
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder God Skysouth?”
Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Elder God Skysouth had
over a hundred Elder God and Ancestral Immortal slaves, while Ning
had left Violetjewel behind. Dealing with him would be a bit tricky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Ruins, only part
of the dangers came from the traps and defenses left behind by that
ancient power. The other part came from the cultivators who might
strike out at you out of greed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hand over the
treasures!” Elder God Skysouth’s face turned cold as he stood
there at the front of his boat. “Otherwise, die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder God Skysouth.
I don’t wish to become enemies with you. The Windsource Ruins is a
large place. There’s no need for us to fight to the death over
these treasures,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fight to the death
with you? You?” Elder God Skysouth finally ran out of patience. He
barked coldly, “Kill him.”

Chapter 17 - Danger Zone
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Elder God Skysouth
issued the order, all of the Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals under
his command immediately began to attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Six streaks of light that moved faster than the limits of the
Heavenly Daos charged straight for Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee.” Ning didn’t
hesitate at all, immediately using the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent]
to evade.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chase!” All of the
Elder Gods charged straight after Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was powerful, but
when a hundred Elder Gods joined together into an Elder God
Formation, they would be able to hold off even a real World God for a
period of time. If Ning was surrounded by them, he would be unable to
escape! They would slowly grind him down, exhausting his reserve of
divine power and Immortal energy. Ning absolutely would not permit
himself to be surrounded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You won’t be able
to escape.” Elder God Skysouth laughed coldly. He had spent quite a
lot of money to purchase those two Ancestral Immortals who were
capable of controlling magic treasures faster than the limits of the
Heavenly Daos. They were generally responsible for briefly tying down
opponents, giving the rest of the Elder Gods enough time to charge
forward and trap them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These slaves made it so
that Elder God Skysouth was virtually invincible to anyone below the
World level of power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six streaks of
light chasing after Ning were six long shuttles. They clearly moved
even more quickly than Ning, and they soon intercepted him and moved
to block him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“F*ck off.” Ning
unleashed his full power, using [Three Heads, Six Arms] and wielding
six swords simultaneously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heartsword Realm!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six swords struck
out simultaneously!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Starseizing Hand]
was unleashed as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After spending a
hundred years training while living in the Windsource Chaosworld,
Ning had improved his sword-arts even more, resulting in his strikes
containing even greater power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six long shuttles
were all smashed away. Although Ning slightly slowed down for a brief
instant, in the next instant he immediately regained his normal speed
and continued to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” Elder God
Skysouth had been watching lazily from atop his warship, but in this
instant his face completely changed. “Those two Ancestral Immortals
are able to attack faster than the speed of light using their
treasures. He was able to instantly defeat them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The clash was simply
too brief. It was as though those six shuttles had instantly been
knocked away as soon as Ning had struck them…and thanks to his
half-step World God body and the [Starseizing Hand], Ning was able to
send them flying a very long distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hundred-plus Elder
Gods were much slower by comparison. They were only able to watch
helplessly as the white-robed youth continued to pull further and
further away from them before finally disappearing into the horizons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Elder God
Skysouth frowned, then let out a cold snort. “Fine. You run fast.
For your sake, you’d best hope you can keep running that fast the
next time I see you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,” he
ordered calmy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The Elder
Gods and Ancestral Immortals all returned to the warship, which then
quickly departed the scene as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced backwards,
then let out a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the future, I’ll
need to get a few Elder God and Ancestral Immortal servants of my
own,” Ning muttered to himself. There was a great difference in
power between Elder Gods and World Gods, but sometimes quantity could
make up for quality! When a hundred Elder Gods joined together into
an Elder God Formation, they would be able to withstand even a true
World God for an extended period of time. If a thousand of them
joined together into an Elder God Formation, they might very well be
capable of killing some of the weaker World Gods!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, it wouldn’t
be so easy for someone to acquire a thousand Elder Gods. The entire
Fogstone Army only held a few thousand Elder Gods and first-tier
Ancestral Immortals!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, the cost
of a thousand-man Elder God Formation would be even higher than the
cost of a thousand Elder Gods! Without the formation, the Elder Gods
would be nothing more than a pile of loose sand. Only through usage
of an Elder God Formation would they be able to join together into a
perfect whole.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to fly
forwards at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given how strong Ning
was, the swamp region of the Ruins didn’t pose much of a threat. So
long as he was careful and stayed far away from any powerful auras he
sensed, he would be fairly safe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah, there it is.”
Ning saw a chain of mountains appear off in the distance. “I’ve
reached another part of the Ruins.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The intelligence
report I received regarding the Windsource Ruins is now essentially
useless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was slightly
worried. The swamp was the outermost layer and also the
‘safest’region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other regions were
controlled by the restrictive formation spells of the Ruins and would
often change and transform. A place might be perfectly safe one day
but transform into a death trap the next day. That was why his
intelligence report was now of no use.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning landed atop a
mountain peak. Even he no longer dared to rashly fly about any
longer, for fear of accidentally flying into a death trap.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” As Ning
jogged forward, he suddenly turned his head to look off into the
distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A red-robed woman was
seated in the lotus position at the top of a mountain peak. The
woman’s face was delicate and beautiful, with eyes as gentle as the
waters of autumn. She was surrounded by hundreds of crescent blades
that were wreathed by fire, causing flames to billow out all around
her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a beautiful
woman.” Ning had very high standards, but even he couldn’t help
but let out a sigh of praise. “Beauty like this could cause the
collapse of an empire.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After glancing at her,
Ning continued to jog forwards, instantly traversing ten thousand
kilometers with each movement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-robed woman had
noticed Ning as well. She couldn’t help but murmur softly to
herself, “How odd. The [Libertine Dream] technique I devised
carries an aura of natural charm which is far superior to those more
blatant, forceful charm spells. And yet, he didn’t even pause to
say a word to me? Hasn’t he heard of me, the Flamefairy?” 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji, the
Flamefairy, was quite a famous figure amongst the Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals of the Badlands Territory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And why is he
running so quickly in a place as dangerous as this?” The
fiery-robed woman mumbled to herself, “I’ve always felt that I’m
pretty crazy, but he’s even crazier than me. If he keeps running
around that fast, he’ll probably explore more of this place in one
year than I would in ten thousand. Still, he’ll die faster than me
as well. I hope you are lucky enough to survive…it’s rare for me
to take a liking to someone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The swamp was the
outermost region. After exiting the swamps, one would enter the truly
dangerous regions. Generally speaking, most people would advance very
carefully through these regions and move at a glacially slow pace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, given that the
Windsource Ruins took up fully half of the Windsource Chaosworld, it
truly was incredibly vast. If you moved through it slowly, you could
spend a million years and still just explore a tiny part of it.
Still, since Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals generally had very
long lifespans, they wouldn’t be in a rush. Safety first!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, was
different.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not only did he have a
clone in the outside world, he also had mastered the ‘Heartsword
Realm’ technique and had tremendous control over his surroundings.
His skill empowered his boldness. In addition, he only trained for a
relatively brief period of time; how could he possibly be willing to
spend a few hundred thousand years here? He was planning to adventure
through this place for a few years at most, then leave. Of course he
had to move quickly!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s eyes
lit up as he saw a corpse off in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get in here.” He
flung out a Protocosmic spirit-rope, looping it over that corpse and
pulling it into his estate-treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The corpse would have
to be destroyed, but the treasures Ning would keep.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Keep going.” Ning
was in an excellent mood. One would often encounter the corpses and
skeletons of fallen cultivators in this place…but of course, if one
wasn’t careful, one might easily end up joining.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The place was simply
too large.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning spent more than a
year traveling through the Ruins. Thanks to the keen senses provided
by the ‘Heartsword Realm’, the protection provided by the
Goldstar Beads of the Heavens, and the investigative power of his
heartforce, he was able to avoid all of the most dangerous areas.
Aside from Elder God Skysouth and the Flamefairy, he encountered six
more cultivators. However, only one of the six tried to assault Ning;
the rest steered clear of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the one who
tried to attack Ning? Ning killed him, of course!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was jogging
through a mountain forest, sometimes moving fast and sometimes moving
slow. He moved at quite a unique rhythm; clearly, Ning had gotten
used to this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Waves
of power were rippling out from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s eyes
lit up. “Those waves are pretty powerful, and it seems there are
quite a few of them. Let’s go take a look.” Generally speaking,
when multiple people fought aginst each other in a dangerous region
like the one he was located in right now, it was over an extremely
important treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quickly and
silently moved closer to the source of the ripples, soom arriving at
a mountain peak. Ning hid within the grass, peering off into the
distance. Within the distant mountain gorge, he saw five Elder Gods
and Ancestral Immortals engaged in a battle. The five were divided
into two sides, with four cultivators on one side and one cultivator
on the other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hellsword, there are
two of these Dao weapons. Why can’t we split them? One for you, one
for us. Isn’t that ideal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Dao weapon for you
four fools? Die, die, die!” The lone cultivator was dressed in
black robes, and his six arms were striking with six blurry streaks
of sword-light. As for the other four cultivators, they were able to
just barely hold him off as they supported each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing these
words, Ning’s eyes lit up. “Dao weapons? Two of them? Elder God
Hellsword….mm, so that’s the legendary Hellsword. He truly is an
expert of the Dao of the Sword. He should be on the same level of
power as me.”

Chapter 18 - Battling Within the Ruins
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you, die!”
Hellsword exploded with power as he wildly assaulted the other four.
He knew that if this battle went on for too long other, Elder Gods
and Ancestral Immortals in the Windsource Ruins might be drawn to
this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t hold any
longer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A muscular Elder God
who wielded six black staffs let out a low growl. Hellsword’s
sword-light landed against his body, but only created a few sparks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Retreat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A blood-robed Elder God
who had been fighting Hellsword in close combat suddenly blanched,
then hurriedly split his body into two and sent his two clones
fleeing in two separate directions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A streak of sword-light
fell down upon one of the clones, slaying it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My divine body’s
been weakened. I won’t be able to hold on for any longer.” The
blood-robed Elder God continued to flee at high speed. The other
three Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals cursed, but had no choice
but to begin fleeing in other directions as well. They weren’t
actually members of a team; they had simply joined together on an
ad-hoc basis simply because Hellsword was far too powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. Those fools.”
Hellsword came to a halt, grinning as he looked at the four fleeing
figures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Hellsword’s
face suddenly changed dramatically as he immediately turned his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An icy ray of
sword-light had suddenly appeared and was stabbing straight towards
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So there was one
more hiding in the weeds.” Hellsword let out a savage grin,
striking out mercilessly with his six swords. He wasn’t worried
about the enemy attack at all; although it was quite fast, it was too
simple and straightforward a strike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The opposing streaks of
sword-light collided.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hellsword was sent
flying backwards, his face a mask of astonishment. As for the
white-robed Ji Ning, he chased right after Hellsword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Brightmoon] sword-art,
Blood Drop stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What tremendous
strength.” Hellsword was completely stunned. His opponent wasn’t
just stronger, he was overwhelmingly stronger!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But raw strength is
useless against me.” He suddenly came to a halt, spun around, then
charged straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Slash! Slash!
Slash! Slash! Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Streaks of sword-light
filled the air between the two, then both fell back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hellsword stared at
Ning, then said in a low voice, “Who are you? Someone with such
powerful sword-arts can’t possibly be an unknown figure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sunrise,” Ning
said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You must be a new
expert in the Dao of the Sword,” Hellsword said coldly. “You are
pretty strong. However, the Ruins aren’t a suitable place for
sparring. Let’s compete after we leave this place.” After
speaking, Hellsword transformed into a streak of black light, moving
at light speed as he fled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the two had
clashed, he had the feeling that Ning’s sword-arts were simply
perfect. He couldn’t find any flaws at all, and so he decided to
avoid wasting more time with such a troublesome opponent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leaving?” Ning
willed his swords to fly out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nine streaks of
sword-light shot out through the skies. These nine swords were all
Chaos treasures that Ning had acquired in the Windsource Ruins.
Although they weren’t part of a set, Ning’s Ancestral Immortal
power filled them, ensuring that each of them possessed shocking
levels of power. They spread out like a layered net, completely
surrounding and blocking Hellsword’s path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All nine swords moved
faster than the speed of light and were thus able to quickly catch up
to Hellsword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” Hellsword
blanched as he stared at the nine swords surrounding him. “Where
the hell did such a powerful expert of the sword come from? His
sword-arts are completely flawless. Damn it all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He would rather fight
against an enemy with ferocious offensive stances than someone like
Ning, whose sword-arts could be described as truly flawless. One
could easily succumb to a sense of despair when faced with such
impeccable sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine streaks of
sword-light swirled around him, preventing him from fleeing any
further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You won’t be able
to escape.” Ning had already manifested three heads and six arms.
He wielded six of his Darknorth swords as he charged straight towards
Hellsword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then let’s fight!”
Hellsword went berserk as well, his eyes filled with bloodlust as he
once more threw himself against Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Neither would be
willing to retreat. Two Dao weapons were at stake!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dao weapons were
incredibly rare, even amongst the other experts on their level. Every
single Dao weapon was worth at least a cube of chaos nectar, with the
best Dao weapons being worth more than ten! This was a sum of money
that even World Gods would lust after. It was only natural that both
Ji Ning and Hellsword went berserk over the two Dao weapons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I get those two
Dao weapons, I might be able to extract enough Five Elements essence
to completely repair Violetjewel!” Ning’s killing intent began to
soar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four fleeing Elder
Gods and Ancestral Immortals could sense powerful ripples emanating
from behind them. “Who is Hellsword fighting against now?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four of them
carefully began to creep backwards. The allure of a pair of Dao
weapons was simply too great!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is that?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After sneaking back,
they saw a white-robed figure battling furious against a black-robed
figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed figure
was the famous, highly regarded ‘Hellsword’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed figure
was an unknown youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? Hellsword is
actually at a disadvantage?” The four were all shocked. “Where
did such an expert of the sword suddenly come from? He’s so
strong!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Xiuyi, what
should we do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What can we do? Stay
far away from them and watch. If both are heavily injured, we can try
to seize the opportunity to attack them. If no chance presents
itself, then we’ll immediately run away after their battle
concludes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Xiuyi’s
words are reasonable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This white-robed
Elder God is even more terrifying than Hellsword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Hellsword both
suspected that those four had returned to watch them, but neither
really cared about the four. Four supreme Elder Gods? Pffft. It might
take them a bit of effort to kill the four, but it wouldn’t be too
hard. Ning’s ‘Heartsword stance’ in particular ensured that he
didn’t have to worry about group attacks at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two continued to
focus on battling each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword attacks
seemed to be more casual and carefree, but they came in consecutive
linked waves that made Hellsword feel as though he had no chance to
even breathe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hellsword’s attacks
were more frenzied and they were filled with a thick intent of
darkness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light flashed.
Finally, a blow landed upon Hellsword’s body. Ning felt as though
he had just stabbed an extremely tough magic treasure. The power of
the blow caused Hellsword to be knocked flying backwards, and he
slammed into a distant boulder, causing it to break apart into tiny
pieces that shot out in every direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A protective divine
ability?” Ning frowned slightly. “It seems as though I’ll have
to suppress and seal him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What!?” Upon Ning
landed a blow against him, Hellsword’s face changed yet again.
Clearly, his sword-arts were somewhat inferior.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I can’t
overcome you in sword-arts…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hellsword gritted his
teeth, then manifested an enormous violet hammer that emanated mighty
ripples of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Dao weapon?”
Ning immediately understood. So one of the two weapons which
Hellsword had acquired was a warhammer. No wonder he hadn’t used it
during this battle! Using sword-arts with a warhammer wasn’t really
effective.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…the
difference in power between the two was obvious. Hellsword had no
choice but to change the way he fought.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” Hellsword
brandished the violet warhammer, then struck out with it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the warhammer struck
out, streaks of lightning could be seen crackling around it. It
compressed space in front of it as it smashed straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What tremendous
might.” Ning could instantly sense how much power this strike held.
He hurriedly willed his Darknorth swords to transform into black
holes that he then used to defend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The warhammer was
deflected off to one side, while Ning was knocked a few steps back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I knew it.”
Hellsword had an ugly look on his face. This white-robed youth was
ridiculously strong. Even though Hellsword had an advantage in
weaponry, the white-robed youth was still able to defend against it
with his techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A big warhammer like
this must have lots of Five Elements essence inside of it.” Ning
now wanted the weapon even more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s a total of
two warhammers. You can have one, I’ll keep the other. Deal?” As
Hellsword continued to battle, he began to send Ning a mental
message. He was willing to compromise. There was nothing he could use
against Ji Ning’s terrifying sword-arts, and he knew that he would
definitely be defeated if this battle was to continued for much
longer. This white-robed youth was also skilled in long-range
attacks; there was no way he would be able to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Give me both and
I’ll let you off the hook,” Ning sent back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t even think
about it.” Hellsword was beginning to go crazy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then let’s keep
fighting.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning charged forward
even more furiously than before, sending sword-light flashing
everywhere. He even manifested a rope next to him, filling it with
some of his will. If Ning was able to break through Hellsword’s
defenses and catch him offguard, he would use this rope to bind and
capture him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hellsword battled on
the run, and while doing so he sent furiously to Ning, “This place
is the Windsource Ruins. You never know when danger is going to
appear here. If you keep chasing after me like this, you’ll end up
in a death trap as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just continued
with his furious attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals watching from afar felt breathless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Both of them are
crazy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hopefully, both of
them will be killed by traps or protective formations, letting us
pick up their treasures.” The four watched, prayed, and chased
after the the Hellsword and the white-robed cultivator as those two
continued their wild fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as Ning clashed
once more against Hellsword in midair…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a gray gust
of wind suddenly appeared out of nowhere, spinning into a tornado and
instantly whirling around both Ning and Hellsword. A few moments
later, the tornado vanished…but with it vanished Ning and Hellsword
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the four saw this
from afar, their faces all changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone knows that
the Windsource Ruins are too dangerous to fly through. You might end
up being trapped inside some formation. Those two must’ve been
teleported straight into a death trap.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn. Those two Dao
weapons were swept away as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unwilling to just give
up, the four of them continued to wait there for three full days, but
they saw neither hide nor hair of Ji Ning and Hellsword, to say
nothing of the Dao weapons. In the end, they had no choice but to
leave unhappily.

Chapter 19 - A Gray Wind
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” Ji
Ning’s face immediately changed as that gray wind appeared,
bringing with it an aura of death and stillness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hellsword had been
driven by Ning to the brink of madness, which was why he had started
to fly around in a crazed manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The difference in power
between the two wasn’t that great, which was why Ning needed time
to subdue and capture him. Ning had thought that he wouldn’t be so
unlucky as to run into a protective spell during such a short
battle…but alas, he really was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gray wind swept
both Ning and Hellsword into its grasp, and its utterly indomitable
power threw the two of them flying downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What incredible
power.” Ning did his best to halt his fall, but his divine power
and Immortal energy were far too weak to do so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was an utterly
enormous black pit beneath them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Hellsword were
both spun around like tops by the tornado and sent flying straight
into the pit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop. Stop!” Ning
instantly activated his [Three Heads, Six Arms] ability. All six of
his arms dramatically increased in size as he clawed towards the
edges of the pit. In midair, Ning had nothing to hold onto. Now,
however, he was able to see the stone cliffs lining the edges of the
pit. Ning had the feeling that if he was drawn deep into this pit by
the tornado, he would probably end up dead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had to come to a
halt! But the wind was simply too powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s six arms
simultaneously activated the [Starseizing Hand]. In the end, one of
his hands managed to just barely clench around a pillar of rock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Ning had been
dragged down at an incredible pace. When his hand clenched around the
stone pillar, his entire body came to a sudden halt. A terrifying
ripping power was applied throughout his entire body, causing it to
twitch. As for his hands that were using the [Starseizing Hand], they
instantly went numb and slack…resulting in Ning continuing to be
dragged downwards by that furious gray tornado!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack! Crack! Crack!
The gray stone pillar that Ning had managed to grab onto earlier
began to crack apart as well. Moments later, it completely shattered
and was also dragged downwards by the furious tornado.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gotta stop.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop!” Ning’s
six arms wildly clutched at the surrounding walls, seeking to grasp
anything that jutted out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning finally came to a
halt when three of his hands managed to simultaneously snake their
way into an enormous crevice in the pit walls. Thanks to these three
hands holding onto that crevice desperately, he was finally able to
resist the power of the tornado.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew. I stopped.”
Ning let out a sigh of relief. The enormous stone crevice was
thousands of meters long, and as Ning latched onto the crevice he had
changed his arms to make them hundreds of meters long as well. He had
dug his hands deep into the crevice, ensuring that he would be able
to hang off the walls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hellsword had also been
dragged into the pit, and he was also clawing at the walls in an
attempt to find something to hold onto. However, he was far weaker
than Ning in raw strength. He managed to grab onto a jutting piece of
rock, but the tearing force instantly rendered his hands completely
numb and slack. He wasn’t able to slow himself down! The power of
the tornado was simply too great, giving him no chance to grab onto
anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s hands were
akin to Chaos treasures, after all. He also had the power of a
half-step World God body, as well as the enhancement of the
[Starseizing Hand]. That was the only reason why Ning was more
successful than him in coming to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! As Hellsword
continued to be dragged downwards, his body would occasionally smash
into some jutting pieces of rock, resulting in him bouncing around
the walls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hellsword vomited out a
mouthful of blood. These collisions were even more deadly than Ning’s
sword-strikes, and he continued to smash into one jutting rock after
another. Given how keen Ning’s eyesight was, he was able to clearly
see Hellsword continuing to fall several hundred kilometers, smashing
into the walls at least a few dozen times. It seemed as though the
deeper Hellsword fell, the more powerful the tornado became.
Hellsword’s body was beginning to twist and contort from the
collisions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After smashing into a
particularly sharp spear-shaped rock, Hellsword’s body actually
completely blasted apart. The powerful tornado quickly ground the
pieces of his body apart, completely wiping him out in body and soul.
The tornado was far stronger than Ning, after all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A pity.” Still
hanging off the stone walls, Ning could do nothing but watch as
Hellsword died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dao weapons were
sucked down as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…what should I
do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All six of Ning’s
arms were clinging onto the stone crevice. He was wearing a top-grade
suit of Chaos armor, and he had a powerful divine body that had
trained the [Golden Statue]. He was more than capable of withstanding
the power of this tornado.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Am I supposed to
just keep hanging here?” Ning spread out his heartforce, but alas
it was instantly destroyed by that gray wind of destruction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This gray wind is
capable of destroying even heartforce! How terrifying was this
ancient power that erected the Windsource Ruins!?” Ning muttered
softly to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had no idea. The
strongest figure of the Badlands Territory, Daoking Badlands, had
once paid a visit to the former master of this estate…and he had
been thoroughly convinced of his inferiority. In fact, the reason why
this place was named ‘Windsource’ was because that ancient power
had reached an utterly unfathomable level of mastery over the wind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Neither heartforce nor
coresense could penetrate the gray wind. All Ning could do was use
his own eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to get out of
here.” Ning raised his head to look upwards. The gray wind howled
furiously above him, blocking his vision. Ning used his top-grade
Chaos armor to form a semi-translucent barrier over his head; only
then was he able to see just a little bit of the area above him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to get out of
this pit. The wind is too powerful; I won’t be able to maintain a
grip on any jutting pieces of rock. My only choice is to drive my
entire arm deep into some of those crevices and cracks.” Ning
scanned the area above him for more crevices. The gray wind had
caused quite a bit of erosion to this pit, resulting in quite a few
crevices appearing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s one.”
Three hundreds above Ning was a slightly smaller crevice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
immediately stretched one of his hands upwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The furious power of
the wind blasted down against Ning’s hand with the weight of a
thousand stars, completely preventing him from reaching upwards. Ning
did his best to fight back against it, and he found that he was able
to stretch his arms out in various other directions…but to go
completely against the win and reach upwards? Completely impossible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Won’t work. Wind’s
too strong.” Ning quickly gave up the attempt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I can’t go up…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning lowered his head
to stare at the seemingly bottomless black pit beneath him. “Then
my only choice is to go down!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked downwards
carefully. Roughly six hundred meters below him, he saw another large
crevice. He immediately stretched out with a hand to grab a hold of
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Going up meant going
against the wind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Going down meant going
with the wind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he increased his
arm to make it many hundreds of meters long, it was easy for him to
snake his hand deep into the crevice. Ning sent one hand after
another into the second crevice before finally letting go of the
first one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quickly fell
downwards, then came to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s continue.”
Ning glanced at his surroundings, then began to climb downwards
again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, Ning began to
slowly make his way down through this bottomless pit of darkness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A while later, Ning saw
a sword that was jutting out from a stone pillar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This sword wasn’t
one of Hellsword’s. Some other poor bastard must’ve been dragged
in here and lost control of his weapon, resulting in it being stuck
here.” Ning immediately, laboriously reached out to grab that
sword, then took it into his estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning then continued his
slow downwards climb.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three hundred meters.
Three thousand meters. Thirty kilometers…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, Ning had picked
up a total of three weapons. Alas, all three were ‘merely’ Chaos
treasures; none of them were Dao weapons. Still, it made sense. If a
World-level expert was grabbed by the gray wind, he wouldn’t have
been manhandled as badly as Ning and Hellsword had been. There were
very few Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals who held Dao weapons; the
chances of one of them just happening to fall down into this pit were
even lower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning slowly clambered
down over another hundred kilometers, then took a rest and glanced at
his surroundings in the hopes of finding a way out of here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s that?”
Ning look downwards, surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A cave had actually
appeared on the walls of the pit. This was clearly a cave that had
been artificially dug out, and it was many hundreds of meters wide.
Although the gray wind howled past it, it didn’t go into the cave
itself, making the cave a rare and welcome oasis of peace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because it sloped
downwards and inwards, Ning wasn’t able to see it earlier. Only
now, when he drew closer, did it appear before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who dug out this
cave? Doesn’t matter, I suppose. I’ve used up quite a bit of my
divine power after climbing so long and keeping [Three Heads, Six
Arms] active for so long. I need to get in there right away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hurriedly began to
climb in its direction, then sent his arms deep into the cave
entrance. There were a few jutting pieces of rock inside the cave,
allowing Ning to easily gain a handhold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quickly ‘shrank’
his arms, resulting in the rest of his body being pulled into the
cave like a rubber band.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was strange. There
was no wind in this cave at all. Ning had gotten so used to the
raging gray winds that he felt rather unaccustomed to the calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew. I can finally
take a break.” Ning deactivated [Three Heads, Six Arms], then
glanced at the gray wind which continued to rage outside of the cave.
He then turned his head to carefully inspect the cave itself.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 20 - The Nine Seals
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was extremely
obvious that this cave had been dug out artificially. It had been dug
out in an extremely methodical manner, and various markings that
looked like fish scales could be seen on the walls. There were also
some diagrams and some writing that had been left behind on the cave
walls, and the cave itself emanated a strange intent that felt like
flowing water. Ji Ning couldn’t help but be affected by the cave’s
aura, and his heart became quite calm as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was in no rush to
read the words or look at the pictures. Instead, he first carefully
inspected the scale-like patterns and marks on the walls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very neat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If someone slowly
dug the cave out, there’s no way it could all be so neat and tiny.”
Ning stared at the tiny markings. “I feel as though someone must’ve
used a divine ability to instantly scoop out the rock and make the
cave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but feel shocked by this possibility.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he had grabbed
onto that stone pillar a short while ago, the powerful tearing force
from the tornado had only been able to cause a few cracks to it. He
had tested out using his hands to ‘dig’ a handhold into the
walls, but had been completely unable to succeed whatsoever. This was
why Ning had chosen to find pre-existing crevices instead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The stone here has
been nourished by the local formations and baptized by the gray wind,
giving it extraordinary properties. Most likely, not even World-level
experts would be able to so easily dig out a cave of such size,”
Ning mused to himself. He reached out with his hand, gently stroking
it against the fish-scale patterns.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he did, he suddenly
could sense a strange, unique intent pouring towards him from the
patterns.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As calm…as water…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning carefully
inspected the cave in detail for a while longer, then turned his
attention towards the writing and the diagrams on the cave walls. As
Ning viewed it, those diagrams wouldn’t exactly be running away. If
he wasn’t careful and missed something or activated a trap by
accident, that would be truly disastrous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ‘Hundred Streams
of the Windsource’ in these ruins are quite marvelous indeed. A
pity…I would’ve loved to have had the chance to sit down and
discuss the Dao with the fellow Daoist who created this estate. That
fellow Daoist died countless years ago. In the future, when I reach
the end of my own life, I shall also leave behind my Dao and allow
the cultivators who come after me to get a good look at it…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">I have spent more than
a hundred thousand years here and have gained certain insights.
Although I’ve only inspected a few of the streams, I can tell that
there is a great difference between them and the path which I have
chosen, and so it doesn’t matter if I look at the rest of the
Hundred Streams or not…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Here are the insights I
have gained from a hundred thousand years of viewing these streams.
I’ve recorded all of them down here. If a cultivator has the chance
to come here in the future and see them, consider this a bit of karma
between us.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These are the words of
Waterwind!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single character
emanated a relaxed, carefree aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning looked at
these words, he felt as though he could see that ancient power
writing them down all those years ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waterwind?” Ning
murmured softly to himself, “Who is that? Judging from what he
wrote, he should be someone who was on the same level of power as the
creator of the Windsource Ruins.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Badlands
Territory…as far as Ning knew, it didn’t hold anyone by the name
of ‘Waterwind’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had long ago
acquired intelligence reports regarding the many World-level experts.
The most powerful figure in the entire Badlands was the creator of
the Badlands Court, Daolord Badlands! Daolord Badlands was still
alive and was unfathomably powerful; he wasn’t a person who someone
of Ning’s level could hope to approach.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Badlands had
established the Badlands Court. World-level experts were like
toddlers before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Badlands Court
holds a number of very famous figure, but none of them go by the
moniker of ‘Waterwind’,” Ning mused to himself. “No, I’ve
never heard this name before. Could it be…someone from another
territory?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, in the end it
didn’t really matter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Waterwind talked a big
game. If he was telling the truth, then he was most likely someone
above the World-level of power! Even if he was ‘merely’ a
World-level expert, he most assuredly stood at the very peak of power
amongst them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waterwind…Waterwind…”
Ning quietly memorized this name, then turned his attention to the
‘insights’ which Waterwind had left behind on the cave walls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cave walls were
covered with both writing and diagrams.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The writing consisted
of the words Ning had read just now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the diagrams,
they contained the insights which Waterwind had gained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The diagram was of
fishes swimming in the sea. Ning saw more than ten fishes, each of
which was in a different pose. Around them could be seen several
ordinary-looking lines which seemed to represent the ripples of the
water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were a total of
sixteen fish and ninety-seven water ripples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These diagrams…?”
Ning felt that these diagrams were rather odd. He gave them a closer
look, carefully inspecting the water ripples and the fish for any
peculiarities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly, without Ning
even noticing it, a surge of will and intent began to slowly seep
outwards from the diagrams and towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A vast river that was
three thousand meters wide was flowing past Ning, and in the river
was a fish of gigantic proportions. The river was merely three
thousand meters wide, but this fish was over three hundred meters
long. The fish swam with the waves, continuing to advance forward
with an indomitable, unstoppable attitude.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What the hell?”
Ning stared blankly at his surroundings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Directly him was a
river that was three thousand meters wide. There were several other
rivers next to it, each of which was three thousand meters wide and
which flowed with tremendous speed. Off in the distance, Ning could
see even more rivers, but he wasn’t able to get a clear glimpse of
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning wasn’t
able to see those rivers clearly, he could vaguely sense that there
was a total of a hundred river streams.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hundred rivers. A
hundred fish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rivers flowed in
one direction. The fish swam in the same direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the very end of the
rivers, there was a place where all of them came together, a place of
unstoppable power which saw the hundred streams become one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single river gave
Ning a different feeling, as did the fish within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the rivers felt
like the pretty girls next door.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the rivers felt
like scorchingly attractive vixens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the rivers felt
like icy cold fairy maidens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all had completely
different auras and intents, but they were able to perfectly join
together off in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Hundred Streams
merge together to form the Dao…but alas, if you are unable to do
so, you shall die. A pity, a pity…” A sigh suddenly echoed forth
from this world…and then, everything vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was once more
within the cave, staring at the ordinary-looking pictures of fish and
water ripples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What just happened?”
Ning was puzzled. “Was that an illusion I saw just now? No…I
should’ve been able to tell if that was all an illusion. It was no
illusion. It was….something else…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After ‘Waterwind’
looked at the ‘Hundred Streams of the Windsource’, he left behind
these diagrams containing his insights.” Ning raised his head to
give the diagrams another look, but then he suddenly froze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because when
he did so, the scene he had just seen instantly began to replay in
his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hundred surging
rivers, the hundred swimming fish, even that final sigh…all of it
appeared once more within his memories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It has an
inexplicable feeling to it. Almost like…sadness.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning silently pondered
on this. The reason why Ning felt that sense of sorrow was due to
that final sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But this so-called
‘hundred streams merging together to form the Dao…’” Ning had
the feeling that those words contained an incredibly profound meaning
to it. The more he tried to understand it, the more confused he
became. However, Ning was in no rush. He sat down in the lotus
position and began to slowly meditate on what he had just seen. He
was so absorbed by this that he actually forgot ot enter the
Heavengazer Tower, as he was completely focused on the scene of the
hundred streams that he had just seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One day after another
went past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to sit
there, as unmoving as a statue. Dust began to collect and accumulate
on his body, and soon Ning looked like an actual statue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six years later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been
completely covered with dust…but finally, on this day, he opened
his eyes, revealing a look of surprise and delight in his gleaming,
crystalline gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Hundred Streams
merge together to form the Dao…the Nine Seals join together to
become One…so this is how the Nine Chaos Seals actually work,”
Ning murmured softly to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The meaning of the
phrase ‘the Hundred Streams merge together to form the Dao’ was
simply too profound; he was able to just barely glean a few insights
from it. However, while doing so he was able to see many similarities
between it and his Nine Chaos Seals, resulting in him gaining many
more insights into the ninth seal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Before leaving the
Three Realms, Ning had already mastered the eighth chaos seal. Only
one was left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A series of complicated
divine runes began to appear within Ning’s eyes. All nine of the
Nine Chaos Seals began to manifest within his eyes, changing and
transforming in an endless pattern. In the past, it seemed as though
there would never be an end to the changing runes of the Nine Chaos
Seals…but once Ning mastered them, the transformations came to an
end. Finally, they came together to form the image of what looked
like a flower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This image appeared on
Ning’s soul itself, as well as his very truesoul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was an azure flower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was sacred, holy,
natural.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seal imprint of an
azure flower began to naturally manifest itself on Ning’s forehead
as well. After appearing briefly, it then quickly faded away and hid
itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When the Nine Chaos
Seals join together to become one, they become absolutely marvelous.
Mother Nuwa must have reached this level as well.” Ning could sense
the seal imprint of an azure flower that had appeared on his
forehead, an azure flower that was gently swaying.

Chapter 21 - Azureflower Space
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sea of
consciousness was located very close to the forehead…and within Ji
Ning’s sea of consciousness, there was an absolutely beautiful
azure flower that was swaying in the wind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I never would’ve
thought that after mastering the Nine Chaos Seals, an azure flower
seal would appear, with an azure flower appearing in my consciousness
as well.” Ning could sense himself transforming. In the past, after
mastering each chaos seal he would be able to more closely attune
with the essence of certain concepts such as destiny, slaughter,
darkness, the sword, etc.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that the nine had
come together, Ning felt an even greater attunement towards the
essence of the sword. It made sense; he had the most insights in this
regard, after all. He also felt much closer attunement towards
rainwater, lightning, space, and other Daos…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is this azure
flower meant for?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is it meant to help
me be more closely attuned to the various essences when I meditate?”
Ning was puzzled. He carefully inspected that swaying azure flower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning’s
heartforce brushed against that azure flower…it suddenly began to
transform.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crackle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartforce was supposed
to be formless and untouchable, but as soon as it touched the azure
flower it was immediately devoured by it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Inside the azure flower
was a region of its own. This space was a blurry, empty region.
However, a mist was slowly beginning to materialize inside of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My heartforce was
transformed by the azureflower space into mist?” Ning was so
surprised and shocked, he immediately came to a halt. Almost ten
percent of his heartforce had been used up in an instant!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heartforce is
ephemeral and formless. Only certain special techniques, such as
Houyi’s archery techniques, are able to make use of heartforce. But
this azureflower space was actually able to convert and transform
heartforce…” Ning could sense that the mist within the
azureflower space was filled with a strange, marvelous type of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It can convert
heartforce. Is it also capable of converting divine power and
Immortal energy?” Ning wondered to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning willed a tiny
thread of divine power to seep into his sea of consciousness as well.
As soon as it brushed against the azure flower, it was immediately
devoured by the flower, resulting in a bit more mist to appear inside
of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“B-b-but…” Ning
was dazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s actually…the
same?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When heartforce is
devoured, it transforms into mist. When divine power is devoured, it
also transforms into mist. And…the mist is the same?!” Ning could
hardly believe it. Heartforce and divine power were two completely
different types of power; the differences between the two were
enormous! And yet, both were somehow converted into a different type
of energy, one which Ning was capable of controlling?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense how
terrifyingly powerful the energy contained within the mist was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Or perhaps…it
isn’t a ‘conversion’. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say
that the azure flower was able to ‘eat’ my divine power and
heartforce, then give birth to this new type of energy?” Ning mused
to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So it can eat both
divine power and heartforce…what of Immortal energy?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning willed it, and his
Immortal energy flew into his sea of consciousness as well. As soon
as it touched the azure flower, it was also devoured right away,
resulting in even more mist appearing within the azureflower space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning remained seated in
the lotus position inside the cave, a very complicated series of
looks flashing over his face. There was surprise on his face as well
as puzzlement and excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure flower that
appeared after the Nine Chaos Seals merged together was simply too
marvelous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Divine power, Immortal
energy, heartforce…these were three completely different types of
energy, but the azure flower was capable of eating them all and then
giving birth to more of the mist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is this azure
flower so powerful? It’s actually capable of eating and
transforming three completely different types of energy.” Ning
murmured silently to himself, “I wonder…was it true that the Nine
Chaos Seals were formed naturally by the primordial chaos? Or were
they created by some ancient power? They are simply too marvelous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Doesn’t matter, I
suppose.” Ning pushed that aside for now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many of the abilities
these ancient powers were capable of were beyond Ning’s
imagination. For example, the supreme figure of the Badlands
Everworld was Daolord Badlands, someone who also stood on a level of
power that surpassed that of the World-level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s see just how
powerful that mist is.” Ning willed a hint of the mist to emerge
from the azureflower space. Instantly, his entire body began to be
filled by the mist, absorbing it like a dry sponge absorbing water.
As it did so, Ning began to transform.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no way to
make the power of the mist leave the body?” Ning was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Divine power, Immortal
energy, and heartforce could all be made to leave the body. This mist
energy, however, could not.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning spent some time
testing it out. Indeed, the mysterious mist was only able reside
within his body, unable to leave it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What on earth is
this mist good for?” Ning knelt down on one knee, stretching out
his right hand and suddenly slapping it against the stone ground. As
he did so, a surge of power suddenly burst forth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire cave
trembled and a few cracks actually appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…” A shocked
look was on Ning’s face. He hurriedly waved his hand, causing an
estate-world to appear within the cave. Ning quickly entered the
estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a Chaos-level
estate-treasure which Ning had acquired after entering the Ruins.
Ning had quite a few estate-worlds now; the reason he had chosen this
one was because it was extremely large.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The insides of the
estate-world was nearly ten million meters in size. It contained a
vast mountain range, a wide sea, a series of giant continents, and
many alien Outsiders that lived here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly appeared
within the skies of this world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s give it a
try.” Ning’s eyes lit up and he began to fly through the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He didn’t use the
Ninehorn Lightning Serpent; instead, he just relied on the power of
his divine body as he flew. He instantly transformed into a streak of
rainbow light…and as he flew, he actually broke past the speed of
light. If in the past he was able to travel three hundred thousand
kilometers in an instant, now he was able to travel nearly four
hundred thousand kilometers in an instant!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It looked like a simple
increase of just a third, but in reality breaking past the speed
limits of the Heavenly Daos was incredibly difficult. And more
importantly, in the past Ning had to rely on the Ninehorn Lightning
Serpent in order to reach the speed of light. Now, he wasn’t using
the lightning serpent at all, merely relying on the power of his
divine body…and yet, he was able to breach the speed of light! Ning
hadn’t gained any new insights with regards to space or speed, but
his flying speed had just dramatically increased!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was almost like
becoming a World God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World Gods were
dramatically strengthened in every single way, resulting in them
completely eclipsing the various limits of the Heavenly Daos. The
limits of the Heavenly Daos were now completely unable to restrict
them any further, allowing them to ‘brute-force’ past the speed
of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was actually able
to brute-force past the limits?” Ning came to a halt. He stood
there in the air, completely astonished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I originally just
had the body of a half-step World God….but with the mist supporting
me, I’m actually able to effortless brute-force the limits of the
Heavenly Daos?” Ning truly couldn’t believe it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, when he had
struck the ground of the cave with a palm just now, he had already
begun to sense it. The power of his palms definitely equaled the
power of a Dao weapon. It was absolutely at the level of a
World-level expert!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, he had apparently
also reached the World-level in terms of speed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And the reason for
these miraculous results…was the power of the mist that formed
within the azureflower region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the energy was
unable to leave his body, it supported and reinforced it, upgrading
Ning in every single area to an entirely different level. He was now
stronger and faster…and Ning had the feeling that he was now as
fast as a World God. Even if he wasn’t, he had to be extremely
close to that level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was able to fly
faster than the limits of the Heavenly Daos while relying solely on
his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was able to strike
as hard as a World God while solely striking out with his palms.
This, too, represented a breaching of the limits of the Heavenly
Daos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The limits of the
Heavenly Daos…they were like paper, easily pierced through by Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no need for
him to rely on his insights from the [Five Treasures]
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was need for any
other forms of support.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just by allowing the
mist to reinforce his body, he was able to completely breach the
limits of the Heavenly Daos in every single way. Even if he wasn’t
a World God, he wasn’t far off from that level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could it be this
powerful?” Only now did Ning truly understand how marvelous the
azureflower space was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who on earth came up
with this technique?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The primordial chaos
did have quite a few monstrously powerful techniques. For example,
Ning’s combined usage of the second stage of the [Taowu Eighteen
Fiendgods] and the [One True Body] technique to give himself the
power of a half-step World God. The primordial chaos also contained
stories of some even more powerful techniques that had been devised
by truly ancient powers, and in some of those stories these
techniques allowed extremely powerful Elder Gods and Ancestral
Immortals to slay World-level experts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What did one need in
order to kill someone on a higher level?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ridiculously powerful
techniques, terrifying treasures, shockingly high levels of insight
into the Dao, and more. Only when one had reached the utmost peak of
power in every single aspect could one produce such extraordinary
results.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had the feeling
that the technique which produced his azureflower space was one such
technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stronger one
became, the harder it would be to grow even more powerful. There were
actually quite a few strength-enhancing techniques akin to the [Taowu
Eighteen Fiendgods] or the [One True Body], such as the [Thousand
Bodies Sutra], a technique which was even more monstrous. However,
after all those clones were joined together into one, it would become
thousands of times more difficult to improve the body any further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Or, to put it another
way…the azureflower space technique was a technique that was
thousands of times more valuable than the combination of the [Taowu
Eighteen Fiendgods] and the [One True Body] techniques.

Chapter 22 - Continuing Downwards
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning began to feel
excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had just undergone a
transformation on a qualitative level. He had long ago mastered the
‘Heartsword stance’, ensuring that he would be able to withstand
a blow or two from even a true World-level expert. If he was able to
completely repair Violetjewel, then he might actually be able to give
those World-level experts an actual fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Am I going to be one
of those legendary monsters who are able to slay World-level experts
despite merely being an Elder God?” Ning mumbled to himself, then
grinned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was too difficult to
break through to the World-level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single person who
was capable of succeeding in doing so was an absolute genius who had
many fortuitous encounters. Thus, an Elder God who could slay a World
God had to be an even more brilliant genius who had even better luck
and even deeper insights.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dao of the Sword
is a Dao meant for combat. I need to do my best to master the second
stance of the [Nameless] sword-art. I might not be capable of
becoming one of those monsters, but I still need to work as hard as I
can to advance through my chosen path.” Ning had a look of desire
in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A man had to aim for
the stars and set high goals for himself on his path to cultivation.
That way, even if he didn’t succeed in his goals, he would still be
able to travel farther than most cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning once more appeared
within the cave inside the pit. With a wave of his hand, he put away
his estate-world treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This mist energy is
truly marvelous. Still…I imagine it’ll be used up quite quickly
in battle. I need to store up more of it.” Ning waved his hand,
causing the Heavengazer Tower of Radiance to appear next to him, then
entered it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Heavengazer
Tower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning began to fill the
azure flower with his heartforce, divine power, and Immortal energy.
The azure flower accepted it all, ravenously devouring the energy and
converting it into mist, resulting in the mist grower denser and
denser.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After most of his
energy was used up, Ning took a break to recover. He could withdraw
energy from the primordial chaos to replenish his divine power, but
his heartforce could only be recovered through rest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After recovering…he
continued to pour all his energy into the azure flower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh. Finally, once
the mist in the region reached a certain level of density, a vortex
suddenly formed which drew in all the mist energy, converting it into
a single crystalline drop of water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A drop of water?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning attuned to it
briefly, then immediately understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This drop of water was
the form the mist took when it reached an extremely high level of
density. When battle began, he would be able to draw the mist energy
out from the drop of water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to use up
almost all of my divine power, heartforce, and Immortal energy in
order to condense a single water drop.” Ning couldn’t help but
feel shocked. “Well, time to continue.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The primordial chaos
was truly vast and infinite. There was a limit to how much of its
energy a cultivator could draw upon, with the hard limit being how
much the cultivator’s body could withstand! Thanks to the
Heavengazer Tower, Ning was able to withdraw chaos energy at a rate
that was ten times faster than someone in the outside world. He
repeatedly went through a cycle of exhausting all his heartforce,
divine power, and Immortal energy, then replenishing it through
resting. More and more water drops began to appear in the azureflower
space. One drop. Two drops. Three drops…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single drop was
formed through Ning completely exhausting and converting all his
energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, after a long
period of time, a total of thirty-six drops of water were circling
within the azureflower space. A strange equilibrium had been reached,
and a sense of pressure radiated outwards from the azureflower space,
letting Ning know that it had reached its limit for now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning spent a few more
days in the cave after this. He needed to get a full picture of what
the azure flower could do. As for the other clone of his true body
which was within the prisonworld, it had also mastered the Nine Chaos
Seals and had gained an azure flower seal of its own, one which was
also capable of manifesting those drops of water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, for the clone,
three drops was the absolute limit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as the my
true body’s azureflower space is able to hold more power than my
backup clone’s?” Ning murmured to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is it due to it
having a stronger divine body? A stronger Jindan? Or is it due to the
soul?” Ning was filled with many questions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His true body was
formed through merging seventeen clones. It had a more powerful
divine body, a stronger soul, and a Jindan that was comparable to
first-tier Jindans. Its azure flower was more powerful as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to dwell on
it. For now at least, it seems as though the azureflower energy can
only be applied to the divine body,” Ning mused to himself. He had
a feeling that the azureflower energy wasn’t that simple, but
despite spending quite a bit of time analyzing it he was still unable
to discover any other methods of applying it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given Mother Nuwa’s
abilities, I’m sure she must’ve been able to merge the Nine Chaos
Seals together as well. She also must have an azureflower space of
her own, and I’ll wager her insights into it are much greater than
mine. She might’ve discovered some of its secrets,” Ning mused.
“But…I still have no idea where she’s gone off to. There’s
actually no record of her in the Badlands Territory.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mother Nuwa had left
the Three Realms roughly half a chaos cycle ago. If she had arrived
in the Badlands Territory…given her power, her arrival definitely
would’ve been recorded down. It must be understood that even the
more powerful Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals were known
throughout the Badlands Territory. As for the World Gods, all of them
would definitely be recorded down. And yet, Ning was unable to find
any records of Mother Nuwa at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Or perhaps she
didn’t make it to the Badlands Territory? Did she get lost in the
spatial vortex tunnel? Given her power, Mother Nuwa should’ve been
able to traverse that tunnel with ease unless her luck was so horrid
that she was completely surrounded by spatial rifts, giving her no
way out at all. The chances of that happening, however, are quite
low.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Or did she hide her
true identity here in the Badlands Territory?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. Well, I’ll
worry about that later. Given her power…if she’s still in the
Badlands Territory, her reputation will quickly spread throughout the
region.” Ning was in quite a good mood right now. His mastery of
the azureflower space had been more beneficial to him than anything
he could imagine. Even if his true body ended up dying here, his
backup clone would eventually be able to rebuild it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, senior
Waterwind.” Ning turned to look at the words left behind on the
cave walls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was thanks to the
diagram of the ‘Hundred Streams merging together to form the Dao’
that Ning had been able to gain tremendous insights of his own and
thus master the Nine Chaos Seals. This was far more valuable and
important to Ning than merely improving his sword-arts a bit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning moved to stand at
the edge of the cave. He first stared upwards, then downwards towards
the bottomless abyss.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Should I climb
upwards? Or should I go down?” This was what Ning was pondering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the azureflower
energy supporting him, he would be able to easily climb upwards and
escape from the pit. But after leaving the pit, would he be able to
escape this place safely? Hard to say.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What would happen if he
climbed downwards? Still hard to say.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It won’t be too
hard for me to climb upwards, but…” Ning nodded slowly. “I
don’t need to rush out of here. I’ll go down and take a look
first. Countless cultivators must’ve been swallowed by the
Windsource. Hellsword himself had a pair of Dao weapons on him. The
depths of the Windsource Ruins must hold many treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the path
downwards might be filled with many dangers, it was also a path that
led to great treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It wasn’t impossible
that Ning might end up finding four or five Dao weapons there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go.” Ning
no longer hesitated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cultivators were meant
to battle against Heaven and Earth. If they wanted to acquire good
treasures, they’d have to risk their lives for it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s arms stretched
out many hundreds of meters. He looked like a giant ape as he swung
from crevice to crevice, the azureflower energy filling his body
making the process quite simple. In fact, Ning was now able to easily
grasp onto jutting pieces of rock without needing to focus on cracks.
Previously, Ning wouldn’t be able to maintain his grip, but now he
was able to do so with ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Swoosh. Swoosh.
He clambered down very agilely with six arms, moving so fast that he
looked like a blur.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ten kilometers. A
hundred kilometers. A thousand kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued his
downwards descent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every so often, he
would encounter a treasure that was caught within a crack or on a
ledge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is way too
deep. I must’ve gone down at least thirty thousand kilometers by
now.” Ning couldn’t help but secretly sigh in amazement. “The
deeper I go, the more powerful the Windsource seems to become as
well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, the
Windsource was at least five or six times more powerful than it had
been when he was next to the cave. However, Ning had become so much
more powerful that he was still able to proceed in a very relaxed
manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s eyes
lit up as he saw a warblade that glistened with bloody light that had
been caught within a crevice. As the gray wind blew past the
warblade, it emitted an ear-piercing screech. The warblade was quite
dazzling to behold, and its aura caused even Ning’s heart to
clench.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Dao weapon!”
Ning revealed a look of delight. “After climbing down thirty
thousand kilometers, I picked up more than a hundred Chaos weapons.
Now, I’ve finally found a Dao weapon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning reached out with
his arms, stretching them out several hundred meters as he stuck his
hands deep into the crevice, then pulled the warblade out. Judging
from the ripples emanating from the warblade, it was an ownerless
item. Its former owner had most likely died a long time ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I feel as though its
aura is even stronger than Violetjewel’s aura is,” Ning murmured
to himself. “It must be quite a powerful Dao weapon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s guess was
correct.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This warblade was a
weapon which an Elder God had acquired from an incredibly deadly
place. It was a top-grade Dao weapon! However, after acquiring the
weapon, the Elder God had been unable to escape the danger zone he
was in. He continued to flee through the area and in the end had been
swept into and perished within the Hundred Streams of the Windsource.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For the sake of this
warblade alone, I have to make it out of here alive. It’d be a huge
waste if I died.” Ning quickly put the warblade away. One could
perish at any moment when trapped within a deadly area such as
this…but the rewards one could reap could also be staggering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll keep going
downwards.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I still haven’t
seen those two Dao weapons which Hellsword found.” Ning reached out
with his six arms, continuing his quick downwards descent into the
depths of this bottomless pit.

Chapter 23 - Windbeast
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning continued to
clamber downwards, traversing yet another ten thousand kilometers. On
the way down, he picked up another twenty-plus Chaos treasures. The
reason why he picked up no Protocosmic spirit-treasures was because
the gray wind here was so strong that even Protocosmic
spirit-treasures would be slowly ground to dust by it. Only Chaos
treasures were able to survive the wind for extended periods of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? I reached the
bottom?” Ning held onto the walls with his six long arms as he
stared downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gray wind formed a
swirling maelstrom at the bottom, but the pit itself had come to an
end. All Ning could see was the small part of the enormous maelstrom
that was visible from his location.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This should be the
bottom. This is where the wind transforms into a maelstrom, at least.
That means that the treasures left behind by the dead cultivators
should all be here.” Ning began to grow rather excited. Hellsword
had two Dao weapons on him, and Ning had already picked up over a
hundred Chaos treasures and a top-grade Dao warblade on the way down.
The number of treasures at the bottom had to be immense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The closer he got to
the treasures, the more careful he became. He slowly climbed
downwards, carefully inspecting his surroundings as he did so. The
gray wind here was so powerful that if it wasn’t for his
azureflower energy, there was no way he would be able to climb around
here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The maelstrom is
pretty large.” As he continued to climb downwards, the true size of
the gray maelstrom of wind began to reveal itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning was
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous maelstrom
covered an area of roughly a thousand kilometers. On one end of the
maelstrom was the deep pit which Ning had just emerged from, while on
the other end of the maelstrom was another pit that seemed just as
deep and dark. Quite a bit of the gray wind would occasionally howl
towards and go through the second pit as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is…?”
Suddenly, Ning had a thought. The image of the ‘Hundred Streams’
once more appeared in his mind, with those rivers all surging forward
before coming together as one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now I understand.
This is what senior Waterwind spoke of when he said he saw the
marvelous sight of the Hundred Streams of the Windsource. What I
experienced just now should’ve been just one of those flows.”
Ning immediately understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Hundred Streams of
the Windsource represented a hundred of these tunnels that coiled
deep into the planet before joining together at a common location.
Each tunnel had to be more than a million kilometers long. The
Hundred Streams contained all of the Daos which had been mastered by
the ancient power behind this estate!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Waterwind had viewed
several of the flows and gained many insights into them. Thus, he had
left behind his diagram atop the walls of that cave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The pit I just
climbed out of and the pit on the other side should belong to the
same flow.” Ning nodded slowly to himself. “It’s much like how
the waters of a river will occasionally form small whirlpools when
going past certain bends. So I’ve only been on a single stream this
entire time. Still, it makes sense. Even someone as unfathomably
powerful as Waterwind was only able to investigate a few of the
streams.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll wager that
quite a few of the treasures ended up being piled up here somewhere.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, Ning finally
understood. After he had been drawn in here from the outside world,
he had begun his journey through a single stream and had now
encountered the first ‘bend’ in the stream. This meant that he
was most likely in the outermost layer of the Hundred Streams!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The farther down I
go, the more dangerous it will probably become!” Ning mused to
himself. “Even Daolord Badlands and senior Waterwind were unable to
fully conquer this ancient ruin. If I try to go much deeper, I’ll
probably be throwing my life away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon realizing that he
was still at the outermost layer of the Hundred Streams of the
Windsource, Ning immediately came to his senses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I should take away
these treasures, then get the hell out of here.” Ning immediately
came to this decision, then once more began to carefully crawl
forwards. Soon, he reached the bottom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The maelstrom itself
didn’t have too much of a sucking power to it, just some tearing
power. The margins of the maelstrom were actually quite peaceful, and
many treasures had been swirled about and tossed to the edges of the
maelstrom. Ning saw that there had to be hundreds, perhaps over a
thousand treasures with tremendously powerful auras that were
scattered around the edges of the maelstrom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seven Dao weapons?”
Ning was delighted when he saw this. “And that’s just what I can
see with the naked eye. There are probably several other Dao weapons
that are hidden within storage treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning willed
the azureflower mist energy to reinforce his legs, allowing him to
easily walk across the bottom of this chamber. The sucking power
wasn’t that strong here, allowing him walk about quite freely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning silently crept
forward, soon arriving in a region that was roughly three hundred
meters long. There was no wind here at all, and quite a few treasures
had been piled up here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is great.”
Ning waved his hand, collecting the treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That small corner
contained dozens of Chaos treasures as well as a Dao weapon. The Dao
weapon was an odd-looking fist-sized slab. Ning used his divine power
to bind it, and upon doing so Ning realized that this ‘slab’ was
actually a flexible sword of incredible sharpness that could also be
used as a whip.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? What are these
fragments?” Ning glanced at the unremarkable fragments nearby.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
picking up a fragment of a sword handle. “What’s this?” Ning
frowned. He could clearly see deep indents on the surface of the
handle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are those…fang
marks?” This thought suddenly flashed through Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come here.” Ning
waved his hand, causing the many shards and fragments to all fly into
his estate-treasure. Within the estate-treasure, Ning’s coresense
wouldn’t be disturbed by the gray wind, allowing him to more
carefully inspect the fragments. What he found was a very strange
object located within the large pile of ordinary fragments.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
causing the strange object to fly out and come to a rest within
Ning’s palm. It was a large, palm-sized bluish-white scale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fragments he had
picked up were of all different colors, and so Ning hadn’t noticed
the scale earlier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A scale?” Ning
glanced at the patterns on the scale. It looked quite like a scale
that would appear on some sort of a beast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And those fang
marks…fangs that were able grind apart a Chaos treasure…and a
scale? I can’t stay here. I need to pick up these treasures, then
get out of here.” Ning didn’t even dare to imagine what creature
had caused this. He hurriedly flew towards a different corner of the
chamber, but as he did so he saw a streak of light fly against the
gray wind, emerging from the depths of the chamber and flying towards
him with astonishing speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning blanched when he
saw this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Good heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even though he had
become dramatically stronger, he still had to use his arms and hands
to crawl around this place. However, that streak of light was not
only moving against the wind, it was doing so at an utterly
inconceivable speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee.” Ning no
longer dared to tarry. His hands stretched out thousands of meters as
he hurriedly began to crawl upwards and flee at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My…my treasures…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as Ning had picked
up that scale, a creature had stirred from deep within this chamber.
Its entire body was bluish-white, it had a crystalline mane, the head
of a tiger, a body that was completely covered in scales, an
extremely long tail, and four mighty limbs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After being born, it
had lived its entire life here within this endless tunnel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It would occasionally
discover some sabers, knives, staves, hammers, and other weapons that
fell into its lair. These weapons were useless to it, but it liked to
collect them and hoard them! It even placed a few of the scales it
had shed in the corners of the chambers where there was no wind, so
as to signify that those treasures belonged to it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You actually dare to
rob me of my treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was enraged. It
immediately transformed into a streak of light, flying against the
wind towards the invader.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What sort of a freak
is this? How can it possibly fly directly against the wind of the
Hundred Streams? Does this scale belong to it?” Although Ning had
fled after taking just one glance at the creature, he was still able
to tell that it was a strange beast that was completely bluish-white
in color, while the scale he had acquired was also bluish-white. “And
those shards of treasures that had been bitten apart…did those
teeth marks come from it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The undamaged Chaos
treasures were all high-grade or top-grade in quality, while the
broken ones were all fairly low quality Chaos treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still…for it to be
able to chew Chaos treasures apart…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
understood that this monster was most likely far too powerful for him
to handle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s six arms moved
in a blur as he frantically clambered upwards. He had never crawled
as fast as he was crawling right now. Before this, he had been moving
very slowly, for fear of something dangerous happening. Now, he was
climbing at his absolute maximum speed. In almost the blink of an
eye, Ning propelled himself upwards ape-style by more than ten
thousand kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But despite how fast
Ning was climbing, that bluish-white streak of light flew upwards
even faster, even though it was going against the wind. In fact, it
had caught up to him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn. I found so
many treasures. Am I going to die here now? This sucks!” Ning
turned his head, staring at the ferocious, bluish-white monster that
had drawn close to him.

Chapter 24 - The Battle in the Abyss
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crystalline mane of
the bluish-white beast trembled as it glared at Ji Ning, its dark
yellow eyes filled with hatred and murder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning clung onto the
walls of the pit with one hand, as he turned to stare at the
bluish-white scaled monster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their gazes met.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t want to be
enemies with you,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!!!” The
bluish-white monster suddenly let out a furious roar as it struck out
with its tail, striking so fast that Ning blanched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hurriedly use his
five free arms to strike out with his sword-arts. It was as though
five black holes had suddenly appeared in the air and moved to
deflect the oncoming attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The incredible power of
the collision caused even Ning’s body to tremble, smashing him
against the stone walls behind him. A large crack had appeared on the
walls, but thankfully Ning had a tough divine body and a top-grade
suit of Chaos armor, as well as the support of that azureflower mist
energy. All these things ensured that he was able to withstand the
blow…but from this very first clash, Ning instantly understood that
his foe was even more stronger than he was!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since Ning had
mastered the Nine Chaos Seals and acquired the azureflower energy,
Ning had felt confident that he was very close to the World God level
of power and perhaps had even reached it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But this monstrosity
before him…a simple strike from its tail had complete overpowered
Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” Die!”
Die!” The bluish-white monster charged forward furiously, raking
out with its claws.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I gotta get out of
here.” Ning quickly clambered up the walls like a spider, sometimes
using his left hand to climb, sometimes using his right. He’d
occasionally block an attack while occasionally borrow from the force
of the collisions to propel himself further upwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Riiiiip! The sharp
claws tore a gash through the stone walls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whap! The powerful
tail-strikes caused the stone to shudder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was at a complete
disadvantage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This beastie…doesn’t
seem to be that tough.” After exchanging a few dozen blows with the
creature, Ning was slowly beginning to come to this conclusion. “It
is strong and fast, and its claws are quite sharp, but…it doesn’t
seem to have many insights into the Dao at all. It has an incredibly
powerful body, but in battle it is clumsy beyond belief.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azureflower mist
energy had strengthened Ning’s body, making it so that the
difference in power between him and the beast wasn’t that great. If
Ning hadn’t mastered the Nine Chaos Seals and was only as strong as
he was when he had first been drawn into the pit, he would’ve been
flattened by that first swipe of the tail. It wouldn’t have
mattered how profound his insights into the Dao were!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t keep
wasting time with it. If too much time passes, my azureflower mist
energy will be used up and I’ll be finished.” After battling for
just a short period of time, one of the drops of liquid azureflower
energy had already been used up. This shocked Ning and brought him
back to his senses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can’t kill
me!” Ning barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You. Die!” The
bluish-white scaled creature continued to fight in a berserk manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning took out the
warblade. This was the Dao weapon which he had picked up a short
while ago, and Ning had already bound it to himself quite some time
ago. In terms of raw power, it was even stronger than the
still-damaged Violetjewel!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“F*ck off!” Ning
exploded with power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swords are double-edged
weapons. Sabers have just a single blade. However, the tip of this
warblade was incredibly sharp, and thus it could also be used to
stab, split, and scrape, just as a sword would. Still, it was still
better suited for more explosive and forceful attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heavenbreaker
stance!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning held the warblade
in a two-handed grip. He allowed his divine power and the azureflower
mist energy to both blast forth at full power as he raised the
warblade up high, then furiously chopped down towards the
bluish-white scaled monster before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ‘Heavenbreaker
stance’ was Ning’s most forceful attack. Of Ning’s many
sword-arts, it was the sword-art which was best suited for use with a
weapon such as this warblade. In fact, after getting some insights
into the second stance of the [Nameless] sword-art, Ning’s
‘Heavenbreaker stance’ now contained even more of a killing
intent than it did before. When Ning unleashed this attack he was
striking downwards, resulting in the attack being sped up by the
howling wind. His saber-light flashed out far faster than the speed
of light, giving the bluish-white scaled monster no time to dodge at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“GWRAAAR!” The
monster confidently blocked with its claws.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous crescent
saber-light actually blasted the sharp claws aside, landing against
the creature’s scaly body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bluish-white scaled
creature was actually knocked backwards, scales shattering at the
point of impact and flying out of its body. It slammed into the stone
walls of the pit with a bang, causing the stone to tremble and
multiple cracks to appear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In raw power alone…with
the aid of the warblade, Ning was actually able to overpower even the
bluish-white beast. It was the beast’s own fault for being too
stupid; it had a mighty body that was stronger than even the body of
a World God, but the way in which it was able to use that power was
quite crude. It simply had far too low a level of insight into the
Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Or perhaps it might
have no insights at all. Perhaps all it knew was just the most basic
of attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AWOOOO!” After
smashing into the stone walls, the bluish-white creature suddenly
raised its head and let out a furious howl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Its howling voice
contained a strange, rippling wind to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sound of its voice
was carried away by the Windsource and instantly transmitted to a
different region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within a distant
pit, a windbeast that had been slumbering suddenly raised its head.
It murmured softly to himself, “An invader?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s an
invader?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That kid Fuu hasn’t
been alive long enough. He’s too weak, which is why we had him
stand watch over one of the least dangerous regions. And yet he’s
asking for reinforcements?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The windbeasts all
heard this sound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of them had
powerful auras, some of them had weak auras. Some of them actually
shook their heads and sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nine of the closest
windbeasts transformed into streaks of light, flying through the wind
like fish swimming through water. When Ning had seen the bluish-white
creature fly at high speed against the wind, he had been so terrified
that he immediately fled. Only after actually fighting it did he
realize that he was actually able to beat it. These windbeasts were
born in the Windsource, after all; this was why they were able to fly
within the wind with such ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His body is too
tough. Even my warblade is only able to chip off a few of its
scales.” Upon seeing this, Ning instantly lost all desire to fight
against the creature any longer. In a place as dangerous as this, he
couldn’t just waste his azureflower energy willy-nilly; if he ran
out, he’d die!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quickly clambered
upwards, moving more than a thousand kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Running?” The
bluish-white scaled monster continued its pursuit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What was that?!”
As Ning climbed upwards while blocking the attacks from the first
monster, Ning suddenly saw a second streak of light fly towards him
from down below.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Another one?!”
Ning was horrified. “Move! Move! Move!” Ning was truly panicking
now. He used four of his arms to furiously climb upwards while his
other two arms used the warblade to furiously strike down upon the
chasing windbeast. Each blow consumed quite a bit of his azureflower
energy, but each time the windbeast suffered just slight injuries. It
refused to give up the chase.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to climb
upwards at high speed. “I should be just a few thousand kilometers
away from the exit. Once I escape the pit, the gray wind won’t be
able to cause me any trouble. I’ll easily be able to fly faster
than the limits of the Heavenly Daos and it’ll be much easier for
me to deal with that monster.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can’t even
deal with a single invader?” The second streak of light had arrived
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Help me kill him,”
the first windbeast growled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shit.” Ning
gritted his teeth as he saw yet another streak of light appear in the
depths of the pit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How many of the
damned things are there?” As Ning continued to climb upwards, he
defended himself with two hands. He now wielded the warblade with one
hand, using it to launch incredibly powerful attacks. With the other
hand, he activated the slab that he had picked up, causing a flexible
sword to immediately fly out from within it. This was the second Dao
weapon which Ning had acquired.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The warblade was used
to launch ferocious, savage attacks. The flexible sword was used to
execute the ‘Shadowless stance’ and other unpredictable sword
stances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning’s other
four hands, he continued to use them to frantically climb upwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two of the windbeasts
furiously assaulted Ning, and he defended against them while
continuing to climb upwards. Right at this moment…the third
windbeast arrived as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“B-b-but…” Not
only was Ning facing the attacks of three windbeasts, he could see
two more streaks of light soaring upwards from the dark depths of the
pit. One of those streaks of light moved with incredible speed;
clearly, it was the fastest of the five.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I let them
surround me, I’m dead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning furiously defended
against their attacks, using his Dao weapons to block. He also
redirected some of their attacks, making it so that the three
windbeasts interfered with each other’s attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There it is!” Ning
could see the bright opening above him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gotta charge out!”
Ning could already see the fourth windbeast, the incredibly quick
one, drawing very close to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Ning
intentionally let himself be hit by a claw strike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! He borrowed the
power of the blow, letting it sweep him upwards and shoot him outside
of the pit entrance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“GRWAAAAR!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuu, not only were
you unable to kill him, you actually hindered me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You idiot! He was
barely able to handle me. You were useless!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Both of you, shut
up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All three of you
idiots, shut up!” The fourth windbeast let out a roar, causing the
other three to fall silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four windbeasts all
looked upwards, a look of rage and dread in their dark yellow eyes.
They didn’t dare fly out of their pit, as the Ruins were far too
incredibly dangerous. Even they were only able to live peacefully in
their local part of the Hundred Streams. There were many places which
were death traps even for them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” After flying
out of the pit and away from the gray wind, Ning landed on the
ground. He glanced towards the deep, enormous pit in surprise. “They
didn’t come out?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew. I finally
escaped!”

Chapter 25 - The House By the Lake
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning kept a firm
hold on the ground. Only when he saw that no windbeasts were emerging
did he relax and glance at his surroundings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning slowly
rose to his feet, looking around himself with surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vast skies were
filled with streams of gray energy that criss-crossed in the air. A
stream of gray energy was flowing through the endless pit he had just
crawled out of as well. Ning immediately understood that the gray
energy was actually the gray ‘wind’ which had enveloped him and
Hellsword earlier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When Hellsword and I
were fighting, we must’ve activated some restrictive spell by
accident, resulting in us being swept into that tornado.” Ning
carefully inspected the area. “If those windbeasts were too afraid
to come out here, it has to mean that this place is dangerous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was in a vast new
realm. Aside from some enormous pits, Ning could also see some
enormous continents, mountains, valleys, and lakes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everything looked so
peaceful!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning’s
heartrate began to speed up. Ever since he had manifested the
azureflower seal after merging the Nine Chaos Seals, Ning had become
even more keenly attuned to the essence of destiny. He was able to
easily see the future destinies of mortals at one glance, and he
could now sense that destiny was warning him that this place was
incredibly dangerous. It was as though those peaceful-looking
continents, mountains, and lakes were all filled with danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?”
Ning raised his head to stare towards the skies, then towards the
area around him. “I can sense that every single direction is filled
with grave danger.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If every direction
is filled with danger…and if the pits are filled with all those
windbeasts…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forget it. I’ll
just randomly choose a direction. It’ll be up to luck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After pondering for a
moment, Ning had no choice but to harden his heart. Warblade and
flexible sword in hands, he began to carefully move forward. If every
direction was filled with danger, then picking a particular direction
didn’t matter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning walked out of the
barren wastelands and into a grasslands. Although he sensed
tremendous danger the entire time, he made his way forward safely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Maybe I’ll be able
to walk out of this place,” Ning consoled himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The lake is quite
pretty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He saw a lake within
the grasslands, so beautiful that it looked like the tears of a
lovely maiden.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope nothing
dangerous suddenly pops out of the lake.” Ning continued to remain
vigilant, and he even kept the Goldstar Beads of the Heavens around
him, so as to help forewarn him of any incoming danger. Of course, if
he wasn’t strong enough no amount of vigilance would matter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A ripple suddenly
spread out and encompassed Ning, causing his surroundings to change
and transform.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is…?” Ning
stared at his surroundings. He could still see the beautiful lake,
but a quiet little residence had appeared by the side of the lake.
The house was emanating ripples that were so powerful, they caused
Ning to shiver.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense how
terrifying and deadly that house was. He wanted to move away from it,
but no matter how he walked he was unable to move farther than three
kilometers away from the house. It was as though space itself was
twisted here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I can’t leave,
I suppose I’ll have to go over and take a look,” Ning mused to
himself. “The person who built this house has to be far more
powerful than me. If he wants me dead, I won’t be able to escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had no other
options. His only choice was to go forward, and he did so, gently
pushing open the gates to the courtyard of the house.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Inside the courtyard
was a garden and a grassy lawn, as well as several seats that were
scattered across it. In the center was a graceful, elegant house that
emanated ripples of tremendous power. Ning walked over towards the
house.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three of the four sides
of the house had windows, while one side had a door. The windows were
made from wood and could be easily seen through.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning could
vaguely make out a figure seated in the lotus position inside the
house. This caused Ning to feel quite shocked. However, Ning still
chose to walk forward to the doors of the house.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Inside the house, there
was an old man dressed in golden Daoist robes who was seated atop a
prayer mat. The old man’s eyes were closed, and he was holding a
horsetail whisk in his hands. Next to him lay a miniature nine-level
pagoda.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His Daoist robes, his
whisk, the prayer mat, the nine-level pagoda…everything emanated
ripples of absolutely shocking power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That nine-level
pagoda in particular radiates an aura that is a hundred times as
powerful as the aura of the warblade. This was the aura which
Violetjewel gave me before I bound it.” Ning was stunned. “Can it
be that this nine-level pagoda is also a treasure that is on a higher
level than that of Dao weapons?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was no longer
the same person he was back in the Three Realms. He was now a vastly
more experienced figures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos treasures were
generally wielded by Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dao weapons were
generally employed by World Gods and Chaos Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for weapons which
surpassed Dao weapons like Violetjewel or this tower…they were
items which would drive any World-level expert mad with desire!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His robes, the
whisk, the prayer mat…those three are all Dao weapons, and they
each have auras that are as strong as the aura of my warblade.”
Ning’s own eyes were shining with desire as well. The treasures
that he could see were already enough to drive any World-level expert
mad with lust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…it seems as
though this old man is already dead?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sensed no life
energy at all from the old man’s body, only an aura of ancient
might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll give it a
test.” Ning moved many steps backwards, then willed his Protocosmic
spirit-rope to fly out. Ning didn’t dare to actually approach the
old man and try to take the treasures himself, for fear of activating
some sort of dangerous spell or formation. Thus, he instead willed
his Protocosmic spirit-rope to loop around the nine-level pagoda,
intending to tug it over. If he could acquire that pagoda, this
entire trip would be more than worth it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The pagoda was
something which even World-level experts would go crazy for. The only
reason why World God Northrest was able to acquire Violetjewel was
due to the assistance of Vastheaven Palace. For Ning to be able to so
easily acquire another such treasure was simply a bit of staggeringly
good luck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the Protocosmic rope
moved within nine meters of the old man, a wind suddenly arose around
him. As the wind blew past the Protocosmic spirit-rope, half of it
was instantly disintegrated into dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A series of words
suddenly appeared in midair, every single character gleaming with
golden light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fellow Daoist who
is capable of defeating the Windsource Formation shall acquire my
treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was filled with
both shock and desire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Windsource Formation?
What was the connection between it and the Hundred Streams of the
Windsource? Could it be that this old man was the creator of these
ancient ruins? If he really was, could this house be the house where
he lived? Ning couldn’t quite believe it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you die, you die.
Why did you have to put up these formations and spells?” Ning’s
head hurt. He had grown dramatically more powerful, but he was still
just barely capable of damaging a Protocosmic spirit-treasure. To
instantly disintegrate it into dust? He was far from capable of such
a thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me try it
again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning willed a large
battleaxe to appear. This battleaxe was covered with divine runes,
and it was a top-grade Chaos treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A top-grade Chaos
treasure…I refuse to believe you can destroy it.” Ning
immediately used his Immortal energy to send the battleaxe to fly
towards the seated old man. Once more, when the axe reached nine
meters of the old man, a wind arose. Hissssss! When the wind blew
across the axe, it emitted an ear-piercing hiss.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The axe remained
undamaged…but it was unable to advance any further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
Ning could sense incredibly powerful energy blocking his battleaxe’s
path. No matter how hard he ‘pushed’, he was unable to make it
advance at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a stream of
energy flew out from the nine-level pagoda next to the seated old
man. The stream of energy transformed into the appearance of a
black-robed child.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop trying. You
aren’t even a World-level expert. Why are you wasting your time?”
The black-robed child snapped rather irritably.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…” Ning was
startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m a treasure
spirit. Haven’t you seen one before?” The black-robed child
glanced sideways at the old man’s corpse, then said, “And you can
stop lusting after the old man’s treasures. Even if you managed to
break through the Windsource Formation, you’d have to swear a
lifeblood oath first. Only after accomplishing it would you be
allowed to acquire these treasures. As for breaking through the
formation? Only peak World Gods would have a shot at it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only peak World Gods
would have a shot at it?” Ning was puzzled. “What level was this
senior at?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was just a peak
World God as well.” The black-robed child smirked. “However, he
was one of the servants of Daolord Windsource, who gave him a few
treasures like the Windsource Formation. Although no one is currently
commanding it, it’ll still be very hard for anyone to break through
it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This all made sense.
The deceased World God had used the phrase, ‘the fellow Daoist who
is capable of defeating the Windsource Formation’; for him to use
the words ‘fellow Daoist’ meant that the person capable of
defeating the formation would probably on the same general level of
power as he had been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh. When Daolord
Windsource died, all of his servants accompanied him to the grave. If
he died, he died, but why the hell did the old man have to keep me
trapped here as well?” The black-robed child sighed, then shook his
head. “I’m a venerable treasure that has a quintessence inside,
but I’ve been trapped here for ages. What a waste!”

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A magic treasure that
had a quintessence core within it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right. Violetjewel had
a quintessence core within it as well. Its physical body had suffered
incredible damage but the quintessence core inside of it was
completely unharmed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t you want to
leave?” Ji Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course I do. I’m
bored to death here.” The black-robed child glanced sideways at
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aside from breaking
the Windforce Formation and swearing a lifeblood oath, is there truly
no other way of taking you away?” Ning asked. “If you can tell me
a way, I’ll definitely do my best to carry it out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well, there is.”
The black-robed child nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There is? What?”
Ning’s eyes lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Become a Daolord
first,” the black-robed child said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly felt
speechless. The only Daolord in the Badlands Territory which Ning was
aware of was Daolord Badlands. There might be other Daolords who were
in seclusion, but regardless of how many were present, their level of
power was a level far beyond Ning’s. If Ning truly did become a
Daolord in the future, it wouldn’t be hard for him to acquire
treasures such as this. Didn’t Daolord Windsource himself parcel
out such treasures to his World God servants?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One could imagine how
fabulously wealthy Daolords were!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How many servants
did Daolord Windsource have exactly?” Ning asked curiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kid, you aren’t
even a World God yet.” The black-robed child shook his head, then
said in a smug manner, “Let me broaden your horizons a bit, then.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, right.”
Ning’s eyes lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Windsource
had a rather weird disposition, but he truly was an incredible
figure. He roved through the endless primordial chaos and journeyed
through many of its territories. He directly enslaved over five
hundred World-level experts, with more than a hundred others
willingly joining him as retainers…” The black-robed child let
out an amazed sigh. “In fact, he even had a Daolord as his
retainer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning was
shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Incredible, right?”
The black-robed child said smugly, “When Daolord Windsource
descended upon this territory, the owner of this territory came out
and welcomed him with great ceremony and courtesy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But alas…I heard
that Daolord Windsource failed in his attempts to merge his Hundred
Streams together down. Before dying, he exiled his eldest disciple,
the one who had become a Daolord, as well as some other disciples and
retainers. He then led all of his slaves and the rest of his
World-level retainers to this place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to what
Daolord Windsource said, this was his ancient homeland. He left this
place long, long ago and voyaged through the outside the world. If he
was to die, he wished to die at home.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, his
ancestral chaosworld had vanished long ago. Thus, Daolord Windsource
established the Windsource Chaosworld in the same location where his
ancient chaosworld had been. He then established the Windsource
Ruins. Supposedly, he did all this to show off all the insights into
the Dao he had gained during his life. After leaving his Dao
behind…he died.” The black-robed child pointed towards the seated
old man. “Look. That’s one of the poor bastards who served him
and was forced to join him in death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“More than five
hundred World-level experts joined him in death?” Ning was
speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
black-robed child nodded. “Daolords, y’know? Daolord Windsource
was actually pretty peaceful. Some of the crazier Daolords will go
completely berserk. When they die, they will make their entire
territory die along with them, going so far as to slaughter every
living being they can find before dying in a sea of corpses.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning truly was unable
to say anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Make an entire
territory die with them, then continuing to slaughter until they
themselves perished?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Madmen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more powerful a
person was, the more terrifying they would be when gripped by
madness. It seemed as though Daolord Windsource really was fairly
calm by comparison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So you are saying
that more than five hundred World-level experts died in these ruins?”
Ning sighed in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Samsara Daolord,
more than five hundred World-level experts, and an enormous number of
Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals all died here,” the black-robed
child said. “Over the course of countless years, quite a few
treasure-seeking cultivators have died here as well, leaving behind
many of their own treasures. Thus, this place really is like a giant
treasure vault. The only question is…are you strong enough to loot
it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are actually
pretty lucky.” The black-robed child let out a sigh. “You
actually were able to find this place. The wind is formless and
fickle, and thus the internal structure of Daolord Windsource’s
estate is also ever-changing. Since you were able to find this place,
you now have a chance of being able to escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A chance of being
able to escape?” Ning was surprised and delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. There’s a
pavilion over there. Once you go inside of it, it’ll teleport you
to the outer regions. The outer regions are much safer than this
place,” the black-robed child said. “Alright, that’s all. Hurry
up and beat it. You were lucky enough to find this estate this time,
but you probably won’t be so lucky next time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After speaking, the
black-robed youth flew back into the nine-level pagoda.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning once more turned
his gaze towards the golden-robed old man who was seated in the lotus
position within the house. He couldn’t help but shake his head and
sigh. This old man was a peak World God; most likely, he was on par
with even the likes of World God Northrest or even stronger. And
yet…his destiny had been to accompany his master unto death!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Windsource had
only driven away some of his disciples and retainers. The rest of his
retainers, along with his slaves, had all died with him here.
Apparently, the retainers who had died were the ones he didn’t
like. The ones he did like, he had exiled along with those disciples,
sparing them instead of having them die with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The treasures are
right there in front of me, but I just can’t get at them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forget it. Time to
go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew that luck and
fortune couldn’t be forced. If he really was lucky, he’d be able
to find a World God’s corpse that wasn’t protected by any
formations or spells at all, allowing him to easily take away any
treasures. That would really be a helluva stroke of luck!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And yet, he was still
fairly lucky. Although he hadn’t been able to acquire the
treasures, he had learned of a safe route out of here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After leaving the
house, he turned to glance one final time at the golden-robed elder’s
corpse. Only then did Ning begin to make his way through the
courtyard. There were a total of three pavilions within the
courtyard, but Ning was in no rush to leave. Instead, he first
inspected the other rooms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There might be some
other treasures left here,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning really did find
something inside one of the rooms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a room with a
study. There was a table here, a quill pen having been tossed atop of
it. The table was covered with golden paper, but there was plenty of
paper scattered on the ground as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn. Damn. Damn.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn me for choosing
to serve that old bastard.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn that old
bastard for being unfair and partial.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You damn well
deserved to lose your Dao and die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The words on the paper
were filled with hatred. In truth, the retainers didn’t realize
what had happened right away. Only after Daolord Windsource had
sealed their truesouls did they understand what was happening. Given
that it was guaranteed that their souls would soon be shattered, how
could these slaves and retainers possibly feel afraid of him any
longer? For them to merely vent their rage on a few pieces of paper
was nothing!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A pity for them that
Daolord Windsource had already went into silent seclusion to wait for
death to come. How could he possibly care about the ravings and
curses of these ant-like beings?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the instant of his
death, the seals covering the truesouls of his slaves and retainers
were all activated, causing all of their truesouls to be destroyed as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This World God
must’ve been fond of calligraphy. This pen is actually a Dao
weapon.” Ning was amazed. This was the first time he had seen a
pen-shaped Dao weapon. He hurriedly picked it up and easily bound it
to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The quill of this pen
could transform into countless strands of white thread that could
entangle one’s foes, while the tip of the pen could be used as an
awl or dagger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It could be used for
soft attacks or hard attacks. This truly was a fierce weapon.
However, the deceased World God had long ago grown accustomed to
using it for calligraphy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I keep searching,
perhaps I’ll find more.” Ning thoroughly searched the rest of the
rooms but found nothing else. Still, Ning was in an excellent mood. A
quick search had resulted in him gaining a pen-shaped Dao weapon
which other Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals would go mad over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go.” Not
hesitating at all, Ning immediately began to move towards the
pavilions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were three
pavilions in total. Ning used his Immortal energy to take control of
the nearby grass to test the pavilions out. When he sent the grass
into the second pavilion, the grass suddenly disappeared as it was
teleported away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There it is. It
really was teleported away. I wonder if it was teleported to some
place safe or some place dangerous.” Ning could sense the ripples
from the teleportation. “At least there’s a chance of getting out
of here. In I go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning strode forward,
entering the pavilion. As he did so…swoosh! He disappeared into
thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning re-appeared
somewhere else in the middle of the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where am I?” Ning
glanced downwards, a look of delight instantly appearing on his face.
“The region I was in previously?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had been journeying
through this region for more than a year before encountering and
battling Hellsword. Only then had he been swept into the Hundred
Streams of the Windsource. Now, he had made it back to this dangerous
region. However, Ning now knew that compared to the core regions he
had just escaped, this ‘dangerous region’ and the swamps were all
incredibly safe. Even Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals were able to
wander through this region with ease!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I managed to come
back with quite a haul of treasures. If I died in there, all my
treasure-scavenging would’ve been for nothing.” Ning was filled
with contentment and happiness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly stared
off into the distance. His vision was incredibly keen, especially
after the azureflower energy began reinforcing every part of his
body. He was now able to see to great distances with the naked eye,
and he immediately saw a warship drifting through the distant skies
next to a chain of mountains. This warship had been resized to be
merely a few dozen meters long, and it clung tightly to the chain of
mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder God Skysouth?”
Ning immediately recognized the warship. He couldn’t help but
murmur to himself, “It seems the two of us really are destined to
clash.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately began
to fly towards the warship, the Goldstar Beads of the Heavens
swirling around him.

Chapter 27 - Ji Ning and the Flamefairy
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Karma was truly a
wondrous, mysterious thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ji Ning flew towards
the warship, he couldn’t help but sigh. When he had first entered
the Ruins, Elder God Skysouth had relied on his army of slaves to
attack Ning and attempt to seize Ning’s treasures. In truth, Ning
didn’t hold much of a grudge. Anyone who entered the world of
cultivation had to abide by its many unspoken rules, and combat was
extremely common within the Ruins. If Ning truly had been killed, he
would’ve only blamed himself for being too weak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Back then, he had
elected to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After roaming about the
Hundred Streams of the Windsource, he had ended up acquiring multiple
Dao weapons and had mastered the Nine Chaos Seals, materializing the
azureflower seal and growing dramatically more powerful. And now, as
soon as he exited the Hundred Streams, he had run into Elder God
Skysouth once more. If there was no enmity whatsoever between the
two, Ning probably would’ve just left; that was the type of person
he was. But now that there was a bit of bad blood…Ning didn’t
hesitate at all in choosing to chase after him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This, too, was karma!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Destiny and karma
truly do work in unfathomable ways.” Ning could sense the
unfathomably distant and vast essence-river of destiny ebbing and
surging.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was now able to see
the fate of mortals with but a single glance, discerning their future
joys and sorrows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Truly formidable
cultivators, however…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning found it difficult
to see their destinies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although destiny was
often viewed as being abstruse, it actually operated on simple
principles. Destiny was formed by the entangling of countless
different strings of karma. For example, Ji Ning held a grudge
against Old Man Yuan, which was why Ji Ning had ended up joining
Fogstone and being stationed here on the Windsource Chaosworld! But
of course, the secret workings of destiny were trillions of times
more complicated than the simple ‘cause and effect’ of karma.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood another
principle as well. The past was difficult to change, but the future
was not.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, Ning might
be able to see the destined life path of a mortal, but because the
future had yet to actually happen, for that mortal’s destiny to be
changed wouldn’t be too hard. For example, if a powerful cultivator
suddenly chose to intervene in that mortal’s life, that mortal’s
destiny would easily be changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Book of Life and
Death was a good example. It set down the destined fates of mortals,
but if that mortal gained great karmic merit, his life could be
completely changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, Ning had the
sneaking suspicion that some unfathomably powerful figures might be
capable of reversing things that had already occurred in the past!
For example…perhaps a cultivator whose truesoul was destroyed could
be revived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was Ning’s
greatest hope and goal as he continued on his path of cultivation.
His greatest desire was to see his beloved wife be brought back to
life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to chase
after the warship, moving closer and closer to it, but his mind began
to wander as he began to ponder on the workings of karma and destiny.
In truth, he didn’t view Elder God Skysouth as much of an opponent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hundred Elder Gods in
an Elder God Formation were very formidable and were capable of
holding off even a World God for a period of time, but Ning didn’t
intend to give Elder God Skysouth the chance to act as he pleased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The warship continued
to slowly fly through the mountains. Elder God Skysouth was seated on
at the front of the ship, lazily watching the skies before him. Next
to him was a table covered with wine and delicacies, along with two
female servants who were attending to him. Behind him were six Elder
Gods and Ancestral Immortals who were maintaining a watchful
vigilance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In front of the
warship, a blazing figure was fleeing at high speed. The area around
this fiery-robed woman was filled with countless daggers of flame.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flamefairy.” Elder
God Skysouth chortled. “You’ve been fleeing for quite some time
now. I imagine you should understand that you won’t be able to
escape me. If I wanted to, I could’ve caught you long ago. However,
I chose not to. I can’t bear to see such an unmatchably beautiful
Immortal maiden like yourself die within a place like this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All I want you to do
is be one of my retainers. Why must you be so stubborn?” Elder God
Skysouth drained all the wine from his winecup. The female servant
next to him smiled flirtatiously and quickly helped him fill it once
more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just a retainer?”
The fleeing Su Youji laughed coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You look ravishing
when you are angry, Flamefairy. Your [Libertine Dream] technique
truly is alluring.” Elder God Skysouth couldn’t help but sigh in
praise. “I’m not asking that much. All you need to do is serve me
as a retainer while also being my pleasure-companion. What’s the
point of cultivation? It is to be able to travel as far as we can on
our paths with our hearts filled with pleasure. But for someone like
me…I no longer have any hopes with regards to cultivation. All I
can seek is excitement and pleasure, yes?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I train in the
[Libertine Dream]. I cannot possibly become your pleasure-companion,”
Su Youji sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Libertine Dream]
technique did not permit the user to lose her virginity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a technique
which Su Youji had devised for herself after she saw fragments of an
ancient technique. Su Youji had improved with dramatic speed after
developing this technique. She had been cultivating for less than a
million years but had long ago become comparable to a supreme Elder
God or Ancestral Immortal. However, because she was a Ki Refiner, she
was a bit weaker than Fiendgod Body Refiners in close combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The forbidden fruits
taste the sweetest.” Elder God Skysouth let out a soft sigh, his
voice echoing by Su Youji’s ears. “Someone like me can buy and
sell even female Ancestral Immortals as chattel, but one as
mesmerizing as you is almost impossible to find. I urge you to stop
running. If you keep running around like this, you might wind up
activating a dangerous formation of some sort.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Elder God Skysouth was
quite relaxed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as he had seen
Flamefairy Su Youji, he had immediately desired to possess her and
had tried to force her to become his retainer. She knew that she
wasn’t a match for him and so had been willing to bow her head,
but…the lifeblood oath which Elder God Skysouth had wanted her to
swear had been simply too onerous. Although she was a ‘retainer’
in name, in reality she would be nothing more than a toy for him to
enjoy. The reason why she was known as the Flamefairy was because she
had an explosive, fiery temper. There was no way she would accept
such terms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She had trained for
less than a million years. Even though she was just a Ki Refiner, she
was still comparable to supreme Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals.
She had an extremely high level of insight into the Dao and could
quite possibly reach the World-level of power. How could someone like
her possibly be willing to become someone else’s plaything?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Elder God Skysouth
was quite patient. He was willing to slowly chase after her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had once tried to
send his servants to chase after her, but she had furiously fled at
maximum speed. Skysouth had immediately recalled his servants. Such a
high-speed chase could easily result in the activation of some hidden
formation, and he wasn’t willing to see the Flamefairy die like
this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, he had slowly
chased after her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the Flamefairy
fleeing at a fairly low speed, he wouldn’t be in much danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, since she
was running in front of him while he was slowly chasing from behind,
she was essentially serving as a scout for him that was helping him
test and see if the area up ahead was safe or not. Where else could
he possibly find a free scout like her? He needed time to tame the
Flamefairy’s unruly spirit anyhow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To tame such a
peerlessly beautiful Immortal woman was no easy feat. Time would be
needed…but once he succeeded…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just the thought of it
made him quiver.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is there?!”
Elder God Skysouth suddenly put away his warship and turned to look
behind himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two female servants
next to him were badly frightened, but the six Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals simply looked backwards with vigilance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Behind them was a
white-robed youth who was flying straight towards them, surrounded by
countless golden beads that were swirling around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful, Master.”
The six were shocked, as they all recognized Ji Ning. The two most
powerful of them had used treasures to attack Ning faster than the
speed of light, but Ning had broken through their attacks with one
blow and then easily escaped.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Sentinel?”
Elder God Skysouth smirked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooooosh! A large
group of Elder Gods immediately appeared around him. These were the
hundred Elder Gods which Skysouth carried with him at all times
inside an estate-treasure. This represented the greatest force he
could muster. When traveling through the Ruins, he often put on a
show of being weak. When he actually got close to other Elder Gods
and Ancestral Immortals, he would suddenly summon all of his
subordinates.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him! Let’s
see if he dares to flee through this region at high speed like
before!” Elder God Skysouth pointed straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was no fool. Last
time, when the two had fought each other, Skysouth had quickly
realized that this ‘Sentinel’ was a formidable expert who had the
power of a truly transcendent Elder God in power. Thus, this time he
immediately ordered all hundred of his Elder Gods to attack! Last
time, Ning had been able to escape because they were in the swamps;
this time, they were in a much more dangerous region. Logically
speaking, he wouldn’t dare to flee at such high speed through it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hundred Elder Gods
all immediately charged towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Him?” The fleeing
Flamefairy, Su Youji, was glancing backwards as well. She saw that
Elder God Skysouth had come to a halt and had instead turned his
attention towards a white-robed youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She recognized that
youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Over a year ago, this
youth had flown past her. However, the two had only exchanged
glances, not words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s in danger.”
In her heart, Su Youji was definitely cheering for Ji Ning. She was
filled with anger and hatred towards Elder God Skysouth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Faced with a hundred
attacking Elder Gods, Ning drew a thin, slender sword. This was the
flexible Dao sword he had acquired earlier. It could be used as
either a soft weapon or a hard weapon, and its slenderness made it
very suitable for intricate, unpredictable sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not only did Ning not
flee, he instead charged straight towards the hundred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He isn’t fleeing?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s courting
death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hundred Elder Gods
were filled with confidence. They didn’t fear anyone below the
World-level of power in a frontal clash. Alright, perhaps they might
fear one of those legendary monsters who could defeat World-level
experts despite being mere Elder Gods…but what were the chances of
running into such a figure?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” “Die!”
Saber-light and axe-light flashed through the air, howling towards
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly
dramatically sped up, instantly surpassing the speed of light as he
shot out in a solitary arc, moving past all hundred Elder Gods. The
Elder Gods wanted to hack at him with their weapons, but none of them
were able to attack faster than the speed of light. They couldn’t
even touch the hem of Ning’s clothes, to say nothing of Ning
himself. Ning easily moved past them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Ning flew
straight towards Elder God Skysouth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How?! Impossible!”
Elder God Skysouth was truly frightened now. There were very few
experts capable of moving faster than the limits of the Heavenly
Daos. Generally speaking, only World Gods were capable of this! The
Lord of All Fiends was one of the very few exceptions. He was so
ridiculously fast that even Mother Nuwa, who had just become a World
God, was unable to catch up to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop him!”
Skysouth hurriedly directed his six bodyguards to defend him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, all of you
come back!” He hurriedly ordered the rest of the hundred Elder Gods
to return as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning had
arrived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six bodyguards all
readied their various weapons and treasures, using them to attack
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gotta hold. Gotta
hold! If I can hold for just a few moments, my Elder God Formation
will make it back here.” Elder God Skysouth hurriedly manifested a
three-headed, six-armed form as well. Each of his six arms wielded a
long hook, and he sought to use them to defend and buy himself some
time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But alas, the
white-robed youth had already arrived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light flashed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The attacks of the six
bodyguards all missed. They did their best but were unable to even so
much as touch Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! A sword suddenly
stabbed at Elder God Skysouth’s throat. Because he wore a
protective suit of armor, the sword wasn’t able to pierce through
his throat, but…the powerful force contained within Ning’s sword
was powerful enough to cause Skysouth’s body to be instantly
disintegrated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You-…” Skysouth
stared in disbelief at the white-robed Ning. How could this be? Even
during their previous battle, this Sentinel had been limited to the
speed of light. His sword-arts weren’t as fast as they were now
either! Why was he so terrifyingly strong this time?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, he had
no idea that the azureflower mist energy in Ning’s body had made
him both stronger and faster, allowing him to easily overpower the
limits of the Heavenly Daos with his sword through raw strength.
Ning’s sword-arts were profound to begin with, and this time they
were significantly faster than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skysouth’s body
completely disintegrated. How could someone like him possibly endure
a head-on sword-strike by a World-level expert?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His six bodyguards, his
two female servants, his hundred Elder God slaves…their eyes
instantly turned dim and all signs of life vanished from their
bodies. They were slaves. Long ago, their lives had become
inextricably linked to the life of their master! This was a way of
ensuring that slaves would truly work hard to protect their masters.
If their master died, they would not be able to escape death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To tell you the
truth, you actually had a chance at staying alive.” Ning began
glancing through the treasures which Elder God Skysouth had left
behind. “If you had kept those hundred Elder Gods around you at all
times, I wouldn’t have been able to get you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World-level experts
were able to move faster than the limits of the Heavenly Daos. How,
then, would a hundred Elder Gods in a formation be able to fight back
against such a foe? All other methods were suicidal; the only method
was to defeat motion with stillness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Elder God Skysouth
had ordered the hundred Elder Gods to stay around him and protect him
at all times, there was no way Ning would’ve been able to breach
such a turtle-shell defense. However, Skysouth had been so confident
in his ability to defeat anyone aside from a World-level figure that
he had ordered all hundred Elder Gods to attack instead. This
rendered his own defenses vulnerable enough that any World-level
expert would be capable of effortlessly dodging past the Elder God
formation to slay him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skysouth couldn’t
really be blamed. How could he have ever imagined that Ji Ning was
this strong?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“B-but…” The
distant Su Youji was completely dazed by what she saw. “He flies
faster than the limits of the Heavenly Daos, his sword-arts are
faster than the speed of light, and his blows are so powerful as to
destroy an Elder God’s armor-protected body. Seven Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals fought against him, but they weren’t even able
to touch his sword…what the hell level is this guy at?!”
</P>

Chapter 28 - The First Retainer
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He can break through
the limits of the Heavenly Daos as he pleases.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quite a few of Elder
God Skysouth’s servants were supreme Elder Gods, but they were
still unable to so much as touch him. They were like toddlers facing
off against a giant.” Su Youji was truly stunned by what she had
just seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prior to mastering the
Nine Chaos Seals and manifesting the azureflower seal, even if Ning
had Violetjewel on him he would’ve still had to use it to block the
enemy’s weapons. This time, however, he had the azureflower energy
powering his body, upgrading it considerably and making it much
faster in every way. His enhanced body was fast, his sword was fast,
and his sword-arts were incredibly profound. This was why his enemies
hadn’t even been able to touch him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is he a World-level
expert?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But he clearly is an
Elder God. His Elder God aura is very noticeable. I saw him just a
few years ago; he definitely was an Elder God back then. There’s no
mistaking it at all.” Su Youji’s heart was shaking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She had suddenly
thought of something.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was fairly easy for
most Elder Gods to become ranked as ‘standard’ Elder Gods or
‘elite’ Elder Gods. ‘Supreme’ Elder Gods would be considered
experts. As for ‘transcendent’ Elder Gods, they were truly
formidable figures, and the generals of the Fogstone Army were all at
that level. When they used certain weapons or certain explosive
techniques, they might even be able to temporarily reach the World
level of power. When Ning had first gone to Fogstone, he was just
barely at the World God level of power when he used Violetjewel.
However, if he had battled against a true World God, he probably
would’ve been defeated in a single blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But according to the
legends…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were some true
monsters who could accomplish the impossible!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were truly
invincible amongst Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals…and some of
them were so terrifyingly strong as to be able to slay even World
Gods and Chaos Immortals! However, less than one in a million Elder
Gods would ever reach such a level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I actually ended up
running this one of those legendary monsters.” Su Youji grew
excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Someone like Ning was
capable of fighting against World-level experts despite merely being
an Elder God and Ancestral Immortal. Once he became a World God, he
would instantly become one of the most elite of World Gods!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I miss an
opportunity like this, I’ll regret it for the rest of my life.”
Su Youji quickly came to her decision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All this seemed to
happen in slow motion, but in truth it happened in an instant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After slaying Skysouth,
Ning waved his hand and caused the corpses of thousand Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals to be swept into his storage treasure. After
putting them away, he said, “I’ll find a suitable burial ground
for some of these corpses in this estate-world. The deceased figures
had all died on their own paths of Immortal cultivation; Ning would
rather bury them than allow their corpses to remain there in the air.
He wanted to build a special graveyard for Immortals and Fiendgods
here, so as to constantly remind himself that his path was a perilous
one that required the utmost of caution.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist!”
The distant fiery-robed Flamefairy immediately flew towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned his head to
glance at her, immediately recognizing her. He had encountered her a
few years ago when he had first entered this region. He nodded
slightly. “It seems we truly do have a bit of fate connecting us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Indeed.” Su Youji
said curiously, “Don’t you recognize me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are…?” Ning
looked at her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had only purchased
a single star map, one which primarily explained the various major
organizations located within the Badlands Territory. It focused on
the World-level experts as well as a few incredibly powerful Elder
Gods and Ancestral Immortals. As for the Elder Gods and Ancestral
Immortals who spent most of their time roaming and adventuring, there
was very little information regarding them. This was why Ning wasn’t
able to immediately recognize figures such as Elder God Skysouth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hellsword had belonged
to one of the local organization; he was simply out on a brief
adventure. This was why Ning recognized him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My name is Su Youji.
Most people refer to me as the ‘Flamefairy’,” Su Youji said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can simply
address me as Sunrise,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Su Youji
looked at Ning, her eyes shining. “Fellow Daoist Sunrise, would you
be willing to accept me as your retainer?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Retainer?” Ning
was startled for a moment before understanding that the Flamefairy
must have seen him slay Elder God Skysouth. He had long ago heard
that some extremely powerful Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals would
have other such figures be willing to serve them as retainers.
However, it was incredibly rare for someone to voluntarily offer to
join someone in such a fashion!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m a Ki Refiner
but I an comparable to a supreme Elder God,” Su Youji said
hurriedly. “I’ve trained for less than a million years and stand
a chance of becoming a World-level expert.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A retainer who had a
chance of becoming a World-level expert was completely different from
one who did not.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning
carefully scrutinized Su Youji.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He did indeed wish to
acquire some retainers; in fact, if he wasn’t able to find enough,
he would go and purchase some slaves. Although he was now very
powerful, even World-level experts had need of an army of
cultivators, to say nothing of him. An army of a thousand Elder Gods
in a formation could very well slay even a World-level figure!
However, this was mostly dependent on the strength of the combination
formation as well as sturdy Immortal estates that could resist
outside attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This allowed them to
both attack or retreat in relatively safety. Who wouldn’t want such
an army?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, a formation
that could use a thousand Elder Gods or a thousand Ancestral
Immortals wasn’t easily acquired. Even if Ning did manage to
acquire one, he would need a number of commanders who had reached
very high levels of comprehension in the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Ki Refiner?”
Ning looked at Su Youji. “Attack me using your most powerful
techniques. If I find you acceptable, you may be my retainer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Su
Youji’s eyes lit up. “Be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!” Su Youji
raised her milky-white hand, pointing towards Ning with a finger as
red light flashed in her eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!! Nine streaks of
fiery red light simultaneously shot out around her. If one carefully
inspected them, one would see that every single stream of fiery red
light was actually formed from an enormous number of fiery blades.
These nine streams of fiery red light joined together into a perfect
whole, coming to form a beautiful, nine-tailed bird. The bird’s
entire body blazed with flames as it charged straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had an aura of
tremendous power and incomparable dominance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She’s merely an
Ancestral Immortal, yet she has such tremendous power. And I have the
feeling…that this technique hasn’t revealed its full power yet.”
Ning instantly understood that the Flamefairy had been telling the
truth. She did indeed possess a high level of insight; in this
regard, she was probably comparable to transcendent Elder Gods in
power. However, because she was a Ki Refiner and didn’t have access
to any powerful divine abilities, in battle she was merely comparable
to a supreme Elder God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stretched out with
his right hand. It increased dramatically in length, transforming to
become dozens of meters in size as his palm became as crystalline as
jade.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine-tailed
firebird slammed directly against Ning’s palm. Countless sparks of
fiery light appeared on the surface of Ning’s palm, but in the end
the firebird was completely destroyed while Ning’s palm was
completely undamaged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wasn’t even able
to shake him.” Su Youji was secretly shocked by what she saw. “So
he’s this powerful, even in terms of just raw strength?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning had killed
Elder God Skysouth, he had focused on speed and sword-arts. This
time, he revealed his terrifying raw strength.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning looked
at Su Youji and nodded. “Very well. I’ll accept you as my
retainer. Here’s an oathstone. Take a look for yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were two types of
retainer relationships.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first type of
relationship was like the one between Saber and Godfiend Witherspike.
His status had been nearly identical to that of his master’s. In
this type of relationship, both the master and the retainer would
swear lifeblood oaths; only then would the two trust each other. But
of course, the master’s lifeblood oath would be much looser.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second type of
retainer involved a relationship like the one between Daolord
Windsource and some of his World Gods. Those World Gods had chosen to
serve him in the hopes that he would provide them with guidance and
tutelage. They naturally had a much lower status than him. All of
them had to swear lifeblood oaths to Daolord Windsource, but the
Daolord naturally would never swear one to them. Whenever he was in
the mood, he would occasionally impart them with a bit of guidance.
That would be enough to make those World Gods delirious with joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The relationship
between Ning and Su Youji belonged to the first type.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji feared just
one thing…that Ji Ning would force himself upon her. Her [Libertine
Dream] technique was one which required her to be a virgin until the
day she became a World God. Given how strong Ning was, if he wanted
to force himself upon her there was no way she’d be able to fight
back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning heard Su
Youji’s request, he felt absolutely speechless. Still, in the end
he just chuckled and swore the oath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youji greets you,
Master.” After the two swore their lifeblood oaths, the
relationship between them had changed permanently. Su Youji beamed at
Ning as she bowed, her smile filled with endless charm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded and smiled
as well. “You are the very first retainer I’ve ever accepted.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ll definitely
accept more and more in the future, Master.” Su Youji’s eyes were
shining with light. “But I’ll always be your first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go. We’re
going to leave the Ruins,” Ning said. “Oh, right. My true Daoist
name is ‘Darknorth’. ‘Sunrise’ is just a Daoist name I’m
temporarily using.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As you wish,
Master.” Su Youji followed by Ning’s side, but in her heart she
was mumbling to herself, “Darknorth? Darknorth?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two travelled more
than ten thousand kilometers through the mountain range before
finally reaching a region where the skies were filled with mist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two immediately
soared into the skies, flying into the mist. They then disappeared
into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Windsource Ruins
were perpetually shrouded in clouds and mist. Whenever you found a
place in the dangerous areas or in the swamps where you could see the
mist, all you had to do was fly into the mist and you would be able
to leave! This was something everyone knew about the Windsource
Ruins.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eastcalm Mountains.
The Sunrise Courtyard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two streaks of light
descended upon the courtyard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is my
residence,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You live here on the
Windsource Chaosworld, Master?” Su Youji was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. I’m a
Sentinel of Fogstone,” Ning said. He couldn’t help but let out a
sigh. He had spent quite a few years wandering the Ruins, but Elder
God Mountain Eater and the other soldiers stationed here had never
sought him out. Ning had ordered that they were to immediately
contact him if the forces of God Emperor Blacklotus invaded. Once
they shattered the message talisman which Ning had given them, Ning
would immediately know what had happened and would return from the
Ruins.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, it made sense.
He had spent a hundred years in training without any attacks
occurring. This most recent adventure had only lasted a few years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Choose a place for
yourself to live in,” Ning instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.” Su
Youji turned her head to glance at a nearby room, then pointed
towards it and said, “Then I’ll live right over here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, then
retired to his own private rooms. He began to carefully inspect the
treasures he had acquired during this journey through the Ruins. He
had acquired quite a few treasures, as well as several storage-type
treasures which he hadn’t even had the chance to inspect carefully
yet.

Chapter 29 - Reaping the Rewards
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Half a day later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was seated by
himself at the highest point on the mountain where the Sunrise
Courtyard was located. He was staring at the vast skies, the chains
of mountains, and the distant plains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really made a
killing this time!” Ning let out a blissful sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had already bound
all of the treasures he had acquired in the Ruins, including the
storage treasures. He had also completely finished sorting through
the items in the storage treasures as well. There had indeed been a
number of unexpected surprises for Ning, such as a Chaos-level
estate-treasure which Ning suspected was originally owned by a
World-level expert!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because this
estate-treasure actually had a pair of Dao weapons within it! It also
had a star map and a jade slip containing information regarding the
Windsource Ruins, both of which seemed to be far better than what an
Ancestral Immortal or Elder God should be capable of acquiring.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The star map included
records of the Badlands Territory and five nearby territories, with
the Badlands Territory having the most detailed markings. Every Elder
God and Ancestral Immortal who had even the slightest bit of renown
was recorded down within this star map, including even the newer ones
like Su Youji the Flamefairy. Generally speaking, only World-level
experts could acquire star maps of such detail which covered such a
vast expanse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And that jade slip! The
World-level expert who originally owned it must have sought out a
great deal of information regarding the Windsource Ruins, as the jade
slip contained detailed records of the Ruins, describing the
outermost swamp region, the outer region, the inner region, and the
core region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The outer region was
the dangerous area where Ning had encountered Su Youji. It was a
place where Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals often ventured
through.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The inner region
included the Hundred Streams of the Windsource. Many of the
World-level servants of Daolord Windsource had been stationed in the
inner region and had died there as well. The inner region was far
more dangerous than the outer region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The core region was the
place where Daolord Windsource had lived. Not even Daolord Badlands
or Waterwind had dared to venture too deeply into that place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we add in these
two Dao weapons I found in that estate-treasure, I now have a total
of five Dao weapons.” Ning was absolutely delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Elder God Skysouth had
left quite a few things behind after he died. The most precious item
he had left behind was his Elder God Formation, but he had also left
behind over a hundred Chaos treasures. Alas, he didn’t even have a
single Dao weapon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What Ning didn’t know
was that Elder God Skysouth had actually found a Dao weapon many
years ago. Knowing himself to be too weak to make proper use of it,
Skysouth feared that other Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals would
just take it from him! Thus, he instead sold the Dao weapon, using
the proceeds to purchase many Elder God slaves as well as an Elder
God Formation. Instantly, he became virtually invincible against
anyone weaker than a World-level expert.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five Dao weapons,
one Elder God Formation, and over three hundred Chaos treasures.”
Ning nodded to himself. These were the main proceeds of this
adventure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five Dao weapons,
with that warblade being the most valuable of the five. It should be
considered a top-grade Dao weapon and is most likely worth roughly
fifty cubes of chaos nectar.” Ning continued to quietly calculate
mentally. “The other four all combined are probably worth fifty
cubes as well! An Elder God Formation meant for a hundred Elder Gods
is probably worth roughly ten cubes. As for the three hundred Chaos
treasures, some are high-quality while some are low-quality. They are
probably worth roughly ten bottles of chaos nectar on average, for a
total of around ten cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All combined…they
should be worth more than a hundred cubes!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sighed in
amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A single cube of chaos
nectar was equivalent to a thousand bottles! A hundred cubes…that
was comparable to the total networth of an ordinary World-level
expert!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was what made
adventuring in these places so alluring!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just the tiniest part
of the fortune left behind in the ruins of a deceased Daolord was
comparable to the networth of an ordinary World God!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And yet, the danger
level in such a place was similarly high. As soon as Ning had entered
the Ruins, he had been beset by dangers. He had damn near died when
the windbeasts had chased after him. The only reason why he was able
to safely return to the ‘outer region’ was because he had stupid
good luck, resulting in him finding and entering that private estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To safely leave the
inner region was incredibly difficult. Only around half of the World
Gods who entered the place would be able to leave alive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But for those who did
manage to leave…almost every single one of them returned with great
rewards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many
treasures…this should be enough to repair my sword, Violetjewel,”
Ning mused to himself. Even if he used up all of the treasures, Ning
wouldn’t feel any heartache. This was because Violetjewel was a
weapon that had a quintessence core!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The
fiery-robed Su Youji walked out. As she looked at the seated
white-robed youth, she felt quite happy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She had been pursued by
Elder God Skysouth for so long. Whenever she thought of his ugly
smile and his demand for her to become his pleasure-companion, she
felt extremely repulsed. When she looked at the seated Ning, she
could sense the distance between the two of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were many
cultivators who tried to befriend her and move closer to her, hoping
that they would have the chance to enjoy ‘the joy of fish when
entering the sea’. But Ning, however, only gave her a feeling of
distance. Clearly, he didn’t wish to be too intimate with her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning turned
his head to look at her. “Right. If you aren’t busy, accompany me
on a trip to Fogstone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fogstone?” Su
Youji was startled for a moment, then smiled beautifully. “Alright.
When?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right now,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning deeply desired to
completely repair Violetjewel and restore it to its full level of
power. According to the books he had read as well as the notes left
behind by World God Northrest, weapons that had quintessence cores
were incredibly marvelous. They surpassed all ordinary weapons and
stood at a completely different level of existence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal cultivators of
Ning’s level focused on attuning to certain essences, such as how
Ning was attuning to the true essence of the sword in the hopes of
reaching a higher level of skill with it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Violetjewel
had such an essence within it! This quintessence core was the most
valuable part of Violetjewel. The stories regarding weapons like
Violetjewel were simply too obscure and mystical; Ning wanted to see
it for himself!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Su Youji flew
together within his ship, departing from the Windsource Chaosworld
and heading towards Fogstone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fogstone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Last time Ning had come
to this place, he had been an outsider. This time, he was a general
of the Fogstone Army. He was considered one of them and there was no
need for someone to guide him around.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, seniors.
What sort of treasures might you need?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were within an
enormous hall inside an island. This hall was filled with many
beautiful maids, with one being on the True Immortal level. When she
sensed Ji Ning and Su Youji’s auras, she immediately became
extremely hospitable. This place was extremely important. It was the
central location for people to sell treasures to Fogstone. Because it
was located in the heart of Fogstone, the forces of Fogstone didn’t
really worry about anyone causing trouble here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
producing his general’s insignia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“General?” The
violet-robed female True Immortal’s attitude became even more
respectful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How many treasure
fragments do you have here?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To repair Violetjewel,
he would need Five Elements essence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cheapest way to
acquire Five Elements essence was to purchase treasure fragments from
already-destroyed treasures. A more expensive solution would be to
purchase undamaged ingredients, while the most extravagant way was to
purchase undamaged artifacts and treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Treasure fragments?”
The violet-robed female wouldn’t dare to lie to one of Fogstone’s
generals. She immediately said, “There aren’t many cultivators
who need treasure fragments. Most who purchase them do so to extract
Five Elements essence from them to repair other treasures. As a
result, our entire stockpile is worth less than a cube of chaos
nectar. However, this should be more than enough to repair a Dao
weapon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The violet-robed woman
was privately guessing that this general was intent on repairing a
Dao weapon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Less than a cube?”
Ning was no longer the ignorant child he had been when he was in the
Three Realms. A treasure with a quintessence core that had been
almost completely wrecked internally would require an enormous amount
of Five Elements essence if one wanted to repair it. If he was to
purchase raw ingredients rather than treasure fragments, even a
hundred cubes of chaos nectar might not be enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Purchasing treasure
fragments was a better path to success.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s it…?”
Ning frowned, but this was as he had expected. Fogstone only had nine
World-level experts. Why would it see the need to store so many
treasure fragments here?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
led Su Youji away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He wasn’t worried
about openly asking for treasure fragments here on Fogstone. Everyone
on their side was bound by a lifeblood oath preventing fratricide.
This was one of the reasons why Ning had chosen to come to Fogstone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems I’ll have
to pay a visit to the Badlands Everworld if I wish to acquire enough
treasure fragments to repair Violetjewel,” Ning mused silently to
himself. “I can be a bit more relaxed here on Fogstone, but I’ll
have to be careful when I’m in the Badlands Everworld. If I’m too
arrogant and end up catching the wrong person’s attention, I can
very well die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning was going
to be vigilant, he wasn’t scared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youji.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two were within a
flying warship that soared through the space outside Fogstone. Ning
said to the nearby Su Youji, “I’m preparing to pay a visit to the
Badlands Everworld.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go wherever
you go, Master.” Su Youji laughed. “And I’ve visited the
Badlands Everworld before. I’m quite familiar with the place.
Although I was just there once, I have to admit that it truly is a
remarkable and marvelous place. Many cultivators reside there, and
even the most powerful organization of the Badlands Territory,
Badlands Court , is located there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying warship
continued to advance through space towards the distant Sevenwater
Star. From there, they would be able to make use of a spacetime
transfer array that would send them directly to the Badlands
Everworld!
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 30 - First Visit to an Everworld
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sevenwater Star was a
long distance away from the planet of Fogstone. After reaching it,
they had to wait for another year before the spacetime transfer array
was activated. Thus, it took them two years before they were able to
reach the Badlands Everworld. This was actually quite a short period
of time, and the reason why the transfer happened so quickly was
because the Badlands Everworld was a fairly high-traffic location.
The Badlands Everworld was the center of the entire Badlands
Territory and held the most powerful organizations in the region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the other
cultivators appeared within the spacetime transfer array. As for
Flamefairy Su Youji, Ning had naturally been stored her away into his
estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this is the
Badlands Everworld?” Ning walked out of the array, staring at the
vast world that had appeared before him. He waved his hand, causing
Su Youji to appear next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can you feel it?”
When Su Youji appeared, she smiled as she looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly.
“What an odd feeling.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was now powerful
enough to easily destroy most chaosworlds. However, the Badlands
Everworld gave Ning an impression of exalted majesty, a sense of
all-encompassing grace that was completely ineffable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really can’t fly
here.” Ning tried to fly but couldn’t, no matter what he did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How marvelous. This
place is exactly as the legends said it is. Supposedly, the skies
have been completely sealed in the Badlands Everworld. There really
is no way to fly through the air here.” Each time Ning tried to fly
into the air, a strange, unfathomable sort of law seemed to exert its
power upon him, making it impossible for him to fly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to the
legends, when each everworld was first created by their powerful
creators, certain Laws would be set down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, there
might be a ‘flamebane’. This meant that all fire-attribute types
of power would be completely unusable within that everworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Or for another example,
there might be a ‘swordbane’. This meant that even the most
formidable of experts in the Dao of the Sword would find themselves
unable to summon the energy of the true essence of the sword. In
fact, they wouldn’t even be able to draw their swords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There could be some
other special Laws as well. So long as the creator of the everworld
set down that rule, all others who came to the everworld would be
forced to follow it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the Laws of the
Badlands Everworld was its ‘skybane’. No living creatures were
able to fly here, not even winged creatures like birds! Nothing and
no one could fly in this world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course, if you were
incredibly powerful, you might be capable of resisting this law.
Daolord Badlands, for example, might be strong enough to force his
way into the air…but of course, that was just conjecture. No one
had ever seen Daolord Badlands flying about within the Badlands
Everworld. The only reason why people thought he might be capable of
disobeying the Law was because everyone here felt the utmost of
respect for Daolord Badlands’ abilities! However, it was also
equally possible that not even the Daolord was capable of flying
here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for others?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No World-level expert
was capable of overcoming a local Law, to say nothing of an Ancestral
Immortal or Elder God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still, the everworld
is a very comfortable place,” Ning said softly. “This world is
incredibly deep and dense. It feels as though it embraces all
visitors with warmth and kindness, bringing peace to their hearts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a reason why
so many cultivators like to live here within the Badlands Everworld
and why so many organizations want to take this place over. However,
only the most powerful organization of all, the Badlands Court, is
qualified to rule this place!” Su Youji said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come. Let us go find
Waveshift City.” Ning immediately strode forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two walked
shoulder-to-shoulder as they advanced at tremendous speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Waveshift City was the
largest, most bustling city of the Badlands Everworld. It was
indescribably old, and it had existed ever since the Badlands
Everworld itself had first come into being! Naturally, this made it
far older than the so-called Badlands Court, which had merely
destroyed the previous occupant of this everworld, took it over, and
changed its name to be the ‘Badlands Everworld’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Waveshift City was
quite close to the spacetime transfer array.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Flamefairy
merely had to walk for roughly an hour before arriving at the base of
the mountains around Waveshift City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quite high.” Ning
raised his head to stare upwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a mountain
that was a million kilometers tall, its peaks wreathed in white
clouds and crowned with an enormous city. Waveshift City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s hike up the
mountain,” Ning chuckled. “It’s been a long time since I’ve
gone hiking.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have to walk our
way up step by step. I feel just like a mortal.” Su Youji grinned
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The mountain path was a
sinuous one that coiled around the mountain peak, slowly guiding
travelers upwards. If Ning was able to fly, he would’ve flown
straight up to the peak of the mountain. Instead, he now had to
slowly hike up one step at a time. Within the everworld, flight
simply didn’t work.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This everworld is
truly vast, far larger than any chaosworld.” As Ning hiked up the
mountain, he couldn’t help but let out a sigh. “I hear that the
everworld has many ancient ruins located inside it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Su Youji
nodded. “I heard there are more than ten.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were more than
ten ancient ruins within the Badlands Everworld which had never been
fully conquered! This was because the Badlands Everworld was simply
far too vast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here we are.” Su
Youji pointed towards their front.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The mountain peak
itself was just a few hundred kilometers around, but it held up an
enormous city that spanned hundreds of thousands of kilometers. The
city almost looked as though it was hanging precariously in the air,
ready to tip at a moment’s notice. Ning and Youji followed the
mountain path forward, walking towards the gates.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The walls of the city
were engraved with two words ‘Wave’ ‘Shift’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waveshift…” Ning
raised his head to look at those two words, sensing the incredibly
arcane ripples emanating from within them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those ripples were
simply too hard to lock down. Just trying made Ning feel tired and
extremely uncomfortable. The difference in power was simply too
great. Ning quickly tried to give up attuning to those ripples, but
was unable to break free from the endless might that radiated out
from those two words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Urgh.” Ning
vomited out a mouthful of blood before finally coming back to his
senses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, don’t you
know that you must not stare at those two words?” The Flamefairy
asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know, but I still
wanted to take a look. I won’t die just because I looked at them,
right?” Ning laughed. “They truly are incredible. Those two words
made me vomit up blood just because I looked at them. I wasn’t able
to glean any insight into them at all, just a feeling that they are
unfathomably profound.” According to the legends, even World Gods
who stared at those two words would vomit up blood, to say nothing of
someone like Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking, if
you took over an everworld you would change its name.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Badlands Court had
taken over this everworld and had thus renamed it to be the ‘Badlands
Everworld’. However, they hadn’t changed the name of the most
prosperous city of this everworld, precisely because those two words
‘Wave’ ‘Shift’ were completely inviolable. Those two words
served as the core of the entire city and possessed utterly supreme
power. So long as those two words remained on the walls, all other
cultivators would continue to call this place ‘Waveshift City’,
no matter who tried to change its name.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, there were many
cultivators who suspected that when the Badlands Everworld was first
established a long, long time ago, its original name might’ve been
the Waveshift Everworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No one knows who
wrote those two words.” The Flamefairy let out a sigh. “That
person might well be more powerful than even Daolord Badlands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It made sense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were differences
in power even amongst Daolords. Didn’t Daolord Windsource have a
Daolord amongst his retainers?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart began to
beat slightly faster as he thought about that ancient, powerful
figure. A few moments later, he turned and entered Waveshift City
alongside Su Youji. Waveshift City was an incredibly prosperous city,
and it had one simple rule: All combat within city limits was
forbidden! Anyone who violated this rule would instantly suffer
automatic attacks from the formations protecting Waveshift City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a bustling
place.” As Ning walked through the wide streets, he could see Elder
Gods and Ancestral Immortals everywhere. As for True Gods and True
Immortals, there was a ridiculous number of them located here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I would imagine that
almost half of the cultivators of the entire Badlands Territory are
gathered here,” Su Youji said. “Waveshift City even holds more
than a thousand World-level experts!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. This was a
place of power and safety. No one would dare to attack you here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, once you left
the city, no one would care if you lived or you died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that the Palace
of Ten Thousand Treasures?” Ning stared off into the distance. Far
away, at the ends of the street, there lay an utterly enormous palace
that glowed with absolutely breathtaking light. The entire palace
emanated many ripples of power, each of which represented the
presence of a Dao weapon. The ripples which the palace were
intentionally radiating out numbered over a hundred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, that’s the
Palace of Ten Thousand Treasures. It holds more treasures within it
than any other place within Waveshift City. Here, you can buy
whatever treasures you desire! You can have Dao weapons custom made
for you, or even be able to purchase one of those legendary treasures
with a quintessence core inside of it. So long as you are willing to
pay the price, you can buy anything…but of course, the price of
such a weapon would be truly terrifying.” Su Youji let out a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nind nodded. He knew
that the master of this Palace was actually Daolord Badlands himself!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Badlands could
capture a few dozen World Gods, then enslave them and sell them off,
but they still wouldn’t be as valuable as a single treasure with a
quintessence core. The price of such a treasure was unimaginable,
enough to drive even a World God completely mad.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you plan to
buy or sell, Master? You can do it all here. This place is extremely
safe, and the Palace will never reveal your secrets,” the
Flamefairy sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know.” But in
his heart, Ning silently muttered to himself - Bullshit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yes, the Palace was an
extremely safe place where he could sell off his Dao weapons to
acquire a hundred cubes of chaos nectar; the Palace wouldn’t really
care much about it. But if he was to directly purchase ‘treasure
fragments’ from them in large quantity, everyone would be able to
guess that Ning had a treasure which required significant amounts of
Five Elements essence to repair!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Badlands had an
exalted status here; there was naturally no way he could possibly
switch positions and decide to come here to run the shop. The ones in
charge of this place were most likely World Gods or Chaos
Immortals…and Violetjewel was a treasure that would attract
attention from any World-level expert, some of whom would actually
stare at Ning from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no such thing
as the old nonsense saying about ‘one’s word is priceless’.
Everything had a price to it; the only question was how high. A magic
treasure that had a quintessence core was valuable enough that many
Elder Gods and Chaos Immortals would be willing to sacrifice
anything, face included, to acquire it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to spend a
little bit of thought on this,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>

Chapter 31 - Magic Treasure Fragments
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later, Ji
Ning walked into the Palace of Ten Thousand Treasures by himself,
having had Flamefairy Su Youji enter his estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you wish to
purchase, fellow Daoist?” As soon as Ning walked in, a violet-robed
female cultivator with the aura of an Ancestral Immortal greeted him
with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning swept the palace
with his gaze. It was filled with violet-robed male and female
Immortals, all of whom were at the Elder God or Ancestral Immortal
level. This was a testament to how wealthy the Badlands Court was!
The treasures here ranged from Protocosmic spirit-treasures to Dao
treasures, and there were more than a thousand display tables filled
with those treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This particular
violet-robed Ancestral Immortal fell into place behind Ning,
following him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m here to sell
treasures,” Ning sent mentally. “I’m selling a Dao weapon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Dao weapon?” The
violet-robed woman gave Ning a surprised glance, then also switched
to speaking mentally. “It seems you’ve made some great gains
while adventuring, fellow Daoist. Please follow me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, Ning was led
towards a side hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My uncle-master
shall arrive shortly,” the violet-robed Immortal said. The Badlands
Territory was a vast place, and every so often there would be a few
Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals who were lucky enough to acquire
Dao weapons while adventuring. Hundreds of them might die in their
adventures, but every so often one would luck out. This wasn’t that
uncommon, and given how vast the entire Badlands Territory was, a
surprising number of Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals had Dao
weapons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
they would go to the Palace to sell off the Dao weapons and trade for
other treasures they needed. Daolord Badlands was behind the Palace;
there was no need for them to worry about their security here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle-master,” the
violet-robed woman called out respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed,
white-haired old man walked in, and the aura which rippled off of him
was completely different from that of an Elder God’s or an
Ancestral Immortal’s. Ning suspected that this had to be a Chaos
Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior,” Ning
immediately said respectfully. Any Chaos Immortal admitted to the
Badlands Court had to be an extraordinary figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take your Dao
weapons out and let me have a look,” the white-robed Chaos Immortal
said with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, four Dao
weapons appeared in the air before him. There was a warblade, a quill
pen, and a pair of long shuttles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, Ning had
acquired five Dao weapons. However, Ning had taken a liking to the
flexible sword and thus was unwilling to part with it for now. Even
if he sold it, he’d only gain access to roughly ten cubes of Chaos
nectar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This warblade…”
The white-robed Chaos Immortal’s eyes lit up as he nodded slowly.
“Not bad.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He didn’t seem to pay
much attention to the other three items.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I also have an Elder
God Formation.” Ning also produced the Elder God Formation he had
acquired from Elder God Skysouth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The
white-robed Chaos Immortal glanced sideways at the Elder God
Formation, then ignored it. At his level, only a formation that
allowed for a thousand Elder Gods would be of interest. To him, a
hundred-man Elder God formation was very unremarkable. In truth, even
Ning didn’t care about it that much. Thanks to his azureflower
space, Ning was now capable of fighting a hundred Elder Gods head-on,
making the formation of little use to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This blade…this
should be a weapon that was nourished through sin, a Sinblade. It is
quite excellent.” The white-robed Chaos Immortal nodded. “The
others are just so-so. All combined, I’d be willing to give you 105
cubes of chaos nectar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After finishing his
words, the white-robed Chaos Immortal glanced at Ning, then turned
and left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos Immortals held an
exalted status. They would be willing to come out to assess Dao
weapons and give a price for them, but they generally wouldn’t
actually deal or haggle with Elder Gods or Ancestral Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As my uncle-master
just said, the highest price we can give is 105 cubes of chaos
nectar.” The violet-robed female Immortal looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine, then let’s
just set the price at 105 cubes.” Ning nodded. Generally speaking,
the Palace would make very honest offers, as they disdained from
trying to nickel-and-dime weak cultivators like him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I also have some
Chaos treasures. Quite a few of them, actually. I wish to sell them
all.” Ning waved his hand, causing more than three hundred Chaos
treasures to instantly appear in the air next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The violet-robed woman
was quite calm, as she had seen far too many Chaos treasures in her
life. She swept them with her gaze, then smiled as she looked back at
Ning. “We can give you three cubes for them, I suppose.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Chaos treasures
were worth roughly what he had thought they would be worth, while the
Dao weapons had been worth a bit more than he had expected. It was
probably due to the warblade. Ning had thought it to be worth roughly
fifty cubes, but he wasn’t sure as to exactly how much it would be
worth. It was a top-grade Dao weapon, after all. Some could be bought
for fifty cubes while others would require up to a hundred cubes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A total of 108
cubes. We will give it to you in the form of chaos nectar and chaos
jewels. Alternately, would you like to receive treasures in trade
instead?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need.” Ning
shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amongst the many Chaos
treasures he had acquired was a Chaos-level ‘Five Elements
Cauldron’. Ning really didn’t need any particular treasures right
now at all. The flexible sword was also more than enough of a weapon
for him at present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then please accept
this.” A short while later, the violet-robed Immortal returned and
gave Ning a storage flask that contained a separate dimension within
it which held many bottles of chaos nectar as well as many chaos
jewels. As for the flask itself, it was naturally a complimentary
gift.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After accepting the
flask, Ning turned and left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now…time to buy
treasure fragments.” After leaving the Palace, Ning began to ponder
on what to buy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Waveshift City was an
extremely busy city. Given that all combat was forbidden in this
place and that it was protected by Daolord Badlands as well as an
incredibly ancient formation, it could be described as the safest
place of the entire Badlands Territory! Thus, this placed was loved
by cultivators who disliked violence and who wished to calmly focus
on their meditations. World-level experts, Elder Gods, Ancestral
Immortals, True Gods, True Immortals…an enormous number of them
lived here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, they needed
resources and treasures for cultivation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, some World-level
experts would arrange for their disciples to set up shops here.
They’d toss the spoils of war they acquired into the shops for
sell.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were three
particularly popular types of shops. The first involved the buying
and selling of treasures. The second involved the buying and selling
of divine abilities and secret arts. The third involved the buying
and selling of slaves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were the three
types of shops that did the most trade. Although there were also
shops that sold formations, pills, and other things, they weren’t
quite as popular.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In Waveshift City
,there were more than eight hundred shops that engaged in the buying
and selling of treasures! Some were established by independent
World-level experts while others were established by clans and
organizations, such as Fogstone or the Blacklotus Empire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixth day after
Ning’s arrival at Waveshift City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Windflower Hall was
a treasure shop owned and operated by the Windflower chaos-kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black-robed child
walked into the hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” A female
True Immortal quickly walked forward to welcome him. Cultivators
couldn’t be judged by their appearances alone. Although this child
looked very young, he had the aura of an Elder God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you have treasure
fragments for sale here?” The black-robed child said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We do.” The female
True Immortal looked at the child. “But not much. Just three cubes
worth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wish to buy six
hundred bottles worth of treasure fragments,” the black-robed child
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The female True
Immortal was quite calm. Treasure fragments weren’t popular items,
but when people did purchase them they usually purchased them in
large quantities. Some large organizations actually bought them in
bulk, while other independent cultivators might need them to repair
their treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninelights Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” A
white-robed female Celestial Immortal stepped forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The muscular man
glanced sideways at her. It was quite rare to see a Celestial
Immortal in Waveshift City; she most likely had come here alongside
her master or her family members.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wish to buy
treasure fragments, eight hundred bottles worth. Do you have any?”
The muscular man sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We do,” the female
Celestial Immortal said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A child. A muscular
man. An alien Outsider. An elderly man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning transformed into
many different forms, using some of the minor techniques and tricks
which World God Northrest had imparted to him to mask and disguise
his natural aura. Given his power, most Elder Gods and Ancestral
Immortals wouldn’t be able to see through his disguise. Only World
Gods and Chaos Immortals would be able to do so, if they gave him a
serious look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, Ning
focused on shops and stores that were operated by True Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within half a day, he
visited over 180 different shops, buying around five hundred to eight
hundred bottles worth of treasure fragments. Soon, he had completely
spent all 108 cubes of chaos nectar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Badlands Everworld.
The spacetime transfer array.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is this one going to
Brightcave Star?” When Ning arrived at the array, he asked this
question of a nearby Elder God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. It’s about to
activate immediately.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning paid
the fee of a bottle of chaos nectar, then stepped into the array.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
the spacetime transfer array was activated, sending its occupants to
Brightcave Star.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon reaching
Brightcave Star, Ning immediately teleported away. He found a
distant, unoccupied planet, then went into seclusion for three years.
Three years later, he rode Brightcave Star’s spacetime transfer
array and went straight to Sevenwater Star.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After arriving, Ning
went straight towards the territory controlled by Fogstone. He
returned to the nameless star where he had secreted the prisonworld,
then entered it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the prisonworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m back.” Ning
smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had spent five days
in Waveshift City. Only on the sixth day had he gone out shopping for
treasure fragments, precisely because he wanted to make immediate use
of the spacetime transfer array. Ning had completely memorized the
array’s schedule, and in this way ensured that no one would have a
chance to follow him or chase him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To be honest, Ning was
being excessively cautious. He had changed his appearance and his
aura across the hundred-plus shops. As a result, he didn’t cause
even the slightest stir in Waveshift City, nor had any of the
countless cultivators there paid him any special attention.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, Ning was right
to be careful. One had to be careful as a cultivator; a single act of
negligence could very well result in death. It didn’t really matter
if his true body was killed, but if he lost 108 cubes worth of
treasure fragments due to it? Ning would probably want to kill
himself out of regret.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time, he had been
quite lucky when journeying through the Ruins. Next time, he might
not acquire any treasures at all. Who knew how long it would be
before the next time he acquired such a fortune?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning appeared atop a
mountain peak. He stared off into the distance, watching as a
black-robed Ning flew towards him. This was his true body’s backup
clone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here we go.” Ning
revealed a look of anticipation on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the black-robed Ning
landed before him, it produced a blood-colored sword which it tossed
to Ning’s true body. It was Violetjewel. When Ning had entered the
Windsource Ruins, he had stashed Violetjewel away in the prisonworld.
He hadn’t taken it to the Badlands Everworld either. This was the
most important treasure he had, and he had to keep it safe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning waved his
hand, causing an enormous Five Elements Cauldron to appear in the air
and land on the ground next to him, causing the mountain to tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ning
glanced at Violetjewel. It looked fine from the outside, but its
insides were so completely mangled that only its quintessence core
remained intact. Ning said softly, “Violetjewel…the Five Elements
essence from this many treasure fragments should be enough, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was filled with
anticipation. He wanted to see exactly how powerful one of these
legendary quintessence weapons were.
</P>

Chapter 32 - The Quintessence Core of the Sword
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the Five Elements
Cauldron descended upon the mountain peak, it shone with a blindingly
bright burst of light that illuminated the entire area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ji Ning
sat down in the lotus position, placing Violetjewel before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Begin!” Ning waved
his hand, causing an enormous pile of treasure fragments that was
more than thirty meters tall to suddenly appear a short distance away
from him. The treasure fragments consisted of broken bits of sabers,
swords, beads, ropes, banners, staffs, greataxes, cauldrons, flying
boats, Immortal palaces, and other things that were all at least at
the Protocosmic spirit-treasure level. After being badly damaged and
broken into pieces, they were now much less valuable than they were
before, but it was actually even easier to extract energy from them
than it was from undamaged treasures. After all, there was now no
need to actually grind them apart!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Ning sent out
a surge of Immortal energy to scoop up the treasure fragments.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh! The treasure
fragments surged out in a stream, beginning to flood into the Five
Elements Cauldron. This was a Chaos-level Five Elements Cauldron, and
it quickly reduced the treasure fragments to tiny bits of dust and
debris, completely absorbing the Five Elements essence from those
treasures and storing it into the cauldron’s storage region. Just
ten breaths worth of time later, the entire pile of treasure
fragments had been completely used up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…a large amount
of debris came flying out from the Five Elements Cauldron.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Again.” Ning once
more waved his hand, causing another thirty meter pile of treasure
fragments to appear next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The treasure fragments
were once more broken apart and transformed into debris, the Five
Elements essence having been sucked out of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had purchased 108
cubes worth of treasure fragments. 108 cubes of chaos nectar was a
sum that was comparable to the entire networth of many ordinary
World-level experts, and he had used it all to purchase treasure
fragments. The amount of treasure fragments he now had was absolutely
extraordinary!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It took six full hours
to go through it all! Finally, six hours later, the treasure
fragments had been completely consumed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come.” Ning picked
up a jade gourd, causing streams of golden yellow energy, watery blue
energy, green wood energy, fiery red energy, and dark earthen energy
to soar out of the cauldron and into the mouth of the jade gourd.
Only after a long period of time was the Five Elements Cauldron
completely emptied of Five Elements essence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
putting away the cauldron as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This gourd has 108
cubes worth of Five Elements essence.” Ning hefted the jade gourd
in his hands. He had been very lucky, but had still nearly died in
the Ruins in order to acquire such a fortune.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Violetjewel…show
me your true power!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning willed it, and
Violetjewel suddenly appeared in the air before him. Ning took hold
of Violetjewel, then placed it next to the jade gourd. Five Elements
essence immediately began to fly out of the jade gourd, flooding
straight towards Violetjewel. The essence swirled around Violetjewel
before slowly seeping inside of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the surface,
Violetjewel looked as though it was in perfect shape. Its internal
structure, however, was unbearably mangled. It was like a building
that looked pristine from the outside but was filled with shattered
support beams; although it looked nice, it was actually quite weak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By the same principle,
Violetjewel looked as though it was in perfect shape from the
outside, but it was actually very weak! The only reason why it was
still so powerful was because it was simply such a fantastically good
weapon that even in its present state, it could still unleash the
power of a Dao weapon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crackle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The damaged internal
structures of Violetjewel furiously devoured the Five Elements
essence pouring into it. The healing began to occur at a very slow
pace, as every single bit of it was very difficult to repair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The core of the sword
was its quintessence. The closer the healing process came to the
quintessence core, the more difficult it was to repair it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because the surface of
the sword had been repaired, the sword was able to absorb Five
Elements essence much more quickly than before. As more and more of
it was repaired, it began to absorb the Five Elements essence faster
and faster as well. However, there was simply so much essence that
more than six days and nights passed in the blink of an eye, with
Violetjewel continuing to ravenously absorb the essence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It has already
consumed thirty cubes…it is more than half-healed by now.” Ning
actually frowned. “But the closer we get to the core, the harder
the repair process will be.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another day passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fifty cubes…it
still needs a bit more…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sixty cubes…seventy
cubes…still needs a little more…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword was clearly
almost completely repaired by now, but as as they drew closer and to
the core, the repair difficulty began to increase at a staggering
rate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eighty cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninety cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninety-five.
Ninety-six. Ninety-seven. Ninety-eight!” Ning was carefully attuned
to this sword which he bound all those years ago. Finally, the last
bit of damage that was located extremely close to the quintessence
core was also repaired.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After using up
ninety-eight cubes worth of treasure fragments, Ning had finally,
completely repaired Violetjewel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blood-colored sword
hovering in front of Ning emitted a joyful aura. Ning smiled as well,
not suppressing the sword and allowing it to burst forth with its
true aura of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A stream of sword-light
that looked like blood-colored water blasted out in every direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the sword-light
howled forth and spread out around Ning, the prisonworld itself began
to tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning was
badly shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a
prisonworld, a place meant to hold prisoners. When my true body uses
the azureflower seal and strikes at full power, it can cause the
prisonworld to faintly tremble. But just now…I didn’t even
control or activate Violetjewel. Its own natural aura was enough to
cause the prisonworld to shudder?!” Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This weapon is far
more powerful than any Dao weapon! A hundred times more powerful?
Perhaps a thousand times more powerful?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How powerful would I
be if I could control it?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning stared at the
illusory lake of blood that had spread out around Violetjewel, he was
afraid to even imagine how much power this sword truly contained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come over here.”
Ning extended his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The aura of bloody
sword-light immediately vanished as Violetjewel obediently flew into
Ning’s hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Reinforced and
strengthened by the azureflower energy, Ning poured his divine power
into the sword, planning on delivering a full-force strike. But just
at that moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blood and water…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A sword like water…a
sword like blood…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An indistinct, unclear
voice suddenly spoke out from the quintessence core of the sword.
Because Ning’s divine power had filled the sword, he was able to
sense this voice in detail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could sense the
solitary pride contained within the sword’s quintessence core…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, Ning could
almost see a solitary, proud figure appear. That lonely figure figure
seemed to wield a sword that caused Ning to feel a sense of awe and
veneration. When the intent of that sword exploded forth, it crushed
stars, shattered worlds, and wiped out all living beings. Nothing
could stop this surge of sword-intent, which seemed to be capable of
tearing apart even the primordial chaos itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning came back to his
senses. Only now did he realize that he had been in a dazed state for
fully half a month!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This sword’s
quintessence core…?” Ning had acquired Violetjewel a long time
ago, but in the past he had never noticed anything remarkable about
its quintessence core. Only after fully repairing Violetjewel did the
sword’s quintessence seem to come to life, allowing Ning to get a
glimpse of an utterly supreme sword-intent that completely eclipsed
the sword-intent left behind by the diagram of the Hundred Streams of
the Windsource Ning had seen years ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only thing Ning had
ever seen which could possibly be compared to this surge of
sword-intent was the power which had emanated from the words
‘Waveshift’ which he had seen on the walls of Waveshift City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was just as exalted
and ineffable! In fact, it seemed to carry an aura of perfect and
eternity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eternity?” Ning
murmured softly to himself, “No wonder this sort of weapon is
referred to as an Eternal weapon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos weapon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dao weapon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eternal weapon!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eternal weapons were
weapons that contained their own quintessence cores, which made every
single one of them incredibly marvelous and unique. No two Eternal
weapons were exactly the same.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
only figures on the level of Daolord Badlands or Daolord Windsource
would have access to such weapons! Of course, every so often a lucky
junior might be able to acquire such a weapon…such as World God
Northrest, who had found an Eternal weapon of his own!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have this strange
feeling. It is as though the full power of Violetjewel can only be
unleashed when I’m able to completely unleash the might of the
sword’s quintessence core.” This insight suddenly flashed within
Ning’s mind…but the next moment, he just grinned wryly.
Completely unleash it? What a joke! One would need utterly incredible
insights into the Dao necessary to completely unleash the
quintessence core’s power. Ning was far, far from being able to do
such a thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, his path
was the Dao of the Sword, and he had his own insights into this Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me test out its
power first.” Ning held Violetjewel in his hands as he soared into
the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black-haired old man
was seated in the lotus position in a different part of the
prisonworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed youth
suddenly flew over from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Triult.” Ning
spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The
black-robed elder hurriedly rose to his feet. He had been thoroughly
cowed by Ning’s power. By now, all of the Elder Gods and Ancestral
Immortals in the entire prisonworld had been subdued by Ning, while
Swordfather Triult was the first one who had submitted to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t move,”
Ning instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-haired elder
glanced curiously as Ning walked towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly struck
out with his sword. As he did so, it carried the intent of the
‘Killsword stance’ which Ning was working on. Although Ning had
yet to master this stance, the bit of insight he did have was able to
resonate with Violetjewel’s quintessence core and unleash just a
bit of its power, causing it burst forth from Violetjewel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had the feeling
that with a bit of power from Violetjewel’s quintessence, he had
the power to break almost anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! A blood-colored
sword-light flashed through the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a ‘clank’
sound, the translucent black chains connected to the black-haired old
man were split in half.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-haired
elder’s eyes instantly turned huge. “W-what…”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 33 - Meditating on the Sword
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is this
possible? T-these chains were personally forged by the King of
Pangaea…but he clearly…” The black-haired man stuttered as he
stared at Ji Ning in disbelief. Ji Ning was clearly just an Elder
God! He still remembered that time a few hundred years ago when Ji
Ning came with this very same blood-colored sword and hacked down
upon those chains with it. That time, he was only able to leave a few
scars behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swordfather Triult had
still be quite shocked. The Endwar had just concluded and Ji Ning’s
attacks had just barely reached the World God threshold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was now much
stronger than he was before, thanks to the azureflower energy
reinforcing his body! He was also striking out with full power using
an Eternal weapon that had part of its quintessence unleashed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of this blow
was so great that it easily hacked the chains apart. The chains posed
no threat to it at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to what
the King of Pangaea said, only a World God or Chaos Immortal is
capable of severing these chains, but even then it shouldn’t be an
easy task. Is he even more powerful than a newly ascended World-level
expert?” The black-haired elder stared at Ning, his heart filled
with astonishment. How could an Elder God be this strong?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. I’ve
severed the chains and you can leave this place,” Ning said. “In
the future, you can simply accompany me. Once I become a World God,
you can choose whether or not you wish to continue to follow me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To be able to follow
you is my blessing, Master.” Swordfather Triult spoke with the
utmost of respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A legendary monster…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An Elder God who was
absolutely stronger than a newly ascended World-level expert.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning
chuckled. He understood that today, Swordfather Triult was completely
sincere in his servitude. In the past, he had only lowered his head
because he was forced to and because a lifeblood oath bound him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced down at
Violetjewel. Because it was a weapon with a master, he was able to
disguise it as a completely ordinary weapon. No one would be able to
tell how formidable it was. Even Swordfather Triult, who had
personally witnessed the power of Ning’s blow, thought that it was
due to some breakthrough which Ning had made. He didn’t understand
that it was Ning’s sword which had undergone an utterly
earthshaking transformation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So the difference
between an Eternal weapon and a Dao weapon is actually this great!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even when I don’t
activate its quintessence core, it’s still significantly more
powerful than any Dao weapon. Once I activate it…its power is
utterly incalculable!” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eternal weapons were
precious because of their quintessence cores. This was the reason why
figures like Daolord Badlands or Daolord Windsource relied upon them
in battle. The power of their cores was utterly inconceivable.
However, Ning was far from being able to master an Eternal weapon for
now. All he was able to do at present was guide out just a strand of
its power, but that strand was already enough to cause his power to
skyrocket.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning began to release
the prisoners, one after the other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had long ago swept
through and dominated all the prisoners in the prisonworld. Prior to
the Endwar, Ning had used every technique he had at his disposal to
either force them to submit or perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now…Ning helped them
sever their shackles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A group of figures
appeared out of nowhere on a grassy plains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were all the
Immortals and Fiendgods who had been imprisoned within the
prisonworld. Ning had stored them away into his own estate-world.
Just moments ago, all of them had been chatting excitedly amongst
themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Overseer is
absolutely incredible. I personally saw him appear almost instantly,
moving far more quickly than the limits of the Heavenly Daos. He just
casually chopped out with his sword and chopped through the chains
like mud. Crunch! The chains were completely severed. It wasn’t
even hard! He definitely is as powerful as only a World God or Chaos
Immortal should be!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But he obviously is
an Elder God.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, the Overseer
definitely is an Elder God. When I first saw him, he was actually
just an Empyrean God. I even battled against him a few times. How
could he possibly have become a World God in such a short period of
time?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But for an Elder God
to have the power of a World God…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s one of those
legendary figures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were
extremely excited. Legendary monsters like Ning were incredibly rare.
The vast territories each held dozens of World-level experts or more,
but monsters like Ning were much rarer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as they were
chatting excitedly, all of them were suddenly teleported to this
grassy plains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them fell
silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Before them stood a
white-robed figure who they all recognized as the Overseer. In the
past, they might not have been convinced of his mastery, but now…all
of them felt truly subdued. Some of them even felt veneration towards
him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone.” The
white-robed Ning spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I once said that
when I have the power to do so, I shall release all of you from this
prisonworld.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you are
permitted to leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, before you
do so, I must give you a warning. The territory I am currently in is
located within the primordial chaos and is known as the ‘Badlands
Territory’. The Badlands Territory is an extremely large territory
that holds more than eighty thousand chaosworlds, and multiple
organizations hold World Gods and Chaos Immortals within their ranks.
The most powerful organization is known as the Badlands Court, which
rules over the Badlands Everworld. The Badlands Court was established
by Daolord Badlands, someone who stands above World-level experts and
has far more power than you can even imagine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals can adventure through the Badlands Territory.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is best for True
Gods, True Immortals, Empyrean Gods, and Celestial Immortals to avoid
travelling whenever possible, because if you run into some nasty
individuals you might well end up as slaves,” Ning said. “I’m
not trying to frighten you. I’m just telling you the truth. To be
honest, I don’t need to frighten you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Immortals and
Fiendgods were all astonished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Badlands Territory?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Where the hell was
this? Was this…was this place really that much more powerful than
their chaos-kingdom of Pangaea?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wasn’t able to
find any records of Pangaea in the Badlands Territory,” Ning said.
“Alright. You can make your own decisions now. If you choose
freedom, you have to swear a lifeblood oath not to tell anyone
anything about me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are willing to
forever serve you, Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixteen Elder Gods
and Ancestral Immortals had all spoke out in unison after exchanging
glances with each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When they had been
defeated by Ning, they had all already sworn lifeblood oaths to be
his retainers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are willing to
serve you, Master.” The True Gods, True Immortals, Empyrean Gods,
and Celestial Immortals all called out in unison after a brief
hesitation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals were willing to call the Overseer ‘master’.
What had they to be worried about?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, the
Overseer himself had suggested that the True Gods, True Immortals,
Empyrean Gods, and Celestial Immortals should avoid doing too much
travel, as they might be enslaved by unscrupulous figures. Although
Ning had insisted that he wasn’t trying to scare them, they
couldn’t help but feel uneasy. They had been imprisoned here for
too long, and they didn’t have much hope of breaking through. All
they wanted was to stay alive and enjoy life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded. “I am currently living in the Windsource Chaosworld. You
may come with me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” the assorted
retainers all spoke out in unison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced at them
and nodded slightly. In truth, he didn’t hold these True Gods, True
Immortals, Empyrean Gods, and Celestial Immortals in much regard.
However…some of them knew that he had multiple bodies! Long ago,
Ning had been forced to use both his true body and his backup clones
to fight them. This was why they had to swear lifeblood oaths if they
left his service.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To be honest, even Ning
himself felt that most of them would probably end up as slaves if
they left. They were strangers in a strange land with no backers or
protectors, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Windsource
Chaosworld was quite a large place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After returning to this
chaosworld, he was able to use his status as Sentinel to carve out an
area of a million kilometers in the Eastcalm Mountains for his
retainers to live in. As for the Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals,
they released the people and creatures that had been living within
their estate-worlds, allowing them to live and propagate in this
place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You may build your
dwellings atop this mountain,” Ning instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the mountain
where the Sunrise Courtyard was located.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixteen Elder Gods
and Ancestral Immortals, along with Flamefairy Su Youji, all took up
residence in this area around Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After this…life was
extremely calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji often wished
to spar against Ning. Each time, Ning would use his sword-arts to
subdue her, causing her constantly come up with new ideas on how she
could grow more powerful. Her improvements were quite noticeable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ji Ning?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning improved even
faster than she did. Thanks to the influence of Violetjewel’s
quintessence core, the murderous intent of Ning’s sword-arts grew
heavier and heavier, and his mastery of the ‘Killsword stance’
improved much more quickly as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the other
sixteen Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals, they each asked to spar
against Ning once or twice as well. However, they clearly didn’t
have much to work with. All of them had trained for far, far too
long. They had long ago given up any hope of becoming a World-level
expert.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Life in the Windsource
Chaosworld was very calm. Ning focused completely on his sword-arts
and on understanding the quintessence core of his sword. More than
two hundred years passed in the blink of an eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The peak of a mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was seated in the
lotus position. The mountain wind rustled against his robes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Violetjewel lay across
Ning’s knees. He treated it almost as he would a lover, keeping it
by his side at all times so that he could constantly sense and attune
to the will of its quintessence core. This made Ning’s rate of
improvement astonishingly fast. A few decades ago, he had fully
mastered the second stance of the [Nameless] sword-art, the
‘Killsword stance’. However, Ning didn’t feel the slightest bit
of pride or smugness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the face of the
overwhelming sword-intent contained within Violetjewel’s
quintessence core, Ning understood how puny a figure he truly was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How wonderful it
would be if I could one day reach the same level of power as the
quintessence core of Violetjewel.” Ning stared at the distant
skies, the sword-intent hidden within his body causing wisps of
sword-light to flow naturally in the area around him.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second stance of
the [Nameless] sword-art was the ‘Killsword’ stance. The third
stance was the ‘Great Firmament’ stance, also known as the ‘Sword
World’ stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon mastering one’s
own Sword World, one would step into the World-level!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Different sword-arts
would result in the creation of completely different Sword Worlds.
Some Sword Worlds would be insidiously cold, others would be bursting
with heat, while still others would be seep through every pore in
your body. The third stance of the [Nameless] sword-art was clearly
quite profound, but this meant that mastering it would also be
incredibly difficult. Not even Ji Ning knew how long it would take
for him to master the third stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A streak of
light flew towards him from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning was
seated in the lotus position at the top of his mountain. He quickly
turned his head to look over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The streak of light
came to a stop in front of Ning. It was a thin, gray-robed man with
tousled hair. His eyes were dark yellow and filled with cruel
coldness, but when he looked at Ning his gaze was filled with
veneration and respect. He said respectfully, “Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This thin gray-robed
man was actually the wild dog Elder God in his human form. After Ning
had subdued the Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals of the
prisonworld, the one who ended up worshipping him the most and being
the most loyal was actually Elder God Wilddog! Elder Dog Wilddog, in
order to prove his loyalty, had insisted on swearing a second
lifeblood oath to Ning which was so stringent, even Ning was shaken
by its terms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Elder God Wilddog was
born as an Elder God in the form of a canine. He was a very solitary,
arrogant man, but once he truly accepted someone as his master, he
would be completely and utterly devoted to the man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given that even Ning
had been shaken by Wilddog’s oath, he often chose to have Wilddog
carry out many tasks on his behalf.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How did it go?”
Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I looked into this
matter carefully. During the past few centuries, the ‘Mindlord’
in the service of God Emperor Blacklotus has been hiding within the
imperial capital of the Blacklotus Empire. He hasn’t done any
adventuring at all, nor has he led any troops out to do battle.” A
look of resentment was in Elder God Wilddog’s eyes. “This
Mindlord must be afraid of you, Master…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason he had
joined the Fogstone Dominion was for the sake of killing the
Mindlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, both Ning
himself as well as Wilddog had made numerous scouting trips, only to
discover that the Mindlord had spent the past few centuries in the
imperial capital of the Blacklotus Empire. Or, to be precise - ever
since Ning had slain Old Man Yuan, the Mindlord had returned to the
imperial capital, never taking so much as a single step out of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Mindlord truly
is a cautious man.” Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, the
sword-strike which Ning had used to slay Old Man Yuan had completely
terrified the Mindlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Mindlord knew
exactly how deep the enmity between the Three Realms and himself ran.
So many major powers had died by his hands, many of whom were
pioneers and who had assisted, guided, or taught Ji Ning. Houyi, for
example, was Ji Ning’s senior apprentice-brother. As long as Ji
Ning had the chance, he would definitely come for revenge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given how powerful Ji
Ning had been…it would be far too easy for him to slay the
Mindlord. It must be understood that Ji Ning’s final sword-strike
had pierced straight through his body, which was comparable to a
top-grade Protocosmic spirit-treasure!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master?” Elder God
Wilddog hunched over. “The Mindlord often visits friends in the
imperial capital, and also likes to enjoy life. Why don’t you buy
some Elder God slaves and let me lead them into the imperial capital,
then kill him? After assassinating him, I’ll immediately flee
through teleportation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unacceptable.”
Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not even World-level
experts can be watching over every inch of their capital at all
times. If I can find the right moment to attack, I’ll be able to
escape afterwards.” A look of savagery was in Wilddog’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are talking about
the imperial capital of the Blacklotus Empire…” Ning shook his
head. “There’s no rush. We have plenty of time. Let’s take it
slow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If they were hasty,
they might make mistakes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was confident that
he was capable of slaying the Mindlord. The only thing he needed was
a good opportunity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So long as he didn’t
rush, opportunities would come!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The planet of Fogstone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A quiet, secluded
estate-world. This estate-world was filled with sparkling stars that
twinkled with streams of energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A handsome man dressed
in an astral robe was seated in the lotus position by the side of a
lake. Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh. Glittering divine jewels flew out of
his body. These divine jewels were made from crystallized divine
power. Once Fiendgod Body Refiners became World Gods, their divine
power would crystallize into divine crystals. This was a qualitative
transformation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The divine jewels
twinkled, filled with mysterious auras of the Dao. Every single
divine jewel was filled with a slightly different aura of the Dao,
but they all came together into a perfect whole.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooosh. A large
number of divine jewels flew out of his body, swirling around him in
circles, then flying back inside of him. As the divine jewels flew in
and out of his body, dancing in the air, they glimmered with the
light of the stars themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The stars…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The handsome man
murmured softly to himself as his mind was filled with certain
memories that he would never forget.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really have to go
back. I must. I can’t disobey.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright…but you
have to come back, Starchild.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I definitely will.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Who would’ve thought
that with this farewell would become an eternal one?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He would never forget
the sight of his beloved shedding tears as he left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Suddenly, the
chaos energy began to stir around him as a total of twelve divine
crystals suddenly materialized around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The handsome man’s
divine body split apart, transforming into a total of 36,000 divine
crystals that all swirled around each other. Their Daos were joined
together into a perfect whole that gave off a natural aura of
completeness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Reform.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The 36,000 divine
crystals once more gathered together and transformed back into the
astral-robed man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Full mastery…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve finally
become a master-class World God.” The astral-robed man’s eyes
were filled with excitement as he murmured to himself, “Yi…I’ve
kept you waiting far too long.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The astral-robed man
disappeared into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black-robed man was
seated at the front of a palace, drinking some wine and watching as a
troop of female dancers performed before him. There were musicians
present as well, playing some melodies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm?” World God
Blackmist frowned, then instructed, “All of you, leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” All of the
dancers, attendants, and musicians all departed, leaving behind just
World God Blackmist within the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A single person walked
into the palace, a man dressed in astral robes with long black hair.
It was the Starlord of Fogstone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Starchild.” World
God Blackmist smiled. He had watched as the Starlord grew up, and the
Starlord truly was an incredible genius. He had grown and improved
tremendously fast and had long ago surpassed Blackmist himself.
Blackmist had known and protected him for so long that the Starlord
viewed himself almost as Blackmist’s son.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second Uncle.” The
Starlord seated himself next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm? What is it?”
World God Blackmist could sense that something was off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already
become a master-class World God,” the Starlord said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master-class? You’ve
gained full mastery?” World God Blackmist revealed a look of
surprise and delight, but then his face stiffened. “You…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. I’ve been
waiting and biding my time for far, far too long. When Father left
the Badlands Territory and went out adventuring, he ended up never
returning. Back then, the Fogstone Dominion was very weak. There was
no way I could get revenge. All I could do was keep on training…and
in the end, I broke through to become a World-level expert. However,
that old bastard Owlsoar ended up joining God Emperor Blacklotus.
Even if I commanded all of the forces of the Fogstone Dominion
against them, the end result would just be that both of our sides
would be heavily damaged. As for Owlsoar himself, if he focused on
fleeing I might not have been able to capture him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For the sake of the
Fogstone lineage…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve been enduring
my hate and biding my time. Now that I’ve become a master-class
World God, it is time to act,” the Starlord said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…” World God
Blackmist hesitated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew of the enmity
between the Starlord and Chaos Immortal Owlsoar, of course.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the Starlord had
been very weak, World God Blackmist had accompanied him as he had
wandered the outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During his wanderings,
the Starlord had encountered a female Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both had been quite
weak, but they still ended up falling in love with each other. Back
then, World God Blackmist had pretended to be nothing more than an
old servant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some time after the two
met, the Starlord’s father, who had himself been the Starlord of
Fogstone at that time, had summoned him. Thus, he had to immediately
go back to Fogstone. As for that female Immortal, she was bound by
her duty to her clan and so had to remain behind within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And with this
parting…their farewell became eternal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the Starlord had
returned to Fogstone, his father had completed all of his
arrangements and then left the planet, never to return.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos Immortal Owlsoar
had been refining a mighty sin-treasure. He butchered countless
innocent cultivators in order to baptize his sin-treasure with their
blood…and alas, the clan of the Starlord’s lover was one of the
clans that had been wiped out. By the time the Starlord found out, it
was far too late…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord had cried
bitterly before the ruins of his lover’s clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He swore he would take
revenge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since that day,
the Starlord began to improve at a dramatic pace, reaching the
World-level in an astonishingly brief period of time! After doing so,
he continued to grow tremendously quickly, making repeated
breakthroughs without pausing. And now…he had become a master-class
World God! Even his sword-arts were now far more profound than World
God Blackmist’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can no longer
wait,” the Starlord growled. “I truly cannot. I’ve already
reached the level of full mastery. How much more stronger do I need
to become? Am I supposed to wait until I become a Daolord? That’s
far too difficult. Even if I waited another hundred chaos cycles, I
still might not be able to achieve it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now that I’ve
reached the level of full mastery, I’m as strong as I possibly can
be for now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We will definitely
win this attack! I’ll take part myself. There is no way that Chaos
Immortal Owlsoar will be able to escape.” The Starlord’s handsome
face was twisted with rage and savagery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Blackmist
couldn’t help but secretly sigh upon seeing this. In the past, the
Starlord had always been quite relaxed and nonchalant about
cultivation. It was all due to his obsession, his stubborn desire to
take revenge that he had transformed into a cultivating fanatic and
improved so rapidly. In fact, the only reason why he hadn’t left
for revenge a long time ago was because he was worried about
protecting the Fogstone lineage. That was why he had waited for so
long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Starchild, if you
wish to go seek revenge, then I shall definitely help you,” World
God Blackmist said. “However…you should first go and convince the
other World-level experts of the Fogstone Dominion. The more who
stand with us, the better our chances are.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The
Starlord of Fogstone nodded.
</P>

Chapter 35 - The Order
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was often said that
the Fogstone Dominion held a total of nine World-level experts. This,
however, referred to the ones who permanently resided within this
region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fogstone Dominion
held sway over ninety-six chaosworlds. Over the course of many years,
it had given birth to quite a few World-level experts. Many of them,
such as the Starlord’s father, had ended up leaving the Badlands
Territory and adventuring through other lands! In truth, there were
many World-level experts who drifted through other territories. Even
the Starlord himself had visited quite a few territories, despite
being fairly young.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At present, there were
nine World-level experts on the planet of Fogstone. The Starlord,
World God Blackmist, and Immortal Skyram were all members of the
Fogstone lineage. As for the other six, they were treated something
like distinguished guests and honored vassals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If the Starlord
wishes it, then I agree to take part in this battle. I will do
everything I can to support our side in our campaign against the
Blacklotus Empire, but if the situation goes south, I’ll still have
to focus on keeping myself alive,” a bald, golden-robed elder said
in a slow voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let everything
happen according to the plan. I agree as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Acceptable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, I’m reminded
of the days when I adventured through the outside world. I’ve been
secluded here on the planet of Fogstone for far too long. It is time
for a good fight!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since the Starlord
has paid such a hefty price, we naturally are willing to agree!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, the nine
World-level experts all agreed to join the battle against the
Blacklotus Empire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second Uncle, I’ll
have to trouble you to pay a visit to the Badlands Everworld and
purchase the ‘Minor Thousand Elder Gods Formations’ and the
‘Minor Thousand Ancestral Immortals Formations’,” the Starlord
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Done.” World God
Blackmist nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, when the
time comes, just follow the plan. It’ll make everything easier for
you,” the Starlord said. “I don’t insist on you killing too
many foes; I just need you to help me tie them down.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
Starlord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A minor task for
people like us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given the price
you’ve already paid, Starlord…I can’t see how the Blacklotus
Empire can possibly win.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These vassal
World-level experts, including Chaos Immortal Abyssus, were all
couldn’t help but secretly sigh in amazement at how ancient and
deep-rooted a lineage the Fogstone lineage was. They were actually
capable of purchasing a ‘Minor Thousand Elder God Formation’ for
the Fogstone Army!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, over the
course of countless years, the Fogstone Dominion had actually come
into possession of three such formations. In order to strengthen
their hand even more, they were going to purchase three sets of those
formations for Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals. Immortal Abyssus,
the most unfathomably powerful of the six vassals, was also loaning
one of his own formation sets as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These formations
allowed a thousand Elder Gods or Ancestral Immortals to join together
in battle. Roughly three hundred cubes of chaos nectar was needed for
each. Most World-level experts wouldn’t be able to afford such a
price. All their possessions combined wouldn’t necessarily be worth
that much.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A so-called ‘Major
Thousand Elder Gods Formation’ actually allowed a total of nine
thousand to assemble together in battle. However, those formations
were far too expensive; they were worth almost as much as an Eternal
weapon! However, these formations were also ridiculously powerful;
once a World-level expert was trapped within this formation, he would
definitely perish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Windsource
Chaosworld. The Eastcalm mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was seated in the
lotus position within the Heavengazer Tower of Radiance, working on
the Seventh Cycle of the [Starseizing Hand].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although most of his
time was spent on sword-arts, he still needed to alternate through
other areas of cultivation as well. During the past few centuries in
the Windsource Chaosworld, Ning had been able to use his insights
into the [Fogstone Apocalypse] and the [Nine Elements Annihilation]
to roughly sketch out how the Seventh Cycle of the [Starseizing Hand]
would work.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” A voice
suddenly called out from outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning opened his eyes.
He hadn’t blocked out sound from the outside world, and so he was
able to hear what was happening outside the Heavengazer Tower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning appeared out of
nowhere within a study. He waved his hand, causing the Heavengazer
Tower which had been atop the table to disappear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Creeeeak. He pulled the
door open. Outside the study stood Elder God Wilddog.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, orders have
come from the planet of Fogstone.” Elder God Wilddog said
hurriedly, “The three captains stationed here have all been
summoned already.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Orders?” Ning was
startled, then nodded. “Let’s go take a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? Everyone is to
return to Fogstone?” The golden-robed Elder God Mountain Eater
called out in shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no longer
a need for troops to be stationed here on the Windsource Chaosworld?”
The other two captains, Tearwell and Soulflight, were completely
shocked as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he looked
at the messenger before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The messenger said
respectfully to Ning, “General, captains, this order comes from the
Starlord himself. You can see it for yourself.” As he spoke, he
handed over a glowing golden scroll over to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning unfurled the
scroll and gave it a thorough reading.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The words on the scroll
had been etched with divine power, and their aura was indeed the aura
of the Starlord’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The three of you can
take a look as well.” Ning handed the scroll over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Elder God Mountain
Eater, Immortal Soulflight, and Elder God Tearwell accepted the
scroll and looked through it, puzzled. None of them questioned the
validity of the order, as there was no way the scroll or the
messenger could be faked. Anyone capable of making a scroll that
could fool them was powerful enough to not need to do such a thing!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is an important
border region, but he’s actually withdrawing all troops? This has
never happened before in all the years I’ve been here,” Elder God
Mountain Eater said in a low voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very well.” Ning
nodded then instructed, “Since the Starlord has ordered it, all of
us should immediately return to Fogstone. Also…the decree states
that we have to withdraw in a stealthy fashion.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The three
captains all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning left Swordfather
Triult in the Eastcalm mountains, so as to protect the Immortals and
Fiendgods who lived in the surrounding area. All the others, such as
Flamefairy Su Youji or Elder God Wilddog, followed Ning in leaving
this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They moved in stealth.
Ning led his retainers as well as the hundreds of Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals of the Fogstone Army away from the Windsource
Chaosworld and travelled to the planet of Fogstone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon reaching
Fogstone…Ning realized that thousands of Elder Gods and Ancestral
Immortals had all gathered here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s been a long
time since I’ve seen so many Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This many?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The soldiers all sighed
in amazement, then began to break up into groups of four or five.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“General, the
Starlord has summoned you.” Things wouldn’t be as relaxed for
Ning as they were for the ordinary soldiers. He was immediately
summoned into the Starlord’s estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord’s
estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Four figures were
seated within a side chamber.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Upon entering
the side chamber, Ning immediately saw those four seated figures. All
of them had extraordinary auras and different appearances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings,
generals.” Ning was the first to speak out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard that our
Fogstone Army has gained a new general who sparred against World God
Blackmist. A pity that by the time I heard of this, fellow Daoist
Sunrise, you had already left Fogstone.” A tall, muscular, scaled
alien cultivator dressed in white robes was the first to respond.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, Sword
Immortal Sunrise.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Sunrise, we
should spar as well if we have some free time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four generals all
behaved in a fairly friendly manner towards Ning. They were on the
same side, after all, and they had all sworn lifeblood oaths to
support each other. Naturally, they would be quite a cohesive force.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the sixth general
arrived as well as Elder God Imperius.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Starlord has
arrived.” The seven turned to stare towards the outside, sensing
the vast astral aura approaching. Moments later, an astral-robed man
stepped into the hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings,
Starlord.” The six generals and Elder God Imperius all bowed
respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord sat down
in the principal seat. “You can be seated as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you,
Starlord.” Ning and the others all sat down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve summoned all
of our Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals to Fogstone. I imagine you
have your own guesses as to why.” The Starlord had a smile on his
face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were all quite curious. Given that the Starlord had summoned all of
their many scattered armies…there definitely had to be an important
reason behind this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The entire Fogstone
Army is going to mobilize. Every World-level expert and every soldier
is going to move out…and assault the Blacklotus Empire,” the
Starlord said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was shocked as
well. Although he was awaiting a good chance to act against the
Mindlord, he was still stunned upon hearing this news. Generally
speaking, the various organizations within the Badlands Territory
would only engage in small-scale skirmishes against each other. These
skirmishes were only meant to temper the Elder Gods and Ancestral
Immortals within their ranks. Things would rarely escalate to the
point of a full-blown war! Wars on that level…they had a tremendous
impact on the area and would result in horrifying casualties.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the Fogstone
Dominion had nine World-level experts, the Blacklotus Empire had six!
In addition, a battle between cultivators wouldn’t be solely
dependent on mere numbers alone. A single powerful World-level expert
could very possibly counter seven or eight weaker World-level
experts. An extremely powerful one, such as World God Northrest when
he wielded Violetjewel, could easily slay ten ordinary World Gods who
stood in his path!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, numbers didn’t
mean everything. No one could say for certain what the various
World-level experts hid up their sleeves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our plan has already
been drawn up,” the Starlord said. “The seven of you will each
take control over 999 Elder Gods or Ancestral Immortals! You’ll
form a total of six ‘Minor Thousand Elder Gods Formation’ and one
‘Minor Thousand Ancestral Immortals Formation’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seven formations?”
Ning was secretly shocked by this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A formation that
allowed a thousand Elder Gods to join their power would be able to
surround and kill some of the weaker World-level experts! Even
powerful ones would be stymied for a time by them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Imperius will be
responsible for the Ancestral Immortals, while the six of you will be
responsible for the Elder Gods. I’ll give you all a month to
familiarize yourselves with these formations,” the Starlord said.
“A month from now, we shall head out towards the Blacklotus
Empire.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Acknowledged.” The
six generals and Elder God Imperius all assented in unison.
</P>

Chapter 36 - Sparring With the Sword Again
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the other
generals each accepted a set of formations, then left. Because Ning
didn’t have his own estate on the planet of Fogstone, the Starlord
of Fogstone arranged special accommodations for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The estate Ning was
given was roughly a hundred kilometers in size. It was once filled
with gardens and pools, but all of those things had been flattened as
a military drill grounds had been established here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“General.” A throng
of Elder Gods were standing on the drill ground, watching Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nine captains!”
Ning called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Present!”
Instantly, nine goldenscale Elder Gods responded to Ning’s call.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Each of you shall
command a total of 110 Elder Gods. Spend some time getting
familiarized with this formation and getting better control over it.”
Ning waved his hand, causing nine dark-golden discs to fly out
towards those nine captains. The entire Fogstone Army had undergone a
significant revamping, with some of the personal servants of the
World-level experts having been sent to join as well to make sure
that each team had enough men!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine captains
accepted the dark-golden discs, quickly binding them and attuning
themselves to the mysteries within them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for the rest of
you…” Ning looked at the other Elder Gods, then waved his hand
again, causing a large number of slightly smaller formation-discs to
appear in the air. The divine runes covering these formation-discs
were slightly less complicated as well. “You need to work hard as
well. Cooperate with your captains. Your formation-discs will be a
bit simpler; I trust that in four or five days, you should have
mastered them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.
The nine hundred-plus discs all flew towards the Elder Gods, with
each Elder God receiving one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for me?” Ning
explained, “I’ll be at the core of the formation, leading the
nine captains.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine you have
already have an inkling as to what this is. Correct…this is a
‘Minor Thousand Elder Gods Formation’!” Ning could see the
curious looks on the faces of the Elder Gods. Most of them were
probably secretly exchanging mental whispers, and so Ning just went
straight to the point.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Elder Gods
present fell silent upon hearing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Minor Thousand Elder
Gods Formation?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A formation which would
allow a thousand Elder Gods to perfectly join their strength together
and unleash it? Supposedly, even weak World Gods who were trapped
within such a formation would be slain by it. They were actually
going to have a chance to use such a legendarily powerful formation?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hundred Elder Gods
Formation. Minor Thousand Elder Gods Formation. Major Thousand Elder
Gods Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These formations
weren’t developed by any single power or any single Daolord. They
had been developed and refined by many generations of major powers
over the course of countless years. By now, they had reached the
point of utmost perfection! It could be said that there was no way to
improve these formations any further at all. They had become
perfectly standardized and refined, and so all ‘Minor Thousand
Elder Gods Formations’ were identical to each other, capable of
allowing a thousand Elder Gods to unleash the full might of their
combined power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From this day
forth.” Ning swept the Elder Gods with his gaze. “You will have
just one assignment. You are to master this formation as quickly as
possible! You can practice with your captains and comrades in small
groups. Every three days, all of us will come together for a joint
practice session.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. Go and
meditate on the formation,” Ning commanded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, General.” The
Elder God soldiers all responded in unison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s own
formation-disc was the most complicated disc of all. He would be at
the center of the formation and responsible for harmonizing it, and
so Ning actually entered the Heavengazer Tower to meditate on it in
detail. After spending six days inside the Heavengazer Tower, Ning
completely mastered the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three days passed in
the outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The planet of Fogstone.
The drill grounds at the front of Ning’s estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble the
formation!” Ning issued the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the thousand
formation-discs joined together, causing countless streams of light
to spring up and form a web that covered every single Elder God. The
entire region seemed to be completely encompassed by this net of
light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a strange
feeling.” Ning stood there, head raised towards the skies. “I
feel as though I’ve become one with the heavens and the earth of
this area.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once the formation was
established, the users would become one with this dimension, forming
a world unto themselves. This was the reason why they were able to
fight evenly against even World-level experts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning glanced
sideways towards a fairly muscular Elder God captain. The formation
in his region was trembling slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m still not that
accustomed to this formation.” The captain sent a rather ashamed
mental message.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sent back, “Get
accustomed, fast.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The muscular
captain himself realized that the eight other captains were in
complete control of their parts; he was the only one who was falling
behind. As for the ordinary Elder God soldiers, quite a few of them
were rather unstable as well. However, because those soldiers served
ancillary roles, their instability wouldn’t make much of a
difference. They were like the twigs, while the nine captains were
like the branches! As for Ning, he was the trunk of the tree!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If anything happened to
Ning, the entire formation would collapse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A world unto
ourselves…once we strike, we’ll strike with not just the power of
all the Elder Gods, but also with the power of the world itself.”
Ning nodded to himself. An enemy attack on any single Elder God would
be dispersed across the entire formation, as well as the world which
the formation had created. Most likely, 99% of the power would be
dispersed into the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only a tiny amount of
power would actually land upon the thousand Elder Gods!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, most World-level
experts would be unable to do anything to a thousand Elder Gods who
had joined together in such a formation. Weaker ones would actually
be killed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. Most of our
Elder Gods have already mastered the technique. Go back and spend
some more time on it. I hope that three days from now, our formation
will be even more perfect,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, General.” The
Elder God soldiers were all rather excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was their first
time being part of such a tremendously mighty force. Even though they
were merely the twigs of this mighty formation, they were still
supposed by the world which this formation created, allowing each of
them to reach the World God threshold of power. As for the nine
captains, they would be even more powerful. As the center of the
formation, Ning was the most powerful of them all! He was now far
more powerful than when he was by himself and using the azureflower
mist energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooosh. The Elder
God soldiers quickly departed and the drill grounds fell silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Just as Ning
turned to leave, he suddenly saw a figure appear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black-robed man with
tousled hair had appeared on the drill grounds. He had a smile on his
face as he strolled towards Ning in a leisurely fashion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was surprised.
World God Blackmist? Why had he come to this place?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, senior.”
Ning immediately called out respectfully to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I could sense you
assembling the formation so I took a look. Your forces have been
pretty fast. The formation is more or less ready, and your control
over it is excellent.” World God Blackmist chuckled. “The core
formation-disc is the most complicated disc. To be able to master it
within three days is impressive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hurriedly said, “I
actually spent a total of six days. I relied on the assistance of a
temporal treasure to speed time up for myself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Blackmist
couldn’t help but let out a surprised laugh. This Darknorth really
was quite an honest fellow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Starlord gave
you a month, primarily because the core-disc is extremely hard to
master. Six days is still impressive.” World God Blackmist
continued, “Last time, when you sparred against me, I could see
that that your sword-arts were on the verge of making a great
breakthrough. Have you succeeded?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I did indeed make a
breakthrough,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” World God
Blackmist’s eyes lit up. He couldn’t help it; of the Elder Gods
and Ancestral Immortals on Fogstone, the only one who was truly an
expert in the Dao of the Sword was Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come on, then. Let’s
spar a bit!” World God Blackmist said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning was
growing excited as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning produced a
longsword that seemed to flow with the waters of autumn. It was the
flexible Dao sword he had acquired. Since they were merely sparring
and testing out each other’s sword-arts, there was no need to take
out an Eternal weapon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful.” World
God Blackmist waved his hand, causing an ordinary-looking longsword
to appear. He naturally wouldn’t use his most powerful weapon in a
sparring match against a junior.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A smile on his face,
World God Blackmist struck out with the sword in his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the sword-light
flashed, it instantly seemed to fill the heavens and the earth with
its light. The surrounding area seemed to have been transformed into
an endless haze of black mist…and suddenly, a bizarre but
dominating streak of sword-light stabbed out from within the mist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning remained quite
calm. He knew that this was the ‘Sword World’ of World God
Blackmist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” Ning
struck out with an exceedingly savage stab as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When his sword shot
out, it was like a stream of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the fastest
and most penetrative stance of the [Brightmoon] sword-art, the ‘Blood
Drop stance’. By now, this stance had been completely infused with
the essence of the ‘Killsword stance’ of the [Nameless]
sword-art. The [Nameless] sword-art actually represented a certain
realm of comprehension regarding the sword. After absorbing the
essence of its techniques, Ning had completely incorporated them into
[Brightmoon].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the Killsword
stance struck, it held nothing back at all! Once the sword struck
out, it carried an aura of grim resolve with it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword-light
clashed against Blackmist’s strange sword-light, smashing it apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? This sword-art
is quite clever. Last time, your sword-arts focused around complete
control and perfect flawlessness. This time, it’s the opposite…you
ignore all else in favor of an attack that holds nothing back at all,
filling it with savage resolve. In savagery alone, you are quite
close to the average ‘Sword World’ level.” World God
Blackmist’s voice rang out. “Fortunately, I’m not new to the
Sword World level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of Ning’s
sword-art was quite tremendous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The essence of the
Killsword stance was to be vicious to the enemy and merciless to the
self. It ignored all defense and held nothing back, sending forth a
strike of utterly incomparable might that was close in power to that
of an ordinary Sword World’s might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only someone who had
already mastered the Heartsword stance would be able to use this
technique without injuring himself. If someone who didn’t master
the Heartsword stance was to train in this technique, they wouldn’t
have the flawless control necessary to ensure that there would be no
openings. The end result would be that if you were unable to kill
your opponent, your opponent would be able to seize upon your flaws
and kill you instead!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only when the
Heartsword stance was mastered could one use such a dangerous,
ruinous stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The longer Blackmist
fought, the more excited he became. This Darknorth truly was talented
in sword-arts. He had improved so dramatically since their last
fight! Aside from the savage and violent ‘Killsword stance’, Ning
actually had another sword-art that was even more shocking to
Blackmist. This was something Ning had come up with based on
Violetjewel’s quintessence core. Although it hadn’t truly taken
shape, it was still enough to make Blackmist’s heart clench.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough, enough.”
World God Blackmist laughed. “I’m using a Chaos weapon and the
strength of an Elder God, but I’m at the verge of being beaten.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m using a Dao
weapon,” Ning hurriedly explained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, so that’s how
it is.” World God Blackmist once more let out a surprised laugh as
he glanced at Ning’s flexible sword. “That explains it. My
sword-arts are clearly more profound than yours, and yet I wasn’t
able to suppress you when I used a Chaos weapon and the strength of
an Elder God.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt tremendous
gratitude in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had sparred for
quite a long period of time just now. Only when Ning was unable to
gain anything further had Blackmist brought things to a halt. This
sparring match allowed Ning to test and verify all the many insights
he had gained during the past few centuries, which translated into
thousands of years in the Heavengazer Tower. His sword-arts had
improved by quite a bit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s rare for
Fogstone to produce such an expert in the Dao of the Sword.” World
God Blackmist looked at Ning. “I can sense that your talent in the
sword is no lower than the Starlord’s was. Train hard. Oh, right.
Be careful on this trip to the Blacklotus Empire. Staying alive is
what matters the most.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Also…this is a
sword-art I personally devised. It has a simple name: [Blackmist]
sword-art. You are already so talented with the sword that this
sword-art of mine won’t be of much use to you, but if you read
through it you might gain a few ideas.” World God Blackmist waved
his hand, producing a jade slip which he tossed to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately caught
it, then said gratefully, “Thank you, senior.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To be honest, I was
thinking about taking you on as my disciple. However, judging by your
performance today, I can tell that you’ll soon catch up to me and
perhaps even surpass me.” Blackmist smiled. “Alright. Continue
with your preparations for the war.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Blackmist
departed in as leisurely a fashion as he had arrived. His hair still
tousled and mussled, he casually sauntered off before slowly
disappearing into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt tremendous
gratitude towards the man. The very first time Ning had arrived on
Fogstone and met with World God Blackmist, Blackmist had personally
sparred with him and guided him as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time continued to pass,
and Ning spent his days analyzing World God Blackmist’s sword-arts.
Soon, a full month had gone past. It was time for the grand army to
go on campaign!

Chapter 37 - Invasion
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord’s
estate. An enormous empty region within the estate was filled with a
teeming mass of Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder what they
are planning to do with such an enormous force.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They have to be
planning on attacking a different organization.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if they plan to
launch an attack, is there a need to go this far? The Fogstone Army
usually has around three thousand Elder Gods, and they normally would
use just three of those formations. But now, they’ve actually
managed to summon a force of seven thousand Elder Gods and Ancestral
Immortals, including some who were servants or slaves of the various
Chaos Immortals and World Gods.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s just watch
and see.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals were all discussing this amongst themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Elder God
Imperius, and a few others who knew the truth felt a certain
tightness in their chests. Yes…their leaders had spared no expense
on this war.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had originally
numbered just three thousand, but after recalling all of their
far-flung forces and adding in many servants and slaves, the Fogstone
Army now numbered seven thousand! Ancestral Immortal Imperius was a
good example of an irregular who had been pulled in. He was the
disciple of Chaos Immortal Abyssus and was incredibly strong, which
was why he had been assigned to command one of the seven armies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder what sort
of a feud exists between the Blacklotus Empire and the Fogstone
Dominion. Why is the Starlord going all out in this fight?” Ning
murmured these words to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here they are.”
Ning’s eyes suddenly lit up as he saw the nine figures walking
towards them from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The leader of the nine
was the astral-robed Starlord of Fogstone. Next to him were the other
World-level major powers. The nine of them walked forwards together,
causing all of the gathered Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals to
fall silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone,” the
Starlord said, “This campaign is an extremely important one. When
the fight begins, all of you need to listen to the orders of your
generals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” all the
soldiers acknowledged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">‘Come in.” The
Starlord waved his hand. Whoosh. Instantly, a ripple of power spread
out. None of the Elder Gods or Ancestral Immortals resisted,
resulting in all of them disappearing into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“By my command, the
planet of Fogstone is to be completely sealed. No one is to be
allowed to enter or leave.” A sonorous voice suddenly spread out
into the ears of every single cultivator on the planet. Even the
normally public trading markets were quickly sealed away as the
entire planet was put on lockdown.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh
swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine World-level
experts soared upwards, quickly appearing in the skies and staring
down upon Fogstone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come in.” The
Starlord waved his hand, causing the enormous planet of Fogstone
itself to disappear as well. The planet had long ago been refined
into an enormous magic treasure. This was the core legacy of the
entire Fogstone lineage. Now that the entire Fogstone Army was on
campaign, the Starlord naturally wasn’t willing to leave the planet
here undefended.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Starlord really
is going out this time,” a green-robed elder said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This time, we’re
going to have a chance to witness the Starlord’s true power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If all of us go
all-out, we might very well be able to wipe out the entire Blacklotus
Empire, even though that isn’t our goal. The only thing I’m
concerned about is the guardian formation protecting the imperial
capital of the Blacklotus Empire.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Starlord, that
guardian formation truly is quite deadly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other World-level
experts all issued words of caution.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enemy’s capital
was bound to be an incredibly dangerous place to invade. Every
generation of Starlords had worked hard to further reinforce
Fogstone, rendering its formations increasingly deadly. Although the
Blacklotus Empire wasn’t as old as Fogstone and mainly relied on
God Emperor Blacklotus’ personal power, without a doubt the God
Emperor and his vassals had set up many mighty formations around the
imperial capital.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. Just
carry out our plan,” the Starlord said. “All you need to do is do
what I told you to do. Don’t worry about anything else.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These World-level
experts were just giving the Starlord a few words of caution. They
weren’t ordinary pawns who could be sacrificed for the sake of a
greater goal. Given their power, they were qualified to speak and
treat with the Starlord as equals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. We can’t
waste any time.” The Starlord frowned. “The sudden disappearance
of Fogstone will soon be noticed, but it’ll take a bit of time
before the word gets to the imperial capital of the Blacklotus
Empire. We need to get there as soon as possible. Ideally, we’ll
arrive before the Blacklotus Empire is prepared for us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After speaking, the
Starlord waved his hand and caused a ship of stars to appear before
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine World-level
experts all boarded this ship, which then twinkled with starlight and
disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial capital of
the Blacklotus Empire was located within the Blacklotus Chaosworld.
It was the central administrative city for the entire Blacklotus
Empire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire city was
actually an enormous magic treasure which was shaped like a
nine-petal black lotus. The entire city stretched out ten million
kilometers and was seated at the very tip of a mountain. The city’s
layout was actually quite similar to the layout of the Badlands
Everworld’s Waveshift City. This was a testament to how ambitious
God Emperor Blacklotus was. He was an incredibly arrogant figure,
which was why he had styled himself as the ‘God Emperor’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder what’s
been going on with the Fogstone Dominion lately. They actually
summoned back all of their Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals from
their various stations.” A gray-robed, black-haired man was
frowning in thought as he sat within a winehouse located in the
imperial capital.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This gray-robed,
black-haired man had lofty brows, and the look in his eyes made it so
that not even the winehouse’s attendants dared to go near him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that
Fogstone is about to launch a grand campaign?” The gray-robed man
muttered to himself, “It can’t be for the sake of that Ji Ning
fellow, right? He shouldn’t have that sort of ability.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Goddamn Ji Ning.”
The gray-robed man’s face grew uglier by the moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was one of the Nine
Divine Generals of God Emperor Blacklotus, the Mindlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His Primaltwin had
possessed Old Man Yuan in the Three Realms and had lived there for
many years. As he saw it, for someone like him to wipe out a
backwaters chaosworld was simplicity itself!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although a World God in
the form of Mother Nuwa had suddenly appeared out of nowhere, the
Mindlord had remained hidden and didn’t reveal his true power or
intentions. Eventually, Mother Nuwa left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had remained hidden,
even after her departure. He was in no rush, and his long life had
taught him to be patient.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, the Endwar had
come.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First, that ‘Lord of
the Demonheart’ had appeared once more! Although Demonheart had the
power of a supreme Elder God, Old Man Yuan felt confident in being
able to handle him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And yet, those yokels
had actually given rise to a formidable Heartforce Cultivator, Houyi!
Still, this was not entirely unexpected. Old Man Yuan had taken
control over Chang’e long ago, precisely because he wanted to have
some leverage over Houyi. As a Heartforce Cultivator, he knew exactly
how devastating such a mental influence could have on a cultivator.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had accounted for
everything…except for this Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning. He had trained
for a very brief period of time, but he was an utterly terrifying
monster. In the end, Ji Ning had broken through and become so
powerful that he had utterly crushed Old Man Yuan, defeating his
palm-arts through superior sword-arts, then stabbing him through the
forehead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone who has the
power of a truly transcendent Elder God.” Old Man Yuan had truly
been terrified. He immediately planned a deception, and in the moment
of his death he willed all of his servants and slaves to die. He even
released his bindings over his various magic treasures, so as to put
on a show of being truly dead. All of this was for the sake of
preventing Ji Ning from finding him later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, when the
Mindlord carefully analyzed this matter, he realized that he had made
an miscalculation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Witherspike!” The
gray-robed elder muttered to himself, “I didn’t give a damn about
Witherspike, but he knew exactly who I was. It is very possible that
he might’ve told Ji Ning and the others about me. If he did
that…given how much those of the Three Realms hate me, they’ll
definitely come for revenge. Given how strong Ji Ning is, he stands a
very good chance of surviving the trip through that spatial vortex
tunnel!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If he wants
revenge…he’d probably want to find a backer. It’s entirely
possible that he might’ve joined one of the nearby organizations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Mindlord had
instantly come to this conclusion, and so he immediately began to
purchase intelligence reports to see if any transcendent Elder Gods
had appeared in recent years! In the end, he finally found out that
Fogstone had gained a new general by the name of ‘Sunrise’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sunrise?” The
gray-robed elder smirked. “Transcendent Elder Gods don’t just
appear out of nowhere. If Ji Ning truly has left the Three Realms, he
most likely is this ‘Sunrise’ figure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he had already
guessed at the truth, there was still nothing that he could do about
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sunrise was stationed
on the Windsource World and had three hundred Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals under his command. What was the Mindlord supposed
to do? Ask a World-level expert to intervene? He didn’t have that
sort of ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All he could do was
hide!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t even know
if this ‘Sunrise’ really is Ji Ning,” the gray-robed elder
muttered to himself. “I hope he isn’t. I hope that Witherspike
never told Ji Ning about me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To tell the truth, the
Mindlord had been miserable in recent years! However, he knew that he
had to keep enduring it and bide his time. He had to at least verify
whether or not Sunrise really was Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Sunrise really was…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Going outside by
himself would be suicide.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“OUTRAGEOUS!!!”
Suddenly, a furious roar rang out, echoing throughout the entire
chaosworld and causing it to tremble. All the cultivators within the
imperial capital of Blacklotus were shocked by this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come to my estate
immediately!” An icy cold voice that was tinged with rage suddenly
rang out in the Mindlord’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His Imperial
Majesty?” The Mindlord was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ignoring everyone and
everything else, the gray-robed figure immediately flew out of the
innhouse’s window and headed straight towards the God Emperor’s
estate.

Chapter 38 - Leagacy Treasure, Fogstone Planet
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Blacklotus
Chaosworld. A giant warship with an aura of awe-inspiring majesty was
forcing its way straight through this world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The warship was ten
thousand kilometers long, and at its prow stood nine World-level
experts. Behind them stood a dense cluster of seven thousand Elder
Gods and Ancestral Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This chaosworld is
the home of God Emperor Blacklotus.” The Starlord’s face was icy
and solemn. “There’s no way for us to escape his notice after we
enter his chaosworld. Still…there’s no need to keep it hidden.
It’ll be too late for him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The great warship
disappeared in a teleportation. When it reappeared, it was over the
clouds that were above an enormous city that was shaped like a black
lotus with nine petals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A ripple of power
spread out from the Blacklotus imperial capital. The ripple of power
spread out to cover the entire chaosworld, seeking to completely seal
it off from the space around it, but it was too late.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the imperial
capital of the Blacklotus Empire?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A city shaped like a
nine-petal black lotus…it has to be it.” Only now did most of the
Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals aboard the ship understand who
their target was. It was actually the Blacklotus Empire! All of them
felt both excited and nervous. If they were by themselves, they would
never dare to cause trouble here…but now there were seven thousand
of them as well as nine World-level powers!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This filled all of them
with excitement and eagerness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble the
formations,” the Starlord commanded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven generals,
including Ji Ning and Imperius, immediately began to assemble their
formations. In almost an instant, all seven thousand of the Elder
Gods and Ancestral Immortals were in place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not a single one
moved to flee?” The Starlord sat at the very front of the prow,
staring downwards at the vast city below them. The entire chaosworld
was now sealed so tightly that not even an ant could escape from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps they feel
that they are strong enough to leave when they please, if they feel
the need to do so later,” Chaos Immortal Abyssus said with a
chuckle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
Starlord laughed coldly. “They won’t be able to.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord swept open
his astral robes. Instantly, an enormous planet suddenly appeared in
midair. It was the planet of Fogstone! Fogstone was kept to a size of
merely ten million kilometers, roughly the same size as the
nine-petal black lotus below it, but Fogstone was emanating ripples
of utterly terrifying power. And then…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It shot out countless
specks of astral light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The starlight spread
out to cover trillions of kilometers, completely illuminating the
city beneath it, the nearby mountains and lakes, and the distant seas
themselves as well as many mortal cities. In fact…its light spread
out to cover this entire chaosworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“W-what’s…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless living
beings within this chaosworld, mortals and beasts included, all
stared in puzzlement at the starlight that had just appeared
everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The starlight felt very
comfortable to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
A cultivator suddenly realized, to his shock, that it was now
impossible to engage in teleportation here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ripples of
spacetime have become completely locked.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the black lotus
city.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Inside the God
Emperor’s estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six figures were
standing shoulder-to-shoulder, staring upwards at the skies. When
they saw the enormous planet of Fogstone suddenly appear and radiate
starlight in every direction, their faces all paled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” A chubby,
ruddy-skinned alien with just one vertical eye let out a growl. “The
Starlord of Fogstone has actually moved his headquarters, the planet
of Fogstone, to this place. According to the stories, the planet of
Fogstone is actually the legacy treasure of the entire Fogstone
lineage. When it spreads out its astral light, it will completely
suppress the local ripples of spacetime, causing every single region
to be completely locked down. There’s no way for us to escape, even
if we wished to do so.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They actually
brought their entire planet with them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s not much
of a feud between us and Fogstone. We have the occasional border
skirmish, but none of our World-level powers have ever feuded against
theirs. Why would the Starlord be so crazed as to move his entire
planet here for this attack?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six were all quite
puzzled. God Emperor Blacklotus was puzzled as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fogstone Dominion
was of an ancient lineage, and its legacy treasure was the planet of
Fogstone itself. In addition, every single Starlord of Fogstone was a
terrifying figure. Even if a person was once nothing more than an
ordinary World-level power, upon assuming the mantle of ‘Starlord
of Fogstone’ that person would transform into an utterly terrifying
figure. This was all because of the legacy treasure known as the
planet Fogstone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fogstone could be used
to attack…and if one paid an incalculable price, one would be able
to unleash utterly ruinous power from it. The planet itself was
filled with countless dangers and traps, making it so that very few
organizations would dare to raid it or launch attacks within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When used as a
defensive structure, World-level experts had virtually no chance of
breaking through into Fogstone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When used to trap foes,
the astral light it radiated would make it so that even World-level
experts would move much slower!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single Starlord
of Fogstone had the power to command and control the planet of
Fogstone. This naturally made them some of the most troublesome
opponents a World-level expert could face!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Starchild.” A cold
voice rang out, echoing within the prow of the incoming warship. “I
don’t believe my Blacklotus Empire has ever offended you…and yet,
you’ve actually gone so far as to move your legacy treasure, the
planet of Fogstone, to my territory.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blacklotus.” The
Starlord stared downwards from his position at the prow, then said in
a calm voice, “It is true that no grudges exist between the two of
us, and I have no desire to engage in a war against you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No desire to engage
in a war? Then why have you come in such force?” The voice of the
God Emperor rang out once more, causing the very air above the
imperial capital to tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve come here
today solely for the sake of Immortal Owlsoar,” the Starlord said
calmly. “After killing Owlsoar, I’ll immediately lead my forces
away and also offer valuable treasures to make up for the offense.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone fell silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll give you as
much time as is needed for a single stick of incense to be burned.
Afterwards, if you choose to continue to protect Owlsoar, I’ll have
no choice but to press the attack.” As the Starlord spoke, he waved
his hand. A stick of gray incense instantly appeared in the air then
self-ignited, emitting a calming and fragrant aroma. This was a
precious treasure which cultivators used, known as the ‘Three Zens
Incense’. Once it was lit, the cultivator would become extremely
calm and be able to much more easily sense the Dao. This was of great
benefit. When Ning trained in the [Solitary World God], what he
needed to break through to the next level was to have his heart be
completely calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s this all
about?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Owlsoar, the
Starlord of Fogstone did all this just to kill you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What sort of grudge
exists between the two of you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other five,
including God Emperor Blacklotus, turned to stare at Chaos Immortal
Owlsoar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Owlsoar was a
jade-eyed elder who had a divine blood tattoo on his forehead. His
oily jade eyes inspired terror in all who saw him. He frowned and
said in a low voice, “I don’t think there is any enmity between
the two of us. Don’t be impatient. Let me ask him about this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Starlord of
Fogstone.” Immortal Owlsoar’s cold voice rang out towards the
great warship in the skies. “I don’t know how I’ve offended
you. Is it possible that there has been some sort of a
misunderstanding?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…misunderstanding?”
The cold voice that rang down from above was filled with endless
hatred. “Were you the one behind the great massacre that occurred
within the Blackcold Chaosworld?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Owlsoar’s
face immediately changed upon hearing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the sake of forging
a mighty sin-treasure, he had once butchered countless living
creatures. However, although he had slain many individuals, he had
been careful not to slay any creatures who were protected by other
World-level experts. However, he knew that this sort of butchery
would naturally stir revulsion amongst certain noble-minded figures
and possibly result in them attacking him, which is why he had
immediately joined God Emperor Blacklotus after finishing the
refining process.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Was there a
connection between the creatures of that chaosworld and you?”
Immortal Owlsoar still couldn’t believe it. By his calculations,
when he wiped out the Blackcold Chaosworld the Starlord of Fogstone,
Starchild, had been nothing more than a young fellow. Back then, the
Starlord had actually been Starchild’s father.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…” A
frenzied, frozen laughter was torn from the Starlord’s throat. “My
Dao-companion was located on the Blackcold Chaosworld!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Immortal
Owlsoar’s face completely changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Back then, Starchild
truly had been nothing more than a young fellow, and his
Dao-companion was nothing more than a weak female Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All those years ago, in
the face of the power of a Chaos Immortal like Owlsoar, they were
nothing more than dust in the wind. But now…the weak little
Starchild had come for revenge in his capacity as the Starlord of
Fogstone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blacklotus.”
Immortal Owlsoar hurriedly turned his head to look at the frowning
God Emperor Blacklotus. He said frantically, “Blacklotus, we aren’t
that much weaker than them. There’s no need for us to be afraid of
Starchild.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” God Emperor
Blacklotus glanced sideways at him and let out a cold snort. Clearly,
he was quite unhappy at the trouble which Immortal Owlsoar had
brought to his doorstep.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">God Emperor Blacklotus
had quite an unpleasant look on his face, and he felt quite unhappy
that the Starlord of Fogstone had come to his very doorsteps.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this very moment.
The spacetime transfer array of Sevenwater Star.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A barefoot old man
dressed in ragged clothes suddenly appeared within the array.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Immortals and
Fiendgods responsible for protecting the array stared at the old man
in astonishment. “H-he…actually paid the fee to have the array be
activated for him ahead of schedule?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This would cost a
hundred bottles of chaos nectar for short distances and even more for
longer distances. Thus, not even World Gods or Chaos Immortals would
do so lightly. Generally speaking, only the most top-tier of
World-level experts would ever choose to have the spacetime transfer
arrays activated for them on an individual basis. They often
travelled throughout the outside world, after all, and constantly
went from one array to another. If they had to pay for a personal
activation each time, the costs would be quite staggering. Thus, it
was quite rare for even the caretakers of the spacetime transfer
arrays to see a cultivator have the array activated on an individual
basis. This was especially true for a lesser-travelled location such
as Sevenwater Star.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for this old man’s
strange appearance, that didn’t really matter. Cultivators dressed
and acted as they pleased. They could all tell that this barefoot old
man had an extraordinary demeanor. None of the caretakers even dared
to breathe loudly in front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh. Finally made it
to the Sevenwater Star of the Badlands Territory.” The raggedy old
man stepped out of the formation and into the skies. He muttered to
himself, “If Daolord Windsource was going to die, he could’ve
just died somewhere convenient. Why the hell did he have to run all
the way over here, to the Badlands Territory? This old man is
dog-tired from the journey.”

place. I hope my information is correct and the talisman is truly

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The raggedy old man
took another step through the void of space, then completely
disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Blacklotus
Chaosworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Above the city shaped
like a black lotus with nine petals was an enormous planet that
glimmered with boundless amounts of astral light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two forces faced
each other watchfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the God
Emperor’s estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you think we
should do, everyone?” God Emperor Blacklotus glanced at the other
four World-level experts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Help me out,
everyone.” Chaos Immortal Owlsoar looked at the other four as well,
a hint of ill-disguised entreaty on his face. At a time like this,
face no longer mattered. If God Emperor Blacklotus and the other five
weren’t willing to stand up for him and he was forced to face the
might of the entire Fogstone Army by himself, he would most assuredly
perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Owlsoar, you…ugh.
Forget it. It is far too late now.” A man dressed in a white robe
embroidered with flowers shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What, are all of you
shrinking back already? The Fogstone Dominion isn’t that much more
powerful than us. If they force us to bow our heads this time, how
will we ever be able to raise our heads again when meeting the other
World-level powers of the Badlands Territory?” An alien covered in
oily black armor spoke out, his golden eyes filled with anger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The entire reason we
all joined together in an alliance was so that we could jointly deal
with any threats, right? It’s also been a long time since I’ve
had a good fight. My hands itch.” The chubby cyclopean alien spoke
out in concurrence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A look of delight and
gratitude appeared on Immortal Owlsoar’s face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll listen to
what Blacklotus says,” the bald, gray-robed elder said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blacklotus…” All
of them turned to look at God Emperor Blacklotus. Immortal Owlsoar
had a hopeful look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">God Emperor Blacklotus
gave Immortal Owlsoar a glance, secretly shaking his head. He had
always felt rather contemptuous towards Immortal Owlsoar. Immortal
Owlsoar had only been able to break into the World-level due to a
stroke of tremendous luck, not talent. After breaking through to this
level, it had become extremely difficult for him to improve any
further at all. Thus, Immortal Owlsoar had chosen to embark upon an
evil path…and yet, despite having chosen this path, Immortal
Owlsoar was always worried about the consequences of his actions. As
a result couldn’t be considered a truly demonic figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Based on what God
Emperor Blacklotus knew…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The truly demonic
figures of the legends were able to throw an entire territory into
utter turmoil despite merely being World-level figures! They would
cause all the living creatures of tens of thousands of chaosworlds to
perish for the sake of refining a single terrifying sin-treasure.
Compared to those figures, Immortal Owlsoar was quite lacking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, I agree
with what you said.” God Emperor Blacklotus nodded. “Since we’ve
chosen to stand together, we need to remain unified.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Owlsoar was
delighted upon hearing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition…although
Starchild claims that he holds a huge grudge against Immortal
Owlsoar, who knows if he’s even telling the truth?” God Emperor
Blacklotus laughed coldly. “He might have simply come up with a
random excuse to force us to give up Owlsoar. After he kills Owlsoar,
what’s to stop him from coming up with another random excuse to
kill another one of us? Are we supposed to give up our fellows one
after the other? By then, we’ll be even weaker before. They’d
probably be able to wipe us out at one blow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, right! This
is probably a plot!” Immortal Owlsoar said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough! Shut your
damn mouth. I only said he ‘might have’.” God Emperor
Blacklotus cast him a cold glance. “The more likely answer is that
he really does hold a grudge against Owlsoar. To engage in such a
large battle for just a bit of territory wouldn’t really be worth
it. It is very possible that his Dao-companion truly was killed by
Owlsoar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Owlsoar
nervously bit his lips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still…for him to
force his way to our doorstep is a sign of completely disrespect
towards me and towards all of you.” God Emperor Blacklotus said
calmly, “They have nine World-level experts while we only have six,
but we also have the protective formations surrounding our imperial
capital. How dare they act so brashly?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They really are
holding us in no regard whatsoever.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They’re actually
kicking in our doors. Let’s have a fight with them and see who is
really stronger.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the warship in the
air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord of
Fogstone and the rest of the nine World-level experts were waiting
quietly. The stick of incense hovering in midair continued to slowly
burn, with less than half of it remaining.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Starchild.” A
voice rang out from below.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have you made your
decision?” The Starlord of Fogstone replied coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You say you wish to
kill Immortal Owlsoar, and so I must let you kill him? What if you
then demand to kill my other World-level experts? Am I supposed to
offer them up as well?” God Emperor Blacklotus’ voice was icy
cold as well. “In the end, I’ll be all by myself…and then
you’ll just gang up on me and kill me, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord frowned
then sent back, “Blacklotus, if you don’t believe me, I’m
willing to swear a lifeblood oath.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need for a
lifeblood oath. Even if Owlsoar truly did kill your Dao-companion, he
is still a Chaos Immortal of my Blacklotus Empire! All of us have
joined together in an alliance, precisely because we saw the value of
joining together against powerful enemies.” God Emperor Blacklotus’
voice grew even colder. “If you leave right away, I’ll forget
about your affront and your invasion of my territory. If you do
not…then I have no choice but to let this be settled through
combat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A true pity.” The
Starlord waved his hand, causing the half-burnt stick of incense to
disappear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems we will
still have to face them in combat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We expected that.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The others, including
Immortal Skyram and Immortal Abyssus, all glanced at each other. All
of them had suspected that Fogstone wasn’t powerful enough to force
the Blacklotus Empire to surrender without firing a single shot.
Thus, they were already prepared to storm this city by force. The
reason why they had acted in such secrecy was to ensure that the
Blacklotus Empire wouldn’t have the chance to purchase any Elder
God Formations of their own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seven formations,
attack!” The Starlord commanded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Acknowledged!”
Ning and the rest of the six called out in unison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,” Ning
ordered. He led his 999 Elder Gods to fly out of the great warship,
and the other six armies flew out alongside them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spread out,” Ning
sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone, Ning
included, began to spread out to cover an area of ten million
kilometers. Their bodies then blurred as they each transformed to
become massive titans who were ten thousand kilometers tall. These
titans each held weapons in their hands and were surrounded by veils
of flowing light. Clearly, they were reinforced by the world-energy
of the ‘Minor Thousand Elder Gods Formation’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A thousand titanic
Elder Gods had appeared, staying within roughly ten thousand
kilometers of each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aside from Ning’s
army, the other six armies of Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals had
also scattered within an area of ten million kilometers. The Elder
Gods all transformed to become ten thousand kilometers tall, and the
weapons in their hands grew alongside them. As for the Ancestral
Immortals, they retreated slightly but began to take control over
their magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“ATTACK!” The
Starlord of Fogstone pointed downwards towards the lotus-shaped city
and gave the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven thousand
Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals howled furiously as they charged
downwards. It was as though a giant hemisphere of light formed by
thousands of towering Fiendgods had come smashing downwards towards
the city…and right behind them were the nine World-level powers!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The World-level powers
were worried about the formations guarding the imperial capital of
Blacklotus. The formations protecting any organization’s
headquarters were bound to be extraordinarily powerful, and ordinary
Chaos Immortals and World Gods might not be able to handle them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the ‘Minor
Thousand Elder Gods formation’ was expressly meant to block attacks
and entangle foes. Thus, part of their plan was to have those seven
formations join together and reinforce each other. This was the most
dangerous part of the plan, and the nine World-level experts weren’t
willing to take the brunt of the danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black cloud suddenly
appeared around the black lotus city below them. The black cloud
drifted outwards, covering the air above the city and serving as a
protective layer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven thousand
Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals simultaneously launched attacks
downwards, with the Elder Gods lashing out with their enormous
weapons. Ning, for example, was using the flexible Dao sword with his
right hand and Violetjewel with his left. Both swords had been
transformed to become many tens of thousands of kilometers long, and
he hacked down furiously with both of them at the same time! But of
course, Ning kept part of Violetjewel’s true power in abeyance, not
letting it truly erupt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, all of their
forces were attacking simultaneously. Even if Ning held nothing back
at all, it wouldn’t make much of a difference. It was better to
keep his true power hidden and unleash it later in a sudden, critical
attack against the forces of the Blacklotus Empire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
The seven thousand Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals launched
frenzied attacks at the black cloud, smashing down with their
gigantic weapons or striking from afar with magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single Elder God
and Ancestral Immortal was supported by the power of the world which
had been created by their formation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the attacks of
ordinary Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals had reached the World God
threshold of power! The nine captains of each formation were even
more powerful, and as for the generals at the center? They were now
comparable to true World-level experts. Although the ordinary Elder
Gods and Ancestral Immortals had merely reached the World God
‘threshhold’ of power, they had the advantage of overwhelming
numbers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of the World-level
experts of the Blacklotus Empire would dare to withstand the combined
assault of seven thousand Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals in
formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black cloud didn’t
seem to resist at all, allowing the enormous weapons and magic
treasures to pass straight through it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It isn’t
blocking?” The nine World-level powers behind the seven thousand
Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals all frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the Blacklotus
Empire focused completely on defense and forcefully fought back
against every attack, it would actually be fairly easy for them to
take it down. In a head-on clash, the Blacklotus Empire’s formation
would have to withstand the full brunt of their blows, after all. But
now that the Blacklotus Empire wasn’t blocking and was instead
enduring and ablating their attacks, things would become a bit more
difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems the
guardian formation of the imperial capital of Blacklotus is quite
profound.” The Starlord sent mentally, “Seven formations, enter
the imperial capital and smash all before you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven thousand
Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals had joined together to form a
half-globe of light that was ten million kilometers across. They
pressed downwards forcefully, emanating a thick aura of World energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, all
World-level experts possessed World energy. Chaos Immortals dispersed
their Jindan region into primordial chaos, then formed a chaosworld
from it. As for World Gods, the mighty power within their body was
equivalent to the power of an entire chaosworld, which was why they
were also capable of forming chaosworlds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning and his
subordinates, they had World energy thanks to the ‘Minor Thousand
Elder Gods Formation’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A thousand Elder Gods
who were able to perfectly mesh their energy together through a
formation would be able to naturally merge with the dimension around
them and be supported by the power of the local World energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven thousand
Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals were incomparably valiant as they
continued their downwards charge, brandishing countless weapons. They
soon charged into the dark clouds that were covering the lotus-shaped
city.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black clouds were
pushed aside by their World energy, and they continued to crash
downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have seven
formations working together.” A hint of a killing intent could be
seen in the Starlord’s eyes. “No matter how formidable your
formations are, there’s no way you can break our seven mighty
formations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A single ‘Minor
Thousand Elder Gods Formation’ was already extremely tough to break
apart. Seven of them joining forces…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord believed
that most likely only a Daolord would be capable of defeating such a
force.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven thousand
Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals were what he was relying on to
deal with the formations protecting the imperial capital of
Blacklotus!

Chapter 40 - Ji Ning and the Mindlord
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The restrictive
spells covering the imperial capital are no longer a threat to us.”
Immortal Abyssus smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” The
Starlord of Fogstone nodded. “Everyone, our seven thousand Elder
Gods and Ancestral Immortals have already entered combat. It is time
for us to join them. Blacklotus and the rest of the six are inside
the city. There’s no way they can avoid my astral light. Let
everything proceed as according to plan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Flickers of killing
intent appeared in the eyes of the World Gods and Chaos Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, your squad
of Elder Gods is responsible for protecting Immortal Overguard.”
The Starlord’s voice rang out by Ning’s ears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous number of
icy blades were howling through the air towards him. The titanic Ning
wielded two swords in his hands, using them to hack with abandon and
knock the blades aside. All of the formations and restrictive spells
protecting the imperial capital had been activated, resulting in a
furious flurry of attacks being directed at the seven thousand Elder
Gods and Ancestral Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Starlord.”
Ning immediately acknowledged the order, then sent out an order of
his own. “Captain Mountain Eater, lead your 110 Elder Gods to
protect Immortal Overguard.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had a total of
nine squads under his command. Elder God Mountain Eater’s squad was
located closest to Immortal Overguard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Acknowledged.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hundred-plus Elder
Gods under Mountain Eater’s command immediately moved into a
defensive perimeter around Chaos Immortal Overguard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Follow me.” Chaos
Immortal Overguard stood atop an enormous formation-diagram which was
covered with four different streams of colored light that emanated an
aura of awesome power. As for Mountain Eater and his hundred, they
were all scattered around him in a protective stance. Once any
attacks from the defensive formation and spells appeared, they would
immediately go forward to block them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning’s army
of a thousand Elder Gods were scattered across various corners of the
castle, they remained joined together in one unit!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A grand formation like
the ‘Minor Thousand Elder Gods Formation’ could be maintained
across great distances. Even if all of them were spread throughout an
entire chaosworld, they would still be able to keep the formation
active. But of course, if they continued to expand it too much beyond
that, there would be no way for the formation to remain active.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine World-level
experts broke apart into six squads, each of which was protected by
over a hundred Elder Gods. The six squads launched attacks against
the six World-level experts of the Blacklotus Empire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, the
World-level experts of both chaos empires were about to clash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Owlsoar.” The
handsome, astral-robed Starlord stared coldly towards the distant
jade-eyed elder. The old man’s eyes were closed as he took out a
treasure that looked like a ritual tower. The ritual tower emanated
the screams and calls of countless souls. Weaker individuals who
heard the terrifying cries emanating from a sin-weapon like this
could very well suffer a mental breakdown.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Starlord of
Fogstone.” Immortal Owlsoar held the ritual tower in his hands,
staring coldly at the Starlord and the black-robed, black-haired man
next to him. “Two of you against me? You honor me too much.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Owlsoar.” World
God Blackmist said calmly, “Today, you shall definitely die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, is that so?”
Immortal Owlsoar let out a cold laugh, then waved his hands.
Suddenly, a large group of figures appeared out of nowhere next to
him. There were exactly a thousand Elder Gods, and they all emanated
the same ripples of World-energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Minor Thousand
Elder Gods Formation?” The Starlord’s face changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He didn’t expect that
Immortal Owlsoar would actually have a thousand Elder Gods with him,
as well as a Minor Thousand Elder Gods Formation of his own. This was
going to be tricky. Everyone knew how defensively formidable these
formations were. When he joined forces with World God Blackmist, he
had thought that it would be easy for them to deal with Owlsoar.
Similarly, if they were just dealing with a thousand Elder Gods in
formation, it wouldn’t be too difficult. But to deal with both at
the same time…this was going to be tough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The Starlord
frowned. His astral light was spread throughout the city, and thus he
saw that a Minor Thousand Elder Gods Formation had suddenly appeared
next to God Emperor Blacklotus as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They actually have
two of their own?” The Starlord was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful,
everyone. The Blacklotus Empire has two Minor Thousand Elder Gods
Formations of their own. One is protecting God Emperor Blacklotus
while the other is protecting Chaos Immortal Owlsoar,” the Starlord
sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why do they have two
of their own?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Was our attack
leaked by someone to them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible. If it
was leaked, the Blacklotus Empire would’ve paid any price necessary
to acquire more of these formations. They wouldn’t just have two.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If there was no
leak…this means they are always carrying two thousand Elder Gods
with them at all times?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The World-level powers
of the Fogstone Dominion conversed mentally amongst themselves,
growing more vigilant and wary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all knew exactly
what these two additional formations represented.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A single such formation
required roughly three hundred cubes of chaos nectar! It must be
understand that even after selling off so many treasures, Ning had
only been able to acquire a bit over a hundred cubes. This was
already roughly equivalent to the entire networth of most World-level
experts. More powerful World-level experts might have perhaps five
hundred cubes worth of treasures, but almost none of them would be
willing to sell off three hundred cubes worth of treasures in order
to purchase a single formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Fogstone
Dominion, the only person who personally owned one of those
formations was Chaos Immortal Abyssus, who had adventured in the
primordial chaos for many years and was unfathomably powerful. None
of the other eight owned any of these formations in their own right!
The Fogstone Dominion itself had three of these formations, but those
belonged to the Fogstone lineage, not the Starlord of Fogstone
himself. This time, they had then paid an utterly enormous price,
selling off quite a few of the Dominion’s treasures in order to buy
an additional three sets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seven total sets. Six
belonged to the Fogstone lineage, one was on loan from Chaos Immortal
Abyssus. From this, one could see how rare and valuable these
formations were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the Blacklotus
Empire?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">God Emperor Blacklotus
had personally established the entire empire; he had no lineage or
backing. As for the other five World-level experts, they were just
temporary vassals and none of them were particularly outstanding.
Logically speaking, they shouldn’t be wealthy enough to waste money
on one of these formations, as none of them should’ve even had that
many Elder God slaves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So…where did these
two formations come from?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“None of the other
World-level experts have a thousand Elder God slaves with them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only God Emperor
Blacklotus might have that many. Although he didn’t have that many
slaves, he did have an army with thousands of Elder Gods. Those two
formations probably came from him…but he built up the Blacklotus
Empire all on his own with no outside backing. How could he possibly
afford two of those formations all by himself?” This was why all
nine of the World-level experts of Fogstone had grown wary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">God Emperor Blacklotus
stood in place, an enormous black lotus with nine petals beneath his
feet. The lotus flower swiveled slowly as its petals spread outwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Beyond the perimeter of
the lotus flowers stood a thousand Elder Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blacklotus, it seems
all of us have underestimated you.” Immortal Abyssus, Immortal
Skyram, and World God Goldcloud stood there in midair, each
surrounded by a hundred Elder Gods who were helping them block the
enemy defensive spells.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fogstone Dominion
had a total of nine World-level experts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three of them had been
sent to deal with God Emperor Blacklotus!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two were dealing with
Immortal Owlsoar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The others were all
fighting in single combat. The goal wasn’t to win; it was just to
tie their foes down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since you’ve
decided to come onto my territory…you shall never leave again.”
God Emperor Blacklotus swept them with a calm gaze. “Attack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!” The
thousand Elder Gods around him all howled furiously as they charged
forwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense the
six titanic shockwaves emanating throughout the city. These were the
shockwaves coming from the battles against the six World-level
experts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, this place
was the imperial capital of Blacklotus! And fortunately, the astral
light of Fogstone was suppressing the ripples of spacetime in this
area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Otherwise, a battle on
this scale and level would’ve caused the entire chaosworld to break
apart long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Things are much
easier for us.” Ning and the seven thousand Elder Gods only had to
focus on dealing with the defensive enemy spells and formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A streak of
violet-golden thunderfire struck directly towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning struck out with
his sword, immediately breaking apart the streak of thunderfire. 99%
of the power of the attack was absorbed by the invisible dimension
protecting them, while the remaining 1% was jointly handled by the
thousand Elder Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning charged
straight forwards. As the center of the entire formation, he had to
stay within the city. So long as he did so, the formation would be
fine. The other Elder Gods were assigned to various regions, but he,
as the core, wasn’t given a specific assignment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Starlord really
is impressive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning moved from
place to place, suppressing the power of the defensive spells and
formations, he also kept an eye on the various World-level experts.
After watching two of them, he turned to watch the battle going on
with the Starlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord was an
extremely dazzling figure. Countless streams of astral light spread
out from around him as though he was their sovereign and emperor. All
by himself, he was able to tie down both Immortal Owlsoar and the
formation of a thousand Elder Gods. World God Blackmist was helping
out as well, but the tower-wielding Immortal Owlsoar and his
formation of Elder Gods was still able resist their attacks. These
formations were meant for defense, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning was
suddenly stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had just seen a
gray-robed, black-haired old man amongst those thousand Elder
Gods…and the man had seen Ning as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sparks began to fly as
their gazes met in midair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old Man Yuan?”
Ning had received a detailed intelligence report regarding the
Mindlord long ago which included information about his appearance. He
was able to recognize the man at a single glance…and the way in
which that man looked at Ning made Ning feel completely certain that
it was definitely Old Man Yuan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?” When the
Mindlord saw that distant, blurry figure amongst the ranks of the
Elder Gods of Fogstone, he was frightened quite badly.

Chapter 41 - The Death of Chaos Immortal Owlsoar
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“H-he actually did
leave the Three Realms.” The Mindlord’s heart was shaking, but he
quickly came back to his senses. “Why should I fear him? I’m a
member of a Minor Thousand Elder Gods Formation. Not even World-level
experts can do anything to me right now. Me, fear him, an Elder God?
It’s actually good that he’s here. I’ll find a chance to kill
him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Him! It’s him!”
Ji Ning had been quite calm, but upon seeing the Mindlord Ning’s
eyes instantly turned bloodshot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those memories began to
play through his mind…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The death of Human
Sovereign Suiren, whose body had transformed into those petals of
kindlefire…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The self-detonations of
Daoist Three Purities, Lord Tathagata the Buddha, Keeper Everwood,
and Buddha Jueming…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Senior
apprentice-brother Houyi, who had died right in front of Chang’e…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And those countless
other Immortals and Fiendgods of the Three Realms who had sacrificed
their lives in self-detonation…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could hear the
sounds of those detonations ringing within his memories. He could
hear those furious roars, those frenzied screams.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Murderous rage began to
swell in his heart, rage which he was unable to suppress. It quickly
filled his entire being.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless comrades had
died in the Endwar…all because of this man!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old Man Yuan! DIE!”
Ning immediately charged straight towards the Mindlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” When the
Mindlord saw Ning transform into a streak of light and fly towards
him, he let out a cold smirk. “He’s just an Elder God. How can he
possibly shake our formation of a thousand Elder Gods?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s too
powerful.” Chaos Immortal Owlsoar had an ugly look on his face. He
gritted his teeth, summoning the ritual tower closer towards himself.
He was just barely able to set up a defensive perimeter of roughly
thirty meters around himself. “How is the Starlord this powerful?
Aren’t they only powerful because they can rely on the power of
Fogstone itself? But the planet of Fogstone is outside the city! The
Starlord is relying on just his sword-arts yet is still incredibly
powerful!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thanks to this mighty
sin-weapon, Chaos Immortal Owlsoar was a very formidable figure even
amongst World-level experts, and the ritual tower was actually meant
for defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And yet…even though
he had a thousand Elder Gods helping him to divert his enemy’s
attacks, he had still been beaten back to the point of only being
able to keep a defensive perimeter of just thirty meters. If he
didn’t have the thousand Elder Gods, he probably would’ve been
slain in just one or two strokes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second Uncle, this
formation is a pain in the ass,” the Starlord sent frantically. He
was using his seven formations to suppress the protective formations
and defensive spells of the imperial capital, but now two such enemy
formations were causing him problems as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, they are quite
troublesome. I’m not able to breach their defenses either.” World
God Blackmist had gone all out as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, World God
Blackmist was a bit weaker than the Starlord to begin with. He was
roughly on par with Chaos Immortal Owlsoar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With this formation
present, it’ll be very hard for us to kill Immortal Owlsoar.” The
Starlord was growing frantic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This formation…”
World God Blackmist was frantic as well. He had transformed to become
a titanic figure who was thirty thousand kilometers tall, and he
furiously launched attacks in every direction, but the thousand Elder
Gods just absorbed his strikes as if they were made of soft taffy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? Ji Ning?” The
Starlord noticed Ji Ning suddenly charging towards them from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal
Darknorth, Ji Ning. The leaders of the Fogstone Dominion all knew who
he truly was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, hurry up
and go help World God Blackmist tie down the Minor Thousand Elder
Gods Formation!” The Starlord ordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Starlord.”
Ning immediately flew towards World God Blackmist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh, what’s the
point of him coming here?” The Starlord couldn’t help but
secretly sigh to himself. “Even though he has the formation
strengthening him, and even though he is the core of the formation,
he will still be at most comparable to an ordinary World God. He’s
probably a bit weaker than even my second uncle! Even if he does help
out, it’ll be hard for them to completely tie down that enemy
formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was wielding
Violetjewel in his hands. His gaze was ice cold, and the azuremist
energy had quickly begun to flow out from the azureflower seal on his
forehead, permeating his entire body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why Ning had
come to the Badlands Territory…was to kill the Mindlord!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And now, the Mindlord
stood right before him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kill!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of the
azureflower mist energy was strengthening him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The World energy
generated by the formation of Elder Gods was strengthening him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had an Eternal
weapon…Violetjewel!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“KILLSWORD STANCE!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised Violetjewel
up high, assuming a stance reminiscent of Pangu cleaving Heaven from
Earth. In this instant, Ning was using the ‘Heavenbreaker stance’
of the [Brightmoon] sword-art to unleash the essence ‘Killsword
stance’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the stances of the
[Nameless] sword-art, be it the Heartsword stance or the Killsword
stance, represented a certain realm of enlightenment regarding the
Dao of the Sword. Ning’s own [Brightmoon] sword-art was completely
capable of unleashing the full extent of his insights into these
realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whenever the Minor
Thousand Elder Gods Formation suffered an attack, it would first
divert 99% of the energy of the attack into the World energy
surrounding it, with the remaining 1% being spread across all
thousand World Gods. This was why Ning had immediately used his most
overpowering and dominating strike, the Heavenbreaker stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A strand of power was
also extracted from the quintessence core within the Eternal sword
and infused into the surface of the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous sword
chopped straight towards Ning’s most hated foe, the Mindlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha, it is
useless! I’m now a member of an Elder God Formation. No matter how
strong you are, you won’t be able to do anything!” The Mindlord
watched as that terrifying sword descended towards him. Although his
heart shook a bit as he knew he wouldn’t be able to survive it
without the formation…the fact was that right now, he DID have the
formation. What did he have to fear?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blood-colored
Violetjewel crashed down upon the Mindlord with absolute fury.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The concussive power of
the blow was instantly dissipated into the surrounding region as well
as across the bodies of all thousand Elder Gods. All of the Elder
Gods trembled, their bodies coming to a brief halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” World God
Blackmist was both shocked and delighted by this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To cause a thousand
Elder Gods to come to a halt required an incredibly powerful attack.
When World God Blackmist himself used his most powerful killer moves,
this was the exact same result.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” The
distant Starlord was also completely shocked and overjoyed by what he
was seeing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible. He’s
just an Elder God. There’s no way he could’ve done this.”
Immortal Owlsoar’s heart turned so cold that it was like a block of
ice, and his eyes were filled with shock and rage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahah…excellent,
Darknorth, excellent! I didn’t expect that with the formation
strengthening you, you would actually be as powerful as I am!”
World God Blackmist sent mentally, “Join with me and attack these
Elder Gods. Let’s make it impossible for them to help Immortal
Owlsoar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Acknowledged,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the support of the
azureflower mist energy and the formation, Ning was probably slightly
more powerful than even World God Blackmist. He also had an Eternal
weapon! And yet…Ning understood that his fatal weakness lay in his
insights.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His sword-arts were
still merely at the level of the Killsword stance, while World God
Blackmist’s sword-arts were at a far higher level. This was why the
two of them remained on par with each other in strength. In addition
to that, Ning was still unable to unleash his Eternal weapon’s true
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eternal weapons were
valuable because they had quintessence cores. It was the power that
lay within their cores which was truly terrifying! If Ning was able
to unleash just thirty or forty percent of that power, he would
probably be able to chop apart the enemy formation with just a single
blow! Alas, actually unleashing that much power from the quintessence
core was far too difficult. Ning would probably have to reach the
same level of sword-arts as World God Northrest in order to command
such power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Ning was
already quite formidable. World God Blackmist was no ordinary
World-level expert, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
World Gods were more formidable than Chaos Immortals. This was
because most World Gods also trained as Ki Refiner as well! World God
Blackmist in particular was an expert of the Dao of the Sword and
incredibly skilled in launching offensive attacks. For Ning to be
comparable to him in might was absolutely incredible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Blackmist and
Ji Ning simultaneously launched their respective killer moves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The way in which World
God Blackmist was fighting was completely different from when he had
been sparring with Ning. He had manifested a total of six arms and
was striking with six swords in an endless windmill of attacks,
sending six streaks of sword-light against his opponents in a
constant barrage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he wielded
Violetjewel as he furiously struck out with the Heavenbreaker stance
once more. <BR> BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The simultaneous double
attack from two experts of the Dao of the Sword caused all thousand
Elder Gods to once more tremble and come to a halt. Although every
single Elder God only had to endure a tiny part of their blows, the
difference between them and the World-level experts was simply too
great. Now that Ning and Blackmist had joined forces, the power of
their blows made the Elder Gods feel absolutely miserable. They had
been completely suppressed in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These formations
truly are incredible. Even when World God Blackmist and I join
forces, we’re still merely able to just keep them suppressed.”
Ning couldn’t help but sigh to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Blackmist had
joined together to completely shut down this Minor Thousand Elder
Gods Formation, making it so that those thousand Elder Gods were
completely unable to help protect Chaos Immortal Owlsoar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?
How?!” The terrified Chaos Immortal Owlsoar immediately turned tail
and transformed into a streak of black light, intent on fleeing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you think you can
actually escape me?” The Starlord’s handsome face was now
somewhat twisted by savagery. In fact, he could be described as
looking rather crazed. “Owlsoar, I’ve waited for this day for far
too long!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOOM!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord’s entire
body suddenly radiated with brilliant light. The astral light swept
forward and caught Immortal Owlsoar within it, making it so that his
movements became dramatically slower, almost as though he was moving
through quicksand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“N-no…spare me!”
Chaos Immortal Owlsoar had learned quite some time ago that there was
a huge gap in power between himself and the Starlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord sent six
streaks of sword-light straight towards him in a series of
consecutive blows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The terrified Immortal
Owlsoar sought to use his ritual tower to defend, even summoning his
other two Dao weapons as well…but alas, those two weapons were
clearly inferior to the ritual tower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang! He was
able to just barely block the first two sword attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third strike
plunged deep into his forehead, and as it did so a terrifying
sword-intent erupted forth into the Jindan chaos region inside his
body. The Jindan chaos region began to break apart, and the Dao-tree
inside of it was also beginning to be obliterated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…” A look of
resentment and disbelief was in Immortal Owlsoar’s eyes as his life
aura rapidly began to weaken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord pulled his
sword out of Owlsoar’s forehead. As he stared at Owlsoar’s
corpse, he fell silent and said not a word.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_42___Blacklotus"></A>
Chapter 42 - Blacklotus
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent!” World
God Blackmist and Ji Ning were both delighted by what they saw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord of
Fogstone stared at Immortal Owlsoar’s corpse, his heart filled with
many complicated feelings. He murmured softly to himself, “Yi, I’ve
finally slain Owlsoar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? Owlsoar died?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Owlsoar died?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other four
World-level vassals of God Emperor Blacklotus sensed Owlsoar’s
powerful aura vanish from the battlefield. The entire city only held
a total of fifteen World-level experts! There was a tremendous
difference in power between them and Elder Gods. For one such aura to
suddenly be extinguished caused the Blacklotus Empire’s forces to
feel alarmed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one of them had
died…then the Starlord and World God Blackmist would now be free to
strike at the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The situation would
just grow uglier and uglier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t panic.” A
voice suddenly rang out within the minds of the four World-level
experts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blacklotus, what
should we do now?” The other four were all growing worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous black
lotus swiveled below God Emperor Blacklotus’ feet while a thousand
Elder Gods surrounded and protected him. Although Immortal Abyssus,
Immortal Skyram, and World God Goldcloud had joined forces against
him, they still found it hard to do anything to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">God Emperor Blacklotus
had an ugly look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was in control of
all the formations protecting this entire city and thus he knew
better than anyone else what was happening in each part of the city.
Immortal Owlsoar had simply died too quickly. As soon as Ji Ning had
entered the fray, Immortal Owlsoar had been almost instantly slain by
the Starlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I never would’ve
thought that an Elder God would be able to force me to do this…”
God Emperor Blacklotus murmured softly to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even with the formation
strengthening him, Ning was still merely on par with World God
Blackmist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the Blacklotus
Empire had been at a disadvantage this entire time. Ning’s suddenly
burst of power was the last straw that broke the camel’s back!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have I been in
retirement for too long?” God Emperor Blacklotus suddenly
manifested a total of twenty-four arms, each of his arms coming
together to form a mudra.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A terrifying aura of
power instantly burst forth from his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Immortal
Abyssus, Immortal Skyram, and World God Goldcloud had been unable to
do anything against God Emperor Blacklotus this entire time…and
now, their faces blanched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This aura. T-this…”
Immortal Abyssus stared in astonishment at God Emperor Blacklotus. He
had travelled through many territories and experienced many dangerous
situations. Right now, God Emperor Blacklotus was giving him a sense
of tremendous danger. “He’s actually this powerful? Then why has
he squirreled himself away within his Blacklotus Empire for all these
years? We are in trouble now! No wonder he was able to so casually
produce two of those Elder God Formations!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as the Starlord
slew Immortal Owlsoar, the God Emperor’s aura began to explode with
power. This immediately snapped the Starlord out of his reverie and
cleared his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a terrifying
aura.” The Starlord was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was tremendously
talented and had great affinity for the Dao of the Sword. He was now
also a master-class World God, which meant he was unquestionably one
of the top-tier World Gods around. However, the Starlord also knew
that his level of power wasn’t THAT special; World Gods who had
Eternal weapons or who had incredibly monstrous divine abilities
would still be able to completely dwarf him in power. And now, it
seemed as though God Emperor Blacklotus had just activated a secret
art that was so powerful, its aura alone was enough to cause the
Starlord to feel nervousness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second Uncle, Ji
Ning, hurry up and wipe out this formation,” the Starlord
immediately ordered. “God Emperor Blacklotus is unfathomably
powerful. We need to wipe out his other supporters, then encircle and
slay him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as he had
sensed the God Emperor’s aura, the Starlord immediately understood
that although he himself was also quite powerful, he probably wasn’t
a match for the God Emperor in single combat. The Starlord was rather
stunned. How was this God Emperor Blacklotus so powerful?! Still, it
was too late for regrets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” World
God Blackmist had turned solemn as well. “Ji Ning, let’s attack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Violetjewel in hand,
Ning had already turned his gaze towards those thousand Elder Gods,
focusing in particular on the Mindlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill them!” The
Starlord bellowed as he flew through the air, moving far faster than
even Ji Ning. Astral light radiated from every part of his body,
those specks of light shooting out like countless tiny stars.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the astral light
spread out, they exerted their power upon the Elder Gods,
constricting them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We need to flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Separate and flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Mindlord and the
others began to flee in every direction. They had realized long ago
that this new Elder God who had joined the fray was merely on par
with World God Blackmist, but the Starlord of Fogstone was far more
powerful than either of them. If World God Blackmist and Ji Ning were
already capable of suppressing them, then once the Starlord joined in
they would definitely be shattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Imperial Majesty,
save us!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Elder Gods
scattered in every which way, but they still were merely able to
watch as the Starlord, Blackmist, and Ji Ning chased after them. All
three of them moved faster than the limits of the Heavenly Daos,
while the thousand Elder Gods were much slower in comparison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” The Starlord
let out a cold shout as he struck out with his sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! A dazzling
river of stars appeared in midair, coming together to form a gigantic
sword that cleaved down upon the back of a fleeing Elder God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Ji Ning and
World God Blackmist struck out at the same time as this blow landed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Mindlord was one of
the captains of these thousand Elder Gods, and as such he was able to
flee faster than most of the others. For the sake of ensuring that
his blow would land at the same time as the Starlord’s, Ning had no
choice but to just attack the Elder God closest to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bodies of all
thousand Elder Gods shook.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Urgh.” More than
ten of the Elder Gods spat out a mouthful of blood. Cracks appeared
on their faces and blood began to pour out of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single one of the
thousand Elder Gods had to endure the same amount of power from the
attacks. At a time like this, the weakest would be the first to
perish! The Mindlord and others who had powerful protective divine
abilities would be able to hold on for much longer than the rest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Again!” The
Starlord sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahhhh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re doomed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the already
heavily-wounded Elder Gods began to panic…but alas, there was
nowhere to run.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yet another dazzling
stream of stars split the skies and chopped down towards an Elder
God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Blackmist
struck out with their full power as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this moment, God
Emperor Blacklotus’ twenty-four arms completed their mudras. His
terrifying aura skyrocketed even further, covering virtually the
entire city.]
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone dies
eventually.” God Emperor Blacklotus could sense the despair of his
thousand Elder Gods. He let out a soft sigh. “I bid you farewell on
your next journey. I’ll take revenge for you.” The Elder Gods
were simply too far away, and he was still surrounded by those three
World-level powers, with Chaos Immortal Abyssus being particularly
tough. Thus, not even God Emperor Blacklotus would be able to save
those thousand Elder Gods in time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blacklotus, although
you are powerful, you are taking us a little too lightly,” Immortal
Abyssus said with a cold laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">God Emperor Blacklotus
gently waved his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black fog
permeating every part of the entire city began to vanish, revealing
all of the countless buildings in it. Of course, the majority of the
buildings had already been wrecked by now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Chaos
Immortal Abyssus, Chaos Immortal Skyram, and World God Goldcloud were
all secretly shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black fog covering
the entirety of the imperial capital had made it impossible for them
to get a good picture of their surroundings. Only the Starlord had
been able to scan the entire area, thanks to his astral light
permeating the entire area…but now, the God Emperor had actually
dismissed the black fog. Clearly, he no longer wished to bother with
using any minor tricks. This was a display of utmost confidence in
his superiority.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are right. I
really don’t treat the three of you seriously at all.” God
Emperor Blacklotus frowned slightly. He could sense that six of the
weakest Elder Gods had just been slain. Although the core and the
nine captains were still present and were able to just barely keep
the formation up, it would now be even harder for them to withstand
any attacks. All of the Elder Gods had already begun to panic and
flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The three of you…who
do you think you are?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In years past…more
than a few World-level experts died by my hand!” God Emperor
Blacklotus said calmly, “I came to the Badlands Territory, set up a
little empire for myself, and just wanted to reign here in peace. I
never would’ve thought that trouble would come crashing down out of
nowhere.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine, then. I’ll
wipe out the entire Fogstone lineage and let the cultivators of the
Badlands Territory know exactly how powerful I am.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Abyssus, Skyram,
and Goldcloud heard these words, they couldn’t help but turn to
look at each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These words were a bit
too brash, weren’t they?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wipe them all out?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What did he take the
nine World-level experts of Fogstone to be?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prepare to receive a
blow from me.” God Emperor Blacklotus’ aura began to surge
outwards. Whooooosh. Instead, a series of black lotuses began to
bloom in the area around him. Countless black lotuses emerged,
causing an area of a million kilometers around him to transform into
an enormous pool of lotuses. These black lotuses radiated a
tremendous killing intent that surged towards the three World-level
experts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the first
stance of the Forbidden Black Lotus…Lotus Sea.” A calm look of
supreme confidence could be seen in God Emperor Blacklotus’ eyes.

Chapter 43 - Slaying the Mindlord
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black lotuses
bloomed throughout the area, carrying a unique sort of charm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Immortal
Abyssus, Immortal Skyram, and World God Goldcloud weren’t in the
mood for enjoying their beauty. Immortal Abyssus hurriedly sent a
mental message to the hundred Elder Gods surrounding him. “Hurry up
and retreat. Don’t get involved in this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The hundred
Elder Gods could sense that things were turning dangerous. They
didn’t dare to push it too far.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Immortal
Abyssus waved his hand, causing a semi-translucent cloth banner to
fly out. The cloth banner flew through the air, instantly covering
the skies as an enormous number of divine runes began to flow through
it. The semi-translucent cloth banner began to emanate streams of
gloomy white light that completely suppressed the countless black
lotuses. The lotuses tried to push them back, but the light of the
cloth banner was extraordinarily tough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve always heard
that Immortal Abyssus of the Fogstone Dominion is unfathomable in his
power, but I didn’t think that you’d be able to withstand the
first stance of my Forbidden Black Lotus.” God Emperor Blacklotus
spoke out calmly, but the murderous aura which had once pervaded him
when he had roamed through the various territories was beginning to
slowly reveal itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He managed to block
it.” World God Goldcloud and Immortal Skyram were both overjoyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of them had
started to panic just now. They could sense that if they were
completely surrounded by those countless black lotuses, they would
most likely die within them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Skyram,
Brother Goldcloud, this God Emperor Blacklotus is far too strong.
He’s already forced me to take out my most powerful treasure,”
Immortal Abyssus sent mentally. “I’m already at my limit. Listen
to my instructions. As long as we can hang on for a bit longer, the
Starlord will soon arrive. With him by our side, we will no longer
need to fear God Emperor Blacklotus.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Immortal
Skyram and World God Goldcloud both held great faith in Immortal
Abyssus. In the past, they knew he was strong but were uncertain as
to how strong he actually was. Now they realized that he was strong
enough to block those countless black lotuses that had inspired such
terror in them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha…” God
Emperor Blacklotus let out a laugh. “Now, try out the second stance
of my Forbidden Black Lotus. This stance is known as ‘Lotus Hell’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice echoed
throughout the skies and by the ears of the three World-level
experts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, one black
lotus after another began to descend from the skies. Countless black
lotuses descended, and as they did so they were actually beginning to
resonate with the countless black lotuses on the ground that had been
suppressed by Immortal Abyssus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Starlord, hurry over
here!” Immortal Abyssus blanched as he hurriedly commanded the
cloth banner to send out light to both suppress the black lotuses on
the ground as well as the black lotuses falling from the skies. For a
moment, he was able to establish a defensive perimeter and block the
lotuses from every direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord knew that
time was of the essence, and so he struck out with two sword at
maximum speed, slaying six of the weakest Elder Gods in the Elder God
Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second Uncle, Ji
Ning, let’s go. We need to get over there right now.” After
breaking through the formation, the Starlord immediately waved his
hand, causing dozens of streaks of sword-light to chop out towards
the Elder Gods closest to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright,” World
God Blackmist said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Starlord, I’ll go
right away, but first I need to kill the Mindlord.” Ning didn’t
immediately follow behind him, instead flying at maximum speed
towards the terrified, fleeing Mindlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord glanced
backwards at Ning. Ning had said long ago when he had first joined
the Fogstone Army that his goal was to kill the Mindlord. “Fine.
Hurry up and get rid of the Mindlord, then come join us right away.”
Ji Ning was now an important member of their force. The other six
formation commanders were merely comparable to ordinary World Gods,
while Ji Ning was comparable to World God Blackmist, an expert of the
Dao of the Sword. He could be considered an expert amongst World
Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning moved faster than
the limits of the Heavenly Daos, furiously chasing after the
Mindlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why is this
happening? Why?!” The Mindlord was frantically fleeing, but the
Starlord’s astral light was slowing him down too much. Ning caught
up to him almost instantly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, spare me!
Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Mindlord began to
beg for his life. Earlier, when the Starlord had broken apart the
formation, he had slain quite a few Elder Gods before heading off
towards the other World-level experts. The entire Minor Thousand
Elder Gods Formation had collapsed, resulting the Mindlord becoming
much weaker as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I gifted you my
[Heart Sutra] long ago!” The Mindlord sent frantically. When he was
in the guise of Old Man Yuan in the Three Realms, he had put on a
truly flawless act! He had helped train juniors, ‘risked his life’
for his friends, and acted exactly as the true Old Man Yuan had. This
was why the Nuwa Alliance had never suspected a thing or seen any
flaws in his masquerade.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, Patriarch
Subhuti’s friendship with Old Man Yuan had only deepened!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had casually
bestowed the [Heart Sutra] to Ji Ning, but that was merely a manual
with some extremely crude bits of information pertaining to
heartforce. This was part of his usual act of pretending to be a kind
old man!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had already
arrived, and his eyes flashed with murderous malice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Mindlord grew
frantic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already
informed one of my slaves about the Three Realms. Once I die, my
slave’s lifeblood oath will compel him to immediately spread this
information regarding the Three Realms. By then, quite a few
adventurers of the Badlands Territory will probably set off towards
it.” The Mindlord sent threateningly, “Eventually, an endless
stream of adventurers will go from the Badlands to the Three Realms.
It’ll be finished!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light flashed.
Although the Mindlord was wearing armor, it was a very weak set of
Chaos armor. There was no way it could withstand Ning’s full-force
strike! Ning’s sword-light struck the Mindlord at the waist,
chopping straight through the Chaos armor. The terrifying power of
Violetjewel swept through the Mindlord’s entire body, wiping out
all of his divine power as well as his truesoul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even when Ning was back
in the Three Realms, his full-force blows were capable of piercing
through top-grade Protocosmic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He now was strengthened
by the azureflower mist energy, the World energy of his formation,
and was wielding a fully repaired Eternal weapon. Even his sword-arts
had improved! His full-force strikes were now completely capable of
shattering ordinary Chaos treasures. If the Mindlord was wearing a
suit of top-grade Chaos armor, Ning wouldn’t be able to chop
through it, but the kinetic force of Ning’s blows would still be
enough to reduce the Mindlord’s body to dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I…” A look of
true despair appeared in the Mindlord’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two severed halves
of his body suddenly broke apart and crumbled. Violetjewel’s power
was more than enough to cause his entire body to break apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Mindlord…is
finally dead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After slaying the
Mindlord, Ning was momentarily dazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could almost see his
senior apprentice-brother Houyi in the moment of his truesoul’s
dissipation. He could almost see the other major powers of the Three
Realms who had all transformed themselves into enormous suns.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This troublemaker
has finally been dealt with. My fellow Daoists…seniors…rest in
peace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart was
filled with many complicated feelings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Was he happy?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t feel even
the slightest bit of happiness right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He felt disappointment
and frustration.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He also felt a sense of
release.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Mindlord’s death
represented the true, final end to the great Endwar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He even dared to
threaten me as he died.” Ning glanced at the Mindlord’s
completely shattered corpse. The truesoul within the corpse had been
wiped out, and there wasn’t any hint of life in his body. “Even
if you really did tell your servant about the Three Realms, so what?
How many adventurers would dare to brave the spatial vortex tunnel
between it and the Badlands Territory?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And even if they do
brave it…so what?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Primaltwin has
also mastered and unified the Nine Chaos Seals. It is capable of
using the azureflower mist energy and has the power of a World-level
expert as well. It doesn’t matter how many adventurers make it
there; I’ll kill them all,” Ning murmured to himself. He didn’t
believe that any World-level experts would go adventuring in the
Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning himself would
eventually become a World-level expert as well, and the azureflower
mist energy would guarantee that he was far stronger than most
World-level experts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really wonder how
Daoist Three Purities managed to acquire those Nine Chaos Seals.”
This thought briefly flitted through Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ripples of incredible
power spread out from off in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned his head to
look. The black fog had long ago dissipated, and so he was now able
to see everything quite clearly. The astral light from the planet of
Fogstone continued to shine down upon the city, revealing the scene
of Immortal Abyssus, Immortal Skyram, World God Goldcloud, the
Starlord of Fogstone, and World God Blackmist all fighting against
God Emperor Blacklotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most dazzling
figures were the Starlord and the God Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!” Each blow
of his sword struck out like a stream of stars, leaving a trail of
shattered black lotuses behind them. The Starlord was able to destroy
more than half of the black lotuses by himself. He was so powerful
that he was roughly comparable to the other four allied World-level
experts combined.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for God Emperor
Blacklotus, he stood in the center, the enormous nine-petal black
lotus below his feet still slowly swiveling. Even now, it was the God
Emperor who was attacking while the other five were defending.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, hurry over
here and help protect Abyssus.” As soon as Ning slew the Mindlord,
the Starlord of Fogstone immediately urged him to come.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Acknowledged.”
Ning transformed into a streak of light, moving faster than the
limits of the Heavenly Daos as he charged straight towards the most
terrifying place on the battlefield.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ji Ning moved closer
to the battlefield, he saw those countless black lotuses bloom and
then be smashed apart. He couldn’t help but feel a hint of fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Abyssus.”
Ning immediately flew towards Immortal Abyssus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sorry for the
trouble, my young friend.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Abyssus smiled
towards Ning, then once more turned his full attention towards
controlling his swirling cloth banner. The cloth banner looked quite
ordinary, but it made it so that the black lotuses weren’t able to
move past it in the slightest. Of course, this was primarily because
the Starlord of Fogstone had charged to the very forefront of the
battle, destroying the majority of the black lotuses before they were
even able to get close to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Should I just stand
here and watch?” Once Ning arrived next to Immortal Abyssus, he
felt rather puzzled. The others were all launching furious
counter-attacks against the black lotuses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, just stand here
and watch for now,” Immortal Abyssus sent mentally. “Don’t be
deceived by the fact that I’m able to block these attacks. I’m
almost at my absolute limit. If God Emperor Blacklotus was just a bit
more powerful, I wouldn’t be able to hold them back any longer…and
as a Chaos Immortal, I’m much weaker in close combat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pure Chaos Immortals
were innately weaker than World Gods. Most World Gods were dual
refiners, giving them an overall advantage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, all you
need to do is help protect Abyssus.” The Starlord’s voice rang
out within Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Acknowledged.”
Ning understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning began to simply
watch the battle, while all the others such as Immortal Abyssus went
all out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for God Emperor
Blacklotus, his eyes were filled with a murderous intent. He showed
no mercy in his attacks at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though
God Emperor Blacklotus is extremely strong,” Ning mused to himself.
“The Starlord seems to be slightly weaker than him. Immortal
Abyssus is right behind the Starlord! After him should be World God
Blackmist. World God Goldcloud and Immortal Skyram are both
significantly weaker.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could clearly see
the difference in power between the various World-level experts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as Ning was
watching…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stalemate had
clearly angered God Emperor Blacklotus, who suddenly let out a
furious roar: “Forbidden Black Lotus, third stance…Blacklotus
World!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.
Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh. The countless black lotuses had been falling
from the skies and rising from the ground. Now, however, every single
inch of space on the ground or in the air within a million kilometers
began to manifest the black lotuses. The black lotuses even began to
appear next to Immortal Abyssus and Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone’s faces
changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Abyssus
immediately acted, willing an enormous black shadow to swirl around
him and cover Ji Ning as well. The black shadow covered an area of
roughly three hundred meters, and all the black lotuses in the area
covered by the black shadow were immediately shattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Things weren’t so bad
for World God Blackmist and World God Goldcloud. They were World
Gods, after all; even though a few attacks made it through their
defenses, they were able to hold on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful!” The
Starlord was forced to divert some of his energy to protecting
Immortal Skyram.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you will
die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">God Emperor Blacklotus
had a sinister look on his face as he stood there atop the enormous,
slowly swiveling nine-petal lotus. The area around him had become
completely filled with the trillions on trillions of small black
lotuses, all of which were furiously striking out towards his
World-level enemies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Abyssus
continued to use his illusory shadow, blocking out all lotuses within
its range.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
Countless black lotuses smashed towards the illusory shadow in an
endless stream, exploding as they struck it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, my young
friend.” Immortal Abyssus’ face tightened. “I’ll use my magic
treasures to block these lotuses as best I can, but if any slip
through I need you to help me stop them. Try to minimize the number
that end up striking against my Shadow Idol.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While speaking mentally
with Ning, Immortal Abyssus immediately took control over the cloth
banner once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Part of the cloth
banner separated from the rest of it, then coiled around Immortal
Abyssus, blocking more than 90% of the black lotuses that had been
striking towards him. Alas, some of the black lotuses materialized
inside its defenses, and so the closest black lotuses continued to
stream towards the enormous illusory shadow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave it to me.”
Ning’s body momentarily blurred as he transformed to become three
hundred meters tall. He struck out with Violetjewel, which pierced
out beyond the protection of the illusory shadow and set up a
protective barrier of sword-light that covered more than half of the
empty space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-light
transformed into a black hole, continuously weakening the power of
the assaulting black lotuses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The true, terrifying
power of the Heartsword stance was now on full display. Ning had
absolutely perfect control over his sword, especially the ‘Soleheart
stance’ of the [Brightmoon] sword-art, which was a technique which
focused on defense. As a result, when the black lotuses struck him,
they did so after 90% of their power had been ablated. The remaining
10% was then mostly absorbed by the World energy that protected him,
with the tiny remaining amount of energy being spread across a
thousand Elder Gods. By then, there was only a tiny bit of power
remaining.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Immortal
Abyssus relaxed slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With Ning helping him
defend against the majority of the black lotuses, things were now
much easier for him as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Things weren’t so bad
for Ning and Immortal Abyssus, but this was primarily due to Immortal
Abyssus’ usage of the cloth banner and the Shadow Idol. All Ning
had to do was provide a bit of help in order to ensure that they
would survive the danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“God Emperor
Blacklotus is far too powerful. He’s able to fight against multiple
World-level experts by himself and actually have the upper hand.”
Ning stared past the swiveling cloth banner and stared at the distant
God Emperor Blacklotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blacklotus!” The
Starlord suddenly let out an angry roar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His handsome face
actually began to turn a grayish-white color, as did his hands. His
entire body seemed to become almost statue-like as his aura suddenly
exploded with might. His six arms wielded six swords, and he sent
them forth as utterly dazzling streams of stars. He was using the
same sword-arts as before, but the power of his attacks had increased
tenfold!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless black lotuses
were blasted apart as the sword-light easily chopped through them.
The sword-light slashed all the way to God Emperor Blacklotus’ side
and struck directly at the enormous nine-petal black lotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! When
the slowly swiveling black lotus was struck by the terrifying
sword-light, it began to shudder slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this is the
[Fogstone Apocalypse] of the Fogstone Dominion, eh?” God Emperor
Blacklotus was startled as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!” The
Starlord’s skin had now completely turned the color of stone. His
aura grew even more savage, and his blows even began to cause cracks
to appear on the nine-petal black lotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Fogstone
Apocalypse].” Ning was secretly surprised by what he saw. “And
he’s using the third stage of it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third stage of the
[Fogstone Apocalypse] involved transforming the entire body into
stone. It would allow the user to become tremendously more powerful,
with the body becoming comparable to a Dao weapon in toughness.
However, this sort of explosive technique resulted in a rapid
consumption of divine power. Once the divine power was used up, one
would transform into a true statue forever. Thus, this divine ability
generally wouldn’t be used until things were truly dire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord had
clearly grown nervous upon seeing that the five of them were at such
a disadvantage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He truly has reached
full mastery of his skills.” Immortal Abyssus sighed in amazement
and nodded. “The Starlord hasn’t trained for very long, but this
divine ability alone ensures that he is a master-class World God.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master-class?”
Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">God Emperor Blacklotus
was now being completely suppressed by the Starlord’s attacks. No
more black lotuses were appearing around Ning and Abyssus. Clearly,
the God Emperor was now focused on his own defenses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Immortal
Abyssus nodded and smiled. “There are differences in power amongst
World-level experts, and they can be divided into several rough
categories.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first level is
the level of brand new World-level experts. They are young,
inexperienced, and quite weak. They can be described as having just
barely reached the World-level threshold.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second level is
the ordinary level which most World-level experts are at! This is a
level which every single World-level expert can reach after they
spend a bit of time in training.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The third level can
be described as the elite level! Blackmist, for example, is at this
level, thanks to the fact that he has the body of a World God and is
skilled in the offensive Dao of the Sword. I’m actually at this
level as well, but I have a few more tricks up my sleeve than he
does, which is why I’m a bit stronger than him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fourth level is
the level of full mastery! Both the Starlord and God Emperor
Blacklotus can be described as master-class World Gods.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “Are
there any higher levels?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are. If either
of them had an Eternal weapon, they could be described as supreme
World Gods,” Immortal Abyssus said. “This is a fairly widespread
classification system used in these Endless Territories. As for why
they are classified in this manner…once you reach the World level,
you will understand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He wasn’t a World God
yet. He naturally didn’t understand the cultivation mysteries of
World-level experts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Based on Immortal
Abyssus’ classifications…World God Northrest was most likely a
supreme World God! As for the deceased slave he had seen in that
house by the lake inside the Windsource Ruins, he was probably a
supreme World God as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are there any who
are more powerful than even ‘supreme’ World-level experts?”
Ning was curious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are.”
Immortal Abyssus nodded. “But you won’t possibly be able to
understand why those World Gods are as powerful as they are. Some are
World Gods who have unleashed the full power of their Eternal
weapons, while some have cultivation paths that we can’t fathom.
Perhaps they might have gained some particularly incredible legacies!
However, those figures are nothing more than legends. I’ve wandered
through many territories, but I’ve only seen just one of those
terrifying figures. In our Badlands Territory, not a single one of
them exists. Thus, to be a supreme World God is already quite
incredible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded secretly to
himself. No wonder World God Northrest was such an incredible figure!
Alas, in the end he had still fallen.

Chapter 45 - Eternal Weapon
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The morale of the
Fogstone Dominion was soaring.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break for me!” His
entire body a grayish-white color, the Starlord of Fogstone waved his
hand, unleashing streams of astral sword-light against the enormous
black lotus, causing it to begin to crack apart and crumble. God
Emperor Blacklotus continued to stand atop the black lotus, allowing
this to happen. He murmured softly, “I heard that the [Fogstone
Apocalypse] is just something derived from fragmentary records of an
ancient technique. And yet, it is this powerful? I wonder how
powerful the true, complete technique was.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quite a number of
Fogstone’s supreme techniques were incomplete.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Dust of the Mortal
World] was one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Fogstone Apocalypse]
was another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s own [Nameless]
sword-art was just a fragment of the true, complete technique as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why so many
techniques only existed in fragmentary parts was because they were
simply too profound. There was no way to completely memorize them!
Daoist Three Purities had an incredibly high level of insight into
the Dao, but it still took him countless years before he was able to
completely memorize the Nine Chaos Seals, which Ning had already
merged together into one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, techniques
like [Dust of the Mortal World] and the [Nameless] sword-art were
ancient techniques which even Daolords would sigh with amazement upon
seeing. There was no way a World God could possibly have the ability
to completely memorize such a technique; the could at most just
memorize part of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thanks to a stroke of
tremendous luck, World God Northrest had been able to view the
[Nameless] sword-art, but he was only at a level where he could
memorize its first seven stances. He wasn’t able to memorize any of
the rest of it at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Against you? It’ll
be enough.” The Starlord surged with a killing intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You overestimate
yourself.” The God Emperor looked at the Starlord coldly. “I
didn’t want to use this treasure. I thought I could defeat you just
by using a few secret arts…but it seems I’ll still be forced to
activate it. It’s been a long, long time since I’ve truly fought
someone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">God Emperor Blacklotus
stretched out his right hand. Whoosh. A crystalline scimitar that
seemed to have been carved out from a block of ice suddenly appeared
in his hand. The scimitar was roughly three feet long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An unspeakable aura
instantly filled the entire city. In fact, the aura spread out past
the city and covered an enormous region beyond it as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire battlefield
fell silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cold!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single
cultivator, be it the Elder Gods, the World Gods, or the Chaos
Immortals, felt an icy cold feeling in their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that…” All
the cultivators turned their heads to stare at the origin of this
feeling of icy terror. They saw that frozen crystal scimitar in God
Emperor Blacklotus’ hand, as well as the glimmer of azure light
flowing over its surface. Every single cultivator felt their hearts
shudder when they merely looked at the scimitar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is that?”
Ning’s heart was shaking as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That is an Eternal
weapon.” The nearby Immortal Abyssus had turned completely pale.
“That’s an Eternal weapon. I’ve seen the power of an Eternal
weapon before, and this gives me exactly the same feeling. When you
see an Eternal weapon, you’ll immediately lose all your courage.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An Eternal weapon.”
The faces of World God Blackmist, Immortal Skyram, and the others all
changed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could he have an
Eternal weapon?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could God
Emperor Blacklotus be this powerful?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone was dazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eternal weapons were
just legends to most World-level experts! The number of World-level
experts in the entire Badlands Territory who possessed Eternal
weapons could be counted on one hand. They either had incredible luck
or had been bestowed it by a Daolord! It must be understood that most
Daolords used Eternal weapons, and so for them to bestow one on a
World-level expert was incredibly rare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh. An
invisible, freezing intent filled the hearts of every single
cultivator present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m also wielding
an Eternal weapon, but none of the World-level experts paid it any
attention. But now that God Emperor Blacklotus has taken one out, he
has stunned the entire battlefield.” Ning couldn’t help but sigh.
This was all because his attainments in the sword were simply too
low. He was only able to unleash just a tiny fraction of the power
within Violetjewel’s quintessence core, so little that no one even
paid attention to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he was as powerful
as World God Northrest, who was able to unleash thirty to forty
percent of Violetjewel’s quintessence core, he’d be able to
inspire terror in other World-level experts just by standing there
with the sword in his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A supreme World God.
I never would’ve thought that God Emperor Blacklotus is this
powerful.” A frantic look was in Immortal Abyssus’ eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blacklotus.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord withdrew,
slowly stepping backwards as he looked at God Emperor Blacklotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why are you
retreating?” God Emperor Blacklotus asked calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I admit defeat,”
the Starlord said in a low voice. “I’m willing to pay a high
price to stay your hand and quell your rage, God Emperor Blacklotus.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a cultivator, one
had to know when to advance and when to retreat. To continue the
battle when there was such a large disparity in power was just
suicide.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” God
Emperor Blacklotus laughed. “A high price? As far as I’m
concerned, the Fogstone lineage is worth nothing! Oh, wait. I
actually rather like the planet of Fogstone itself. Hand over the
planet and I’ll let you leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible. God
Emperor Blacklotus, you should know that the planet of Fogstone is a
legacy treasure of the Fogstone lineage. Someone who is not of our
lineage cannot bind or control it,” the Starlord said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the truth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, the
Fogstone lineage had actually been completely wiped out by enemies
before. However, once the major powers of the Fogstone lineage who
were out exploring in other territories returned, they would
generally take revenge and retake their legacy treasure, resulting in
the lineage continuing to be passed down. Starchild’s own father,
the previous Starlord, was someone who had gone out exploring as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the custom of
the Fogstone lineage. Once they reached a certain level of power,
they would leave and go out adventuring in the primordial chaos.
After a few dozen chaos cycles passed, they might eventually return
to Fogstone, ensuring that its lineage would remain unbroken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their most important
legacy treasure was the planet itself, and one had to have mastered
certain core techniques in order to bind the planet. These core
techniques were never taught to outsiders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m willing to
offer treasure that is worth three thousand cubes of primordial
chaos,” the Starlord said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you think I
care?” God Emperor Blacklotus lifted the scimitar up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord’s face
turned even uglier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When I journeyed
through the primordial chaos, I passed through many territories and
took on many masters. And yet, in the end I remained unable to take
that final step to the next level. I no longer hold any hope of
becoming a Samsara Daolord.” God Emperor Blacklotus said softly,
“And so I returned to the Badlands Territory. It had changed
significantly since my departure from it. In fact, when I was born
here, it wasn’t even called the Badlands Territory…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I simply chose a
random location and set up a little empire for myself, intending to
rule over it in peace…and yet, trouble chose to come knocking on my
door.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems that I’ve
been too…benevolent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To tell you the
truth, I had a nickname when I roamed the primordial chaos. ‘Daoist
Blacklotus’,” the God Emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daoist Blacklotus?”
Immortal Abyssus sent mentally, “Careful, I know who he is now!
He’s a true fiend, a demon who delights in slaughter and who walks
the path of evil. Don’t put too much faith in his promises. He’s
an extremely temperamental person who has killed many World-level
experts. Its been a long time since anyone has heard any news
regarding him. I never would’ve thought that he had actually come
to the Badlands Territory and set up an empire for himself to rule
over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daoist Blacklotus?”
None of the other World-level experts, including the Starlord, knew
what this name and title represented.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the Starlord
and the others knew what they had to do.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">God Emperor Blacklotus
shook his head. “Still, I’m willing to be benevolent one final
time. I’ll give you two choices.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first choice is
for all of you to hand over all of your treasures, including the
planet of Fogstone and the treasures and techniques it contains,”
God Emperor Blacklotus said. “I’ll spare your lives.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The other choice is
death.” God Emperor Blacklotus had a very calm look in his eyes.
The lineage of Fogstone truly was an ancient one. Perhaps it held
certain techniques that might be of use to him. Although he didn’t
really feel that he would be able to make any more breakthroughs, he
was still willing to give it a try.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The planet of
Fogstone? All of the treasures and techniques it holds?” The
Starlord’s skin once more transformed to become grayish-white. He
couldn’t possibly hand those things over, because he had sworn a
lifeblood oath upon joining the lineage. If he violated it, the
lifeblood oath would immediately take his life. It was impossible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!” The
Starlord’s entire body had turned grayish-white, and his eyes were
filled with a murderous frenzy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already taken
revenge for Yi, so let’s have a good fight. I want to see just how
powerful an Eternal weapon is!” The Starlord charged forwards in a
frenzy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he did so…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Run!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you, run!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll hold him
down. The rest of you, go hide within the planet of Fogstone. He
won’t be able to do anything to you once you go inside!” The
Starlord’s voice simultaneously rang out within the minds of Ji
Ning, Immortal Abyssus, World God Blackmist, the other World-level
experts, and the minds of the many Elder Gods as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous planet
which had been hanging in the sky suddenly came crashing downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
understood that the planet of Fogstone was definitely filled with
formations and protective spells that were far more powerful than the
ones which had been protecting the imperial capital of the Blacklotus
Empire. If they could make it inside, they would be safe! The
Starlord of Fogstone was the most powerful person on their side; he
was the only one who had a chance of stopping God Emperor Blacklotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He wishes to stop
me? To hold me down?” God Emperor Blacklotus held that enormous
crystal scimitar in his hands as he strode forward, his voice echoing
in the ears of every single cultivator present. “You really do have
a fine Starlord. A pity, though…he won’t succeed. All of you will
die.”

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">God Emperor Blacklotus
showed no mercy at all as he struck out with the giant crystal
scimitar. Whoosh! A streak of icy saber-light shot out through the
air, carrying an aura of extreme coldness as it flew towards the
Starlord. The Starlord’s body was now completely grayish-white, and
he hurriedly shot out streaks of astral sword-light to defend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord was
knocked flying backwards as the saber-light slashed past his chest.
Fortunately, his body was as tough as a Dao weapon and so he was able
to endure the blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can’t stop me.
In a head-on fight, you have no chance of stopping me at all.” God
Emperor Blacklotus smiled coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord was
beginning to panic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He truly was a blessed
child of the heavens! His father had been the previous Starlord,
while World God Blackmist had supported him and guided him. Even
though he hadn’t been particularly diligent in cultivating, he had
still been able to easily overcome his tribulations. After his
beloved Yi had perished, he had begun to work hard and improved at an
even more astonishing speed, becoming a World God. He then continued
until he reached his certain stage, resulting in his divine body
reaching the stage of full perfection! He was now the most powerful
expert of the Fogstone lineage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His path had always
been a path that led straight upwards! Thus, his most powerful
sword-arts were all focused on offensive attacks, making him somewhat
weaker in defensive skills. The Starlord had always believed the old
maxim that the best defense was a good offense! When he used the
[Fogstone Apocalypse] his body was rendered comparable to a Dao
weapon. Why, then, should he waste his time and effort on mastering
defensive sword-arts? Only when he focused his efforts in the right
area would he be able to more quickly reach a higher level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had encountered
someone who was so superior to him that his vaunted attacks were
useless! At a time like this, only someone tremendously talented in
defensive sword arts would be capable of dealing with such a
difficult foe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The airborne
Starlord was smashed downwards towards the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s get out of
here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quite a few Elder Gods
immediately began to flee, not hesitating in the slightest. They all
soared towards the skies, obeying the Starlord’s orders to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…the Starlord
had misjudged one of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Starchild.” World
God Blackmist looked at the Starlord, a gentle look in his eyes. “You
want me to flee?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no way he
would flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The previous Starlord
had shown him great benevolence, which was why he had chosen to help
take care of Starchild! At first, World God Blackmist had only done
so in order to repay the old Starlord’s kindness, and so Starchild
had called him ‘Second Uncle’. He had watched as the child slowly
grew up, while the old Starlord himself had actually spent very
little time with his son.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was World God
Blackmist who spent virtually all of his time by Starchild’s side.
He had watched as Starchild grew up, had shielded him from the wind
and the rain, ensuring that he would live a carefree life! As for the
death of Starchild’s Dao-companion, there was nothing that World
God Blackmist could do about that. All he could do was silently
support his young ward, hoping that this tragedy would encourage him
to grow up even faster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had been so many
years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he was
nominally the child’s ‘second uncle’, in reality Blackmist had
spent far more time and effort on Starchild than the old Starlord
ever had. He had been there when Starchild was a crying and screaming
newborn, and he had watched as Starchild grew up. By now, Blackmist
truly viewed Starchild as he would his own son.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At a time like this…the
Starlord was going to defend them?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Was ordering him to
flee?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How could he possibly
flee?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, World God
Blackmist still felt a warm feeling in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. World God
Blackmist’s body suddenly began to blaze with white light, and all
of his skin instantly transformed to become a rocky-gray color as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Starchild, retreat!”
World God Blacklist let out a loud roar as he charged forwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Starchild was
the Starlord, he had always obeyed his second uncle’s instructions.
Eventually, however, he had become a World God and become more
powerful than his second uncle. It had been a long time since his
second uncle had given him any orders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fact that he was
doing so now caused Starchild to grow blank for a moment…and then
he saw World God Blackmist charging forward, his entire body glowing
with white light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The look in Starchild’s
eyes instantly changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second Uncle!”
Starchild’s eyes instantly reddened. He was the current Starlord of
Fogstone. He knew exactly what his second uncle had just done.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not even your
Starlord is a match for me. You think you are?” God Emperor
Blacklotus once more chopped downwards with his enormous crystal
scimitar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ssssshrk. Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light and
saber-light clashed against each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Blackmist was
different from Starchild. He had relied entirely on himself as he had
grown up, with no one there to provide him with any protection. His
sword-arts were unpredictable and savage, but also quite suited for
defense. Still, even the most defensive of stances would be useless
if the disparity in power was too great.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” God Emperor
Blacklotus was astonished to see that World God Blackmist was merely
knocked a few steps back. “H-how is it that you…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Starchild, leave
right now!” World God Blackmist sent mentally to the Starlord, who
was standing there blankly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord gritted
his teeth, his eyes glistening with tears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Second Uncle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thanks to his second
uncle, he had never worried about anything as a child. His second
uncle had always been by his side, and the Starlord had grown used to
his presence. Upon seeing his second uncle’s body be wreathed in
white light, he immediately understood that his second uncle had just
used the forbidden fourth stage of the [Fogstone Apocalypse]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right. The [Fogstone
Apocalypse] actually had a fourth stage!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, their
[Fogstone Apocalypse] was a fragmented technique. Only the first
three stages were complete, which was why using the first three
stages posed no risks. Even when one used the third stage, so long as
that person stopped before completely using up his divine power, he
wouldn’t turn into fogstone and die. However, their records of the
fourth stage were incomplete. Although it was still usable…once it
was used, the body would begin an uncontrollable transformation into
fogstone!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In other words…once a
cultivator used the fourth stage, he was doomed to die! This was why
the Starlord had been so agonized and grief-struck upon seeing the
white light wreathing World God Blackmist’s body. There was no way
to reverse this process at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is my choice,
and there is no turning back. If you don’t wish for my death to
have been for nothing, leave. Leave right now!” World God Blackmist
roared furiously, “If you don’t run, I’ll have died for
nothing! NOTHING!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aaaaaaaaaaargh!”
The Starlord let out an agonized howl, but he still turned and fled
at high speed, charging into the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He felt hatred and
regret.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why. Why!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did he truly
understand how important his second uncle was to him. His second
uncle was his most beloved family member and just as important to him
as Yi had been! Why? Why did it have to end up this way?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stay alive and
forget about revenge. Only when you become a Daolord should you come
and seek your revenge. Otherwise, I’ll never forgive you. Never!”
World God Blackmist’s voice echoed in the Starlord’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord lowered
his head to stare downwards, tears cascading down his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second Uncle…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Blackmist
continued to battle against God Emperor Blacklotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What type of divine
ability did you use just now?” God Emperor Blacklotus was now quite
intrigued. He sent mentally, “You clearly are quite weak, but this
divine ability actually allows you to be on par with your Starlord.
For a divine ability to be capable of strengthening you this
much…Fogstone really does have quite a few nice things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">God Emperor Blacklotus
did know that in the Endless Territories, there were a number of
monstrously powerful forbidden divine abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hand this divine
ability over to me and I’ll spare your life,” God Emperor
Blacklotus sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t even think
about it!” World God Blackmist roared back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To be honest, it wasn’t
just that he didn’t want to hand it over. People like Ji Ning were
only capable of acquiring the first and second stage, while the third
stage came with many strict requirements. As for the fourth
stage…only the most core members of the Fogstone lineage would have
access to it. Although the fourth stage was fragmentary and
incomplete, every generation of Starlords had done their best to
repair it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fourth stage was
simply too powerful. If they were capable of restoring it to the
point where they could use it safely, it would be wonderful!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are now as
strong as the Starlord, and your sword-arts are quite strange, but…do
you think that’s enough to stop me?” God Emperor Blacklotus let
out a furious roar as the giant scimitar in his hands suddenly
unleashed hundreds of streaks of crescent saber-light, sending them
swirling around World God Blackmist. Every single strike contained
the power of his scimitar’s quintessence core.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to be able to
block them all. For the sake of Starchild, I have to block them all.”
World God Blackmist was wielding six swords in his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had long ago stopped
caring about whether or not he would survive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this moment, he felt
a greater desire than he had ever felt in his entire life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His six swords
transformed into six streaks of utterly dazzling sword-light,
criss-crossing in the area around him and forming an enormous sphere
of black mist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom! The hundreds of streaks of saber-light struck down upon
the sphere of black mist. Although they carried tremendous power,
World God Blackmist was completely capable of withstanding them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Y-you…” God
Emperor Blacklotus stared in astonishment at World God Blackmist.
“You actually made a breakthrough?” Before this, World God
Blackmist’s sword-arts were very unpredictable, but they weren’t
as resilient and tenacious as they were now. His sword-arts had
clearly improved to a brand new level, capable of enduring offensive
blows as though they truly were made of mist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a terrifyingly
strong defensive sword-art. Although God Emperor Blacklotus was
stronger than his opponent, he remained unable to break through his
defenses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. My sword-arts
reached a bottleneck a long, long time ago…but fortunately, I was
able to make a breakthrough today.” World God Blackmist revealed a
relaxed, carefree smile. He was able to stop God Emperor Blacklotus’
attack. Starchild would be able to stay alive. It was enough.

Chapter 47 - None Shall Escape
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At present, World God
Blackmist was every bit the Starlord’s equal in the Dao of the
Sword. However, the Starlord focused on offensive attacks, whereas
World God Blackmist specialized in defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His sword-light was
like a web of black mist that filled the entire region. Although God
Emperor Blacklotus held an absolute advantage, he was still unable to
breach it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you really
think…that you can stop me?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, Blacklotus, spent
countless years roaming across many territories. You think you can
stop me with just a defensive technique like this? You underestimate
me too much!” God Emperor Blacklotus turned his gaze towards the
fleeing cultivators of the Fogstone Dominion, then let out a cold
smile. “I trained as both a Fiendgod Body Refiner and a Ki
Refiner!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire imperial
capital below them began to shudder, then slowly began to swivel. The
city itself was in the shape of a nine-petal black lotus that covered
an area of ten million kilometers. As the enormous black lotus
swiveled, the entire Blacklotus Chaosworld began to shake. Countless
black lotuses began to appear, and they covered the heavens and the
earth as they furiously shot out towards the cultivators of the
Fogstone Dominion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is even more
terrifying than the secret arts he used earlier.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why are there so
many black lotuses?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were all dazed as they stared downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the gigantic
nine-petal black lotus below them swiveled, it emanated an aura of
terrifying power that quickly spread over the entire chaosworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Daoist name was
Blacklotus. My true skills do not lie in close combat, nor was my
reputation established because of this Eternal weapon. It was all
because of my Dao, the Dao of the Black Lotus!” God Emperor
Blacklotus smiled as every inch of the entire chaosworld began to
shake. “The imperial capital of the Blacklotus Empire is actually a
magic treasure which I used when I roamed through the Endless
Territories. I poured all of my blood, sweat, and effort into it, and
it contains my Dao.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s a Dao
weapon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His Dao?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fleeing cultivators
all started to panic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Usually, only Samsara
Daolords were capable of forging Dao weapons! It was incredibly
difficult for a World-level expert to forge a Dao weapon, but if a
World-level expert successfully in doing so and infusing his own Dao
into his creation he would have a weapon that was perfectly suited to
him, allowing him to unleash tremendous power from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The deceased Immortal
Owlsoar, for example, had murdered countless living beings to create
that ritual tower of great sin. He had personally forged that ritual
tower, and the mysteries of the Dao within it belonged to him and him
alone, which was why he was quite powerful when using it. His
insights into the Dao were quite average, but with that ritual tower
in hand, he was actually on par with someone like World God
Blackmist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some World-level
experts who found themselves unable to make any more breakthroughs
would generally focus most of their time, energy, and effort on
forging a Dao weapon for themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The same was true for
God Emperor Blacklotus!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had personally
refined and forged this gigantic black lotus, infusing it with all of
his insights into the Dao of the Black Lotus. When he used this new
Dao weapon to execute his Forbidden Black Lotus technique, the power
of the technique would increase dramatically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, after he
acquired an Eternal weapon, he rarely saw the need to use his
original Dao weapon. In fact, after arriving at the Badlands
Territory, he had actually transformed it to make it a hundred
thousand kilometers in size and treated it as a city.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although there were
some cultivators who had a strange feeling about the city, as though
the entire thing was just one giant treasure, none of them knew that
this city actually contained all of the insights into the Dao of God
Emperor Blacklotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now this…this is
the true Blacklotus World.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Long ago, I set down
restrictive spells on every part of this chaosworld. The chaosworld
itself can become one with my magic treasure, creating a Blacklotus
World of enormous proportions.” God Emperor Blacklotus smiled, but
his eyes were filled with madness. “This…is a world of lotuses…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire chaosworld
was shaking. The earth had cracked apart in many places, revealing
enormous formation leylines. The seas had parted, revealing divine
runes that glowed with black light. The mountains had collapsed and
the cities had crumbled. The entire chaosworld was like an enormous
painting that had been filled with spells…and now, all of the
formations that God Emperor Blacklotus had secretly set down long ago
suddenly exploded in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless black lotuses
began to take shape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The activation of this
formation alone resulted in trillions of living beings on this
chaosworld dying. God Emperor Blacklotus didn’t kill them on
purpose, but he also wasn’t willing to weaken the power of his
mightiest attack, the ‘Blacklotus World’, just to keep them safe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black lotuses
filled every inch of the entire chaosworld, and they furiously flew
through the air towards the fleeing Elder Gods and other cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The planet of Fogstone
had been rocketing downwards towards the cultivators, but it was now
completely surrounded by the endless black lotuses and unable to move
any further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seven formations,
join forces together and do your best to hold!” The Starlord sent
frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hold!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven thousand
Elder Gods had transformed into an enormous protective circle, with
Immortal Abyssus and Immortal Skyram having hidden themselves inside
the circle. However, the valiant Starlord of Fogstone remained
outside the circle, lashing out with his sword repeatedly as he
attempted to chop apart as many black lotuses as he could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, there were
simply too many lotuses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We won’t be able
to escape. Once God Emperor Blacklotus returns, we’ll be doomed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should we do
next?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could the God
Emperor be this powerful?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were
frantic, Ning included. They weren’t capable of breaching past
those black lotuses; there was no way they could make it back inside
the planet of Fogstone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second Uncle.” The
Starlord was still wracked by grief and agony.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If this continues,
all of us are definitely going to die.” Ning was pondering his next
steps. “Right now, we’re able to block the black lotuses because
all seven formations are sharing the load together, but once God
Emperor Blacklotus arrives and strikes out with his Eternal weapon,
we won’t even be able to dodge. If his attack lands on me, my Minor
Thousand Elder Gods Formation will collapse.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven formations
weren’t truly as one. Given how strong the God Emperor was, it
would be easy for him to break through the defenses of the formations
one by one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have no other
options.” Ning frowned. Violetjewel was his most important
possession, and treasures were incredibly important for any
cultivator. Ning truly didn’t wish to loan Violetjewel out to
someone else! It was entirely possible that the Starlord would become
greedy and not return it. As the leader of the entire Fogstone
lineage, the lifeblood oath he had sworn was a very lax one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the leader of their
organization, he had tremendous authority. He could find excuses to
issue punishments to his subordinates, and so it was entirely
possible for the Starlord to find a way to put Ning to death without
running afoul of his lifeblood oath!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll have him
swear another lifeblood oath of my choosing, then I’ll secretly
lend him Violetjewel,” Ning mused. “That’s the only way to
survive this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…there’s just
one problem.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spirit of the
sword.” Ning immediately reached out to commune with the
sword-spirit residing within Violetjewel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master,” the
sword-spirit said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I was to allow
the Starlord to bind Violetjewel for his own use, how long would it
take?” Ning asked. Ning didn’t know much about Eternal weapons,
but he had heard that binding them was actually quite difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to what
the old master told me all those years ago, Eternal weapons are quite
hard to bind,” the sword-spirit said. “Normally speaking, anyone
below the World level of power will not be able to bind Eternal
weapons at all. The only reason why you were able to do so after a
few centuries was because of the secret ‘Heartseep technique’
which Vastheaven Palace had access to.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Starlord is a
World God. He can bind it. But…the quintessence core of an Eternal
weapon contains some of the insights into the quintessence of a Dao
from the original creator of that weapon. Thus, if you wish to fully
master an Eternal weapon, you have to be approved of by the sword’s
quintessence core itself,” the sword-spirit said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Creating Chaos weapons
and Dao weapons, by contrast, was much simpler. They didn’t have
quintessence cores, just a few divine runes and tattoos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For a
World-level…it’ll take anywhere from four or five days to
forever,” the sword-spirit said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forever? You mean,
he might never be able to bind it?” Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. The
quintessence cores have their own personalities and will try to seek
out masters that suit them. If a core is completely opposed to the
person trying to bind it, there’ll be no way to succeed in binding
it. However, both you and the Starlord are quite talented in the Dao
of the Sword. He should be able to bind it,” the sword-spirit said.
“And it should be fairly fast for the Starlord. He should be able
to succeed in just a few days.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning began to panic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A few days?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That was far too much
time. Given how furiously World God Blackmist was fighting, he would
probably run out of energy in the time needed to boil a kettle of
tea. A few days?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s see how much
longer you can hang on for.” God Emperor Blacklotus was quite
relaxed as he used the giant crystal scimitar in his hands to chop
towards World God Blackmist again and again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Blackmist’s
entire body had turned a stony gray color and emanated a dazzling
white light. Clearly, he had gone all out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?
What should I do?!” World God Blackmist was beginning to panic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had managed to stop
God Emperor Blacklotus, yes. But God Emperor Blacklotus was also an
incredibly talented Ki Refiner. This entire chaosworld had become
completely filled with black lotuses, all of which were surrounding
and suppressing the cultivators of the Fogstone Dominion, making it
so that there was no way they could escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A crack suddenly
appeared in the membrane protecting the chaosworld, and a barefoot,
sloppy-looking old man dressed in tattered robes walked out from the
crack, staring downwards with curiosity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s with all
these black lotuses? Oho! An Eternal weapon? Isn’t that
interesting.” The raggedy old man’s forehead creased as he
smiled.

great battle being fought.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go take a
look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He sauntered forward
through the air. Although his body touched some of the lotus flowers,
they slid right through him as though his body was illusory, having
no effect on him at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He looked as though he
was walking quite slowly, but with each step he moved millions of
kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battle was still
continuing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, the Starlord
of Fogstone, Immortal Abyssus, and the others had been completely
surrounded by the endless black lotuses. There was no way out
whatsoever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I never would’ve
thought that I’d end up dying here.” Immortal Abyssus let out a
soft sigh. “For me to die is one thing, but my disciples…”
Although some of the disciples remained behind on the planet of
Fogstone, once the World-level experts died the planet of Fogstone
would fall into the hands of God Emperor Blackstone. Not a single
living being would be able to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could this God
Emperor Blacklotus be so strong?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My luck is horrid.
I’ve been in seclusion for so many years, and the very first time I
leave it to take part in a fight, I end up running into someone as
frightening as him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know. His insights
into the Dao are profound, his forbidden secret arts are incredibly
powerful, and he even has an Eternal weapon! Even when I roamed about
the primordial chaos, I almost never encountered people as terrifying
as him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The various World-level
experts could do nothing but sigh. Their hearts were filled with
resentment and an unwillingness to give up, but they could read the
situation. Whether they lived or died was now completely up to God
Emperor Blacklotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second Uncle.” The
Starlord lowered his head and saw World God Blackmist continuing to
furiously fight back against World God Blackmist. Tears appeared in
the Starlord’s eyes. “Second Uncle, forget it. Forget it. We’ve
lost.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fourth stage of the
[Fogstone Apocalypse] was indeed terrifyingly powerful, but it used
up divine power at an even more terrifying rate. Soon, the very last
bit of Blackmist’s divine power would be used up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…Blackmist,
I have to say that even I admire your tenacity. To show my respect
for you, I’ll allow all of these World Gods and Chaos Immortals to
join you in death.” The God Emperor’s mocking voice rang out in
the skies. “After all of you die, I’ll come up with some other
ideas for acquiring your divine abilities and techniques from within
the planet of Fogstone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no way
you’ll succeed,” World God Blackmist growled, his eyes filled
with savagery and pain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He wasn’t afraid of
death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What he feared was
dying while failing to protect the Starlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I succeed, I’ll
be happy. If I don’t, it won’t make much of a difference.
Blackmist, I’m curious as to how long your divine power will be
able to hold out.” God Emperor Blacklotus was quite relaxed. He
held the absolute upper hand and was launching attacks with impunity.
“You can fight for as long as you wish, but in the end the result
will still be death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Blackmist’s
eyes were filled with resentment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was continuing to
fight, only because he truly wasn’t willing to give up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a series of
echoing booms began to ring out in the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpent-shaped streaks
of lightning began to cascade down from the heavens. It looked as
though trillions of lightning chains had manifested, wantonly
crashing downwards against the earth. The countless black lotuses
were all wiped out, and even some of the black lotuses that weren’t
directly struck by the lightning bolts saw sparks of lightning
crackle around them, wiping them out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One moment ago, the
entire world was filled with countless black lotuses. Now…they had
all vanished. The mountains, the skies, the seas…the mighty divine
runes that filled this world had all been shattered as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What just happened?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven thousand
Elder Gods that had been struggling to defend were all stunned. The
Starlord, Immortal Abyssus…all of them were stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Vanished?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless black
lotuses which they had been struggling to push back had all
just…vanished?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible. That’s
impossible.” God Emperor Blacklotus blanched. He no longer paid any
attention to World God Blackmist as he frantically scanned the world
around him. He knew exactly how strong this forbidden art of his was,
because he had to prepare it in advance by filling the entire
chaosworld with many formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When all of the
formations were unleashed, they were almost comparable to his full
power when he used his Eternal weapon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A forbidden art of such
power had been instantly defeated? By lightning? Who could do such a
thing?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh…so did you guys
think the lightning looked really pretty?” A voice suddenly rang
out by the ears of the Ji Ning, the Starlord, God Emperor Blacklotus,
and all the other cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A barefoot old man
dressed in tattered robes walked towards through the air from afar,
the trillions of lightning bolts parting before his path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really like
lightning, you know.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unfortunately, I
don’t have much talent for it. I lived in the Grand Lightning Sea
for ages, but in the end I was still able to master just one stage of
its lightning. It is pretty weak, but its not bad when you just want
to mess around.” The raggedy old man beamed as he spoke, then waved
his hand, causing the trillions of lightning bolts to vanish from the
heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battle between the
two sides had come to a complete halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fogstone Dominion’s
major powers were filled with excitement, believing that perhaps they
might be able to survive after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">God Emperor Blacklotus
began to worry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, senior.”
Immortal Abyssus was the first to react.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, senior.”
All of the cultivators of the Fogstone Dominion bowed respectfully,
including World God Blackmist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, senior.”
God Emperor Blacklotus and the World-level experts on his side, as
well as all of the Elder Gods, also bowed respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of them were
fools. What they had witnessed just now spoke volumes. This person
had easily, casually wiped out God Emperor Blacklotus’ terrifying
forbidden art. Most likely, only someone on a completely different
level of power could accomplish this…a Samsara Daolord!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to the
stories, Samsara Daolords walked at the borders between life and
death. Each time they traversed this samsara cycle of life and death,
they would grow dramatically more powerful. If they failed…then
they would die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single one of
them was inconceivably powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were legends of
monstrous Elder Gods who could slay World-level experts! However,
even the most monstrous of World-level experts would only at most be
capable of dealing with newly ascended Samsara Daolords. Any Samsara
Daolord who had been alive for just a bit of time had the power to
utterly crush any World-level expert, and the longer they stayed
alive the more powerful they became. According to the legends, an
enraged Samsara Daolord who was about to die might wipe out entire
territories in their death throes!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And those legends were
true!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only those who had
actually encountered a Daolord would understand how terrifying they
were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The raggedy
old man swept the Fogstone Dominion’s experts with his gaze,
revealing a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The experts of Fogstone
all felt a surge of joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The experts of the
Blacklotus Empire all felt their hearts tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You actually dared
to attack one of mine.” The raggedy old man looked towards God
Emperor Blacklotus, a smile still on his face. “You really are
quite bold.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">God Emperor Blacklotus
quivered, his body turning soft.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had experienced many
things while roaming through foreign territories, and he had
encountered quite a few Samsara Daolords. He knew exactly how
terrifying a Samsara Daolord could be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Great!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It looks like he’s
on our side.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Didn’t you hear
the Daolord say ‘one of mine’ just now? Does he belong to us?
Starlord, could he possibly be one of the ancient seniors of the
Fogstone lineage?” Every member of Fogstone was jubilant, and Ning
let out a sigh of relief as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord was also
puzzled. He sent back, “I don’t know. Fogstone does have quite a
few ancient cultivators who are roaming the outside world. It is
possible that one of them broke through to become a Samsara Daolord,
I suppose…but I don’t recognize this man.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blackmist, do you
recognize him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t recognize
this senior either.” World God Blackmist flew towards them, his
skin still that grayish-white color. “If he’s a Samsara Daolord,
he must have been training for an extremely long period of time. He
probably left Fogstone long before I even started to cultivate. It’s
also possible that he’s completely unrelated to Fogstone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fogstone’s experts
were musing over who this Daolord was, while the experts of the
Blacklotus Empire were filled with terror upon realizing that he was
an enemy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You attacked one of
mine, so…I have to kill you.” The raggedy old man continued to
smile in a jolly fashion, but his words were utterly terrifying. He
waved his finger, causing an enormous illusory finger of lightning to
shoot out towards God Emperor Blacklotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My master is Daolord
Seven Sovereigns!” God Emperor Blacklotus had a look on his face as
he screamed, “Daolord Seven Sovereigns is my master!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">God Emperor Blacklotus
wanted to flee, but spacetime was sealed off in this area. He had
nowhere to run or hide.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The finger of lightning
tapped him on his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! One moment, a
look of terror was on God Emperor Blacklotus’ face. The next
moment, he had been completely transformed into dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire world was
silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
hadn’t even had the chance to digest the fact that Blacklotus was a
disciple of this ‘Daolord Seven Sovereigns’ before Blacklotus
died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seven Sovereigns?”
The raggedy old man spat. “Seven SOVEREIGNS? More like seven bugs!
He hides from me like a bug. This old man wanted to kill him before
my Daomerge, but he actually abandoned his home and went scurrying
off to some godforsaken place.”
</P>

Chapter 49 - The Daolord’s Brother
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After killing God
Emperor Blacklotus the raggedy old man waved his hand, collecting the
treasures which Blacklotus had left behind. He singled out the giant
crystal scimitar in particular, picking it up and giving it a close
look. He mumbled to himself, “Huh, this Eternal weapon isn’t
bad.” Watched by all of the cultivators, the old man put the
scimitar away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The raggedy old man
wasn’t the slightest bit self-conscious about looting Blacklotus’
items.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s crazy
powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He squashed God
Emperor Blacklotus like a bug.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Didn’t you hear?
This senior even wishes to kill that ‘Daolord Seven Sovereigns’.”
The cultivators of Fogstone felt their hearts shudder as they
contemplated this. Samsara Daolords were figures that vastly
surpassed them in power. However, their innate fear didn’t prevent
them from also feeling gratitude and veneration towards this raggedy
old man who they had just met for the first time. They all hoped that
one day they might also reach his level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire purpose of
cultivation was to go out and see more things and experience greater
things, to possess more formidable techniques and divine abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go down,”
the Starlord sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thousands of figures
descended from the skies. Now that nothing was around to interfere
with their movements, they moved quite quickly as they descended upon
the enormous nine-petal black lotus which was now bereft of all
buildings. A day ago, this black lotus was a city. After being
activated as a treasure, some of the buildings that lay atop it had
been put away while the rest had been crushed into dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, senior.”
The Starlord stepped forward and bowed. “Thank you for saving us,
senior.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you for saving
us, senior.” The thousands of cultivators behind him all bowed as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the surviving
Elder Gods and World-level cultivators of the Blacklotus Empire, all
of them were feeling rather uneasy. They didn’t even dare to try
and flee, nor did they dare to go forward and speak to the Daolord.
They were afraid that he’d wave his finger at them and kill them
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” The man
dressed in white floral robes gritted his teeth, then said
respectfully, “We have nothing to do with this matter. The Starlord
came here to take revenge on Chaos Immortal Owlsoar, who is now
already dead. We were just defending ourselves and were the weaker
side until the God Emperor revealed his true power in an attempt to
wipe out the Fogstone lineage…but that was him, not us. We just
stayed on the sidelines and didn’t get involved at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right right right!
We didn’t get involved at all, nor were we strong enough to get
involved.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please show mercy,
senior.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four remaining
World-level experts and the Elder Gods all waited nervously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The raggedy old man
waved his hand dismissively. “Beat it, beat it! All of you, beat
it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The survivors of the
Blacklotus Empire were stunned for a moment, then revealed looks of
joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, senior.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First, they bowed
respectfully. And then…swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! All of them flew
into the skies and departed. The Starlord didn’t dare to stop them;
he even withdrew the astral light that had been emanating from the
planet of Fogstone. If the Daolord had granted them permission to
leave, how could he possibly dare to stop them?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After waving the
survivors off, the raggedy old man turned to smile at the cultivators
of the Fogstone Dominion who were standing closest to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s looking at
us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s staring at
us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s smiling!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So what if he’s
smiling? He smiled when he wiped out God Emperor Blacklotus with a
finger, didn’t he?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What are you talking
about? The Daolord already said that he was on our side.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have no idea who
he is. He might be an ancient member of Fogstone who left long ago
but made a breakthrough to become a Daolord.” Everyone present was
secretly speculating, but they all knew that actually breaking
through from the World level to become a Samsara Daolord was
incredibly difficult. The Fogstone lineage was an ancient one, but it
had only produced a fairly small number of World-level experts. For
it to give birth to a Samsara Daolord was extremely unlikely, unless
one of them had a stroke of absolutely tremendous luck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The raggedy old man
walked towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord and the
others all bowed respectfully while secretly feeling eager to find
out exactly who this old man was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The raggedy
old man glanced at them, then turned his gaze to…Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Fogstone
lineage, eh?” The raggedy old man nodded slowly, turning his gaze
back to the Starlord. “Fogstone deserves to be thanked for its
efforts in taking care of this young brother of mine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young brother?”
The Starlord and the others were all stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was also stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Brother?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The raggedy old man
winked at Ning, then sent mentally, “What is your name? Who gave
you the talisman of welcome?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Talisman of welcome?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Vastheaven Palace’s
talisman of welcome? This was a talisman which World God Northrest
had prepared for his heir before he died. Every single formal member
of Vastheaven Palace was given a single opportunity to welcome and
recruit a new member into their ranks. Anyone welcomed in such a
manner would be allowed to enter Vastheaven Palace with no need for
any testing. Thus, the formal members of Vastheaven Palace wouldn’t
casually bestow their talisman of welcome to others. They were
generally extremely exacting in their standards, and some of them
would never use the talisman a single time in their entire lives.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Daoist title is
Darknorth, while my personal name is Ji Ning. This talisman of
welcome was given to me by World God Northrest,” Ning sent
mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northrest?” The
raggedy old man blinked, then the look in his eye changed. “Do you
know how he died?” Vastheaven Palace had known of Northrest’s
passing in the moment of his death. It had investigated the cause of
his death but had been unable to discover anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s chat about
that in a bit. Also, there’s no need for you to stay here on
Fogstone any longer. Return to Vastheaven Palace with me,” the
raggedy old man said. “Vastheaven Palace is much more powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lifeblood oath he
had sworn to Fogstone had been a fairly loose one, as Ning was
planning all along to spend the next chaos cycle searching for
Vastheaven Palace. In addition, since this raggedy old man was able
to immediately recognize that Ning had a talisman of welcome, he was
most likely a member of Vastheaven Palace as well. In fact, it was
entirely possible that he was one of their highest ranking members!
Only a fool would refuse to join such a powerful organization.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Northrest
himself had claimed that countless cultivators dreamed of having the
chance to join Vastheaven Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is Darknorth to
you, senior?” The Starlord and the others were all stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s my friend and
brother.” The raggedy old man nodded. “I’m going to take him
back with me now. You won’t stop me, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course not!”
The Starlord hurriedly nodded. “Darknorth just joined us a short
while ago. He was quite powerful when he joined us, and so the
lifeblood oath he had to swear was a fairly lax one. He’s
absolutely permitted to leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Abyssus and
the others all looked towards Ning as well, a look of envy in their
eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Good heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Samsara Daolord was
addressing him as ‘brother’? Who wouldn’t want to be in his
place?! They’d even be willing to be the Daolord’s retainer, to
say nothing of being his brother. However, Samsara Daolords had
extremely high standards. They wouldn’t just casually accept anyone
as their retainer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There IS one thing.”
The Starlord gritted his teeth. “I’d like to ask you to help me,
senior.” Although he was afraid of angering this Daolord, he still
forced the words out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” The
raggedy old man smiled cheerily at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Childstar!” The
nearby World God Blackmist sent a furious mental message, terrified
that Starlord was going to anger this powerful old man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starlord lowered
his head, then said respectfully, “My second uncle used an
incomplete divine technique which is causing his entire body to
transform into fogstone. We aren’t able to stop or reverse the
process. I hope that you can intervene to rescue my second uncle,
senior.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The raggedy
old man walked forward towards Blackmist. “This is your second
uncle? Yes, he really is completely transforming into fogstone. Hmm.
Don’t resist. Let me take a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The raggedy old man
extended a hand, pressing it against World God Blackmist’s
shoulders and carefully extending his senses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh…what the hell
type of divine ability is this? How unique. It is actually causing
even his truesoul to transform into fogstone. If this continues, he’s
going to transform into a hunk of rock.” As the raggedy old man
extended his senses, he continued to mumble to himself. “But this
divine ability really is quite powerful. It actually allows for one’s
divine power to explode to such a level of might…quite impressive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unfortunately, you
are using an incomplete version of this divine ability, resulting in
your truesoul being petrified. There’s no way to reverse it. Even
if you were to suddenly gain the complete, correct version right now,
you still wouldn’t be able to stop it.” The raggedy old man let
out a sigh. “His truesoul is undergoing an irreversible
transformation. When the process is completed, he’ll lose all life
and become a hunk of rock.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is there nothing you
can do?” The Starlord revealed a look of desperation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He won’t be able
to hold for much longer. Less than the time needed to boil a kettle
of tea.” The raggedy old man shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second Uncle.” The
Starlord gripped World God Blackmist’s hands, his eyes reddening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be sad,
Childstar. Quite a few of the elders and ancients of the Fogstone
lineage have been forced to use the fourth stage, and all of them
died in the grips of despair…” World God Blackmist looked fondly
at the Starlord, almost as if he was looking at his own son. “I,
however, will be dying happily. You are alive! I’ve lived for long
enough. Eternity isn’t for everyone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand.” The
Starlord nodded, but he was still filled with pain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly, World God
Blackmist’s skin turned grayer and grayer. Earlier, there was at
least a tinge of pinkish flesh to his coloration, but now his aura
grew dimmer and dimmer. And yet, a smile remained on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His aura was completely
extinguished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Blackmist had
completely transformed into a statue. However, his gaze remained
gentle and calm, as though he was forever looking at a beloved child.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second Uncle.” The
Starlord shuddered, wracked by agony.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Blackmist.”
Immortal Abyssus and the others all sighed and bowed slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning bowed respectfully
as well. He felt great gratitude towards World God Blackmist, who had
treated him better than anyone else on Fogstone. Blackmist had even
taught him sword-arts with care. Although Blackmist’s sword-arts
weren’t particularly formidable, he had truly been very diligent in
guiding Ning, going so far as to allow Ning to inspect the sword-arts
he himself had come up with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thud. Thud. Thud. The
Starlord fell to his knees, kowtowing heavily as his tears stained
the ground before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The statue didn’t
move. It just stood there, continuing to stare at him with gentle
warmth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go, let’s
go. I hate seeing stuff like this happen. Ugh.” The raggedy old man
shook his head and sighed. “There’s nothing I can do. His
truesoul was transformed into fogstone. Let’s go, Ji Ning. Let’s
go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone…” Ning
looked at the World-level experts and Elder Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since the Starlord was
still kneeling before the statue in grief, it wasn’t appropriate
for them to chat too much with Ning. Their gazes said everything that
needed saying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” The
raggedy elder stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Ning as they both
soared into the skies and disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning flew away, he
turned his head to look backwards, once.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He saw the Starlord on
his knees, as well as the gently smiling statue of World God
Blackmist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fogstone…” Ning
knew that he would never, ever be able to forget this place, his
first home in the Badlands Territory.
