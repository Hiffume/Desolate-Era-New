Chapter 1 - Terror Starsea
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the
Ninedust Sectlord instantly disappeared from the cave. Only then did
the bald, black-robed youth slowly shake his head. “Although
Redwater and Master had very similar Daos and both specialized in
staff-arts, Redwater is just a bit too vicious and cruel. I don’t
like him. In fact, he hadn’t even become a Daolord of the Fourth
Step yet. Forget it. I’ll just wait for a while longer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Universe treasures
possessed tremendous patience. They truly were eternal and undying,
and so they were able and willing to wait extremely long periods of
time before accepting a new master. They would rather go without than
choose someone who wasn’t a perfect fit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning and the
Ninedust Sectlord felt the world around them blur. Moments later,
they found themselves within a dark, empty region of space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re out.” Both
of them revealed looks of delight. They could now both sense the
locations of their avatars.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can finally sense
my avatar and my Primaltwin again.” Ning relaxed slightly. So long
as he could sense them, he would be able to orient himself. Moments
later, he frowned. “Why do I feel as though they are very, very far
away?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was separated from
his avatar by an incalculable amount of distance. He had previously
travelled to Eastroad Territory, one of the border territories of the
Endless Territories, and that was already very far away from
Vastheaven Territory. However, compared to his current distance that
was absolutely nothing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can sense that the
distance between myself and my avatar is greater than the size of the
entire Endless Territories.” The distance was so great that his
senses were rather foggy, but Ning was certain that the distance was
definitely vaster than the Endless Territories themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We…” The
Ninedust Sectlord’s face turned pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust?” Ning
looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are in the Terror
Starsea.” The Ninedust Sectlord’s face was ugly to behold. “And
we are very, very deep inside of it. Extremely deep.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Extremely deep?”
Ning’s face turned pale as well. Deep inside the Terror Starsea?
The Terror Starsea was the most dangerous place that they knew of. In
size alone, the explored parts of it already surpassed the size of
the Endless Territories! In addition, Ning had learned while in the
‘cave’ that the Terror Starsea was actually the battlefield of
the Dawn War, with numerous Hegemon-level figures having died there.
The place was filled with countless wards and dangers that were
originally meant to kill Hegemons, making them incredibly dangerous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you sure we are
deep inside the Terror Starsea?” Ning immediately asked. He quickly
scanned his surroundings. They were in the dark emptiness of space,
with a few glimmers of light off in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m certain,
because I’ve been to the border worlds near the Terror Starsea,”
the Ninedust Sectlord said. “I’ve travelled and adventured
through its outer regions, and we are very, very far away from those
outer regions. Based on the distance from my avatar… my best
judgment is that we are more than half the size of the entire Endless
Territories away from the outer regions. We’re definitely deep
inside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart turned
cold. The Terror Starsea was deadly even for Eternal Emperors, while
even Hegemons would tread carefully here for fear of dying. Generally
speaking, even the most powerful of Daolords wouldn’t dare to
venture too deep inside this place. As for their current location?
This place definitely qualified as not just deep, but ‘incredibly
deep’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two stood there
within the endless darkness of space, both rather nervous. It would
be impossibly difficult to escape the Terror Starsea and go home.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We still have hope.”
The Ninedust Sectlord knew more about the Terror Starsea than Ning.
He said seriously, “Darknorth, your sword-arts have transcended
space itself. You can easily use it to tear open a dimensional gate
and escape incredibly far distances.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
He could indeed slice open dimensional passageways, then travel
tremendous distances through them. It wouldn’t be difficult for him
to create a dimensional passageway that could traverse more than ten
territories. This was far faster than even using spacetime transfer
arrays!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, it made
sense. Given Ning’s current sword-arts, so long as he was able to
lock onto an enemy he would be able to slay that enemy from over a
territory away! Spacetime transfer arrays would normally be needed to
merely traverse such a great distance, a testament to how terrifying
and important the Dao was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Brightshore
Kingdom’s Hegemon was another good example. He was able to easily
appear anywhere within the Endless Territories, an ability that was
far superior to Ning’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The explored regions
of the Terror Starsea are vaster than the Endless Territories
themselves! Since we are only over halfway in, that means that some
Hegemons or ancient Eternal Emperors might’ve been here before,”
the Ninedust Sectlord said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Would you be able to
ask one of those ancient powers to come guide us out?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“None of them would
care about Daolords like us,” the Ninedust Sectlord said. “At
most they would give us a star map.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed. At most,
we’d get star maps.” Ning was worried as well. “We’d know
what was around us, but we’d still have to face any danger on our
own. The two of us would only be considered second-tier even amongst
Daolords. To travel such a great distance and escape the Terror
Starsea… even though my sword-art transcends space, it’ll be far
too difficult.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, yes it will.”
The Ninedust Sectlord felt an enormous sense of pressure as well. He
then muttered, “Why did the Universe treasure send us here?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can’t blame
him for that.” Ning shook his head. “The Dawn War was carried out
in the Terror Starsea; that cave we were in is probably located deep
within the Terror Starsea as well. It might be somewhere right next
to us, in fact. The treasure was only able to send us here. No matter
what, we can’t just give up and lay down to die. We have to fight
our best. Right now, we should first acquire star maps. Perhaps a
good star map will be able to guide us through a fairly safe path.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
laughed. “Right. Patriarch Vulturas, one of the oldest members of
my race, probably came here once as well. He obviously was able to
return. I’ll send my avatar to find a star map first, while you
should acquire one from the Dao Alliance. The Dao Alliance has the
most complete star maps.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look over there!”
The Ninedust Sectlord suddenly pointed off into the distance, a
complicated look on his face. “I think I already know where we are
in the Terror Starsea.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” Ning
followed the Ninedust Sectlord’s finger with his gaze. Off in the
distance, there was a circle of green light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go over
there,” the Ninedust Sectlord said softly. “Darknorth, this part
is up to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
drew his Northbow sword, then with a flicker of sword-light created a
dimensional passageway before them. The Ninedust Sectlord and Ning
both entered the beautiful rainbow dimensional passageway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They flew side-by-side
through this different spatial continuum, advancing rapidly towards
their target.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to exit.” The
two flew out from the glowing dimensional passageway, having arrived
at another patch of empty, blank dark space. They were already more
than ten territories away from their previous location.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning stared
forwards in astonishment. Up ahead was an enormous green whirlpool
that was surrounded by layers of green light. The green light was
filled with boundless vitality, and the rocks and boulders that flew
close to it quickly turned white in color, then disappeared into
nothingness. Next to the green whirlpool there was a similarly sized
black whirlpool which was devouring everything nearby it, sucking all
stones, shattered corpses, and various items that flew nearby into
itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A green whirlpool and a
black whirlpool. The former was filled with life energy, but it
sucked all the life from the surrounding area and destroyed it. The
latter was filled with death energy and devoured everything around
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two seemed to be
parts of a whole. Although they were diametrically different, neither
interfered with the other at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What are those?”
Ning could hardly believe it. He could sense that they were still
very far away, but the two whirlpools looked absolutely enormous.
Ning’s best guess was that these two whirlpools were each roughly
the size of a hundred territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the one
thing in the Terror Starsea which terrifies all six organizations…
the Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels,” the Ninedust Sectlord said softly.
“Do you know? Long, long ago, the Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels was
smaller than a single territory.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face turned
pale. “Are you saying that it is growing?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. It is growing.”
The Ninedust Sectlord nodded. “The Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels… the
life wheel draws away all vital energy, while the death wheel devours
and destroys all. They are stealing and devouring all the life and
matter from the area around them, and as they do so they continuously
grow larger and larger. The rate at which they are growing is only
increasing. In the future, they will grow to encompass the entire
Terror Starsea. In fact, they’ll swallow the entirety of the
Endless Territories and destroy all within it. It is destined for the
Endless Territories to be destroyed one day.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning could
hardly believe it. The Endless Territories were doomed to
destruction?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When the six powers
originally discovered the Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels, they immediately
began to panic. All three Hegemons sought to work together to destroy
it.” The Ninedust Sectlord shook his head. “Unfortunately, any
attacks launched against it were all swallowed. The energy of the
attacks just made it grow bigger. There was simply no way to harm it
in the slightest.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The most supreme
Emperor-class cultivators and a few of the most powerful Daolords all
know of this.” The Ninedust Sectlord looked at Ning. “Given your
power, I imagine the Dao Alliance would soon inform you of this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
distant Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They’d continuously
grow until the day they wiped out the Endless Territories?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is something
which was naturally born from the endless primordial chaos. There is
no way cultivators can possibly resist something like this,” the
Ninedust Sectlord said. “However, there’s no need for us to worry
too much. Based on our current predictions, it’ll be more than a
million chaos cycles before it starts to destroy the Endless
Territories. As Daolords, if we fail our Daomerge we’ll definitely
die within 108,000 chaos cycles. Let the Hegemons and Emperors deal
with this problem.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
distant Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels, still unable to believe what he was
hearing. “The Endless Territories… are doomed to be destroyed?”

Chapter 2 - Travelling
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those two enormous
whirlpools continued to slowly spin in the darkness of space,
continuously absorbing and devouring all things around them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Even
the empty void of space around them was being continuously shattered
and devoured as the power of chaos and all other prime essence
ripples were drawn into the Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing can stop
them at all?” Ji Ning stared at them, murmuring softly to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. Nothing can
stop them.” The Ninedust Sectlord shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning’s true body
was staring, stunned, at the Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels, his avatar in
the incredibly distant Vastheaven Palace of the Endless Territories
was off to visit Daolord Solesky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a private
courtyard. Daolord Solesky’s avatar was relaxing with some wine
while staring at the darkened horizons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother
Solesky,” the golden-robed Ning called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Solesky
turned to look at him, then suddenly started to laugh. “This is
rather diverting.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why are you
laughing, big brother?” The golden-robed Ning was rather surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Solesky smiled. “I’m
laughing because both of us are avatars! Two avatars are holding a
meeting with each other… haha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-robed Ning
was briefly startled before letting out a chuckle as well. Both of
their true bodies were outside, adventuring. Avatars were much
weaker, but they’d be strong enough to stand guard over a school or
clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ever since you
created an avatar, you’ve been spending your time strengthening it.
Aside from the Kongsan matter, you haven’t come to see me at all.”
Daolord Solesky asked, “Why is it that you’ve suddenly come to
seek me out?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There is indeed
something I need help with.” The golden-robed Ning nodded. “I’m
currently trapped in the Terror Starsea.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Trapped in the
Terror Starsea?” Daolord Solesky leapt to his feet, no longer
relaxed in the slightest. He said solemnly, “Where in the Terror
Starsea?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Close to the
Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky’s
face immediately turned ugly to behold. “W-why the hell did you go
there? Even I have only heard of that thing from an old friend of
mine. Supposedly, they are the most terrifying things within the
Terror Starsea. Even the almighty Hegemons are helpless against them;
if they tried to charge into those wheels, they would instantly be
obliterated by them! They are still continuing to slowly grow larger.
Supposedly, in the distant future they might even sweep over the
entire Terror Starsea, then devour all of the Endless Territories and
wipe it out completely.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “I have
heard the same.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But that’s
something that should only happen a long, long time for now. We
probably won’t live long enough to see that.” Daolord Solesky
said seriously, “The Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels are extremely deep
within the Terror Starsea. Not even the most overwhelmingly powerful
Daolords would dare to venture that deep. Why did you go there?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It wasn’t my
choice.” Ning shook his head. “I had an unexpected encounter,
resulting in me being transferred there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Transferred?”
Daolord Solesky shook his head and sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother Solesky,
do you have a map of the Terror Starsea?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I do.” Daolord
Solesky nodded. “I reached the Verge long ago, and so I sought out
every opportunity possible for succeeding in my Daomerge. As a
result, I prepared star maps of the Terror Starsea for myself, and
they include the location of the Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels. However,
they are too far away. If you wish to exit the Terror Starsea, you’ll
have to traverse a distance equivalent to more than half of the
Endless Territories.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait a moment. I’ll
prepare a copy for you.” Daolord Solesky waved his hand, sending
his Immortal energy out and forming an enormous star map in the air.
This star map was filled with many markings and pathways.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It took roughly the
amount of time needed to prepare a kettle of tea before Daolord
Solesky finished drawing the complete star map. By then, Ning had
silently memorized it all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This star map of
mine came from the Dao Alliance,” Daolord Solesky said. “It won’t
be easy to find a more detailed one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This will be
enough.” Ning nodded, his heart heavy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful.”
Daolord Solesky truly was worried. As he saw, Ning’s chances of
surviving this were quite slim.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within the Terror
Starsea, close to the titanic Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels. Ning and the
Ninedust Sectlord stood shoulder-to-shoulder in the darkness of
space, staring at the enormous representation of annihilation in
front of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have a star map
now,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My avatar has gone
out to beg a meeting with Patriarch Vulturas. I trust I shall acquire
a map of my own soon,” the Ninedust Sectlord said. “Have you
looked at that star map of yours yet? What do you think?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is going to be
very hard.” Ning shook his head. “I’ve already taken a look at
things. The ‘safest’ route will still require us to go through
sixty-two dangerous zones. Given our current power, our chances of
surviving will be less than ten percent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sixty-two?” The
Ninedust Sectlord frowned. “Darknorth, your sword-arts transcend
space itself. We should be able to avoid many of those dangerous
regions, no?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already
factored that into my considerations.” Ning said helplessly,
“Without it, we would have to go through more than five hundred
danger zones! That would be certain death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” The
Ninedust Sectlord stared at his surroundings. “How the hell did we
end up this deep inside?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Ninedust
Sectlord really did feel rather aggrieved. They had been teleported
all the way from the Eastroad Sect, only to find themselves
incredibly deep inside the Terror Starsea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust, perhaps
Emperor Vulturas will have a better path than the one I found,”
Ning said. “My star map isn’t all that detailed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Wait for now.
My avatar is now meeting with Patriarch Vulturas,” the Ninedust
Sectlord said expectantly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waited as
instructed. A short while later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, I have the
star map.” The Ninedust Sectlord suddenly began to chuckle merrily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And?” Ning looked
at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s hope after
all.” The Ninedust Sectlord was extremely excited. He waved a
finger, sending out his Immortal energy to form an enormous star map
in the void of space. “This is the star map which Patriarch
Vulturas bestowed upon me. He once exited the same cave we did, and
he also came out in this general area. He was much more powerful than
us, and so he was able to return home with ease. However, he made
repeated trips back to hear in search of the cave again, and so he is
actually very familiar with this region and this route.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The safest route for
us to take is this one.” The Ninedust Sectlord pointed towards a
newly created route on the map. “Other powerful Daolords would find
this route a difficult one, but your power over space will allow us
to take it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the star
map of energy hanging in the air, an excited look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are four
danger zones in total. We must first pass through Dreamdust Way, then
enter the Starflow River. After passing through the entire Starflow
River, we’ll exit from this point. We will then traverse two fairly
short danger zones… and then we’ll be out safely.” The Ninedust
Sectlord said excitedly, “There are four danger zones in total. For
three of them, we should be able to traverse them safely if we use
the protective resources we have at our disposal. The only tougher
part will be the Starflow River.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Both of
them had multiple life-preserving resources. They might not have
enough Dao-seals for traversing several dozen or several hundred
danger zones, but three? Both felt quite confident in their chances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Starflow River?”
Ning said, worried, “We have to pass through the entire thing?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The Ninedust
Sectlord nodded. “That’s the only real obstacle before us. Based
on my calculations, we’ll have to spend at least three hundred
thousand years traversing it. The other places, all combined, will
only require perhaps ten years. Most of our time will be spent going
through the entire Starflow River.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starflow River was
an enormous area that was like an enormous river of stars flowing
through the darkness of the void. To traverse it would take a very
long period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To them it wouldn’t
be too dangerous, and both stood a good chance of making it out
alive. However, they’d still be in there for quite some time. The
more time passed, the more variables might appear and the more danger
might arise. The entire Terror Starsea was the battlefield for the
Dawn War, after all, and the Starflow River was part of it. It
wouldn’t be that easy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For us, this truly
is the safest route we can try.” Ning nodded. “The route I
suggested earlier gave us less than a ten percent chance of
surviving. This one, I’d say our chances are fifty-fifty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” The
Ninedust Sectlord nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fifty-fifty wasn’t
bad at all. Given Ning’s ability to transcend space and the
incredibly detailed map and route which Patriarch Vulturas had given
them, they now stood a very good chance of surviving.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank goodness
Patriarch Vulturas has been here many times. Otherwise, there’s no
way we could’ve possibly found such a safe route.” The Ninedust
Sectlord nodded. “Time to go, Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go. I hope
both of us will make it back to the Endless Territories alive.”
Ning looked at the Ninedust Sectlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll definitely
make it back alive, together!” The Ninedust Sectlord added, “I
just received the ancestor’s legacy. There’s no way I’m going
to die before making it back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust
shared a smile. Both of them understood that this would be a
dangerous, life-and-death journey. “Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust both
stood at the prow of the black vessel. Northbow sword in hand, Ning
tore a black passageway with his sword-arts through the darkness of
space. Swoosh! The vessel flew into the passageway, which shut behind
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them,
homeward bound, had just embarked on an incredible journey.

Chapter 3 - Heartforce Eradicator
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two advanced
carefully, with Ji Ning only opening the tunnels once they found a
fairly safe starting point and stopping point. Every so often, they
would have to rely on the black vessel to avoid a few special areas
that couldn’t be traversed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Half a month went past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… spacetime was
distorted here. Space debris filled the region, and countless dangers
lurked hidden. A black vessel was paused within this field of chaotic
spacetime, enduring the chaotic waves of shattered space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Ninedust
Sectlord both stared towards the front. Up ahead of them, right in
the middle of that region of chaotic space, was a bluestone road that
was ten million kilometers wide. For an extremely beautiful and
peaceful road to suddenly appear within this region of dark, chaotic
space… they could sense that this stone path had to be hiding some
sort of hidden danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dreamdust Way.”
The Ninedust Sectlord said heavily, “If we wish to go back, we need
to go through four danger zones, with the most dangerous one being
the Starflow River! It’s so enormous that it’ll take us roughly
three hundred thousand years to traverse it. The second most
dangerous location will be Dreamdust Way! The final two danger zones
are in the outer reaches of the Terror Starsea. Given how strong we
are, the danger level it will pose us should be fairly negligible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Dreamdust
Way was located very deep within the Terror Starsea and was extremely
dangerous!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope we won’t be
so unlucky as to die here.” The Ninedust Sectlord looked towards
Ning. “Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning nodded.
Swoosh! The black vessel immediately flew towards that bluestone
pathway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only by passing through
Dreamdust Way would they be able to reach the Starflow River.
Although very dangerous, this was comparatively the ‘safest’ path
for them to reach the Starflow River.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
held his longstaff at the ready, his eyes narrowed as he scanned his
surroundings. Clearly, he was quite nervous. He said in a low voice,
“Given our vessel’s flying speed, we should be able to exit
Dreamdust Way in roughly a month. One month. Just one month. We need
to stay on our guard this entire month.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wielded a Northbow
sword in each of his two hands as he maintained a vigilant watch. He
couldn’t help but smirk. “Ninedust. You almost seem nervous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can’t blame me for
being nervous. The slightest miscalculation in this pla-… careful!”
The Ninedust Sectlord’s face turned pale. An azure scaled beast had
suddenly appeared off in the distance. This beast had a pair of
armored wings and a pair of protruding golden eyes that seemed to
contain a vast world within them. Whoooosh. The azure scaled beast
blinked. Moments later, more than ten thousand of similar beasts
appeared next to it. All of them let out shrill, ear-piercing
screeches.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dreamdust lifeforms.
Careful!” The Ninedust Sectlord was very nervous. “Only one of
them is real. The rest are all illusory, but it can switch its true
body with the illusory ones at will. It could be any of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there at the
prow of his vessel, watching as the thousands of beasts charged
towards them. A cold light suddenly flashed through his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! An invisible
ripple swept out like a wave towards the thousands of azure beasts.
One beast suddenly let out a low, agonized scream. Its body trembled,
then its golden eyes quickly grew dim as it silently collapsed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other azure scaled
beasts all completely vanished in an instant, leaving behind that
single fallen corpse. Moments later, the corpse began to
automatically separate into countless motes of azure light which then
began to flow into the bluestone path in a very natural manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It died?” The
Ninedust Sectlord turned to look at Ning, rather amazed. “Darknorth,
w-what just happened? How did that Dreamdust creature suddenly die?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dreamdust lifeforms
were terrifying creatures that were born from the unusual, unique
Dreamdust Way environment. They were born with incredible skill over
illusions, and were able to manifest many false bodies which they
could ‘swap’ with their true bodies at will. Thus, battling
against them was a very tiresome and troublesome task. Even if you
were much more powerful than them, you might die to them if you
weren’t careful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heartforce,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I knew it! I sensed
it.” The Ninedust Sectlord was rather stunned. “You are a
Heartforce Cultivator?” The Ninedust Sectlord had been keeping a
careful vigil, wary of more Dreamdust lifeforms appearing. When he
suddenly sensed that strange wave blast out, he naturally was able to
calculate that it had most likely been heartforce! However, Ning had
never before used heartforce techniques, and Heartforce Cultivators
were incredibly rare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha. I told you
earlier that the Hegemon of the Dao Alliance left something for me.”
Ning smiled. “I became a true Heartforce Cultivator within that
cave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…” The
Ninedust Sectlord was overjoyed. “Splendid! My greatest worry with
regards to Dreamdust Way was that we might actually be trapped by its
illusions! That’s why we have to maintain constant vigilance… but
I never imagined that you would’ve become a Heartforce Cultivator.
Hahaha! To trap a powerful Heartforce Cultivator with illusions is no
easy feat. I can finally relax a little bit and not be as nervous as
I was earlier. Just keep an eye out on things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dreamdust lifeforms
are skilled in more than just illusions; they can also create many
false bodies and are strong in close combat,” Ning warned. “The
legends say that the most powerful lifeforms here are comparable to
Eternal Emperors in power. Even though I’ll be able to resist their
illusions, I’m probably not going to be a match for them in close
combat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The Ninedust
Sectlord nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If push comes to
shove, we’ll have to rely on our Dao-seals,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter what, you
being a Heartforce Cultivator means that we’ll have an easier time
of it when dealing with illusions.” The Ninedust Sectlord said
curiously, “What heartforce art did you use just now? It seemed
quite incredible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heartforce
Eradicator,” Ning replied. This was a heartforce art which Ning
created himself after studying and modifying the heartforce legacy
left behind by Daolord Featherdress. It was highly suited to him and
also extremely powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Featherdress
was far more powerful than the current Palace Lord of the Heartforce
Palace! Daolord Feather had been the number one Daolord of the
Endless Territories in that era and had three supreme heartforce
arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These arts were known
as the [Heartforce Eradicator], [Dreamworld], and [Featherdress
Soulthrall Song]. Daolord Featherdress had primarily relied on the
[Featherdress Soulthrall Song] to become the number one Daolord of
that era. The song mesmerized the soul, ensuring that even powerful
Eternal Emperors would be caught by it if they weren’t careful.
Even many of the most supreme of Daolords were unable to resist such
a terrifying heartforce art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, however, was
different from Daolord Featherdress. Ning’s Dao was that of the
Omega Sword Dao, an offensive Dao. Featherdress was more subtle and
more guileful, and also extremely skilled in the musical arts. This
was why Featherdress had been able to create the terrifying
[Featherdress Soulthrall Song].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two walked
different paths and naturally had very different styles. Ning had
learned just a tiny bit of the [Featherdress Soulthrall Song] and had
barely managed to learn 20% of [Dreamworld], but he had mastered the
extremely offensive [Heartforce Eradicator] art. He had then modified
it to make it better suited to him, resulting in it becoming even
more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His heartforce lashed
out like a sword, eradicating the opponent’s soul and truesoul. It
was an extremely dominating attack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, if his foe was
able to endure the attack, this heartforce art would be very
ineffective. In other words, it was an ‘all-or-nothing’ type of
attack. Daolord Featherdress had been skilled in many areas and thus
was much more dangerous. In the end, Ning simply hadn’t been
training for long enough. He primarily relied on the power of his
Omega Sword Dao. For him to be able to master and then retrofit the
[Heartforce Eradicator] was already quite incredible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The name makes it
sound pretty wild and dominating.” The Ninedust Sectlord said in a
resigned fashion, “I had thought that the gifts the ancestor gave
me would enable me to beat you. It seems I’m not a match for you
anymore.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You really aren’t
a match for me now.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You little…” The
Ninedust Sectlord glared at him. “You don’t know the meaning of
‘modesty’ at all. Just you wait. When I become a Daolord of the
Fourth Step… hmph! I’ve already gained many insights during our
time in the cave. It won’t take me too long to break through and
become a Daolord of the Fourth Step. By then, you’ll know just how
awesome I am.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s quite normal
to be stuck at a bottleneck for several chaos cycles. Don’t worry,
I won’t abuse you too much in the interim,” Ning teased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two bantered back
and forth as they advanced on the black vessel. The reason why they
were able to relax and banter was because they knew that illusions,
at least, would not be a problem! Their only worry would be head-on
encounters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Outsiders.” An
azure beast appeared in the distance, its golden eyes filled with a
murderous look. “Die.” Instantly, more than ten thousand
duplicates of it appeared, with all of them charging towards the
vessel. Neither Ning nor the Ninedust Sectlord could recognize the
real one, as every single body could theoretically be the real one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning turned
and swept his gaze across the beasts, his heartforce surging out like
a wave. Instantly, all of the beasts vanished save for a single one
that fell down dead. The corpse naturally dissipated and merged back
into the bluestone road.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impressive,
impressive. You looked at it and it died! I’m really jealous now.”
The Ninedust Sectlord chortled in praise. “I wonder when and if
I’ll ever become a Heartforce Cultivator. I’ll stare at people
until they die! What a wonderful life that would be.”

Chapter 4 - Heartworld Projection, Descend!
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the most
frightening aspect of supreme Heartforce Cultivators! Their attacks
were silent, fast, and incredibly deadly. Worse, not even Universe
treasures were useful in defending against heartforce attacks. You
could only rely on your Dao-heart, your soul, and your mental
fortitude! There was no way to counterfeit any of these things. Even
if you were incredibly strong in combat, if you had mental flaws then
you would still die at the hands of a Heartforce Cultivator.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Long ago Ji Ning,
Prince Greatjoy, Heartlord Solewind, and Waterlord Firesurge had
journeyed to the Genesis Lands of the alternate universe. Together,
they had tested themselves against the primessence chains that led to
the heart of that universe. Although all four of them were very
similar in power, Firesurge was noticeably much weaker than the
others mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was why Heartforce
Cultivators had very special statuses. Even when they were slightly
weaker than others, they would still be afforded with the utmost of
respect by even the most powerful of Daolords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die, outsider!”
Yet another azure scaled beast emerged. A second later, many
thousands of illusions appeared around it. This was their standard,
innate attack. But Ning just glanced at all of them, then swept out
with his heartforce like a sword. Whoosh! They all dissipated like
smoke as a single corpse fell down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first twelve days
in Dreamdust Way were extremely relaxed. Sometimes they encountered
ten of those Dreamdust lifeforms at the same time, but in each case
Ning was able to wipe them out with a single glance. None of them
were able to resist Ning’s [Heartforce Eradicator] at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the thirteenth day,
they finally encountered a Dreamdust lifeform that was capable of
withstanding the [Heartforce Eradicator] and not perishing. This
beast was noticeably larger than the previous ones that they had
fought. Although it was able to survive the heartforce attack, it
clearly was rather dazed by it, giving Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord
a chance to charge forwards and slay it in close combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the sixteenth day,
they encountered an extremely tough-to-deal-with beast that was able
to ignore the [Heartforce Eradicator]! It was also on the same
general level of power as Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord in close
combat. In the end the two had to join forces, with Ning finishing it
off with a blow from his Omega Sword Dao - Blood Drop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two continued to
advance on their black vessel, but after the seventeenth day they
begin to grow puzzled. “Odd. Why haven’t we seen a single
Dreamdust lifeform?” Life had suddenly become quite tranquil, and
they didn’t run into any of the beasts at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is odd.
Extremely odd. According to Patriarch Vulturas’ notes, Dreamdust
Way should only grow in danger as we move deeper into it, with the
Dreamdust lifeforms increasing in number and power.” The Ninedust
Sectlord frowned. “It should take us roughly a month to traverse
the entire Dreamdust Way. We should be at the very center of it right
now. Why don’t we see as much as a single one?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighteenth day. The
nineteenth day. The twentieth day…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everything was very
calm. No Dreamdust lifeforms appeared. Twenty-six days had gone by in
the blink of an eye, and they were close to exiting Dreamdust way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh. The black
vessel continued to advance at a hundred time’s the speed of light.
Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord stood alongside each other at the
prow, staring off into the distance. Neither relaxed in the
slightest. It had been ten days since they had encountered any
Dreamdust lifeforms. Something was very wrong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” Ning’s
face suddenly tightened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop!” the
Ninedust Sectlord immediately called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black vessel came
to an immediate halt in the darkness of the void. The two of them
stared off into the distance, where an entire host of azure scaled
beasts had gathered. These creatures all had stooped figures, scaled
wings, and protruding golden eyes. In front of them was the largest
Dreamdust beast the two had seen thus far, a creature that was at
least thirty meters tall. The beast at the very back was the
smallest, merely fifteen meters tall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This looks like
trouble.” The Ninedust Sectlord murmured, “Darknorth, the scaled
beasts we saw previously were eighteen meters tall at best. This
group is led by one that is thirty meters tall, and there are five
beasts that are twenty-seven meters tall and twelve that are
twenty-four meters tall. Even the weakest one is fifteen meters tall.
In total, there are twenty-one of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fifteen meters is
the cutoff for surviving my [Heartforce Eradicator],” Ning sent
mentally. “Clearly, the Dreamdust beasts have come prepared.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two sides stared at
each other from afar. Off in the distance, more than a hundred more
scaled beasts also stared at Ning’s group, their protruding golden
eyes seeming to hold boundless worlds within them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wonderful…
absolutely beautiful…” The Ninedust Sectlord suddenly had a
sappy, stupid grin on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s face
tightened. He immediately sent out a surge of heartforce smashing
outwards like a ripple-wave that blocked all outside sources of
power, allowing the Ninedust Sectlord to immediately regain his
clarity of mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I-I was actually
trapped by an illusion.” The Ninedust Sectlord immediately came
back to his senses, a cold thrill of fear going down his spine. He
stared at the distant beast leader. “I was caught in an illusion
without even realizing it. No wonder the Patriarch said Dreamdust Way
was dangerous and that I might die here. He told me to be prepared at
all times.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prepared?” Ning
glanced at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. My original
plan was to engage in a continuous mental conversation with my
retainers; whenever I stopped talking, that would be a sign that I
had been trapped inside an illusion and my retainer would immediately
use a Dao-seal to wake me up!” The Ninedust Sectlord continued,
“But since I knew that you were a Heartforce Cultivator, I didn’t
go through the trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but nod upon hearing this. This wasn’t a bad idea at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cultivators…” An
ancient voice rang out from afar. “I’m impressed that you were
able to resist my illusions. No wonder you were able to slay so many
of my compatriots with ease… but the end result of trespassing onto
Dreamdust Way will still be death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The largest beast’s
aura washed out like a tidal wave as it pointed at the two of them.
“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” All of the
Dreamdust lifeforms let out enraged howls as tens of thousands of
illusions appeared around them. All of a sudden, there were over a
million of the howling figures, and all of them charged straight
towards the two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Use your secret
art,” Ning sent mentally to the Ninedust Sectlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” The
Ninedust Sectlord nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Nine energy
dragons immediately flooded out of Ning’s body. These were his nine
novessence arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">WHOOSH! Curtains of
rippling water appeared around the Ninedust Sectlord that quickly
surged off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It took time for secret
arts to attack. Generally speaking, even the most supreme of secret
arts would still only be able to fly at a hundred times the speed of
light. This was a major bottleneck for cultivators and attacks alike.
There were many Eternal Emperors who were unable to breach this
limit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine awesome secret
arts and the waves of water swirled around each other, forming a
perfect whole as they smashed towards the million-plus figures
charging towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the many
figures caught within the secret arts began to move much slower than
before. However, all of them appeared completely unharmed. This was
what made them so terrifying; there was no way to tell which one was
real and which one was false.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Ninedust
Sectlord’s decision to join forces with their secret arts caused
the fifteen meter beast and the eighteen meter beast to be completely
locked in place, unable to move at all. The body of the fifteen meter
beast actually began to shudder and slowly crumble apart. These two
secret arts were simply too powerful. As for the other Dreamdust
beasts, their speed dropped sharply as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” Ning focused
his gaze upon them. Suddenly, an absolutely enormous world appeared
in the void above the bluestone path. This world held tall mountains,
deep canyons, and flowing rivers within it. At the very center of
this world, there was an absolutely titanic mountain that was shaped
like a giant sword. This enormous world was Ning’s heartworld!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heartworld
projection descended upon the bluestone road.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartworld projections
were different from secret arts. Secret arts needed time to fly out
and strike foes, but heartworld projections required no time at all.
They were illusory projections and thus could descend instantly.
Ning’s heartworld was absolutely enormous, on the same level as
that of Daolord Soleman’s. His heartworld projection was thus just
as powerful as his nine novessence arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the nine
novessence arts and the water curtain joined together, it had to be
done in a careful way to prevent them from interfering with each
other. The illusory heartworld projection, however, was able to
overlap over them perfectly!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! The
fifteen meter beast was already at the verge of breaking apart, while
the eighteen meter beasts had been completely frozen. Both were
instantly annihilated when the heartworld projection came crashing
down. The twenty-one meter beasts were now completely locked in
place, while even the twenty-four meter beasts were dramatically
slowed down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s flee.”
Ning immediately sent the black vessel fleeing at high speeds. There
were simply too many of the remaining Dreamdust lifeforms, after all,
and there was no way to tell which ones were real. There really was
no way for them to kill the creatures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn. They are
forcing me to use some of my own primal essence.” The beast leader
had been at the front of its pack. Its tens of thousands of clones
all vanished, leaving only it behind. It raised his head, letting out
a bellow as a third eye suddenly appeared in its forehead. This was a
completely azure light that glowed with blue light, and it stared
directly at Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of the cultivators
immediately sensed that they were in mortal danger.
</P>

Chapter 5 - The Dreamdust Runes
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the
Ninedust Sectlord were aboard the black vessel, seeking to flee out
of the bluestone road. Their secret arts and the heartworld
projection had crushed to death quite a few of the weaker beasts,
causing the enraged beast leader to open his third eye in his
forehead. When he did so, it seemed as though that eye had become the
hegemon and ruler of this entire region of space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A strange alien script
appeared directly above that eye, formed by multiple divine runes.
Seventy-two of those runes came together to form a single character.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What type of script
is this?” Ning was shocked upon seeing it. “I’ve never seen
this script before.” But although it was his first time seeing it,
Ning was still able to sense the unfathomable, limitless power which
this script contained within it. It seemed as though the only thing
comparable to this ancient script was the azureflower seal that was
formed by the Nine Chaos Seals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire vast
bluestone road suddenly lit up with dazzling azure light that
stretched up ten thousand meters, illuminating the entire region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine secret arts,
the Ripplewater secret art, and Ning’s heartworld projection were
all suppressed by the power of the azure light. It also reached out
to grip the fleeing black vessel, causing it to drop down from a
hundred times the speed of light to merely sixty-two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The beast leader is
going all out. It has activated the Dreamdust Eye!” The Ninedust
Sectlord was shocked. “Darknorth, the Dreamdust Eye contains an
extremely powerful illusory component. If you can’t withstand it,
you need to tell me right away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can handle it.”
Ning gritted his teeth, sending out his heartforce in ringed layers
to defend against the invisible attack. While doing so, he carefully
scrutinized the strange character which had appeared above the beast
leader’s third eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had the feeling that
this character contained an absolutely terrifying level of power in
the realm of illusions. It must be remembered that Heartforce
Cultivators were incredibly strong in resisting illusions, far
stronger than the majority of Eternal Emperors! For even Ning to find
this Dreamdust Eye to be so hard to defend against meant that other
Daolords, even ones as powerful as Palace Lord Dawnstar, wouldn’t
be able to fight it head-on. They would have to rely on special
treasures in order to stay alive and have a chance to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eternal Emperors would
die here as well if they weren’t careful! Thankfully, Ning was a
Heartforce Cultivator. This was why he dared to fight the attack
head-on. One could imagine how terrifying this Dreamdust Eye attack
was!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can sense that
strange character is filled with boundless mysteries and illusions,”
Ning mused silently to himself. “If I could fully master it, I
would be able to reach an even higher level of mastery over
illusions.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Featherdress’
greatest strength lay in those three mighty secret arts. Ning had
only reached a high level of skill in one of them, the [Heartforce
Eradicator]. Compared to other Heartforce Cultivators, he was fairly
weak in illusions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” As the
beast leader opened the Dreamdust Eye, it also transformed into a
streak of light that charged straight towards them. Whoosh! It
instantly moved at a hundred times the speed of light, while the
black vessel was merely moving at sixty-two times the speed of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s chasing after
us!” The Ninedust Sectlord was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At least its by
itself.” Only the beast leader was able to move at a hundred times
the speed of light, with the twenty-seven meter beasts merely able to
move at fifty times the speed of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there at the
prow of the ship, Northbow swords in hand. When he stabbed out with
his sword, his right arm suddenly expanded to become a million
kilometers in size as it pierced through the void. As for the
Northbow sword, it expanded to become nearly ten million kilometers
long, carrying an aura of overwhelming power as it stabbed towards
the attacking beast leader. Ning’s sword was very strange; it
seemed to carry an aura of overwhelming power, but it also contained
some of the mysteries of the Shadowless stance, making it difficult
for the opponent to grasp and predict it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The beast leader
let out a savage bellow as it lashed out with its sharp claws,
sending them directly against the edge of the Northbow sword. A
terrifying burst of power was sent through the Northbow sword towards
Ning. Although Ning’s marvelous sword-arts allowed him to divert a
great deal of the power, the power remaining was still enough to
cause his right arm to go numb. He couldn’t help but stumble three
steps backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How’d it go?”
the Ninedust Sectlord asked, worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is too powerful.
This thing is far stronger than me in close combat.” Ning shook his
head. If it hadn’t been for the Hegemon armor, he probably would’ve
been heavily injured just now. “It seems we’ll be forced to use
up one of our treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he spoke, Ning
suddenly produced a golden medallion with his right hand. Daolord
Kongsan had left behind a number of protective, life-preserving
treasures when he died. Right now, Ning only had two remaining. This
golden medallion had been crafted by an unknown Eternal Emperor. One
crushed, it would form an enormous golden illusory mountain which
would crash down upon the opponent. Ning felt certain that this
should be enough to slow down the beast leader and ensure that they
could flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to waste a
Dao-seal just yet,” the Ninedust Sectlord said hurriedly. “We
only have so many of them. We need to save them up as best we can.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you have any
better ideas?” Ning looked at him. It was indeed true that these
Dao-seals were very rare and difficult to acquire. Daolord Kongsan
had only gotten them over the course of countless years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, Ning had
four life-preserving items left: Kongsan’s two items, the Sword
Hegemon’s Dao-seal, and the spacetime disc the Brightshore Hegemon
had given him. That was it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. I think I have
a decent shot at this.” The Ninedust Sectlord stared intently off
into the distance. “Once it gets a bit closer, I’ll make my
move.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning nodded
and watched off to the side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black vessel was
surrounded by the nine novessence arts, the Ripplewater secret art,
and the heartworld projection. All three combined were able to just
barely ablate the pressuring power of the azure light, allowing the
vessel to continue to advance at a speed of sixty-two speeds of
light. As for the beast leader, it continued to chase after them and
draw closer and closer at a hundred times the speed of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you shall
die,” the beast leader bellowed as it closed in. It truly was a
terrifyingly strong creature with stunningly fearsome illusions. The
Dreamdust Domain it had just summoned was a full level higher and
more profound that Ning’s novessence arts, and it was incredibly
strong in close combat. It wouldn’t be easy at all for them to rely
on their own power to survive this trip through Dreamdust Way. Most
would have to rely on Dao-seals or other such treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. The
distance between the two continued to narrow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the right
moment!” The Ninedust Sectlord’s eyes lit up as he stretched out
his right hand, a strange formation-diagram appearing in his palm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The
formation-diagram within his palm instantly flew out and expanded
dramatically, sweeping out towards the beast leader like the nets of
heaven. The beast leader bellowed furiously, but was still completely
enveloped by this enormous formation-diagram. The enormous
formation-diagram was round inside but square outside, and it was
composed of thousands of layers of strange formations that
continuously merged into each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The beast leader was
trapped within the formation. It let out continuous bellows as it
furiously assaulted the formation, causing the entire
formation-diagram to tremble and layers of formations to break apart,
but new layers were quickly born out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It can’t break
free.” The Ninedust Sectlord revealed a smug look. “If it wants
to break through with raw power, it has to be able to destroy 3500
layers of formations at one go! Otherwise, the formations will be
continuously regrown. Only when the energy within the formation is
used up will it be able to escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How long will the
formation-diagram last?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Probably for a short
while.” The Ninedust Sectlord hesitated slightly. “This is my
first time using it as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing this, Ning
immediately sent the black vessel fleeing at full speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The beast leader
trapped within the formation let out furious roars as the two
cultivators fled. The distance between them quickly began to grow
greater and greater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We should’ve
shaken him off by now.” Ning relaxed just slightly after flying for
more than two hours. They had been flying at a hundred times the
speed of light this entire time; there should be no way their foe
could catch up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust, you said
this was your first time using that formation-diagram?” Ning asked,
“What made you so confident in its power? You also told me not to
use my Dao-seals; didn’t the power come from a Dao-seal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, it came from a
very special formation-diagram treasure.” The Ninedust Sectlord
smiled as he waved his hand, producing a medallion above his palm
that looked like a circle within a square. The medallion was covered
with countless dense clusters of formations. “This
formation-diagram treasure was bestowed upon me by the ancestor. All
I need to do to fully charge it is to fill it with the energy of ten
million cubes of chaos jewels, which allows me to use it one time.
When I activate it, even Eternal Emperors will be trapped for quite
some time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes
immediately lit up when he heard this. “What a fine treasure! So
you can activate it repeatedly?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It could be used for
the low cost of just ten million cubes of chaos jewels? Sure, that
might sound like a lot, but the formation-diagrams it created could
be used to trap Eternal Emperors!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Hegemon would be
able to use it just relying on his own Immortal energy,” the
Ninedust Sectlord said. “Mine isn’t pure enough, so I have to
rely on chaos jewels to make up the difference. It’ll take three
days in order for those ten million cubes of chaos jewels to recharge
the treasure. During the Dawn War, this treasure was considered an
average one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
speechless. The Dawn War truly had been a terrifying one, and all the
treasures that came from that time were truly wondrous. Dreamdust Way
had been nothing more than an unremarkable relic-site during the Dawn
War, but the beasts that it produced, especially the three-eyed
leader which manifested that strange script, truly stunned and
bedazzled Ning. No wonder so many generations of Daolords had dared
to venture into this place to seek their fortunes, with even Eternal
Emperors delving deep within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That script…”
Ning had long ago fully memorized the strange character that had
manifested above the third eye of the beast leader. He began to turn
his attention to analyzing its mysteries.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The black
vessel continued to fly at high speed. Three days later, it finally
emerged from Dreamdust Way.

Chapter 6 - A Three Hundred Millenia Journey
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After emerging from
Dreamdust Way, it took them two more months of travel before they
reached the most important phase of their journey through the Terror
Starsea; the Starflow River.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What an impressive
sight.” Ji Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord stood at the prow of the
black vessel, staring off into the vast and nigh-endless Starflow
River. The place was filled with countless stars and planets of
varying sizes, with some being negligible and others being even
larger than the Solar Star of the Three Realms. All of the stars
emitted absolutely identical auras of golden light, making the entire
Starflow River look like an enormous world of flowing golden sand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was so vast that
they couldn’t see any end to it. Supposedly, there had once been a
major power who had been able to just barely make out the overall
shape of the Starflow River, and it looked like the flows of a river.
This was why it had been named the Starflow River.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Starflow River is
far larger than Dreamdust Way. In comparison, Dreamdust Way was
nothing more than a short hallway.” The Ninedust Sectlord sighed.
“We’ll be in there for three hundred millennia.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But it’ll be three
hundred fairly safe millennia,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we’re lucky.
Who knows, we might be able to ford the entire Starflow River with
ease.” The Ninedust Sectlord was filled with hope as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dreamdust Way was
filled with danger at every turn, whereas Starflow River was
comparatively much safer. The reason why the two viewed it as the
primary source of danger on this trip was because they’d spend
three hundred thousand years here. Even though it was ‘fairly
safe’, all sorts of bad things could happen over the course of
three hundred thousand years. If they were unlucky, they might
stumble upon some truly dangerous creatures or places, and there were
some places in Starflow River which were even more dangerous than
Dreamdust Way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, if they were
lucky it was also possible that they would avoid all danger and be
able to sail through the river with ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was guaranteed that
Dreamdust Way would have an element of danger to it. Starflow River,
however, was up to luck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” The
black vessel flew straight into the awesome Starflow River.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Starflow River was
filled with countless stars that emanated golden light. These
countless stars were all linked together and resonated with each
other, and their invisible power stretched out to cover all of
Starflow River. This power was far superior to the power that filled
Dreamdust Way. So long as this power was present, not even Ning’s
sword-arts would allow him to tear through dimensions and teleport
through it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Things proceeded more
smoothly than they anticipated. Although the two encountered a few
traces of ancient battle sites as they progressed through Starflow
River and ran into a bit of trouble, they didn’t face any true
danger at all. They didn’t even encounter anything capable of
forcing the Ninedust Sectlord to use the formation-diagram in his
palm. Just like that, nearly three hundred thousand years went past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Things have gone
very smoothly. I estimate that in just a few dozen millennia, we’ll
have traversed all of Starflow River.” The Ninedust Sectlord’s
face was covered with excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning felt
rather eager as well. He hadn’t exactly been wasting his time
during the past three hundred thousand years. He had spent a good
period of his time analyzing the mysteries held within the Dreamdust
character and then used those insights into creating illusory arts
for himself. The rest of the time, he spent on his Sword Dao!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, he had reached
the third stage in three of his five sword-intents: the Blood Drop
sword-intent, the Shadowless sword-intent, and the Yin-Yang
sword-intent. As for the Soleheart sword-intent and the Heavenbreaker
sword-intent, both of them were still lacking a bit. Clearly, to
break through to become a Daolord of the Third Step would be rather
difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for illusions? The
Dreamdust character was simply too profound. The Nine Chaos Seals had
guided Ning into understanding and training in the azureflower seal,
but the Dreamdust character was simply something of incredible power
which had been left behind from the Dawn War. It wasn’t an actual
legacy! Ning was only able to learn as much as he could from it, and
the power of his illusions increased several times over. Still,
amongst other Heartforce Cultivators at his level he was still rather
weak in this area! The difference, however, had been lessened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? Darknorth, take
a look.” The Ninedust Sectlord pointed off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning followed the
Ninedust Sectlord’s gaze, only to see signs of ruined buildings on
a distant planet. “Looks like traces from the Dawn War.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go take a
look,” the Ninedust Sectlord said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” By
now, the two were quite familiar with Starflow River. Ever since Ning
had learned that the Terror Starsea had been the battlefield of the
Dawn War, he had been able to divine how many of the ruins they
encountered had been created. For example, Dreamdust Way. Their
prediction was that it had been some sort of formation which had been
left behind from the Dawn War, meant to trap enemies and make them
fight at a severe disadvantage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be remembered
that Dreamdust Way had no one in control of it. The beast leader,
acting independently, was already able to summon a terrifying amount
of power from Dreamdust Way. If the person who had originally set it
up was still alive and in control of it… what a horrifying thought!
These two would probably have been almost instantly slain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, as soon as
the two of them saw the humanoid creature and the two Hegemon
corpses, they had realized that the Dawn War had been fought on a far
greater scale than the two of them could even imagine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The vessel flew
towards the planet in question. As they moved closer, they were able
to clearly see that there were indeed many shattered ruins on this
planet. Everything here was in terrible shape, with nothing more than
a few stone pillars and battered walls remaining.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My guess is that a
major power must have hidden within his estate here, relying on its
layers of barriers to stay alive. However, in the end even the estate
was smashed into smithereens,” the Ninedust Sectlord said. The
flying vessel landed on the planet, allowing Ning and the Ninedust
Sectlord to fly out and inspect the stone pillars.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s still a
bit of power left in this estate.” Ning looked at the pillar in
front of him. The towering pillar was thirty thousand meters tall,
and its top was covered with layers of blurry white light. Even
though countless years had gone by, the power of the pillar remained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It doesn’t seem as
though there are any treasures here.” The Ninedust Sectlord walked
around as he inspected the place. “Over the course of three hundred
thousand years, we’ve run into quite a few ruins here in Starflow
River but haven’t found so much as a single treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These ruins don’t
have much danger either. They were probably discovered and scoured
long ago,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Both Ning and
the Ninedust Sectlord simultaneously turned to stare off into the
distance. A single figure suddenly emerged from a distant,
half-shattered wall. The man had tousled hair, bare feet, and was
garbed in tattered yellow robes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gentlemen.” The
barefoot yellow-robed man smiled as he walked towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you a
cultivator, or…?” Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I belong to the
Starflow race. My name is Daolord Laya.” The yellow-robed man
smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Starflow race?”
The Ninedust Sectlord smiled. “I heard long ago that Starflow River
has a ‘Starflow’ race within it, but this is our first time
actually encountering a Starflow cultivator despite having spent
three hundred thousand years here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The yellow-robed man
laughed. “The Starflow race has many branches that are located deep
within Starflow River. Every branch is protected and hidden by
formations, making it difficult for outsiders to discover them. Only
when we go out adventuring do we interact with the outside world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both Ning and the
Ninedust Sectlord knew a good amount regarding the Starflow race.
Both Solesky’s map from the Dao Alliance as well as the map
bestowed by Patriarch Vulturas had detailed, thorough notes regarding
the Starflow race in the Starflow River. The Starflow race was a
branch of cultivators that had drifted to this place from the Great
Dark. They were scorned by the other six major powers, and so they
elected to make Starflow River their homeland. They found survival
difficult despite having been here for countless years, and they
usually referred to themselves as members of the Starflow Race due to
how long they had lived here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that quite a few cultivator groups had drifted in from the Great
Dark. Most were very weak and unable to compete against the local
powers. Only the Dark Kingdom possessed significant power, resulting
in them becoming one of six major powers. This was also the reason
why the Dao Alliance and the others were highly biased and negative
towards the Dark Kingdom, resulting in many battles. Weaker races
like the Starflow race were still discriminated against, but so long
as they played nice and didn’t try to infiltrate the Endless
Territories, the various local powers there were all fairly kind
towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starflow race
treated the Endless Territories in a very friendly manner. They lived
at the suffrage of the Dao Alliance; how would they dare to not be
friendly? Thus, encountering a member of the Starflow race in
Starflow River was a good thing, not a bad thing, as the Starflow
race member would often provide assistance or guidance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. This is our
very first time encountering a member of your race, and we’re about
to leave Starflow River.” Ning smiled. “If we ran into you
earlier, we might’ve had a smoother journey.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you are
planning to leave Starflow River?” Daolord Laya was curious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, we are leaving
soon.” The Ninedust Sectlord nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Starflow River holds
many treasure sites within it. Have either of you entered one of
them?” Daolord Laya asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Treasure sites?”
The Ninedust Sectlord shook his head. “Although we found a few
ruins, we didn’t find any treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Starflow River is
too vast. You’ve spent three hundred millennia here, but you’ve
only seen a tiny portion of Starflow River,” Daolord Laya said.
“Members of the Starflow race have been in this place for countless
eons, and our Daolords and even Eternal Emperors have continuously
explored and adventured through it. I’m certain that I know far
more about this place than the two of you.”

Chapter 7 - Thundersouth Palace
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the
Ninedust Sectlord both nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our race has
successive generations worth of experience regarding some of the
major ruins and relic sites within the Starflow River,” Daolord
Laya said. “I was preparing to head to one of them. I’ve already
reached the Verge, but actually succeeding in the Daomerge… I don’t
feel confident at all. That’s why I’ve come out to adventure and
to temper myself in the hopes that I can increase my Daomerge
chances.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daomerge…” The
Ninedust Sectlord sighed. “The Daomerge is far too difficult.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, far too
difficult.” Ning shook his head. Whenever the topic of the Daomerge
came up, any and every Daolord would feel a sense of pressure,
especially the powerful ones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although it was also
quite difficult to advance from the first step to the second, third,
and fourth steps, with a single mistake resulting in failure, this
process was comparatively far more secure! For example, once Ning
mastered his second-stage Omega Sword Dao he became a Daolord of the
Second Step. Once he mastered the third stage of his Omega Dao, he
would be able to become a Daolord of the Third Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daomerge, however,
was different! The Daomerge required one to perfectly integrate and
fuse all of the insights you had ever gained into your Dao. Success
or failure could only be truly determined during the Daomerge itself!
There was no one who could say with certainty that he or she would
‘definitely’ succeed in the Daomerge. For example, Ning only
needed to gain sufficient insights into the Dao as he advanced
through each step, and his chances were virtually assured in this
way. The Daomerge, however… he had no idea as to what his chances
of success would be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Windsource of
the Badlands Territory had in the end failed in his attempts to merge
the hundred channels of his Dao together. In the future, Ning would
undergo a Daomerge of his Sword Dao as well. Even someone as proud as
Ning would only claim that he was sure he could become a Daolord of
the Fourth Step. As for the Daomerge? Not even he felt confident in
his chances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The more
overwhelmingly powerful the Dao, the harder the Daomerge will be.”
The Ninedust Sectlord shook his head and sighed. “I don’t know if
I’ll be able to succeed in the future. If I chose a weaker Dao,
things would’ve been much simpler for me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you actually
willing to walk the path of a weak Dao?” Ning rebutted. In his
heart, however, Ning couldn’t help but sigh. His Omega Sword Dao
would be even more difficult! It must be understood that people like
Palace Lord Dawnstar and the Ninedust Sectlord had perfectly joined
multiple Supreme Daos together; if they gained eternity, they would
become Hegemons. Ning’s Omega Sword Dao was even more powerful than
their Daos. If he became an Eternal Emperor, he would be more
powerful than even the Hegemons, right?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning had never even
heard of anyone who was more powerful than the three Hegemons. It was
quite apparent how difficult it would be for him to reach such
heights! In the future, the difficulty of his Daomerge would vastly
outstrip that of Dawnstar or Ninedust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course not!
What’s the point? Even if I succeeded in the Daomerge for a weak
Dao, the only thing awaiting me would be a fate of being hunted and
killed by others.” The Ninedust Sectlord shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since the two of you
are within Starflow River, it’s obvious that you are both
extraordinary Daolords.” Daolord Laya nodded with praise. “I
agree with both of you. As cultivators, we should always strive to be
as strong as we can. Otherwise, even if we become weak Eternal
Emperors we still wouldn’t have the power needed to protect our
race.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clearly, all three of
them shared the same feelings. They had all chosen the path of
becoming extremely powerful Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Besides, the higher
a level of enlightenment you gain and the more profound your
understanding of the Dao is, the better your Daomerge chances will
be,” Daolord Laya said. “I’m preparing to head to an extremely
dangerous relic site known as Thundersouth Palace. In the Starflow
River area, it ranks amongst the top ten ancient ruins and supposedly
has legacies left behind by Hegemons. I wonder if the two of you
would willing to accompany me on that trip?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thundersouth Palace?
Hegemon legacies?” Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord exchanged a
glance. Both of them were intrigued. What was the entire point of
adventuring? It was to seek out precious sites and treasures, right?
A palace left behind by a Hegemon would definitely be filled with
extraordinary things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that really a
good idea?” The Ninedust Sectlord said, “This place is a place
which your race discovered over the course of countless years of
exploring; I’m sure that it is a secret which shouldn’t be
casually divulged to others. If you bring the two of us inside…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry about
that.” Daolord Laya laughed. “Amongst our race, the location and
existence of this place is indeed a tightly-held secret. I’m
already a Verge-level Daolord who is far stronger than many of my
peers, which is why the Emperors of our race informed me of the exact
location of Thundersouth Palace. However, our standard policy as a
race has always been to provide assistance whenever possible to
Daolords of the Endless Territories who venture into Starflow River.
All I need to request is that the two of you promise never to divulge
this secret.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If that’s the
case…” The Ninedust Sectlord nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then we’ll
accompany you on this journey,” Ning concurred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had heard long ago
that the members of the Starflow race had always been extremely
friendly towards cultivators of the Endless Territories. If Ning or
the Ninedust Sectlord really did become Eternal Emperors, they would
immediately gain extremely high statuses within the Endless
Territories. They would remember the ‘favor’ which the Starflow
race had shown them on this day, and they would naturally take care
of the Starflow race when appropriate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we’re going to
head there… then as always, let us all swear lifeblood oaths,”
the Ninedust Sectlord said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. We’ll
swear the lifeblood oath right now. That way, we can all work
together and challenge Thundersouth Palace with full confidence in
each other.” Daolord Laya agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that lifeblood
oaths had been sworn, both Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord felt more
confidence and faith in Daolord Laya. Even if he really had been
plotting against them, now that the lifeblood oath was sworn he would
immediately be devoured by it once he actually tried to take any
action.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, I’ve never
been so lucky before.” The Ninedust Sectlord laughed. “A random
stroke of luck is delivering treasures into my hand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was destiny that
led me to meet with the two of you, Darknorth, Ninedust.” Daolord
Laya smiled. “Very, very few of our Verge-level Daolords go out
adventuring to temper themselves. For the three of us to run into
each other really is an incredible bit of karmic luck, or as I put it
just now, ‘destiny’. In addition, our long-standing rules permit
me to take you to certain ruins. No need to thank me, gentlemen. At
most, I would ask you to remember this bit of kindness I’ve shown
you today. If the two of you are able to gain eternity in the future,
please help us out every so often.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Ninedust
Sectlord both nodded. Their chances of actually gaining eternity were
incredibly low; if they truly did succeed, then occasionally helping
out the Starflow race would be a minor matter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, the Ninedust
Sectlord, and Daolord Laya rode the black vessel as it flew through
Starflow River.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thundersouth Palace
isn’t that far away. Given how fast this vessel moves, we should
reach it in just over a century,” Daolord Laya said. “Thundersouth
Palace is quite dangerous, but I’m very familiar with it. So long
as the two of you follow me, I’m confident that we should be able
to stay safe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t
underestimate Darknorth and myself, brother Laya,” the Ninedust
Sectlord said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, you might end
up needing the two of us to save your behind, brother Laya.” Ning
grinned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? I look forward
to seeing your abilities,” Daolord Laya said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
suddenly asked, “Oh, right. Brother Laya, I heard that the Starflow
race migrated here from the Great Dark?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced at Daolord
Laya as well. Ning himself was also quite curious about this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Daolord Laya
nodded. “Quite a few people know this. Long, long ago our homeland,
a place known as the Peacock Lotus Realmverse, suffered an
unbelievably massive war. The entire Peacock Lotus Realmverse was
completely obliterated, and we were forced to flee for our lives. We
drifted for many years through the Great Dark, with the
first-generation Daolords of the Peacock Lotus Realmverse eventually
all dying. We spent nearly a million chaos cycles drifting through
the Great Dark, after all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As we moved through
the Great Dark, our Eternal Emperors held members of our race within
their estate-worlds, giving them a place to flourish and prosper. The
Eternal Emperors spent nearly a million chaos cycles drifting before
finally arriving at the Endless Territories. In the end, they chose
Starflow River as the place where our race would set down roots once
more. Virtually all of the members of my race are now born and live
in Starflow River, with only the original Eternal Emperors having
actually come from the Peacock Lotus Realmverse. As for us Daolords,
we know nothing of that place at all,” Daolord Laya explained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Ninedust
Sectlord were both rather stunned by this. Nearly a million chaos
cycles of drifting? The Great Dark truly was far, far too vast! No
wonder only Eternal Emperors would dare explore it. Such an
incredibly long journey was enough to bring despair to almost any
Daolord. However, even for Eternal Emperors a million chaos cycles of
solitude was a terrifying prospect. Only Eternal Emperors such as
Mirrorsnow who had long ago grown completely bored of the Endless
Territories after having explored most of it would elect to enter the
Great Dark and seek out excitement there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since we have left
our homeland, propagating and surviving has been quite difficult.”
Daolord Laya sighed. “The Endless Territories is under threat of
destruction by the Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels. Supposedly, in the
distant future even the Starflow River will be destroyed by it. When
that happens, our race shall be forced to continue our wandering.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Yin-Yang Samsara
Wheels?” Both Ning and Ninedust sighed. Indeed, in the distant
future it was almost guaranteed that all of the various organizations
within the Endless Territories would be forced to go off wandering.
But of course, if they didn’t succeed in their Daomerge then the
two of them would never live to witness that day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three continued to
relax and chat as they advanced through Starflow River. More than a
hundred years went past in the blink of an eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thundersouth Palace
is directly ahead. My race has already set up wards to hide
everything in the region. Once I connect to them, we’ll be able to
see Thundersouth Palace.” Daolord Laya stood at the prow of the
ship as he spoke to Ning and Ninedust.

Chapter 8 - The Thundersouth Guardian
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the
Ninedust Sectlord both let out impressed sighs. The Starflow race
truly was crafty; they had actually set up barrier wards to make it
impossible for others to locate Thundersouth Palace. However, the two
of them both understood this decision; any race or organization would
choose to hide such a valuable resource.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Laya stood at
the prow of the vessel. His Immortal energy flooded outwards,
condensing into one mysterious rune after another. Soon, a total of
nine runes had taken shape. They hung there in the void, emanating
waves of blurry white light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Open.” Daolord
Laya’s voice was cold and sharp. Whoosh! The nine ancient runes all
flew towards the void in front of them, and a series of ripples
appeared. A void door appeared in the center of the ripples, and
through the door one could clearly make out an enormous space palace
on the other side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, let us go in.
This void door won’t stay open for long,” Daolord Laya said
hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” The
three of them transformed into streaks of light that flew towards the
void door.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After passing through
the void door, the three were able to clearly see the enormous golden
palace which hung in the empty space before them. The golden palace
was extremely beautiful, and it was coverd with innumerable
sculptures and diagrams which made it look quite bewitching.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The palace had an an
aura of strength, power, and nobility. Above the front gates hung two
giant words - THUNDER SOUTH. These two words crackled with streaks of
electricity, and the calligraphy was filled with a lofty spirit. The
entire palace emanated an invisible aura of presence and might which
was strong enough to cause Ning’s heart to shudder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They hadn’t even
entered yet. Just by staring at it from afar, they already felt a
sense of danger. This was a clear warning which the previous master
of the Thundersouth Palace had left for future guests!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Laya smiled.
“No need to worry, gentlemen.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head.
“Just by looking at those two characters, I can tell that this
should have been a Hegemon’s palace. Even the weakest of traps left
behind by someone on that level would be enough to wipe me out a
million times over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So long as you avoid
being too greedy, you won’t encounter any mortal danger here,”
Daolord Laya said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too greedy?” Ning
and the Ninedust Sectlord exchanged a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you saying we
aren’t allowed to touch any of the treasures we see in there?”
Ninedust frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Laya explained,
“Before I left our racial headquarters, the Eternal Emperors told
me that there are two major dangers which would be awaiting me here.
They told me that if I wasn’t careful, I might die, but if I was
able to survive them then even if I did encounter a few other
problems, those problems definitely wouldn’t be life-threatening.
This is why I only know detailed information regarding the first two
dangers, as the Emperors did not speak of the later dangers in
detail. The main thing they said to me was that I would be fine, so
long as I didn’t get too greedy. I was puzzled by this as well; the
entire point of me coming to this place was to find valuable
treasures for myself. What would be the point if I couldn’t take
anything? But the Emperors simply said that I’d understand
everything once I actually entered.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So we’ll
understand everything once we enter?” Ning laughed. “Hah. Fine,
then. If we knew everything before going in, then it wouldn’t prove
to be much of a challenge or a tempering experience.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Ninedust
nodded as well. “Come, let us go inside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of them trusted
Daolord Laya completely… or to be precise, they trusted the
lifeblood oath all three had sworn. Since they were all bound by
oaths, there was no way for Daolord Laya to lie or deceive to them
regarding this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The palace gates were
enormous. The three stepped through the gates, and as they did Ning
couldn’t help but raise his head to look up once more at the two
words that hung above it, ‘THUNDER SOUTH’. He could vaguely sense
that it contained certain mysteries within it, but his path was that
of the Sword Dao and not that of the Dao of Lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous palace
held many rooms, hallways, and even gardens. It truly was graceful
and refined… but every single part of it was brimming with that
deep azure lightning. Countless tendrils of lightning crackled
everywhere, and they were actually quite beautiful to behold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After they stepped
through the gates, they stared somberly towards the front. All of
them could sense the power held within those flickers of lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That is Eternal
lightning,” Ning blurted out. Ning had encountered many different
types of Dao lightning in his quest to master the [Novessence
Thunder], but none of them gave him the sense of power and danger
which the lightning tendrils before him did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s actually
Eternal lightning within this palace?” The Ninedust Sectlord
blurted out, “Eternal lightning… I’ve never heard of it being
naturally birthed from the primordial chaos.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Supposedly, only an
Eternal Emperor who has reached incredible heights in the Dao of
Lightning is capable of creating a streak of Eternal lightning,”
Ning said seriously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes… and this is
the first great danger.” Daolord Laya said solemnly, “The
lightning fills virtually every inch of this palace, and it is both
sentient and intelligent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sentient and
intelligent?” Ning exclaimed with surprise, “Isn’t Eternal
lightning sentient to begin with?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just watch for
yourself.” Daolord Laya grinned. Just a heartbeat later, the
countless streams of lightning in front of them began to wriggle
about and gather together, transforming into an enormous lightning
humanoid. Its entire body was composed of electricity, and it had a
pair of deep azure eyes that stared down upon the three from their
lofty heights.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was Eternal
lightning, filled with endless vitality and life energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, milord
Guardian,” Daolord Laya said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master left me in
charge of protecting this palace,” the lightning guardian said
calmly. “I will strike you with three palms. If you juniors can
survive all three palms, you’ll be granted entry. If you feel
confident in your personal power, you can choose to accept my strikes
individually.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the palace. Both
Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord had their weapons at the ready.
Daolord Laya said hurriedly, “According to what the Emperors of my
race said, the lightning guardian is reinforced by the power of the
entire Thundersouth Palace and is incredibly powerful! Each of his
three palms is more powerful than the last. If you can’t take them,
come hide behind me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need for that.”
The Ninedust Sectlord hefted his longstaff.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s see just how
tough the lightning guardian is.” Ning had two Northbow swords at
the ready. He was a very proud man; how could he choose to hide
behind another?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lightning guardian
said coldly, “The first palm.” His right hand struck out like an
enormous fan, the lines on his fingertips easily visible as lightning
crackled around his palm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go first!”
The Ninedust Sectlord let out a loud roar as he struck out with his
longstaff, an illusion of waves appearing around it. BOOM! The
longstaff curved in an almost whip-like fashion as it collided
against the giant fan-like palm. An enormous explosion could be heard
as the lightning palm trembled slightly, then retracted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not all that
powerful,” the Ninedust Sectlord sent mentally to the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here comes the
second palm.” The lightning guardian’s voice remained cold and
flat as he struck out once more with his right arm. This time, it
transformed to become a mountain in size as it crashed down towards
the three of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, the Ninedust
Sectlord, and Daolord Laya simultaneously brandished their own
weapons. Ning used swords, the Ninedust Sectlord used his longstaff,
and Daolord Laya used a greataxe. All three sent their weapons
straight towards the lightning guardian’s enormous palm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two forces collided
with an enormous collision. The three of them had managed to endure
this blow head on, but their bodies couldn’t help but tremble from
the force of the collision. They quickly managed to stabilize
themselves. The Ninedust Sectlord’s face was ashen, while Daolord
Laya’s face had a solemn look on it. Only Ning was still fairly
relaxed, as his Hegemon armor was able to whittle away the power of
any blow until it had only 0.1% of its original force. In terms of
defensive prowess, Ning was more skilled than Ninedust and Laya to
begin with. Although his body trembled from the collision, the
shockwave was very little to him and caused his divine body little
harm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if it went up a
full level in power, it would be useless against me.” Ning felt
quite confident. The Hegemon armor truly was powerful. However, Ning
also understood that this was also partially because he himself had
become much stronger than before. When he had first entered the
Azureflower Estate, he had nearly been knocked unconscious by a
single blow. Back then, he was at a disadvantage even when battling
against the likes of Patriarch Clearwind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for now? Ning was
currently stronger than even Kongsan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An impressive
fellow. Fast and furious.” The Ninedust Sectlord let out a growl.
“Darknorth, use your secret arts.” As he spoke, waves of rippling
water began to emanate from his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Ning
nodded. Although he was able to take these hits head-on, the Ninedust
Sectlord didn’t have a suit of Hegemon armor, making it rather
tough for him. The nine novessence arts flew out of Ning’s body in
the form of nine energy dragons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ripplewater art and
the nine novessence arts merged together, spreading out throughout
the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lightning
guardian’s mouth crooked upwards slightly, almost as though he was
laughing. “Interesting. Your secret arts aren’t bad at all… but
I’ll use the power of the entire Thundersouth Palace in my third
strike. I hope you can survive it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! The
hallways, gardens, rooms, and surface of the entire palace began to
light up with runic script. The runes all seemed to flow and
congregate around the lightning guardian. “Get ready for the third
palm!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! The lightning
guardian’s palm struck out like the firmament of heaven itself,
enveloping the entire palace within it as he attacked the three.
There was nowhere to run or hide from this strike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can’t take it head
on. Hide behind me!” Daolord Laya barked mentally as he produced a
golden bone in his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I only have one
treasure left.” The Ninedust Sectlord immediately dodged behind
Daolord Laya. Clearly, he would’ve been forced to use his treasures
if he wanted to take this attack head on. If Daolord Laya was going
to use his, there was no point in Ninedust wasting one of his own
treasures out of sheer pride.

Chapter 9 - The Second Danger
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth!” As the
Ninedust Sectlord dodged behind Daolord Laya, he discovered to his
amazement that Ji Ning wasn’t doing the same. He knew very well
that Ning was roughly on the same level of power as him. If he didn’t
dare to take it head-on, how was it that Darknorth did? But there was
nothing he could do except worry; the final attack of the lightning
guardian was already descending upon them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The enormous hand
descended upon them like the firmament of heaven itself. This strike
contained the full force the lightning guardian was capable of
mustering, and it had been reinforced by the wards of the palace
itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rings of white light
appeared around Daolord Laya and the Ninedust Sectlord, allowing them
to endure and withstand the strike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The lightning
guardian withdrew his palm, then glanced at the three and smiled. “I
didn’t expect that one of you would be able to endure my palm
through his own power. It seems you have quite an impressive
protective divine ability, young fellow. One more trial awaits you,
set down by my master. I hope you all survive it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lightning guardian
took a single step, then dispersed into countless streaks of
lightning that quickly scattered in each direction. No more was the
path in front of them blocked off by any lightning at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impressive,
Darknorth. You actually took it head-on.” The Ninedust Sectlord
walked over to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to my
racial records, only the most supreme of Daolords can endure such a
blow head-on. I’m impressed, Darknorth.” Daolord Laya truly was
amazed. The power of that strike was far beyond what ordinary Eternal
Emperors were capable of; that was a full-power strike from the
lightning guardian which was reinforced by the palace’s formations!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh, I simply have a
decent protective divine ability. My entire body is still numb from
that strike, though. My legs are about to give out underneath me.”
Ning’s legs really were wobbling, but he laughed. “If that
lightning giant launched multiple attacks against me, I wouldn’t
have been able to endure it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just like that, I
used up a boneseal which one of our Emperor’s personally made for
me.” Daolord Laya laughed, “If there were multiple attacks, no
number of boneseals would’ve been able to protect me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but sigh in amazement as well. His divine body was close to but not
quite on par with a low-grade Eternal weapon. He had mainly relied on
his Hegemon armor to endure this hit. Alas, the treasures he needed
to upgrade his protective divine ability were simply too rare and
hard to find. He did acquire Dragonfish Ki, but he needed to find the
rest as well. He needed to upgrade his divine body to make it on par
with a middle-grade Eternal treasure as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Ninedust, and
Daolord Laya followed the winding hallways of the palace. The
Thundersouth Palace was extremely large and quite beautiful. Every so
often, they would see a few flickers of Eternal lightning swimming
about them, but those lightning streaks all kept a long distance away
from them. Clearly, now that they had survived the first trial the
Eternal lightning would no longer cause any trouble for them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Halt!” Daolord
Laya suddenly called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning and
Ninedust came to a halt. In front of them was a lake that emanated an
aura of freezing energy, and a faint layer of cold mist could be seen
on its surface. There was a crooked wooden bridge which passed
through the entire lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The wooden bridge up
ahead is the second dangerous trial which we will face in
Thundersouth Palace, and the last one which could be life-threatening
to us,” Daolord Laya said somberly. “This one is even more
dangerous than the first one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“More dangerous?”
Ning and Ninedust were both startled. Ninedust couldn’t help but
frown. “You were already forced to use up an Emperor’s boneseal
to survive the first one. Now you are telling me that this one is
worse?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Daolord Laya
said somberly, “Quite a few of the more powerful Daolords of my
race have visited Thundersouth Palace in their time. Each was given a
single boneseal, but nearly half still ended up perishing here! It
must be understood that there are two dangerous areas here. If you
use up the boneseal during the first danger, you’d definitely
survive it… and so the ones who didn’t, all perished here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust felt
their hearts clench. Nearly half of the Daolords had perished here?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still, I’m
confident in my chances.” Daolord Laya smiled. “The Emperor said
that I have better than a 70% chance of surviving. Don’t worry at
all, gentlemen. I’ll go up there and give the wooden bridge a try.
If I really am so unlucky as to die here, then you can simply leave.
The invisibility formation my race set up is only directed outwards,
not inwards.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Laya, what
is so dangerous about the wooden bridge?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once you step onto
the wooden bridge, you’ll be trapped within an illusory realm,”
Daolord Laya said somberly. “A very terrifying one! If you allow
yourself to be led astray and accidentally fall into the waters of
the lake, then you’ll die without question.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m planning to
use the illusions here to temper my Dao-heart. My chances of making
it are extremely high; if I can strengthen my Dao-heart, it’ll be
of help to me in my Daomerge in the future.” Daolord Laya had a
resolute look in his eyes. He was preparing for the Daomerge. No
matter what, he was determined to embark on this path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Illusions?”
Ninedust blinked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A terrifying
illusory realm?” Ning stared blankly at Daolord Laya. “And your
chances of surviving it are roughly 70%?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…What’s with the
strange looks on your faces?” Daolord Laya immediately said, “The
Emperor felt that my chances were high, but there’s still a chance
that I might fail. I can’t give up a chance like this to temper my
Dao-heart. Don’t worry, so long as I can make it across safely,
I’ll come back and help you across as well. Otherwise, the two of
you would fall into the lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust
blinked again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You hear that,
Darknorth? The second trial consists of illusions.” Ninedust
laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And to think that I
was feeling really nervous just now. Jeeze.” Ning shook his head
and chuckled as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s with the
two of you?” Daolord Laya was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
began to roar with laughter. “Brother Lay, let me give you a formal
introduction of our friend Daolord Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A formal
introduction? An introduction of what?” Daolord Laya still didn’t
understand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth is
exceedingly skilled in sword-arts, but you know that already. He also
trains as a Heartforce Cultivator and is an extremely accomplished
one.” The Ninedust Sectlord said smugly, “Just now, you were
talking about helping a powerful Heartforce Cultivator survive deadly
illusions… hah! I laughed so hard my teeth nearly fell out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Laya stared
blankly. “A Heartforce Cultivator?” Heartforce Cultivators were
pitifully rare; the Brightshore Kingdom was one of the six great
powers of the Endless Territories, but it still had less than ten of
them, and this was after the almighty Brightshore Hegemon had scoured
the Endless Territories for talented World-level experts! The
Starflow race naturally had even fewer Heartforce Cultivators. They
had more than ten powerful Verge-level Daolords in this era, but not
a single Heartforce Cultivator!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Laya…”
Ning chuckled as well. With a thought, he summoned his heartworld
projection and brought it down upon the area around them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A heartworld
projection? Darknorth, you…” Moments later, Daolord Laya started
to laugh as well. “Haha, I really made a fool of myself just now,
didn’t I? Illusions really are nothing to brother Darknorth. Even
if the master of the Thundersouth Palace personally cast his
illusions over him, I suspect he still wouldn’t be phased in the
slightest.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. This
really was the case. Only someone incredibly skilled in illusions
would have a chance at affecting him; for example, an Eternal Emperor
who was also a Heartforce Cultivator would be able to trap Ning
within illusions. As for Hegemons who occasionally trained in
illusions? Those illusions wouldn’t be able to affect powerful
Daolords who were Heartforce Cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, Hegemons
wouldn’t need to go to that trouble. The almighty Brightshore
Hegemon, for example, could use his mastery over spacetime to wipe
out Ning with ease. But if he was to use illusions instead…
Heartforce Cultivators really would have very little to fear. Ning’s
best guess was that the master of Thundersouth Palace had been
primarily focused on the Dao of Lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, I do have
one request,” Daolord Laya said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If there’s
anything you need, just let me know,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to borrow
this opportunity to temper my Dao-heart. Supposedly, the illusions
are very effective for that,” Daolord Laya said. “If I’m in any
danger, please lend me a hand and ensure that I don’t fall into the
lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Easily done.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Laya nodded
back at him, then walked onto the wooden bridge. He came to an
immediate halt after doing so, staying there for a full hour without
moving at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust both
waited patiently. Roughly one hour later, Daolord Laya’s gaze
turned clear. A serious expression on his face, he began to carefully
advance. However, without even realizing it he began to walk towards
the edges of the wooden bridge. He clearly was walking askew, but he
himself didn’t realize it. He walked closer and closer towards the
lake and its white frozen mist, which seemed ready to reach out and
swallow him alive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful.” Ning
reached out with his arm, expanding it by dozens of meters. As his
arm reached through the illusions, they immediately began to surge
through it and begin to attempt to ensorcere his mind. But it was
like the waters of a well splashing against the well’s stones; they
had no effect at all. Ning was completely unmoved, and so he latched
onto Daolord Laya by the back, then pulled him straight out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Laya was
stunned as he was pulled out of the wood bridge. “What’s going
on?” He was stunned and couldn’t believe it. He turned to look at
Ning. “My mind was clear. I had completely shaken off the effects
of the illusions.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shaken off? If it
wasn’t for Darknorth, you would’ve walked straight into the lake
by now,” the Ninedust Sectlord snickered.
</P>

Chapter 10 - Ji Ning’s Illusions
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is this
possible? I could clearly sense that I was quite awake. I wasn’t…”
Daolord Laya’s voice slowly trailed off. Moments later, he let out
a low sigh. “What a terrifying illusion. It actually was able to
seep into my soul without me even realizing it. The things that I
thought I saw were actually all illusory. My Dao-heart still isn’t
strong enough, allowing my soul and truesoul to be infiltrated
without me knowing it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, it seems you
are fairly weak. Let me show you what I have up my sleeves.” The
Ninedust Sectlord laughed as he walked towards the floating wooden
bridge. After taking two steps, he turned to look at Ji Ning.
“Darknorth, if I also end up walking astray you need to grab me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But of course, I’m
convinced that my Dao-heart will render me invulnerable.” Ninedust
briskly walked forwards and stepped onto the floating wooden bridge.
As soon as he did so, he too suddenly came to a halt and stopped
moving.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He stood there for over
two hours without moving. “Hmph.” A hint of a smile appeared on
the Ninedust Sectlord’s face. “What a formidable illusion.
However, in the end I was able to break it.” He began to walk
forwards as well, but he actually began to turn and move straight
towards the waters of the lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was badly startled
by his sudden movements. Fortunately, Ning had kept a close eye on
him. Ning immediately stretched his arm out by dozens of meters,
latching onto the Ninedust Sectlord’s silver robes and grabbed him
back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why the hell did you
grab me? I was perfectly fine.” The Ninedust Sectlord looked at
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Calm down and think
it over again.” Ning didn’t even try to explain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m sure I
didn’t…” The Ninedust Sectlord’s voice trailed off as well.
Clearly, he was just now slowly shaking off the effects of the
illusion. Moments later, an astonished look appeared on his face.
“That was absolutely terrifying. I’ve never encountered an
illusion like that. I was trapped by the illusion, and I really did
shake its effects off, but… it continued to slowly seep into my
soul and truesoul, affecting both.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The nearby
Daolord Laya concurred, “This is different from ordinary illusions.
It looks dangerous, but all that is just for the sake of allowing it
to disguise its soul-seeping abilities.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. You were able to
last for an hour before having your soul infiltrated.” Ning then
looked towards the Ninedust Sectlord. “Ninedust, you lasted for two
hours before being infiltrated. It seems your Dao-heart is slightly
tougher than brother Laya’s.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But still not strong
enough.” The Ninedust Sectlord shook his head. “I nearly died.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I nearly died as
well.” Laya shivered with fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, I want to
try it again. The way in which this illusion seeps into the soul and
truesoul truly is an excellent way for one to temper one’s
Dao-heart,” the Ninedust Sectlord said immediately. “I can’t
give up a chance like this. Help keep an eye on me and make sure I
don’t walk into the lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wish to give it a
try as well, Darknorth. Give me a hand.” Daolord Laya also wanted
to rely on this opportunity to temper his Dao-heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had a Heartforce
Cultivator watching over them. What had they to fear? And so, the two
of them both stepped onto the wooden bridge… and once again they
eventually began to walk towards the water of the lake like idiots.
In the end, Ning had to drag them back again and again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This illusion really
is something special.” Ning himself walked onto the bridge, then
sat down in the lotus position and allowed the illusions to invade
his soul as he began to analyze them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His heartforce was
maintained and nurtured by the power of his absolutely enormous
heartworld, one which was comparable to an entire territory in size.
There was simply no way an illusion on this level could shake such
powerful heartforce, giving Ning the opportunity to closely study
from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the past three
hundred millennia within the Starflow River area, Ning had often
spent time analyzing Daolord Featherdress’ [Dreamworld] technique
while researching the Dreamdust runes he had encountered in Dreamdust
Way. He was still fairly weak in the art of illusions compared to
other Heartforce Cultivators at the same level of power, but he could
still be considered a grandmaster in this area when compared to
others. The illusory power of this wooden bridge was actually close
to that of the [Dreamworld] technique, but of course it was far from
being a match for the Dreamdust runes. The Dreamdust runes were
comparable to Ning’s azureflower seal in profundity, and the
illusions of this wooden bridge were far from being a match for it,
making it easier for Ning to analyze and study it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With but a thought,
Ning caused time to accelerate a hundred times faster than normal in
the area around him. Given his current level of power, it was easy
for him to use his heartworld projection to accelerate time around
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, many powerful
Daolords were capable of this, including the likes of Daolord
Solesky. Even a number of Immortals and Fiendgods in the Three Realms
were capable of this; for example, the ‘Bridge of Despair’ in the
Underworld Kingdom had this function. However, causing time to
accelerate a hundred times faster than normal for himself was
extremely difficult, simply because he was extremely powerful.
Generally speaking, only a powerful Daolord could accelerate time by
that much.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time continued to flow
on. After spending more than thirty years, the Ninedust Sectlord
finally managed to completely traverse the wooden bridge. Daolord
Laya actually took eight hundred years before accomplishing the same.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I thought that we
had already spent quite some time there. Who would’ve thought that
Darknorth would spend even more time than us?” The Ninedust
Sectlord stood at the other side of the bridge, waiting helplessly as
he looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s just keep
waiting,” Daolord Laya laughed. The reason why Ning was staying at
the bridge for so long was because he was analyzing and researching
its various illusions. It must be remembered that Ning had rescued
Ninedust and Laya on multiple occasions already, and so the two of
them now waited for him without complaint. In truth, for Daolords
even a wait of ten thousand years was nothing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After nine thousand
years had gone past, Ning finally rose to stand up on the bridge once
more. “Interesting.” Ning revealed a smile. “The [Dreamworld],
the Dreamdust runes, and the illusions of this bridge… in the end,
it was the illusions of the bridge that helped me out the most.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Dreamworld] really
didn’t suit him very well at all, as it was primarily tailored for
Daolord Featherdress’ rather soft and insidious approach. The
Dreamdust runes were simply too profound, almost unfathomably so. The
bridge illusions were close to the [Dreamworld] illusions in power,
but had been created by the master of this palace, the Thundersouth
Hegemon. Although the Thundersouth Hegemon’s strongest Dao lay in
thunder and he wasn’t particularly skilled in illusions, he was
still close to Daolord Featherdress in ability. More importantly, his
style was closer to Ning’s own style.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To use a powerful
illusion to attract the enemy’s attention while catching them
offguard and infiltrating their souls… and to lead them astray just
as they are feeling confident about having defeated the illusions.
What a nasty technique.” Ning laughed. “My own illusions have
finally started to take shape, thanks to learning some of the tricks
of the wooden bridge.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since my illusionary
arts have gradually taken form in the Starflow Realm, then let them
be called… the [Dreamstar] arts.” Ning was quite pleased. Now
that he had developed his [Dreamstar] illusions, they would be of
great use to him in battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Heartforce
Eradicator] was simply too brutish; either the opponent resisted it
or died outright! If the opponent resisted it and was able to
maintain mental clarity against it, the [Heartforce Eradicator] would
have no effect at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Dreamstar] art,
however, was able to have a constant impact on the enemy in battle.
So long as the enemy was slowed down or distracted even slightly,
Ning would have the chance to gain victory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Dreamstar]
still needs further perfecting. If I can learn a bit more from the
Dreamdust runes, I might become a figure like Daolord Featherdress,
capable of using heartforce abilities to become the most powerful
Daolord of my generation.” Ning knew that he was still far off from
this goal; his technique was weaker than even the [Dreamworld]
technique, to say nothing of Daolord Featherdress’ most powerful
technique, the [Featherdress Soulthrall Song].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, you
finally stood up.” The Ninedust Sectlord called out to him from the
far end of the bridge, “Hurry up. We wanted to go exploring this
place years ago, since we know that there’s no more danger inside.
The only thing waiting for us is fortune and treasure, but we decided
to wait for you instead. Now that’s brotherhood for you, eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sure, I guess.”
Ning strode towards them atop the wooden bridge. “But I saved you
and grabbed you back from the brink of death more than ten thousand
times. Now that’s real brotherhood, am I right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yeah, but did you
have to do it in a way where you kept on grabbing me by the neck?”
the Ninedust Sectlord groused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You sure are picky
about how you want your life to be saved,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Daolord Laya
watched as Ning and Ninedust bickered and jested. He knew that his
relationship with Ning hadn’t reached such a level yet; the latter
two had experienced multiple life-and-death experiences, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The group departed the
wooden bridge area. “Based on my race’s records, there shouldn’t
be much danger left in the following area,” Daolord Laya said.
“However, that’s only assuming we aren’t greedy, whatever that
means.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Suddenly, the
tendrils of Eternal lightning off in the distance all began to gather
together off in the distance. Soon, an enormous lightning giant was
standing in front of them once more. The lightning guardian stared at
them, then revealed a smile. “I didn’t expect there would be a
Heartforce Cultivator in your ranks. Excellent. Your name is
Darknorth, yes?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth greets
you, milord Guardian,” Ning said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You were able to
take my third strike head-on, and the illusions were unable to affect
you as well. Mm. You are permitted to choose any one treasure from
the Thundersouth Palace. Remember, you are only allowed to take one.
As for the two of you, you aren’t’allowed to take any treasures
at all,” the lightning guardian said. “Remember, don’t be
greedy. Greed leads to death!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised his
eyebrows. So this was what ‘don’t be greedy’ meant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kid, before my
master went off to take part in the great war, he left four of these
palaces behind scattered throughout the Terror Starsea. If you can
pass the trials of all four, a truly large fortune will await you.”
The lightning guardian smiled mysteriously, then dissipated into
countless streaks of Eternal lightning that fled off into every
direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned, not
knowing whether to laugh or to cry. The four palaces were scattered
throughout the Terror Starsea? Perhaps during the Dawn War, the
Terror Starsea wasn’t very dangerous yet, but it was now a place
where even Hegemons wouldn’t dare tread. How could he possibly go
out and search for the other three palaces?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are actually
only allowed to choose one treasure? The two of us aren’t allowed
to choose any?” The Ninedust Sectlord glared at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha! Remember how
you won some treasures in that cave, but I ended up with nothing at
all?” Ning smirked. The Ancient ancestor had left nothing for him
at all. “What comes around, goes around. This time, it’s your
turn to leave empty-handed.”

Chapter 11 - The Stone Cencer Of Reunion
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust chatted with
Ji Ning as the two walked, while Daolord Laya just stared at Ning
with a rather complex look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it, Daolord
Laya?” Ning suddenly became aware of Laya’s stares.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth,
you probably do not yet understand what being given a chance to take
at treasure away from Thundersouth Palace represents.” Daolord Laya
hesitated a moment, a complex look on his face. “The Starflow race
cares deeply about one particular treasure inside this place. If you
were able to bring it out and then gift it to our race, we would be
willing to pay you an enormous price for it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Starflow race
would like to trade with me for it?” Ning was stunned. “Has no
member of the Starflow Daolords been able to take any treasures away
with them when they left?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There has.”
Daolord Laya nodded. “Just one! Receiving the approval of the
Eternal lightning is incredibly difficult. There were others in our
history who were able to endure the three blows and also endure the
illusions, but they still were not acknowledged.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did Ning
understood that gaining the lightning giant’s approval was no
simple task.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only a single member
of our race was allowed to take a treasure away with him, and he
chose a different one,” Daolord Laya said. “My race desperately
desires a chance to acquire that particular treasure. If you are
willing to garner it and trade it with us… don’t worry. I promise
our race will pay almost any price. My avatar is in our headquarters
right now, and I can complete the negotiations for you before you
choose it and bring it out. You can choose where the trade will be
transacted! Even if you wish to carry it out in the Endless
Territories, we can make it happen.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was intrigued. It
really did seem as though the Starflow race was in desperate desire
of that treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What treasure is
it?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Stone Censer of
Reunion,” Daolord Laya said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An incense burner?”
Ning was rather puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be the
legendary…” A stunned look was on the Ninedust Sectlord’s face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at the look
on Ninedust’s face, then looked at the eager expression on Daolord
Laya’s. He instantly started to grow curious about this Stone
Censer of Reunion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me go take a
look first. Before doing so… brother Laya, please do not tell your
race about the fact that I have a chance to select a treasure.”
Ning said calmy, “Once you do, it’s possible that one of your
Eternal Emperors would suddenly charge to this place and lie in wait
outside. That would be troublesome.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry.”
Daolord Laya nodded repeatedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning decided
to first take a look and see just what made this Stone Censer of
Reunion so special. If it was also extremely important to him, then
he would probably immediately leave this place with it in tow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It would take time for
the Starflow race to travel here. There was no way to use spatial
teleportation within the Starflow River; even Ning’s ability to
transcend dimensions was unable to pierce through the local region,
thanks to the omnipresent power of the Starflow River. It would take
quite some time for any member of the Starflow race’s Eternal
Emperors to get here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three of them
quickly arrived at a beautiful, crystalline pavilion. The walls of
the pavilion were like white jade and semi-translucent, allowing them
to be able to see through to the insides.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How beautiful.”
The three of them walked shoulder-to-shoulder through the pavilion.
There were five prayer mats located on the ground, with a palm-sized
incense burner located at the very center of the pavilion. The
incense burner was both white and black, and it faintly emanated an
aura of white smoke that was visible to the naked eye. It wafted out
to an area of roughly nine meters that perfectly covered the five
prayer mats.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were also a
number of paintings hanging from the walls and unfurled on the
tables. Other treasures were on the tables as well. There was a
bracelet that was engraved with some sort of bird carving, a pair of
scissors that gleamed with black light, a pearl the emanated a
freezing aura, and more. In total, there were twelve treasures on the
dais.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So these paintings
were made by the master of this palace?” Ning raised his head to
look at the paintings. All of them were in the same style, and they
naturally contained many of the mysteries of the Dao, primarily of
the Dao of Lightning. And yet, they actually contained some elements
of the Dao of the Sword as well. However, considering that Ning was
the master of the Omega Sword Dao, he viewed this person’s Sword
Dao as being rather ordinary, perhaps on par with Emperor
Mirrorsnow’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was also the Dao
of Illusions, and the Dao of Painting infused into each artwork…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quite a few
treasures here.” Ning’s attention had been focused on the incense
burner in the center as soon as he had come in, but he was in no rush
to inspect it. Instead, he first looked at the other twelve treasures
on the table.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An umbrella?” A
strange golden metal umbrella lay in front of him. The tip of the
umbrella was incredibly sharp. Ning reached out to touch it, filling
it with his godsense to learn some of its secrets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This magic treasure was
known as the Golden Ambersky Umbrella. It could be used to attack,
but when the umbrella was opened it could also serve as a defensive
treasure. It also contained a world unto itself that would be
unleashed once the umbrella was opened, making it a domain-type
treasure as well. The Ambersky World would manifest in the
surrounding area, suppressing the foe. The power of the Ambersky
World alone was on par with Ning’s nine novessence arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It could be used for
attack, defense, and suppression… and in suppression alone it was
comparable to the nine novessence arts. It must be remembered that
Ning was only able to master those nine arts due to a confluence of
lucky factors, and in the end had succeeded only because he had
learned an incredibly profound alchemy technique! And of course,
given his Omega Sword Dao, once he reached the third step as a
Daolord he would be able to unleash even greater power when using
those nine novessence arts to execute his sword-arts. He would reach
a level comparable to Daolord Allgod at that time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Despite that… the
value of the Golden Ambersky Umbrella was truly unfathomable. Ning
was stunned by its worth. The twelve treasures of the Hegemon truly
were extraordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And what’s this?”
Ning reached out to touch the bracelet engraved with the carving of a
flying beast. This was the Sparrow Formation Bracelet. It could be
filled with Hegemon-level energy or chaos jewels, then activated to
unleash a mighty Sparrow Formation that could trap foes. Hegemons
might be able to burst through the formation through raw force, but
any weaker foe would be trapped until the power of the formation was
depleted. Ning’s eyes lit up. “This is quite similar to the
formation-diagram Ninedust holds in the palm of his hands. It’s
actually a multiple-usage formation treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Treasures like these
were incredibly valuable. Even if you encountered the eight lords of
the Sacred Cities or the likes of Patriarch Vulturas, you could use
this treasure to trap them for a brief period of time, which you
could then use to flee! Thus, treasures like this would virtually
never be found for sale on the open market. Eternal Emperors
cherished them very highly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only Hegemons would be
willing to bequeath them to later generations. They truly were of
incalculable value. “A fine treasure.” Ning was deeply intrigued,
but he then looked at the next treasure, a black disc that glimmered
with a spot of light that roved inside of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single treasure
Ning saw interested him greatly. These treasures were of limited use
to Hegemons, but incredibly valuable to most Eternal Emperors. As for
Daolords? They were simply unimaginable. For now, Ning was still the
most intrigued by the Sparrow Formation Bracelet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now, let me take a
look at the Stone Censer of Reunion.” Ning turned his head to look
at the palm-sized incense burner located at the very center of the
room. He walked over, then casually sat down on one of the prayer
mats. Once he did, he sensed a surge of icy energy emanate from the
prayer mats and into his entire body, causing his soul to calm down
significantly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wasn’t too
impressed by the effects of the prayer mat, as there were quite a few
treasures with similar functions. But when the scent of the incense
coming from the stone censer wafted into his nose…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire world turned
silent. Ning’s mind and soul emptied out in an almost prajna-like
state of epiphany, and many of his thoughts and questions pertaining
to the Dao of the Sword quickly began to flash through his mind. More
and more visualizations came to mind as he saw through one bottleneck
after another…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After an undeterminable
period of time, Ning opened his eyes. Only then did he realize that
he had sat here for two days and a full night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I actually was able
to fully master the third stage of the Soleheart sword-intent.”
Ning was shocked. “I’ve almost even finished mastering the new
Heavenbreaker sword-intent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had spent three
hundred thousand years drifting through the Starflow Realm. His
Yin-Yang sword-intent, his Blood Drop sword-intent, and his
Shadowless sword-intent had all broken through to the third stage.
Now, after just sitting down for two days and a night, he had gained
a terrifying number of new insights and breakthroughs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is actually a
meditation-type treasure?” Ning stared at the palm-sized incense
burner in disbelief. “Although the state it allows you to delve
into isn’t as incredible as the true prajna-state of epiphany, it’s
fairly close. This treasure would allow me to enter a state of
epiphany at all times?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To cultivators, what
mattered the most? Treasures were secondary; insight into the Dao was
what truly mattered!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a treasure
meant for meditating on the Dao. It was truly pricess. He’d never
even heard of one of these things being available for sale. The only
reason the Thundersouth Hegemon had left it behind was because he
wasn’t sure if he would survive the Dawn War, and so he had left
this treasure behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninedust Sectlord
and Daolord Laya had been in no rush to sit down. They had instead
simply watched Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Laya said quite
urgently, “Brother Darknorth, are you willing to choose this
incense burner and trade it to the Starflow race?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, if you
are willing to trade it to us Ancient cultivators, we would similarly
be willing to pay an incredible price for it,” the Ninedust
Sectlord said.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 12 - Daomerge
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Laya and the
Ninedust Sectlord both looked at Ji Ning. Ning just continued to sit
there, but he reached out with his right hand to gently stroke the
stone incense burner in front of him. This censer truly was quite
odd; it had a white half and a black half, almost as though two
different incense burners, one white and one black, had somehow been
merged together. The black side felt as cold as ice, while the white
side filled his palm with warmth. It was this strange union of these
two marvelous properties that produced that faint white fragrance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning filled his
finger with his Immortal energy, beginning the process of binding the
Stone Censer of Reunion to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So that’s how it
is.” Ning now understood. The Stone Censer of Reunion was able to
produce a fragrant scent that would cause cultivators around it to
enter a state of constant epiphany. However, the fragrance would
eventually be used up… but so long as you could continue to pour
more Immortal energy into it, more of the fragrance would continue to
be generated. In addition, the amount of Immortal energy it consumed
was fairly low. However, the amount of fragrance it produced was only
enough for a single cultivator to constantly use.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder my two
days of cultivation caused the surrounding mist to shrink from nine
meters to merely six meters.” Ning couldn’t help but sigh. This
was merely the fragrance which was remaining and unused that was
stored within the stone censer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, are you
sure that you will choose this censer?” the Ninedust Sectlord
asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course I’m
certain.” Ning nodded. “A Dao-cultivating treasure like this is
incredibly rare and unquestionably priceless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth…” the
nearby Daolord Laya looked anxiously at Ning. “Are you willing to
trade it to my Starflow race? The Ancient cultivators have extremely
deep roots and won’t care that much about the Stone Censer of
Reunion, and so the price that we are willing to pay will definitely
exceed that of the Ancient cultivators.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You haven’t even
offered a price, but you are already claiming that your race will be
able to offer more than mine?” The Ninedust Sectlord smirked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gentlemen.” Ning
shook his head. “For now, I have no intention of trading this
away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust and Laya were
both startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is extremely
important to me as well. When the day comes that it is of no further
use to me, I might be willing to trade it,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daomerge was
incredibly difficult. The likes of Bertulu, Daolord Skyaxe, Ninedust,
and Palace Lord Dawnstar had joined multiple Supreme Daos together;
if they ever succeeded in the Daomerge, they would become Hegemons!
However, Hegemons were incredibly rare. Ever since the Dawn War ended
in the Terror Starsea, the Endless Territories had only had three
Hegemons; no more, no less.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning and his
Omega Sword Dao? It would be even more difficult for him! If he
succeeded in his Daomerge, he would probably be even more powerful
than a Hegemon… but were there any Eternal Emperors that were above
the Hegemon level of power?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus far, at least,
Ning had never discovered such a thing! In the alternate universe he
had been in, the Hegemons were still the most powerful figures. Even
the leader of the Church of Annihilation in that universe had once
been inferior to the Paragon of Pills. It was only thanks to the
enormous gains and good luck he had reaped in the Genesis Lands that
he had skyrocketed in power to become the most powerful figure in
that universe. However, the ‘Dao’ this superlative lord of the
church had used to complete his Daomerge and gain eternity for
himself was clearly not that powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus far, Ning had
already discovered the corpses of several Hegemons. He had never,
however, discovered anyone above the Hegemon level!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning fully understood
that if he wished to become an Eternal Emperor who was superior to
even Hegemons, his path would be an incredibly difficult one. To
complete the Daomerge with his Omega Sword Dao was virtually
impossible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the past, I had
no faith at all in my abilities to complete the Daomerge. In fact, I
wouldn’t even have dared claim that I felt I had even the slightest
chance.” Ning stared at the stone censer in his hand. “But now
that I have this Dao-cultivating treasure, my chances of completing
the Daomerge have been increased significantly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Northbow swords
were very important to him, but the Stone Censer of Reunion… it was
even more important!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the empty
crystalline pavilion. The three Daolords all had many thoughts in
their minds. Ning was filled with excitement, while Daolord Laya and
the Ninedust Sectlord were filled with both regret and envy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedust. Laya.”
Ning looked at the two of them. “Have you told anyone else that I
have acquired the Stone Censer of Reunion? If you have, my only
option would be to leave this place immediately.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have not.” The
Ninedust Sectlord shook his head. “I would never do such a thing.
Although the stone censer is important, it isn’t something that we
Ancient cultivators would stop at nothing to acquire. Our clan
already has other similar Dao-cultivating treasures. Unfortunately, I
won’t have a chance to use them for quite some time. When I become
a Daolord of the Fourth Step, I might be able to return to the clan
and borrow it for a chaos cycle at best.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For major clans and
organizations, Dao-cultivating treasures were at a level which could
be described as paramount to the entire organization. If an extremely
powerful Daolord was about to attempt the Daomerge, they might loan
it out for a single chaos cycle at most. Both supreme Daolords and
Eternal Emperors all had need of Dao-cultivating treasures, and so it
would be up to the highest-level members of an organization or a race
to decide who would be able to use it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The decision would
generally be based on how to improve the strength of a race as a
whole. However, these treasures would generally end up in the hands
of Eternal Emperors, because Eternal Emperors were also able to
slowly increase their level of strength. The Paragon of Pills herself
was an example of an Eternal Emperor who managed to slowly train to
the Hegemon level. In the alternate universe, another good example of
an Eternal Emperor who slowly became more powerful was Emperor
Maniseal; it was only after he became an Eternal Emperor that he
slowly reached ever-greater heights in the Dao of Seals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Daolords? Even
if they were given Dao-cultivating treasures, the vast majority of
them would still fail their Daomerge. In the end, Eternal Emperors
made up the foundation of any race or clan! The only ones who didn’t
really care about Dao-cultivating treasures were Hegemons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Laya?” Ninedust
glanced sideways at Daolord Laya. “The Starflow race is rather
lacking compared to mine. I don’t think they would necessarily have
a Dao-cultivating treasure. I’ll wager that they are in desperate
need of one. He might’ve already leaked the information. Hell, one
of their Eternal Emperors might be on the way right now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I did not.”
Daolord Laya immediately shook his head. “I’m not that type of
person, brother Darknorth. Don’t worry.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gentlemen.” Ning
looked at them. “Both of you know how tempting a target this
Dao-cultivating treasure makes me. Once word spreads, I’ll never
know another day of peace; in fact, I might very well die. Thus…
brother Ninedust and brother Laya, I’d like to ask the two of you
to swear lifeblood oaths that you will never divulge the fact that I
have a Dao-cultivating treasure in my possession. You can’t even
tell anyone about me having acquired a treasure from Thundersouth
Palace. I know that insisting on you two swearing this lifeblood oath
is a bit overbearing, but I hope you can understand the difficult
straits I am in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued
somberly, “What I can promise is that here in Thundersouth Palace,
the three of us will share the usage of this stone censer. Consider
this a form of compensation from me to the two of you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given how bluntly
you’ve put it, Darknorth, how can I refuse?” The Ninedust
Sectlord immediately swore the oath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This fortune belongs
to you, Darknorth. In the end, it was not meant to be for our
Starflow race.” Daolord Laya shook his head, then swore a lifeblood
oath as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, both of them
knew that if they didn’t swear the oath, Ning would probably
immediately depart from this place and might even hide this
Dao-cultivating treasure somewhere. No matter what, it would be
extremely difficult for the Starflow race to ever acquire it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you.” Ning
let out a sigh of relief, then came to a decision. “This stone
censer is now the most important treasure I possess, far more
important than even my Northbow swords! I cannot risk it being lost.
Since my main body could perish at any time while out adventuring…
mm. Once I get back to the Endless Territories, I’ll leave it with
my Primaltwin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Primaltwin was
permanently stationed in the Three Realms and did not go out
adventuring. It was indeed far safer to leave it there. In addition,
the Primaltwin had also established its own heartworld and was now
incredibly powerful. For it to use the stone censer to train in the
Dao was the same as the true body using it, as their souls and
truesouls were inextricably linked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After this, the three
of them began to take turns using the Stone Censer of Reunion. Every
thousand years, they would alternate!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One special property of
the stone censer was that there was no way to use it under the
effects of accelerated time! Or, to be precise, the fragrance emitted
by the censer was simply too mysterious and profound. If you used
temporal acceleration, you would need the fragrance to also be
increased at a much faster pace, but this would cause the power of
the temporal acceleration treasure to be depleted at an enormous
pace. Even if one merely tried to train at double speed, the amount
of Immortal energy which would be used up would be more than one
could bear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Dao-cultivating
treasure truly is special.” Ning and the others spent all their
time slowly and honestly training in the Dao without using any
temporal acceleration treasures at all. Despite that, they still
trained far more quickly than they normally did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When you were stuck at
a bottleneck, you would sometimes come to a complete halt no matter
how much time you spent training. When you were in a praja-state,
however, you would improve far more quickly, allowing you to quickly
bypass many bottlenecks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A mere ten thousand
years later. Daolord Laya had been seated in the lotus position on
the prayer mat, but he suddenly rose to his feet. This puzzled both
Ning and Ninedust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Laya, you haven’t
completed your thousand year mark yet. Why have you halted?” Ning
asked, puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even before coming
to this palace, I had already reached my limit. Thanks to this
Dao-cultivating treasure, my Dao has become even more perfect than
before. I cannot find any way to improve it in the slightest. Given
how perfect and complete it is, and given how my heart and my mind
are in peak condition thanks to this Dao-cultivating treasure… I
have decided to attempt my Daomerge here in Thundersouth Palace!”
Daolord Laya said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daomerge?” Both
Ning and Ninedust were shocked. The Daomerge? This was the most
terrifying tribulation which each and every Samsara Daolord would
ever face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve waited for
far too long already. It is time for my Daomerge.” Daolord Laya’s
voice was soft, but his eyes blazed with fiery eagerness. This would
be the most dazzling moment in his long, long life.

Chapter 13 - The Flower of Eternity
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When will the
Daomerge occur?” Ji Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right now.”
Daolord Laya looked at Ning. “Brother Darknorth, I would like to
ask you to loan me the stone censer during the Daomerge process.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A minor matter.”
Ning immediately nodded in acceptance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Laya waved his
hand, causing a triangular altar to appear right next to him. The
altar had three black bones atop it, and in the center of the bones
was a depression. Daolord Laya took out a jade bottle, unplugged the
stopper, then poured out a stream of bright silver liquid that
quickly flowed into the depression.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Laya then took
one step forward, appearing above the altar. He then sat down in the
lotus position at the very center of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I spent quite a bit
of effort in preparing this altar as well.” Daolord Laya smiled
towards Ning and Ninedust. “Ninedust, I imagine that you Ancient
cultivators have even better tools at your disposal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course.” The
Ninedust Sectlord nodded. “My race has a very suitable Daomerge
location, and our Verge-level Daolords will generally return to our
homelands for their Daomerge for that reason. Only if some sort of
special situation prevents them from coming home would they ever
attempt the Daomerge outside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ancient
cultivators really do live up to their reputation,” Daolord Laya
said. “My race does not have the ability to create a special
Daomerge location.” As he spoke, he glanced at Ning. “Brother
Darknorth, I’d like to ask you to place the stone censer before the
altar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” With but
a thought, Ning sent the censer over towards the triangular altar,
roughly three meters away from Daolord Laya. This allowed Daolord
Laya to be able to absorb and inhale the fragrance which emanated
from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Laya waved his
hand, causing a second palm-sized jade bottle to appear. After
pulling out the stopper, he shook out a single round and smooth pill
that emanated faint golden light. What looked like serpents could be
seen swimming within the golden light. He opened his mouth and
immediately swallowed the pill into his stomach.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Nethercold
Jadedrake pill? Oho! It seems the Starflow race’s resources are
quite ample. Even I don’t have a single such pill,” the Ninedust
Sectlord said with praise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thanks to having
studied the [Seven Leafpill Chapters], Ning knew quite a bit
regarding the various pills that could be used to assist in the
Daomerge. Nethercold Jadedrake pills allowed one to completely calm
and empty out one’s mind and heart, putting both into a state of
inconceivable clarity. If used to engage in Numerancy or
calculations, one’s mind would be able to move a thousand times
faster than normally. The Daomerge was a process that wasn’t
exactly short, but no Daolord would describe it as ‘long’. Thus,
the faster they were able to engage in the various calculations they
needed to engage in during the time allotted them, the better.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nethercold Jadedrake
pills were recorded within the [Seven Leafpill Chapters]. They were
ranked eighth amongst the various types of Daomerge-assisting pills.
But of course, there were only a total of twelve such pills even
recorded down to begin with, and every single type of
Daomerge-assisting pill was incredibly valuable. As for the top five,
they truly were shockingly rare. The top five pills… even the
Paragon of Pills herself had to use all the power and skill available
to her to succeed at making the second through fifth pills, and the
process wasn’t an easy one. In the end, it was truly a matter of
talent. If the Paragon of Pills wished to make the second-ranked
pill, she would have to pay an enormous price and spend an extremely
long period of time while using up many precious materials.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ordinary Daolords would
kill themselves and still fail to find any of the twelve pills, to
say nothing of the top five.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My race was lucky
enough to stumble onto a few. I rendered a few merits and so was
rewarded with a pill.” Daolord Laya smiled. “Fellow Daoists, I’m
going to begin now. I hope that once my Daomerge concludes, I will
have gained my eternity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gain eternity.”
Both Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord quietly looked at him, mentally
wishing him luck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. Daolord
Laya sat down in the lotus position. He closed his eyes, then took a
deep breath. The fragrance in the surrounding area quickly flooded
into his body. Slowly, ripples of power began to emanate from within
his body, which started to shine with blurry golden light. This was
the light of the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He has started his
Daomerge,” Ninedust said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning watched carefully
as well. “I wonder if he will succeed.” Even as a mere spectator,
Ning still felt a sense of pressure weighing down on his heart. The
Daomerge… in the end, it was the final end which awaited all
Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His path is the Dao
of Metal,” Ninedust murmured softly. “He’s slowly beginning a
final fusion of all of his Samsara Daolord-level insights into the
Dao of Metal. If his fusion is completely perfect, then he’ll have
created a Dao which shall last unto eternity! However, the slightest
of imperfections shall result in failure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning watched silently.
His own Omega Sword Dao might be extremely powerful, but it wasn’t
anywhere close to the ‘perfect and eternal’ level. This was true
for the first stage, the second stage, and even the hypothetical
fourth stage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What did eternity
represent? It meant that a particular Dao was completely flawless and
perfect. The passage of time would not age that Dao in the slightest;
only then could a Dao truly be worth of the title ‘eternal’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Laya was on par
with the likes of Ning, Ninedust, and Kongsan. Most likely, he had
only mastered a single Supreme Dao. His Daomerge would be somewhat
easier than Ninedust’s and Bertulu’s, as all he had to do was
simply complete the Daomerge on the basis of the Dao foundation he
had already set up. Ning was on an even higher level; for him,
reaching true perfection in a Dao was almost impossibly hard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In Ning’s estimation,
based on the fact that his first stage Omega Sword Dao was an
all-encompassing Dao which had already begun to resonate with the
prime essence of the sword, if he did gain eternity with this Dao
then it would become on par with the universe’s prime essence of
the sword itself. One could imagine how hard that would be to
achieve!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time continued to flow
on. Ning and Ninedust both continued to watch. Generally speaking, a
Daomerge would take at most a total of nine years! It was difficult
to estimate how short the ‘shortest’ Daomerge would be. It was
possible for failure to appear after just two weeks; this was a sign
that one’s deficiencies were very significant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder if he’ll
be able to crystallize his flower of eternity,” Ninedust murmured
softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The flower of
eternity.” An expectant look was in Ning’s eyes as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When one embarked on
the Daomerge, the Dao-tree would once more begin to evolve. Upon
reaching the Verge, the Dao-tree within the Jindan chaos region would
reach a total of 540,000 meters in height. It must be understood that
this was the same height as an Eternal Emperor’s Dao-tree! There
was no way for the Dao-tree to grow any larger or any taller. When
you began to Daomerge, you would need to perfectly merge together all
of the insights of the Dao-tree and form a beautiful, eternal flower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flowering of the
Dao-tree and the blooming of this beautiful flower of eternity was a
sign that the Daomerge had been successful. The flower of eternity
would contain the gathered and combined insights of every single
scrap of Dao the Dao-tree possessed. But if you failed, the flower of
eternity would wither just as it started to bloom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! After
Daolord Laya had spent two years in the Daomerge process, the golden
light around his body suddenly expanded dramatically, becoming
dazzling to behold. His aura began to rapidly increase in power and
presence, eclipsing the auras of both Ning and Ninedust. The aura
continued to climb, rising above the level of any and every Daolord…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was someone who had
mastered a single Supreme Dao and was significantly more powerful
than even Emperor Mirrorsnow had been. Once he gained eternity, he
would be on the level of the eight lords of the Sacred Cities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daomerge truly
could result in a skyrocketing level of power for any Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s at the
critical time now,” the Ninedust Sectlord muttered softly. “Time
to go all out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success or failure
will be determined right now.” Ning watched nervously as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daomerge had
already gone on for two years. Clearly, Daolord Laya had reached the
point where he needed to unleash all of his insights. He had to
charge through this final barrier. If he succeeded, then it would be
a complete success and he would have gained eternity. But if he was
lacking in even the slightest… he would fail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Daolord
Laya sat there, an agonized look on his face. Golden light radiated
from his entire body in awe-inspiring fashion as the power of the Dao
of Metal radiated out from him. His aura continued to grow more
powerful, but it also began to shudder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Suddenly, all
of the golden light vanished from him, and his aura quickly began to
decay as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Failure.” Both the
Ninedust Sectlord and Ning slowly shook their heads.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…” Daolord
Laya mumbled to himself. He had been able to ‘see’ that a flower
of eternity had already begun to take shape atop the Dao-tree in his
Jindan chaos region, but the flower had withered away before having a
chance to bloom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had failed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His soul and truesoul
had been in the process of transforming into the Eternal Emperor
level. The process had clearly failed, and both began to undergo a
final, irreversible crumbling. This crumbling was extremely slow, but
there was no way to stop it at all, as the crumbling was occurring at
the very center of his being. If he didn’t fight, the crumbling
would take an extremely long time to complete, but each time he
engaged someone else in battle he would be hastening the end of his
own life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still seated above the
triangle altar, Daolord Laya opened his eyes. He looked at Ning and
Ninedust, a hint of grief in his eyes, then let out a pained smile.
“Fellow Daoists, the Daomerge truly is harder than all else under
the heavens. I had my altar, used spirit-pills, and had the
assistance of the Stone Censer of Reunion. I felt extremely good
about my chances, but I still failed. The flower of eternity withered
away as soon as the bud appeared. It didn’t even have a chance to
bloom. Clearly, I wasn’t even close.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Laya, failing the
Daomerge is normal,” Ninedust said consolingly. “In the end, very
few are able to complete the Daomerge, and Daolords on our level of
power who can do so are even more rare.”
</P>

Chapter 14 - Daolord Badlands
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Ninedust
could both understand how Daolord Laya felt right now. Cultivation
was like climbing a mountain; you slowly started at the very bottom
of the mountain, overcoming many difficulties before you finally
reached the top. The final step you took next would determine if you
rose into the heavens or fell into an endless abyss. Daolord Laya had
failed his Daomerge; clearly, he had fallen into the endless abyss.
His soul and truesoul had already begun to crumble, and he could
already see his future death. His path of cultivation was about to
come to an end. Even though he had mentally prepared himself long
ago, he would still feel great pain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve cultivated
for many years, but it all ends today.” Daolord Laya shook his
head, then let out a hoarse chuckle. “When I was young, I fought
hard to climb to the very top. Only then did I learn how tough things
were for my race. After becoming a Daolord, my every thought was
consumed with taking care of my race…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s been too
long, and I’m far too tired. I’ve spent my entire long life in
the Terror Starsea,” Daolord Laya said. “I’ve never even
visited the Endless Territories.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Laya rose to
his feet, then waved his hand and put away the triangle altar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth.
Brother Ninedust.” Daolord Laya looked at the two of them. “I’m
going to leave now. I plan to pay a visit to the Endless Territories
and learn about it! In fact, I might even go off into the Great Dark.
Before I die, I want to see as much as of the universe as I can.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Ninedust
Sectlord no longer knew what to say.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to send me
off.” Daolord Laya strode quickly towards the exit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two watched as
Daolord Laya left, both filled with regret. Daolord Laya no longer
cared one whit about Thundersouth Palace, electing to leave
immediately. Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord, however, still did care,
because the various paintings hanging on the walls of the palace
represented various techniques that the lord of the palace had left
behind for others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thankfully, he
didn’t go crazy.” The Ninedust Sectlord shook his head. “I’ve
seen Verge-level Daolords go absolutely insane after they failed
their Daomerge.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He trained since he
was young and has cultivated his entire life…” Ning continued to
stare in the direction Daolord Laya had left. “He trained tens of
thousands of chaos cycles… but all of a sudden he failed his
Daomerge and brought his cultivation path to an abrupt halt. This
would be extremely disheartening for any cultivator. It makes sense
for some to be mentally affected by it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. There are some
evil Daolords who normally keep their worst impulses in check and are
afraid to act too rashly for fear of being killed by other major
powers. After they fail their Daomerge and are guaranteed to perish,
they become absolutely fearless and even more detestful than before.”
The Ninedust Sectlord shook his head. “But of course, they’ll die
in their madness.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder what we’ll
end up like when we fail our Daomerge?” The Ninedust Sectlord
suddenly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When we fail our
Daomerge?” Ning stared blankly. Would he fail his Daomerge? Right
now, there was no way for him to be sure as to how he would react.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Maybe we’ll both
succeed and gain eternity for ourselves.” Ning smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha. Right. We’ll
gain eternity for sure.” The Ninedust Sectlord nodded. “I’ll be
a Hegemon when that happens. We Ancient cultivators will have two
Hegemons! Haha.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But both of them
understood that the path to eternity was an incredibly difficult one.
Normally, less than one in a hundred thousand Daolords would be able
to gain eternity, and virtually all of them were ordinary Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust
continued to calmly train within the Thundersouth Palace of the
Starflow River, and both improved quite rapidly. Finally, after
spending thirty thousand years at the Thundersouth Palace, the
Ninedust Sectlord made his breakthrough!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… an aura of
awesome power swept out from the Ninedust Sectlord. He opened his
eyes, his face wreathed with smiles. “Haha. I, Redwater, have
finally broken through! A Daolord of the Fourth Step… I’ve
finally become a Daolord of the Fourth Step! This has been incredibly
difficult. Going from the third step to fourth step was a thousand
times harder than going from the first step to the third step. Haha…
I’ve finally broken through!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
brother Ninedust,” the nearby Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, this is indeed
worth celebrating. I was trapped at the third step for far, far too
long.” The Ninedust Sectlord smiled as he looked at Ning. “It was
all thanks to this Stone Censer of Reunion. If it wasn’t for it, I
would’ve wasted another chaos cycle or two before making my
breakthrough. I had already gained certain insights in the trial the
Ancient ancestor left behind, allowing me to vault to a new level on
this trip.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With this step you
now stand at the very peak of power amongst Daolords, Ninedust,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust nodded,
looking rather pleased. He was someone who had perfectly joined
together two Supreme Daos. Now that he had reached the fourth step,
he immediately stood amongst the ranks of the absolute most powerful
Daolords in the world. He was on the same level as Daolord Skyaxe or
Palace Lord Dawnstar. There might be differences in power due to
different secret arts and different treasures, but those differences
wouldn’t be too great; they were all on the same overall level of
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more powerful you
were, the more difficult it would be to go from the third step to the
fourth step. Daolord Badlands, for example, had also been trapped at
the third step for a very, very long period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, you are
no longer a match for me,” Ninedust said quite smugly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s not
necessarily true,” Ning replied. “Don’t forget that I’m a
Heartforce Cultivator. I’ve gained some insight into the illusions
of the Thundersouth Hegemon over these past few years as I’ve
studied his paintings. You might not be able to fully resist my
illusions now.” If he could trap his enemy in illusions for even an
instant, it would have an impact on how any fight would result.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh…” Ninedust
blinked, then immediately said, “Hmph, I need a bit of time to
solidify my foundation, as I’ve just recently made my breakthrough.
Give me some more time to further strengthen my soul and your
illusions won’t be able to touch me at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninedust’s face
suddenly tightened. “My Dao is now strong enough. I’ve reached
the Verge of the Daomerge as soon as I reached the fourth step. I
should make more preparations as well… right now, I have no
confidence in my Daomerge chances whatsoever.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled.
Right. Ninedust was now at the Verge as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Badlands
Territory. In the Badlands Everworld, there was a legendary place
known throughout the Endless Territories… the Waveshift Realm! This
was a realm that had been left behind by Emperor Waveshift himself.
He was renowned as the number one Numerancy expert of the Endless
Territories, and was far more powerful than the current Daolord
Badlands. He was a mysterious man who appeared and disappeared
without warning, and even the three Hegemons found it difficult to
deal with him as his schemes and calculations were simply too
frightening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Waveshift had
hidden valuable treasures within the Waveshift Realm. This was
something he had said publicly before leaving the Endless Territories
and venturing off into the endless Great Dark.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many generations of
Daolords had entered this place to try their luck, and Daolord
Solesky was one of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Waveshift Realm was
a place that seemed to be covered by an enormous blurry barrier. The
dim light of sunset covered this entire realm, and some cultivators
could be seen passing by it on occasion. Most kept a very safe
distance, as the Waveshift Realm was simply too dangerous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… suddenly, a
dazzling streak of green light shot out from the Waveshift Realm.
This streak of light stretched out countless kilometers, streaking up
into the heavens and piercing through the world-barrier protecting
the entire Badlands Everworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… a second
dazzling streak of bloody light shot out, just as wide and large as
the first one. It shot out towards another direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Black light, violet
light, azure light… a total of nine streaks of light shot out.
These nine streaks of light looked almost like a peacock spreading
its feathers as they shot towards different directions. They pierced
through everything in their path, be it mountains or mist, but they
seemed completely illusory. They caused no damage at all to anything
they passed through, leaving even the grass completely untouched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is this? Is
something happening?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Badlands Everworld
was the center of the entire Badlands Territory. Countless
cultivators were gathered here, and all of them were puzzled,
especially the Elder Gods and True Gods. However, when they saw the
light shoot out from the Waveshift Realm they all realized that this
was something far beyond their level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on in
the Waveshift Realm?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is something
happening?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Badlands Court was
the paramount power within the Badlands Everworld, and its disciples
all stared off in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Husband.” A
married couple was standing together in the skies, staring off into
the distance. The beautiful wife turned to look at her husband,
concerned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An azure-robed Daolord
Badlands was staring towards the light, a complex look on his face.
He shook his head slightly. “I was too proud and rash, too certain
in my Numerancy skills. Compared to Emperor Waveshift, I’m still
lacking by quite a bit. I just caused a bit of a catastrophe. I don’t
think there will be any way to hide this. Ugh. I only have my avatar
inside, but big brother Solesky will be in trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Caused a
catastrophe?” The beautiful wife asked worriedly, “Will it impact
our Badlands Court?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of us should
leave the Badlands Territory for now and hide for a time. For now,
let us just leave an avatar behind to watch over things,” Daolord
Badlands said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hide?” She had
never imagined that things would be so grave that they would have to
flee and hide somewhere else.

Chapter 15 - Voidsea Jadeseal
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Soon, many Daolords
will be charging to this sector,” Daolord Badlands said solemnly.
“If my true body remains here, I might very well fall. However, so
long as I leave and ensure they cannot find my true body, they won’t
dare to cause our Badlands Court any trouble. In the end, my Dao of
Numerancy is a Dao for divination, not battle. My skills lie in
avoiding trouble and finding fortunes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The beautiful
woman nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go. Right
away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
Daolord Badlands and his wife silently departed from the Badlands
Everworld, leaving only an avatar behind to guard over the Badlands
Court.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao of Numerancy
was indeed an extremely troublesome Dao for everyone, but it was
highly unsuited for actual battle. Daolord Badlands himself almost
never went out adventuring or into battle. As a Daolord of the Third
Step who had reached an extremely high level in the Dao of Numerancy,
he logically should’ve been on the same level as the likes of
Ninedust (at the third step) or Kongsan, but in reality he was much
weaker in combat. He was just barely on par with the likes of Solesky
and Clearwind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was his greatest
weakness. However, his skills lay in avoiding trouble; when he
encountered enemies he was unable to defeat, he’d quickly move to
avoid them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, the Dao of
Numerancy was about divination, not omniscience. As a result, he had
suffered greatly for his overconfidence alongside Daolord Solesky in
the Waveshift Realm. Clearly, even he fell for the traps left behind
by Emperor Waveshift, and so he hurriedly slunk away from his own
everworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nine beams of light
have appeared in the skies over the Waveshift Realm?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Something big just
happened.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No matter what, the
Badlands Everworld was still the core of this territory. The Dao
Alliance had stationed a number of cultivators here who were
responsible for diplomacy with Daolord Badlands and watching over the
various treasure auctions! In addition, some of the supreme
organizations within the Endless Territories had inserted scouts to
watch over the Waveshift Realm. Although these scouts weren’t that
powerful, they were only required to keep a long-term watch over
Waveshift City. Waveshift Realm was simply an incredibly famous place
of the Endless Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and send a
report.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Something big has
happened in the Waveshift Realm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The scouts had been
waiting here for far too long with nothing to report. Some had been
waiting for tens of thousands of chaos cycles, and it was all for the
sake of critical moments like this. Thus, none of them dared to
slacken off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the news spread
from the Badlands Territory to the rest of the Endless Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A dazzlingly beautiful
green planet. This world had countless cultivators living within it.
In one corner of this vast world, there was an ordinary wooden house
that merely had a single old man seated within it. The old man had
curly green hair and a pair of horns on his head, and his eyes were
lidded. He had been seated here for more than ten thousand chaos
cycles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had been alive for
far, far too long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch!
Patriarch!” A voice rang out from afar. The green-haired elder
opened his eyes, and they seemed to contain the boundless vastness of
the universe itself within them. His gaze was gentle as he stared
outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A golden-robed figure
was leading a green-haired man who had an exalted aura towards the
patriarch. The green-haired man landed, then said respectfully,
“Patriarch.” He had become a lord of a Sacred City, and in power
he was roughly on par with this particular Patriarch, but he still
showed the old man the utmost of respect. The old man had shown him
great kindness. Although they weren’t master and disciple, he owed
the old man as much as any master. The old man had also done much for
their entire homeland, far more than anyone else. Without the
Patriarch, their lineage would’ve been wiped out long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Qixiao, why have you
come back to our homeland to meet with me?” The green-haired elder
smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch.”
Emperor Qixiao said seriously, “Do you still remember Emperor
Waveshift?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember him? Of
course I remember him.” A nostalgic look appeared on the old man’s
ancient face. “After I became an Eternal Emperor, I spent countless
years studying the Dao of Numerancy myself. I had once believed
myself to be a pre-eminent master of this Dao in the Endless
Territories, but after meeting Waveshift and testing myself out I
realized that I wasn’t even close to being a match. His skill in
Numerancy vastly, vastly surpassed my own.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are being too
modest, Patriarch. Emperor Waveshift relied on the Dao of Numerancy
to become an Emperor; of course he was skilled in it! You, on the
other hand, only started studying it after becoming an Emperor. He’s
left the Endless Territories long ago. In the present day, you are
number one in this Dao,” Emperor Qixiao said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For now, I suppose.
There’s a young fellow named ‘Daolord Badlands’ in the Badlands
Territory who is even more talented than Emperor Waveshift was in
Numerancy. He’s a Daolord of the Third Step but is already
incredible at Numerancy. Once he becomes a Daolord of the Fourth
Step, he’ll probably surpass me in that Dao and become a king of
the Endless Territories.” The old man shook his head. Moments
later, his face tightened slightly as the illusion of the cosmos
within his eyes suddenly vanished. He raised his head to look at
Emperor Qixiao. “Have you come here because of the Badlands
Territory… no. To be precise, you have come because of the
Waveshift Realm?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impressive,
Patriarch.” Emperor Qixiao said hurriedly, “I have indeed come
because of the Waveshift Realm! Just now, I received word that
something major has happened there. Nine streaks of light shot out
from the Waveshift Realm and went through the entire Badlands
Everworld.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s quite a
commotion. Can it be… that the Voidsea Jadeseals have emerged?”
The old man was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That was my first
reaction as well. Before Emperor Waveshift departed, he fashioned
multiple Voidsea Jadeseals. However, he only left one of them to the
Dao Alliance. He put the other five within his own Waveshift Realm,”
Emperor Qixiao said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old man nodded.
“Back then, brother Waveshift told me that if any Eternal Emperor
dared to forcibly enter his realm, all five seals would instantly be
destroyed. Only Daolords would be permitted to acquire them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch, these
seals are supreme Daomerge treasures!” Emperor Qixiao said
hurriedly, “If we can acquire those five seals, we might be able to
produce one or two formidable Eternal Emperors for our race.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The old man
nodded. Voidsea Jadeseals… they were described as supreme Daomerge
treasures because they were publicly acknowledged as being the best
treasures for assisting cultivators in the Daomerge. No treasures
surpassed them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Voidsea Jadeseals were
single-use items. After you acquired them and as you prepared for
your Daomerge, you could form an illusory body within the seal, then
use that illusory body to test out the Daomerge. The process would be
identical to that of the actual Daomerge you would undergo! Even if
you failed your Daomerge, it wouldn’t harm your true body in the
slightest! It was equivalent to giving you an additional shot at the
Daomerge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This additional
experience was more than enough to drive any Daolord mad with lust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why was the Daomerge so
terrifying? It was precisely because the Daomerge was a one-time
event. If you were even slightly lacking, you would fail and never
have another shot at it. If you had multiple shots at it, then
obviously your second attempt would benefit from your previous
experience and give you a far better chance at succeeding in the
Daomerge!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, given how
incredible the Voidsea Jadeseals were, they were naturally incredibly
rare as well. They could only be fashioned through the usage of a
strange treasure known as voidsea jade, and they could only be
fashioned by Emperor Waveshift, who had reached truly inconceivable
heights in the Dao of Numerancy. Prior to his departure, he had used
up his entire supply of voidsea jade to create these six seals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had left one seal
with the Dao Alliance and the other five at the Waveshift Realm. This
was why so many generations of Daolords had ventured off into the
Waveshift Realm, but thus far none of them had been able to find the
Voidsea Jadeseals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The power of the
Voidsea Jadeseals is enough to allow a Daolord who has a single
Supreme Dao to undergo a single full Daomerge attempt. However, if
that Daolord has perfectly fused multiple Supreme Daos together,
he’ll only be able to make it halfway through the Daomerge before
the power of the seal is used up.” The old man sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the limit to
what the Voidsea Jadeseal could accomplish. If someone who had joined
together multiple Supreme Daos together succeeded into the Daomerge,
that person would become a Hegemon! There was no way a Voidsea
Jadeseal could fully divine such a process.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, a Daolord who
had a single Supreme Dao would be able to try out an entire complete
Daomerge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be remembered
that there were incredibly few figures in the Endless Territories who
were capable of comprehending and mastering multiple Supreme Daos.
Thus, these seals were more than enough for the vast majority of
Daolords. Even the most ungodly powerful of Daolords would be able to
at least divine half of the Daomerge process.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch, can you
verify that the disturbance in the Waveshift Realm was indeed caused
by the emergence of the Voidsea Jadeseals?” Emperor Qixiao asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me take a look.”
The old man closed his eyes and began to engage in Numerancy
calculations as strange ripples of power appeared around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long time later, the
old man opened his eyes and nodded. “Tell the younger members of
our race that the Waveshift Realm truly has unleashed its Voidsea
Jadeseals. I imagine that brother Waveshift did this deliberately to
draw many Daolords to his realm, which is why he didn’t hide
anything and allowed me to calculate it all with ease. Any of the top
ten Numerancy experts in the Endless Territories is capable doing the
same.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Voidsea Jadeseals?”
Emperor Qixiao’s eyes lit up. “If we’re certain, then we have
to get them for ourselves.”

Chapter 16 - Everyone Gathering
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a region of
space that was completely cut off from the rest of the universe. This
was a region that was filled with endless blood flames that seemed to
form an entire ocean. Every single flame possessed awesome might and
was capable of easily incinerating a Daolord of the Fourth Step. At
the very center of the flames, there was an imperial throne that
seemed to have been carved out of white bone. The enormous white bone
throne hung there, and above it stood a silver-haired man whose hands
were resting on the armrests. The man stared at the endless flames,
and his heart and mind seemed to be completely one with the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gorsch.” A voice
suddenly rang out within the empty region. “Come forth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-haired man
was startled. Ever since learning that his most talented progeny,
Gorho, had been recruited by the Brightshore Kingdom, he had felt
much at ease. He had temporarily chosen to enter their racial lands
to train; why was it that he was now being ordered to come out?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Coming,” the
silver-haired man said respectfully. Whoosh. He disappeared from atop
the throne of white bone, which continued to eternally hang there
above the endless sea of blood flames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-haired man
appeared within a beautiful, ancient palace. The throne of this
palace was occupied by an exceedingly handsome youth who was dressed
in gaudy black robes and whose eyes seemed to contain the vast cosmos
within them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperor,” the
silver-haired man said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gorsch, I just
received word that Voidsea Jadeseals have appeared within the
Waveshift Realm of the Dao Alliance’s Badlands Territory.” The
icy-faced black-robed youth spoke in an extremely calm voice.
Although he looked very young, he was actually the oldest and most
venerable Eternal Emperor of the entire Aeonian race. He was
perpetually stationed within the core palace of the Aeonian Kingdom,
and it was his responsibility to watch over their ancestral lands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Voidsea Jadeseals?”
The silver-haired man revealed a stunned look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve reached the
Verge of the Daomerge long ago, and you are fast approaching the
great limit,” the black-robed youth said coldly. “You are, at
present, the most powerful Daolord of our race! Although the jade
seals are not strong enough to allow you to fully experience the
complete Daomerge, you’ll at least be able to experience part of
it. This is a rare opportunity for you and your Daomerge. However,
word of this has already spread and all six of the major powers of
the Endless Territories have been informed. I trust that many
Verge-level Daolords are already on their way. What’s worse, you
are an Aeonian while Emperor Waveshift was of the Dao Alliance. It is
entirely possible that he might’ve prepared something nasty for our
race there. If you go, you’ll take on a certain degree of risk.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can choose for
yourself whether or not you wish to go,” the black-robed youth
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone in the
outside world refers to me as King Gorsch, but in the end I’m just
a king, not an emperor.” The silver-haired man said in a low voice,
“My limit approaches, and I have no confidence in my Daomerge
chances at all. Although this opportunity is filled with peril, I
still have to give it a try. If I can acquire one of those seals, my
chances at the Daomerge shall become much greater.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
black-robed youth nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Brightshore
Kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A figure suddenly
appeared out of nowhere atop an ordinary-looking wasteland. It was a
white-bearded old man who was dressed in snowy white robes and who
had six horns on his head. He stood there atop the lands, then opened
his mouth: “Ninestone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… the vast
wilderness began to shake as the earth itself began to bulge upwards.
An enormous four-legged stone behemoth that was covered in countless
sharp spikes emerged from beneath the ground, leaving behind an
enormous crater that was over a hundred million kilometers in
circumference. The Brightshore Imperials were all Chaos Godbeasts,
and they were legendary for their size.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hegemon.” The
four-legged stone behemoth stared at the almighty Hegemon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You merged yourself
into the earth itself to better understand the Dao of Earth. Of the
Brightshore Imperials, you are closest to the lifespan limit. Are you
confident in your Daomerge chances?” the Brightshore Hegemon asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, the almighty
Hegemon was quite worried. Although the Brightshore Imperials had
many generations of Chaos Godbeasts, thus far only a single one had
become a Hegemon - himself. Fortunately, he was powerful enough all
by himself to overawe the entire Endless Territories. However, the
fact that his race had yet to produce a second emperor meant that he
was forced to continuously kidnap some of the geniuses of the other
races of the Endless Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Palace Lord Dawnstar,
Bertulu, Ji Ning… all of them had been kidnapped. They now belonged
to the Twelve Palaces of Brightshore, which were actually more
powerful than the Brightshore Imperials themselves. But of course,
they were no match for the Hegemon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am not confident,”
Ninestone rumbled softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Voidsea Jadeseals
have appeared within the Waveshift Realm of the Badlands Territory!
You might have a shot at one of them,” the almighty Hegemon said.
“However, this will be filled with danger. These seals were
fashioned by the most skilled Numerancy expert the Endless
Territories has ever seen, Emperor Waveseal, and he had to use up his
supply of voidsea jade in order to create them. There’s only a few
of the seals, and they’ve aroused the attention of quite a few
Verge-level Daolords. Many reclusive, normally low-key Daolords have
all made their appearances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can choose for
yourself whether or not you wish to go.” The almighty Hegemon
disappeared into thin air after speaking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waveshift Realm of
the Dao Alliance?” Ninestone’s body blurred as he transformed
into a human shape. He now looked like an incredibly muscular
black-armored man whose eyes were as still as a pool of dead water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninestone was known
amongst the Brightshore Imperials as the Ninth King.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Voidsea Jadeseals
have actually appeared?” Daolord Skyaxe and Daolord Soleman were
seated within a flying vessel in the void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s this?”
Daolord Soleman called out with surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Voidsea Jadeseals
have appeared in the Waveshift Realm,” Daolord Skyaxe said. “I
just received word of this. I imagine the Brightshore Kingdom should
receive word soon as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me ask.”
Daolord Soleman nodded, then soon nodded a second time. “The Twelve
Palaces have just received word as well. The jade seals really have
appeared.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shall we go?”
Daolord Skyaxe looked at Soleman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course!”
Soleman nodded. “This is our best shot at the Daomerge.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two immediately
changed their plans, turning around their flying vessel and sending
it towards the Waveshift Realm instead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within an ordinary
mortal city. Countless mortals lived in this region for up to a
hundred years. They lived ordinary lives and had to work hard for
their living.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This city had a famous
blacksmith who was very skilled in creating weapons, especially
sabers. However, he only smithed when he was in the right mood, and
his smithy was only occasionally operational.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll give you two
golden vastluck coins. Help me forge a suitable saber for me.” A
youth and his servants were present, and they spoke and acted in a
very arrogant manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two golden vastluck
coins?” The ordinary-looking blacksmith, dressed in hemp clothes,
called out in astonishment, “Each of these are worth as much as ten
thousand ordinary gold coins, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Precisely,” the
youth said proudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a fortune! But…
haven’t you heard? When I don’t want to work, no one in the world
can force me.” The blacksmith snickered, “Run along home, kid.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two golden vastluck
coins aren’t enough? How many do you want?” The youth was anxious
now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blacksmith was
about to speak when he suddenly paused. “The Hegemon is saying that
Voidsea Jadeseals have just appeared? This is probably the best
chance that I, Dawnstar, will have to improve my Daomerge odds.”
The blacksmith’s eyes became as tranquil as the sea as he glanced
at the youth and the others. “Cancel it all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The entire city
- in fact, the entire world - all vanished into motes of glittering,
astral saber-light. All of the living beings had been nothing more
than incarnations created by saber-light, not actual living beings.
This was nothing more than a training mechanism he engaged in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waveshift Realm,
eh?” He sheathed his machete into the scabbard on his back. He had
a look in his eyes that was calm but which could bring fear to
countless cultivators. Moments later, he vanished into thin air after
taking a single step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao Alliance, the
Aeonians, the Brightshore Kingdom, the Aberrants, the Ancient
cultivators… all of them quickly received word. Even the powerful
Daolords of the Dark Kingdom were intrigued.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Aeonians were on
rather bad terms with the Dao Alliance, but for the sake of the
Daomerge, King Gorsch and several other Verge-level Daolords decided
to brave the risk and give it a shot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The same was true for
the Dark Kingdom. Verge-level Daolords, for the sake of completing
their Daomerge, were absolutely fearless. They began to stealthily
move towards the Badlands Territory as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the most powerful
of Daolords would feel despair when faced with the Daomerge. When the
legendary Voidsea Jadeseals, the most supreme Daomerge treasures,
suddenly appeared… countless Daolords were intrigued and agitated.
There were many Daolords who were low-key, but that didn’t mean
they were weak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Heartsword was
a classic example. He was very low-key, and only fought after
becoming a Daolord of the Fourth Step due to an irreconcilable
grudge. He gained great fame through that battle, and when he
succeeded in his Daomerge he became the most dazzling Eternal Emperor
in existence. Even now, people whispered stories about him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another example was
Daolord Everstarter of the Sword Palace of the Brightshore Kingdom.
He had also been a very low-key figure who lived in the Sword Palace
and rarely went out adventuring. However, when the Ancient
cultivators went too far in their actions and forced his hand, he
consecutively slew three of their Verge-level Daolords and then
defeated one of their Emperors. He was publicly acclaimed as the most
powerful Daolord of the Endless Territories in his time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clearly, the appearance
of these seals caused many of the normally low-key but incredibly
powerful Daolords to make their appearances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of them would
hesitate over something which could increase their chances at
completing their Daomerge. Not even death could stop them!

Chapter 17 - Trouble For Vastheaven Palace
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Terror Starsea. The
Starflow River. Within Thundersouth Palace.Ji Ning and the Ninedust
Sectlord were still training calmly here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The Ninedust
Sectlord’s face suddenly turned pale. He opened his eyes and called
out loudly, “Darknorth. Darknorth!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” Ning
was seated atop a prayer mat and was using the beneficial effects of
the Stone Censer of Reunion to train. All five of his Supreme Sword
Daos had reached the third stage, but he was stuck at the bottleneck
of actually combining them together into the third-stage Omega Sword
Dao. Although the stone censer was effective in helping him meditate
on the Dao, the toughest bottlenecks would still be quite hard to
resolve.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Something big just
happened.” The Ninedust Sectlord looked rather excited. “Have you
heard of the Waveshift Realm in the Badlands Territory of your Dao
Alliance?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have.” Ning was
startled. That place was quite close to his own homeland, the Three
Realms. His big brother Solesky was in that realm right now. How
could he not be familiar with that place?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Voidsea
Jadeseals have emerged from the Waveshift Realm.” The Ninedust
Sectlord said excitedly, “All six of the major organizations in the
Endless Territories already know about this matter. Many Verge-level
Daolords have gone crazy. Most who have heard about this have already
headed to the Badlands Territory and are going to enter the Waveshift
Realm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Voidsea Jadeseals?”
Ning was stunned. That was a supreme Daomerge treasure! Any
Verge-level Daolord would go crazy over such an item. The entire
reason why so many Verge-level Daolords dared to charge into the
Terror Starsea and other terrifyingly dangerous place was because
they had long ago stopped worrying about the chances of dying; to
them, their only goal was to do their utmost to increase their
chances in the Daomerge. When word of the Voidsea Jadeseals’
emergence spread, it only made sense that many Verge-level Daolords
would immediately charge into the Waveshift Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother Solesky
is there.” Ning’s heart clenched. “Not good.” It was already
dangerous for Solesky to traverse the Waveshift Realm to begin with.
Now that many Verge-level Daolords had also joined the fray…
Solesky simply wasn’t that strong, compared to many of those
freaks. He would be in even more danger than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m still very,
very far away from hitting my lifespan limit. But…” The Ninedust
Sectlord’s eyes were glowing with excitement. “Voidsea Jadeseals
are legendary, supreme Daomerge treasures! Ever since Emperor
Waveshift left, there has been no word of any of these treasures. If
we miss this opportunity, we can probably forget about ever having a
chance to acquire them. Darknorth, I’ve already decided to go to
the Waveshift Realm. How about you? Why don’t we go together? If we
join forces, we really would have nothing and no one to fear.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that he was at the
fourth step, Ninedust was on the same level of power as Palace Lord
Dawnstar, Daolord Skyaxe, King Gorsch, and similar fighters. However,
he wouldn’t dare to claim invincibility. For example, he was
vulnerable to dangerous illusions and extremely powerful Heartforce
Cultivators. It must be remembered that Ning was merely at the second
tier amongst Heartforce Cultivators. If the Ninedust Sectlord had to
deal with the likes of the Palace Lord of the Heartforce Palace of
the Brightshore Kingdom… he really wasn’t confident in his
chances. However, things were different for Ning. Ning might not be
able to do anything to them, but he was more than strong enough to
defend himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When dealing with soul
and truesoul related attacks, defense was much easier than attack. So
long as the difference wasn’t too ridiculously large, Heartforce
Cultivators would generally be able to endure enemy heartforce
attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
nodded. “We naturally can’t give up a chance like this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha! Wonderful. I
imagine that the most powerful of the Endless Territories’ famous
Daolords will be headed there. And that’s just on the surface. I
imagine many of the powerful but low-key Daolords will be headed
there as well.” Ninedust said excitedly, “Darknorth, neither of
us are all that famous in the Endless Territories, but when we join
forces we really will have no one to fear.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed. We can deal
with any type of attacks.” Ning felt quite confident as well. The
two of them weren’t very famous just yet. Ning had killed Kongsan,
there were still very few who knew the name ‘Daolord Darknorth’.
As for the Ninedust Sectlord, he wasn’t that famous either. Both
weren’t nearly as well-known as King Gorsch, Skyaxe, Dawnstar, or
other such figures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s not waste
time. Let’s head in that direction immediately,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed. Let’s move
right away. If we are too slow, it might end up being taken by
others.” The Ninedust Sectlord didn’t want to waste time either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Endless
Territories. Vastheaven Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky and
Daolord Battlemaster were already meeting about this matter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Daolord
Battlemaster stared at Daolord Solesky in astonishment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh. Neither I nor
Badlands imagined that something like this would happen. We were
moving quite carefully, and you know how skilled Badlands is in
Numerancy. Neither of us expected that we’d end up falling into
Emperor Waveshift’s trap. We just kicked over the hornet’s nest.”
Daolord Solesky shook his head. “Based on what I know, the top
organizations of the Endless Territories already know about this. The
emergence of the Voidsea Jadeseals will definitely attract an
enormous number of Verge-level Daolords to hasten towards us.
Compared to them, we’re nothing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother Solesky,
don’t worry too much. My guess is that Emperor Waveshift planned
this out long ago. There’s no way he would allow anyone to acquire
those jade seals with ease. Anyone who touched them would immediately
cause certain spells to be activated that would cause all of this to
happen. The entire point was to draw the Verge-level Daolords of the
Endless Territories over to the Waveshift Realm to fight over the
seals,” Battlemaster said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. This was
indeed part of Emperor Waveshift’s plan.” Solesky acknowledged it
as well. “How could any single Daolord possibly be allowed to
acquire all five of these legendary seals? Of course their emergence
would cause a huge fight and struggle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Battlemaster carried
out a few calculations, then let out a shocked sigh. “All I can see
is a storm of blood and death! The Waveshift Realm is going to become
an utter charnel house of frenzied slaughter and murder. I can’t
even calculate how many Daolords will die in there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Major powers skilled
in Numerancy should be able to calculate how incredibly deadly the
Waveshift Realm will be, but no amount of danger will prevent these
Daolords from coming,” Daolord Solesky said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Often, less than one in
a hundred thousand Daolord would be able to succeed in the Daomerge,
and the vast majority of those who succeeded were extremely ordinary
Daolords. The incredibly powerful Daolords… the Endless Territories
had been around for countless aeons, but how many powerful Daolords
ended up becoming Eternal Emperors?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Based on their
calculations, it was highly unlikely that any of the powerful
Daolords of this generation would successfully become Eternal
Emperors! Thus, everyone would be absolutely fearless in their
pursuit of the seals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Battlemaster, I
suspect that Vastheaven Palace will be in danger as well,” Daolord
Solesky said. “This is all my fault. When I went to the Waveshift
World, I didn’t imagine what an enormous commotion this would
cause. Thus, I didn’t hide the fact that I was heading there. I
imagine that a number of people in the Endless Territories know that
I entered Waveshift Palace long ago. Those Daolords might come here
and seek out trouble for Vastheaven Palace. Your true body should
lead our brothers away from here and hide for a time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hide?” Daolord
Battlemaster frowned. “Very well. I can already vaguely sense that
trouble will indeed be coming. I’ll immediately lead our brothers
somewhere else to hide for a time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the Daolords of
Vastheaven Palace, Solesky, Brightfish, and Ning all had only avatars
present. The only Daolord who had both his true body and his avatar
here was Battlemaster! Battlemaster was also skilled in Numerancy.
Although he was still inferior to Badlands in Numerancy despite
having reached the fourth step when the latter was still stuck at the
third, he was still someone who had become a Daolord of the Fourth
Stance through Numerancy. If he led the brothers of Vastheaven Palace
to hide, there probably really wouldn’t be many who could find
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as they were
discussing this matter…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother.” A
voice suddenly rang out as a golden-robed youth walked over. It was
Ning’s avatar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Solesky
smiled as he looked at Ning. “I was just about to go talk to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Because of the
trouble in the Waveshift Realm?” Ning immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You know about this
as well?” Solesky was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I just heard about
this. Does this have anything to do with you, big brother?” Ning
was rather worried. In truth, he was still just a Daolord of the
Second Step, and he hadn’t spent much time as a Daolord. Thus, the
Brightshore Kingdom hadn’t gone out of its way to inform him of
this matter! And in truth, there really was no for them to do so. It
was extremely difficult for Ning’s World-level retainer to maintain
contact with his clone located in the distant Brightshore Kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It does have a bit
to do with me. To tell you the truth, Badlands and I were the ones
who caused this.” Solesky shook his head, a bitter smile on his
face. “We ended up taking a beating, but didn’t get any of the
seals at all. Honestly, neither of us had really been expecting that
we would. I was just hoping to get a ‘heartshift pearl’ and use
it to bolster my Daomerge chances. Why would’ve thought that we’d
somehow cause the Voidsea Jadeseals to emerge?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Solesky knew his own
limits. Given that no one had been able to acquire the seals despite
the passage of countless chaos cycles, how could he possibly hope for
himself to acquire it? If he had to blame someone, the only one he
could blame was Daolord Badlands for being absolutely incredible in
Numerancy. The latter had been able to find and solve some of the
more critical questions before them, resulting in them activating the
protections which Emperor Waveshift had left behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to worry too
much about this matter,” Daolord Solesky said. “You have enough
to worry about in the Terror Starsea. Stay careful!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Darknorth,
the Terror Starsea is also quite a terrifying and dangerous place.
Big brother Solesky at least has Daolord Badlands’ avatar helping
him out. Given the latter’s Numerancy abilities, the two will be
able to avoid much trouble. It shouldn’t be hard for them to avoid
trouble,” Daolord Battlemaster said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a sigh of
relief when he heard this. Right. In terms of protecting others, even
Ning himself probably wouldn’t be useful as Badlands’ avatar.The
latter was simply too powerful in the Dao of Numerancy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Darknorth.”
Daolord Battlemaster asked hurriedly, “When your big brother
Solesky first headed to the Waveshift Realm, he didn’t really try
to hide it. As a result, Vastheaven Palace will probably face some
trouble. My true body will hide within Vastheaven Palace alongside
our brothers. Will your avatar stay here or accompany us?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait, what’s this
about Vastheaven Palace facing trouble?”

Chapter 18 - Daolords Assemble
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I should be the only
Verge-level Daolord to have entered the Waveshift Realm in recent
memory.” Daolord Solesky said heavily, “I didn’t go out of my
way to keep my trip a secret. Although not too many know about my
trip, there are still a few Verge-level Daolords who know.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The only one?” Ji
Ning’s face turned pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky
explained, “The Endless Territories have many dangerous locations
within them, and the Waveshift Realm holds very few treasures!
There’s nothing of real interest aside from the Voidsea Jadeseals,
making it a much less enticing proposition than the Terror Starsea.
Ever since Emperor Waveshift departed, no one has ever been able to
find so much as a single one of those seals. Thus, there are now very
few Daolords who will brave the dangers of the Waveshift Realm. I
should be the only one to have gone inside in recent memory.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then this is going
to be trouble.” Ning nodded. “Everyone will be able to guess that
someone inside the Waveshift Realm probably caused the enormous stir.
If you are the only one who has gone inside lately, you are going to
become everyone’s target.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not just me. Even
Badlands is going to be in trouble as well.” Daolord Solesky shook
his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky’s
prediction was frighteningly accurate. The Badlands Court was indeed
in trouble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! A wicked black
cloud descended upon the entire Badlands Court. A black-robed woman
stood at the center of that black cloud. Her skin was green, her eyes
were crimson, and she had a pair of curved green horns on her head.
She called out in an icy voice, “Badlands!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Dustrain.” An azure-robed man stood in front of the Badlands Court.
It was Daolord Badlands’ avatar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An avatar? Are you
actually going to send a mere avatar to meet with me?” Fiendqueen
Dustrain let out a cold snort.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Dustrain was
referred to as ‘Fiendqueen’ due to her exceptional strength as
well as the fact that she walked a devilish, demonic path. She was
publicly acknowledged as the seventh most powerful Daolord of the
Endless Territories! But of course, this ranking was only based on
the Daolords who had revealed their strength to the outside world.
There were many low-key ones who had not, and the outside world knew
very little about them. For example, the Ninedust Sectlord was
roughly on par with Daolord Dustrain but very few people knew about
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m quite sorry,
but my true body has departed some time ago along with my wife for
some sightseeing.” Daolord Badlands’ avatar swept the distant
skies with his gaze. “Fellow Daoist Dustrain and the other fellow
Daoists off in the distance… I know why all of you have come! The
strange and incredible happenings within the Waveshift Realm are
indeed related to me. However, I swear on my very life itself that
neither I nor Daolord Solesky have acquired so much as a single
Voidsea Jadeseal. Haha… Emperor Waveshift plotted all this out in
advance. There’s no way he would have let us acquire them with such
ease.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you wish to
attack, feel free to go ahead and wipe out my avatar. However… I,
Badlands, will make it known to all of you that if anyone actually
dares to attack, I will repay you tenfold!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His words complete,
Daolord Badlands turned and headed right back into the Badlands
Court. He didn’t so much as glance at the many Daolords who had
arrived, nor did he pay any attention to Fiendqueen Dustrain in the
skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Fiendqueen
Dustrain had an ugly look on her face, and the other Daolords off in
the distance were all hesitating. They didn’t fear death, but… if
Badlands had already decided to ignore them, what were they supposed
to do? There was no point in destroying his avatar; that would be a
meaningless act.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And, if Daolord
Badlands really did elect on taking revenge, he would become a very
frightening foe. This would be doubly true once he became a Daolord
of the Fourth Step. By then, he would be the number one master of the
Dao of Numerancy within the Endless Territories. Not even Hegemons
would be able to prevent him from taking revenge upon his foes!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems that our
only choice is to enter the Waveshift Realm. If we go in ahead of the
others, our chances might be a bit higher.” Fiendqueen Dustrain
pondered for a moment within the skies, then turned and flew straight
towards the Waveshift Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the Badlands
Court was located within the Badlands Everworld, given that Daolord
Badlands had made his position clear and had left merely an avatar
behind, there really was no one who chose to attack him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If his true body was
here, he probably would’ve been captured long ago. But just an
avatar…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, Daolord
Badlands had a sufficiently fearsome reputation and was able to deter
these people. Vastheaven Palace, however, did not.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I just received word
that Daolord Badlands has merely left his avatar to stand guard over
the Badlands Court. However, if anyone dares to attack the Badlands
Court, he will repay the attacker tenfold in the future.” Two
Daolords were chatting as they strode side-by-side through the void.
A dimensional tunnel surrounded them, and they were walking straight
through it with no need for a spacetime transfer array.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That was a pretty
nasty move!” One of the Daolords was dressed in dark-red armor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems our only
choice is to see if we can get any information from Daolord Solesky.”
The other Daolord was dressed in gray robes, and he let out a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re quite close
to the Vastheaven Territory. Given your mastery over the Dao of
Space, brother Soletruth, we should be able to get there quite
quickly. In roughly two or so weeks, we should reach Vastheaven
Palace. We might even be the first ones there.” The dark-red
armored Daolord said coldly, “For the sake of the Daomerge, we have
no choice but to employ unpleasant means against Vastheaven Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed. Daolord
Solesky is the only Verge-level Daolord who has entered as of late,
and he certainly knows more about the Waveshift Realm than most. Even
if he simply gives us an intelligence report regarding the place,
it’ll make our trip into the Waveshift Realm much simpler and our
chances of acquiring the Voidsea Jadeseals much higher,” the
gray-robed Daolord said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With so many Daolords
heading to the Waveshift Realm, they really weren’t confident in
their own chances at all. There were far, far too many who were more
powerful than them. However, if they were able to acquire some
information in advance, they might have a shot!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A few days later.
“We’re about to reach Vastheaven Palace,” the gray-robed
Daolord Soletruth said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Vastheaven Palace…”
A flicker of cold light flashed through the dark-red armored
Daolord’s eyes. They would force the information out of Solesky, no
matter what they had to do.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The weather was clear
this day, and the skies were like an enormous, beautiful bowl of
azure porcelain. The wind was blowing through this world, and two
figures were slowly walking through the skies. They could already see
Vastheaven Palace up ahead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve reached
Vastheaven Palace.” The dark-red armored Daolord was slightly
excited. “Our best chances lie within Vastheaven Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” The
gray-robed Daolord nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go call him
out. I refuse to believe that old bastard would dare to refuse us.”
A flicker of a murderous intent could be seen in the dark-red armored
Daolord’s eyes. They had come here to force Solesky to give them
what they wanted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“SOLESKY!” After
having flown slightly closer, the armored Daolord let out a loud call
that echoed within the heavens, causing an invisible but baleful aura
to spread outwards from him and cover the entire Vastheaven Palace.
“SOLESKY! GET OUT HERE!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a palace
courtyard. Ning, Solesky, Battlemaster, and Brightfish were all
present. All four of them had only left their avatars behind, and the
vast majority of the Vastheaven Palace’s disciples had departed
already. The only ones left behind were some disciples who had many
clones, as well as a few servants.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Solesky! Get out
here!” A loud bellow rang out from outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here they come.”
Daolord Solesky let out a cold snort. “So someone has finally
arrived.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Battlemaster, and
Brightfish all had mixed looks on their faces. They had predicted
long ago that trouble was coming for Vastheaven Palace, as there
would definitely be some Daolords who would come for Daolord Solesky!
In addition, some were located fairly close by. Some would move
quickly while others would move more slowly, but in the end there
would be many batches of them. Clearly, the first batch of Daolords
had arrived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go take a
look and see who it is.” Daolord Solesky arose and walked outside,
with Ning, Battlemaster, and Brightfish following behind him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.
Whoosh. All four Daolord avatars flew out into the skies, remaining
within the protective embrace of Vastheaven Palace as they stared at
the two distant figures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s Daolord
Soletruth and Daolord Mistbearer.” Daolord Solesky’s face
tightened slightly as he sent mentally to the other three, “Daolord
Soletruth is skilled in the Dao of Space and is an extremely
troublesome foe, while Daolord Mistbearer is silled in close combat.
These two are both on par with me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood. These
two Daolords weren’t all that powerful; they were merely on the
same level as Solesky and Patriarch Clearwind. The weaker ones
wouldn’t even try to come here, while there were only a few strong
ones; they would need time to make it here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Soletruth.
Mistbearer. Why have you two come to Vastheaven Palace?” Daolord
Solesky barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop pretending. Are
you trying to tell me that you don’t know why we are here?” The
distant dark-red armored Daolord Mistbearer let out an angry snarl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is it about the
Waveshift Realm?” Daolord Solesky said, “I can swear a lifeblood
oath that I do not have any Voidsea Jadeseals right now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I guessed as much.”
Daolord Mistbearer smirked. “There’s no way the jade seals left
behind by Emperor Waveshift would be obtained so easily. However… I
need all of the information you know regarding the Waveshift Realm.
So long as you provide that to us, the two of us will leave
immediately.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky let out
a cold snort. “That’s a nice dream you are having. Do the two of
you really think you have what it takes?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He and Daolord Badlands
had spent many tens of thousands of years braving the dangers of that
place and searching laboriously for as much information they could
find. It was all thanks to Daolord Badlands’ repeated usage of
Numerancy divination that hey had learned so many of the secrets of
the Waveshift Realm. How could they just send this information out to
others?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is an item we
acquired last time we adventured through the Terror Starsea.” The
distant Daolord Mistbearer produced a strange stone globe that was
covered with many complex runes that faintly emanated a terrifying
aura of power. “If I crush this item, I’ll be able to annihilate
the entire Vastheaven Palace. If you refuse to give me the
information I need, I’ll have no choice but to use it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak!” The
gray-robed Daolord said coldly, “Will you give us the information
or not?”

Chapter 19 - For the Daomerge
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” The
Daolords of Vastheaven Palace, including Ji Ning, Daolord
Battlemaster, Daolord Solesky, and Daolord Brightfish were all
shocked. They stared intently at the stone globe held in the hands of
Daolord Mistbearer. All of them could sense the faint aura of
terrifying power emanating from the stone globe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Daolord
Mistbearer actually has an item like this?” Daolord Solesky and the
others turned pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were actually
quite a number of Dao-seals and other strange curios which had been
created by Eternal Emperors and had slowly accumulated over time.
This was particularly true for the Terror Starsea, which had been the
battlefield of the Dawn War. There were many, many treasures there
that were capable of unleashing terrifying levels of power. However,
acquiring these treasures was quite difficult. Most Daolords of the
Fourth Step did not have access to such treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolords on the level
of Solesky, Patriarch Clearwind, and Daolord Mistbearer had been
alive for quite some time. If they dared to go out adventuring and
lived to tell the tale, they would generally end up with one or two
of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Experts on the level of
Kongsan had been alive for even longer. They would generally have
nine or ten such items on them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the likes of
King Gorsch or Palace Lord Dawnstar, the most powerful of Daolords?
They were capable of slaying ordinary Eternal Emperors with ease. A
casual blow from them was more than enough to annihilate Vastheaven
Palace and held as much power as those strange artifacts and
Dao-seals. Thus, those things were of very little use to them! Only
precious Hegemon-created items were of interest and use to them, but
those were incredibly rare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These curios were
divided into many different types, such as defensive, fleeing,
karmic, illusory, offensive, and more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Mistbearer
actually has a treasure meant for attacking.” Daolord Solesky was
rather anxious now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This treasure is
very important to Daolord Mistbearer. The handsome Daolord Brightfish
sent mentally, “But for the sake of the Daomerge, he’s gone
berserk. He really would be willing to use this treasure up!
Everyone, what should we do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me give it a try
first,” Daolord Battlemaster said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four Daolords of
Vastheaven Palace stared at the two enemy Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoists.”
Daolord Battlemaster called out in a loud voice, “I imagine you
have also received word that Daolord Badlands has left the Badlands
Court long ago! Vastheaven Palace isn’t staffed by fools either;
our brothers have also left long ago. The four of us are merely
avatars! Even if you use up that treasure and destroy Vastheaven
Palace, you’d at most be able to destroy our avatars. We’re more
than capable of enduring such minor losses.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Mistbearer and
Daolord Soletruth radiated surging, murderous auras from their
position in the skies. Daolord Mistbearer said coldly, “The
creation of Vastheaven Palace involved you spending enormous amounts
of effort in setting up its protective formations. The materials
needed to create four avatars were also extremely costly, not to
mention the time spent in nurturing them. Would you really just give
them up like that?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For the sake of the
Daomerge, we are indeed willing to give them all up.”’ Daolord
Battlemaster smiled. “I have an idea. Let us have both sides take a
step back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Daolord
Mistbearer and Daolord Soletruth exchanged a glance. “Speak!”
Daolord Mistbearer commanded coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Vastheaven Palace is
willing to hand over an intelligence report containing information
regarding the Waveshift Realm,” Daolord Battlemaster said. “While
it won’t include everything big brother Solesky knows, it’ll
still be far more than what the rest of the universe knows about the
Waveshfit Realm. What do you think? If the two of you accept, we’ll
give you the report right away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It has to include
everything Daolord Solesky knows!” Daolord Mistbearer shouted
coldly. As his voice boomed out, an infinitely vast wave of blood
appeared out of nowhere, sweeping through the skies and surrounding
the entirety of Vastheaven Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Mistbearer’s
murderous aura flared as he roared, “If you refuse, die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Solesky, stop
struggling,” Daolord Soletruth barked as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are going too
far!” Daolord Battlemaster said coldly, “My big brother and
Daolord Badlands experienced countless travails in order to find this
information. You want them to hand it all over? Impossible!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you take the two
of us for fools? Emperor Waveshift was the creator of the Waveshift
Realm. He was and remains the most skilled expert in the Dao of the
Numerancy the Endless Territories has ever seen. The Waveshift Realm
is filled with many dangers and is incredibly complex. If you just
give us a portion of your information, it’ll be of negligible use
to us.” Daolord Soletruth said coldly, “Battlemaster, stop
playing games with us. We aren’t fools. You have two options before
you. To hand it over, or to not hand it over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will claim the
life of anyone who dares to bar my Daomerge!” The distant Daolord
Mistbearer raised the stone globe up high with one hand, his voice
filled with murder. “I’ll give you three seconds to consider
this. If you refuse, I’ll wipe you out!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Mistbearer
stood there in the skies, surrounded by endless surging waves of
blood, the stone globe held up high and flaring in one final warning.
For the sake of the Daomerge, he wouldn’t show any mercy at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…” Solesky,
Battlemaster, and Brightfish all turned pale. As for Ning, he had a
complex look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone shares the
same concern - the Daomerge. Why must we be like this? This stroke of
Daomerge-related fortune belongs to my big brother. Today, you come
to pressure him; tomorrow, others will do the same. Are we to
repeatedly give way and just hand this opportunity over to others?”
Ning shook his head. “You two should leave. If you refuse to leave,
I’ll have no choice but to attack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack?” The two
distant Daolords were both startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face gradually
turned cold. “Leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of the two
distant Daolords turned grim. They were slowly beginning to sense the
threat that Ning posed them. Previously, Ning had not yet wished them
dead… but now that he did, the sense of danger radiating from him
grew significantly stronger. Ning’s avatar was roughly on par with
them; if his true body was here, the sense of danger would have been
much stronger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No one can bar my
path to the Daomerge.” Daolord Mistbearer and Daolord Soletruth
shared a glance, but neither hesitated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hand over the report
or prepare to do battle!” Daolord Mistbearer roared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A flicker of a
murderous light flashed through Ning’s cold eyes. An invisible
surge of power instantly sprang out, separating into two streams that
smashed directly against the souls and the truesouls of the two
Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartforce Eradicator!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…” A hint of
terror and disbelief flashed through Daolord Mistbearer’s eyes
before his gaze turned completely dull and lifeless. His corpse began
to fall down from the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s a Heartforce
Cultivator!” The gray-robed Daolord Soletruth’s face turned
bone-white, but he was able to endure the [Heartforce Eradicator]
attack. He stared at Ning in horror. That heartforce attack had been
absolutely terrifying; it was only thanks to his strong Dao-heart
that he had managed to survive! However, he knew that Heartforce
Cultivators possessed many strange and unpredictable techniques, and
they didn’t really rely on such brutish attacks. They primarily
relied on illusions and bewildering spells… and if this Daolord’s
brute-force attacks were already this powerful, how devilish would
his illusions be? Even an instant of distraction could very well
prove fatal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and flee.”
Daolord Soletruth no longer cared about anything else. He hurriedly
waved his hand. Whoosh! A dazzling rainbow dimensional tunnel
instantly appeared next to him, and he hurriedly dove into it and
began to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A tear in space
appeared within a region of primordial chaos more than twenty
territories away. Moments later, the gray-robed and rather
bedraggled-looking Daolord Soletruth jumped out of it, a stunned look
on his face. “He’s actually a Heartforce Cultivator. The newest
Daolord of Vastheaven Palace, Daolord Darknorth… a completely
unremarkable person I’ve heard almost nothing about… is actually
a Heartforce Cultivator. And a terrifyingly strong one at that! He
was able to kill brother Mistbearer with a thought. Ugh. Brother
Mistbearer’s Dao-heart was rather lacking, due to his excessively
murderous impulses.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I never would’ve
imagined that the most powerful member of Vastheaven Palace would be
Daolord Darknorth, rather than Daolord Solesky.” Daolord Soletruth
let out a soft sigh. “Things are going to be complicated now.
Everyone thought that Vastheaven Palace would be easy to deal with,
but who would’ve thought such a terrifying figure would exist
within it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone agreed that
Heartforce Cultivators were notoriously difficult to deal with.
Unless absolutely necessary, no one would willingly make an enemy out
of one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside Vastheaven
Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The corpse of Daolord
Mistbearer continued its descent through the skies. As for Daolords
Solesky, Battlemaster, and Brightfish, all three of them stared at
Ning in disbelief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All this is due to
the Daomerge…” Ning shook his head, then waved his hand and
collected the falling corpse of Daolord Mistbearer. Ning then turned
around, only to see the other three staring straight at him.
“Something wrong? I’m just collecting his corpse. We can split
the treasures later,” Ning grinned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop joking.”
Daolord Solesky flew straight towards Ning, then grabbed him by the
shoulders. “Ji Ning, y-you… you are a Heartforce Cultivator?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. You are
actually a Heartforce Cultivator?” Battlemaster and Brightfish were
quite excited as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
“Right! Previously, I’ve been spending all my attention on
strengthening my avatar. As soon as I left seclusion, this happened.
I didn’t even have a chance to talk to any of you. However, better
late than never!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not late. Not late
at all!” Daolord Brightfish was quite excited. “I never imagined
that Vastheaven Palace would produce a Heartforce Cultivator! Haha.
Who in the outside world would dare to belittle us in the future?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I always thought
that you were a genius of the Dao of the Sword.” Daolord Solesky
stared intently at Ning, also quite excited. “I never would’ve
imagined that you’d actually be a Heartforce Cultivator, and that
you’d be even more formidable in this area than you are in the Dao
of the Sword. You slew Daolord Mistbearer with just a glance!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but say, “Actually… my Sword Dao is slightly stronger than my
heartforce.”

Chapter 20 - Daolord Darknorth’s Name
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Sword Dao is
stronger than your heartforce?” Daolord Solesky stared at Ji Ning
in astonishment. He couldn’t help but ask, “Ji Ning, what level
have you reached, exactly?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I might not be able
to beat the most powerful Daolords, but escaping them should be no
problem at all,” Ning said. In truth, Ning now stood at the very
peak of power amongst second-tier Daolords. He was now much stronger
than Kongsan had ever been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if he fought
against first-tier Daolords like King Gorsch, he might win if their
Dao-hearts were weak! If their Dao-hearts were weak and they were
trapped by his illusions, then he would have a chance of beating them
as well. However, the vast majority of supreme Daolords had extremely
powerful Dao-hearts, and so he would be unable to do anything to most
of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, Ning had his
Hegemon armor and was extremely skilled at staying alive. He also had
his nine novessence arts, his heartworld projection, his ability to
transcend space, and more. There really were few to no Daolords who
could do anything to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“B-but…” Daolord
Solesky was rather flabbergasted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, how did
you suddenly become a Heartforce Cultivator?” Daolord Battlemaster
was quite curious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Early on as a
cultivator, I actually improved even more quickly in heartforce than
I did in the Dao of the Sword.” A reminiscent look was in Ning’s
eyes. “Afterwards, some events cast a shadow over my heart,
resulting in me being unable to improve my heartforce at all. This
time, I had some lucky encounters and was able to break through in
heartforce and establish a heartworld. As a result, my heartworld
naturally began to expand and grow, allowing me to reach my current
level of power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A master of both the
Sword Dao and heartforce. Impressive, truly impressive,” Daolord
Brightfish said as he sighed in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartforce Cultivators
were famous for their bizarre, nerve-wracking techniques. If a
Heartforce Cultivator was also skilled in close combat, he’d become
absolutely terrifying to deal with. This was just the type of person
Ning was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, right.
Darknorth, why did you release Daolord Soletruth just now?” Daolord
Brightfish quickly added, “I could vaguely sense that you only
attacked a single time, and you didn’t use any illusions at all?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded. “Since he was able to survive my [Heartforce Eradicator], I
decided to spare his life. He’ll definitely go tell his Verge-level
friends about what happened today and warn them, and those friends
will in turn warn their own friends. Thus, word will quickly spread,
ensuring that the vast majority of Verge-level Daolords will know
better than to come here and cause trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning’s choice
was correct. We can’t be forced to deal with one Daolord
troublemaker after another,” Daolord Solesky said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.”
Battlemaster said worriedly, “The vast majority of Daolords might
be too scared to come, but those who do dare to come will be tough to
deal with.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then I’ll simply
kill them.” A murderous light flashed through Ning’s eyes. “We’ll
see who is stronger.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning still felt quite
confident in his chances. His Daolord avatar was a Ki Refiner, a
Fiendgod Refiner, and a Heartforce Cultivator! He was able to use
divine abilities and secret arts. However, Ning realized that there
was no way to duplicate his Nine Chaos Seals upon his avatar, and his
avatar only contained an extremely small part of his soul. This was
why his avatar was still significantly weaker than his true body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Any living being’s
core essence came from his soul and truesoul. If the soul or truesoul
was extinguished, the cultivator would die. Generally speaking, if
your soul and truesoul were weak, the amount of divine power,
Immortal energy, and heartforce in your body would also be
correspondingly weak. It would be very hard for you to remain in top
condition! Thus, you needed to stay in contact with your true body’s
soul and ensure that both souls were nurtured.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the reason why
Daolords generally would at most maintain a single avatar at any
point in time. It wasn’t easy keeping an avatar’s soul in peak
condition, and it was quite time-consuming as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, if you
had a Primaltwin, you would be able to maintain a second avatar. Ning
had both a true body and a Primaltwin, and his Primaltwin’s soul
was just as strong as his true body’s. Both souls were inextricably
linked. However, Ning chose to only maintain a single avatar, using
both his true body and his Primaltwin’s souls to nurture it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a result, Ning’s
avatar was comparatively more powerful than that of most Daolord
avatars. If the Northbow swords were excluded from the equation, his
avatar was roughly 70% as strong as his true body!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His avatar held other
advantages as well. Avatars were created from magic treasures that
were covered with formations, and they could be infused with prime
essences just like lifeblood treasures. Ning’s avatar contained the
essence of his Omega Sword Dao, and the special properties which all
avatars had ensured that he was able to perfectly link up with the
local formations and become part of them. When reinforced by those
formations, his power was comparable to that of his true body!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the reason why
many Daolords had their avatars stand guard over their homes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s predictions
were spot-on. After fleeing for his life, Daolord Soletruth did
indeed warn his best friends, who in turn warned their best friends.
Word quickly spread at a viral rate, and both Vastheaven Palace and
the Badlands Court became centers of attention for the countless
Daolords of the Endless Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Badlands of the
Badlands Court had gone into hiding with his wife. Nobody could find
them. The only chance the comparatively weaker Daolords had lay in
Vastheaven Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! A Heartforce
Cultivator?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was able to slay
Daolord Mistbearer from afar with but a thought? Daolord Soletruth
was just barely able to stay alive?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His avatar alone is
already that powerful?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s the name of
this terrifying Heartforce Cultivator of Vastheaven Palace?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth! His name
is Darknorth!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Word quickly began to
spread. When Ning had slain Kongsan, he hadn’t gone out of his way
to reveal himself, and so there really were very few who knew that he
was the killer. As a result, he had little to no reputation in the
Endless Territories. However, the incredible results he had displayed
with merely an avatar instantly shocked countless Daolords. He hadn’t
even really fought! He had wiped out Daolord Mistbearer with but a
casual look!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This battle brought him
instant fame! Finally, Ning had become truly famous within the
Endless Territories. Countless Daolords now knew of a terrifying
Heartforce Cultivator known as Daolord Darknorth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An ordinary chaosworld.
An ordinary mortal city.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Badlands and
his wife were living within a mountain villa inside this city, living
a relaxed life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s that?
Daolord Darknorth has become a Heartforce Cultivator? He wiped out
Daolord Mistbearer with just his avatar?” Daolord Badlands had been
sipping wine in a leisurely manner, but he suddenly revealed a
shocked look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What did you just
say, husband? Daolord Darknorth?” His beautiful wife was shocked as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Daolord
Darknorth. Remember him? The Ji Ning kid who once stayed in our
Badlands Court for a short period of time? As I recall, when he
arrived in the Badlands Court he was merely an Elder God. Only after
returning from the Allgod Estate did he become a World-level
cultivator. It feels like it was just yesterday that he was at the
World level! Now, he’s actually able to wipe out the likes of
Daolord Mistbearer with a thought while just using his avatar? He’s
definitely much more powerful than I am.” Daolord Badlands was
quite stunned. He was skilled in Numerancy, but Numerancy didn’t
confer omniscience upon him. The more talented and powerful a
cultivator was, the harder it would be to divine his fate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If his avatar is
already this powerful, how impressive must his true body be?” His
wife was stunned as well. “He’s reached such incredible levels of
power despite having trained for a very short period of time… in
the future, he will most assuredly become one of the most supreme
Daolords of all the Endless Territories.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even today, there
are no Daolords who would dare to underestimate him.” Daolord
Badlands shook his head. “Because… he is a Heartforce
Cultivator.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Brightshore
Kingdom’s intelligence network was similarly quick,and word quickly
spread to them as well. The Twelve Palaces of the Brightshore Kingdom
were filled with commotion as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth of
the Sword Palace has ended up becoming a Heartforce Cultivator?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From what I’ve
heard, his Sword Dao is incredibly powerful. How is it that he became
so formidable in heartforce as well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Solewind of
the Heartforce Palace might be extremely talented, but I don’t
think he’s strong enough to use his avatar to wipe out Daolord
Mistbearer with a thought.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth has become
a Heartforce Cultivator?” Prince Greatjoy had just returned to the
Brightshore Kingdom when he heard this news. He revealed a hint of a
smile on his face. “Interesting. I never would’ve thought that of
the four of us who went to the alternate universe, Darknorth would
end up taking the lead. It seems I need to work even harder…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Beneath the leaves of a
strange, fiery-red tree that was more than ten million kilometers
tall sat a skinny bald youth. The youth had a smile on his face, but
his eyes were closed as he trained there silently. His upper body was
covered with fiery red divine runes which seemed linked to the
enormous flaming tree behind him. The runes would sometimes spread
out while at other times clustering together…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Solewind
opened his eyes, then smiled. “Brother Darknorth has actually
become a Heartforce Cultivator, and a powerful one at that? I had
thought that I was doing fairly well for myself, after having created
a secret art comparable to the [Featherdress Soulthrall Song]. I
didn’t expect that brother Darknorth would not only become a
Heartforce Cultivator but become even more powerful than me in this
area.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Solewind was actually
incredibly talented in heartforce. When he had been at the World
level, he had been on par with monstrously talented figures like
Greatjoy and Ji Ning. After becoming a Daolord, he would be able to
easily reach the Verge and become one of the most powerful of
Heartforce Cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Genesis Lands,
he had acquired a legacy left behind by a Heartforce Hegemon. He
naturally had an extraordinary destiny ahead of him, and he had
already created a secret art that was on par with the [Featherdress
Soulthrall Song]. Although he had only created the early stages of
it, his foundation was already quite solid.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more solid your
foundation was, the slower and steadier your training would be. At
present, Solewind was also just a Daolord of the Second Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No. No way.
Impossible. How can he be this much more powerful than me?!”
Firesurge was located within a tattered shrine, and he was bellowing
with rage. “Impossible! I’ve been working so hard. Why is it that
he’s pulling farther and farther away from me?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the four peerless
geniuses who had visited the alternate universe, Firesurge had the
weakest mind and Dao-heart. He had always felt certain that he would
become the strongest, and had been working hard this entire time. He
was now quite powerful… but Darknorth, a master of the Dao of the
Sword, had somehow ended up becoming a Heartforce Cultivator, and
reached incredibly terrifying heights in heartforce at that.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The news quickly spread
throughout the universe, and everyone had a different reaction to it.
Ning’s primary goal was achieved - the vast majority of Daolords
shrank back. Very, very few had the courage and confidence needed to
fight a Heartforce Cultivator.

Chapter 21 - Sincerity
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A dimensional rift
appeared within a region which bordered both the Endless Territories
and the Terror Starsea. Two figures emerged from it, one a
white-robed youth who carried a golden sheath on his back, the second
an insidious-looking silver-robed man who radiated an aura of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We finally made it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, I didn’t
expect things would progress this smoothly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the
Ninedust Sectlord both sighed in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of us were
so worried about dying at first.” The Ninedust Sectlord laughed.
“Thank goodness Patriarch Vulturas gave us that star map, and thank
goodness your sword-arts have transcended space, Darknorth. And thank
goodness you are also a Heartforce Cultivator!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We also need to
celebrate our good fortune. The Starflow River was supposed to be the
most dangerous part of the journey, but we were so lucky that we
didn’t run into anything dangerous at all,” Ning sighed happily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their good luck had
combined with many other factors, allowing them to survive their
return to the Endless Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, come! We need
to make haste. We wasted sixty years after leaving Thundersouth
Palace, and we’re still quite far from the Waveshift Realm. We’ve
already wasted so much time, and if we waste any more the Voidsea
Jadeseals will probably end up being taken by those who arrived early
on,” the Ninedust Sectlord said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No rush,” Ning
said. “I have a very quick way of travelling straight to the
Waveshift Realm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A very quick way?”
The Ninedust Sectlord stared at Ning, puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Through the
spacetime tunnels of the Brightshore Kingdom.” Ning immediately
added, “Brother Ninedust, I never spoke to you about this, but…
although I am a member of the Dao Alliance, as a World-level
cultivator I was abducted to the Brightshore Kingdom. Thus, I’m a
member of the Twelve Palaces of Brightshore.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Brightshore
Kingdom? You belong to them?” The Ninedust Sectlord was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
Their journey back from the Terror Starsea had been a dangerous one,
with life-threatening situations possibly occurring at any moment. In
order to avoid any mistrust and anything that could affect their
ability to work together, Ning had stayed silent this entire time
about his true status. Now that they had shared so many
life-and-death experiences for so long, he truly didn’t wish to
keep this hidden.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Y-you…” The
Ninedust Sectlord had a rather complicated look on his face. He then
let out a helpless sigh. “Thankfully you are merely a member of the
Twelve Palaces. If you were a member of the Brightshore Imperials,
I’d really have no clue what to do. The Brightshore Imperials have
always been enemies of us Ancient cultivators. We’ve been fighting
each other for countless chaos cycles.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. The
Brightshore Imperials had once been the slaves of the Ancient
cultivators, which they viewed as the greatest stain on their honor.
It wasn’t at all odd that the successive generations of Brightshore
Imperials had all viewed the Ancient cultivators as their enemies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Brightshore
Hegemon is absolutely shameless.” The Ninedust Sectlord gritted his
teeth, hard. “Of the three Hegemons, he’s the most shameless! He
relies on his incredible mastery over spacetime to abduct some of the
most powerful World-level cultivators of the Endless Territories. If
it wasn’t for the Twelve Palaces of Brightshore, the Brightshore
Kingdom wouldn’t have the status and standing it currently does.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had to acknowledge
this as being true. In terms of Daolords, the Twelve Palaces of
Brightshore had far more members than the Brightshore Imperials. The
Twelve Palaces often numbered one or more of the top three Daolords
of each era within their ranks… and they even had Eternal Emperors!
By comparison, the imperial clan was much weaker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It doesn’t matter.
You remain a brother for life,” the Ninedust Sectlord declared.
“And given my current level of power, I really don’t worry about
those Brightshore Imperials at all. Don’t worry. I won’t make
things difficult for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately let
out a sigh of relief. If Ninedust ended up in a battle against the
Brightshore Imperials, the lifeblood oath Ning had sworn would force
him to protect the Brightshore imperials. Ninedust was making his
position clear in order to avoid precisely this type of awkward
situation. Indeed, given Ninedust’s standing amongst at the very
peak of power amongst Daolords, there really were few to no
Brightshore Imperials who were a match for him, and not a single one
who could truly threaten him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that he was a
Daolord of the Fourth Step, the Ninedust Sectlord’s ‘invulnerable
aquaform’ was far more powerful than Kongsan’s ‘darkness
incarnate’ form had been. In a normal battle, no Daolord was
capable of annihilating him when he assumed that form. In truth, all
of the most supreme Daolords had their own special talents, and all
of them were generally quite hard to deal with. The only ones capable
of threatening them were the most supreme of Heartforce Daolords, who
were able to use techniques that struck at their very souls and
truesouls. Those attacks still proved dangerous to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Featherdress
had created the [Featherdress Soulthrall Song] and become
acknowledged as the most powerful of Daolords. The other supreme
Daolords were unwilling to fight against her precisely because of her
heartforce abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you,
Ninedust,” Ning said gratefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cut that out. We are
brothers!” The Ninedust Sectlord shook his head and smiled. After
having travelled with Ning for so long, he truly felt that Ning was a
person worthy of being his lifelong friend. “Darknorth, you spoke
of using the Brightshore Kingdom’s spacetime tunnels… given who I
am, it probably wouldn’t be easy for me to enter them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When we get there,
I’ll have to trouble you to hide within one of my estate-world’s
for a time,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The
Ninedust Sectlord nodded. The two were very close to each other, and
they both naturally swore lifeblood oaths after having decided to go
to the Waveshift Realm together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the best of
friends would generally rely on lifeblood oaths to bind each other,
as it was possible for even lifelong brothers to turn on each other
for the sake of treasures involving the Daomerge. To avoid such
disastrous outcomes, most would rely upon lifeblood oaths to keep
everyone honest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning and Ninedust
were hastening to the Waveshift Realm, yet another danger befell
Vastheaven Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Vastheaven Palace.”
A white-robed elder had just arrived at the Vastheaven Everworld. He
stood at the peak of a mountain, staring at the distant Vastheaven
Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hear that
Vastheaven Palace has gained a Heartforce Cultivator.” A look of
absolute self-confidence was in the white-robed elder’s eyes. Due
to certain choices he had made in his path of cultivation, he didn’t
fear Heartforce Cultivators at all. “My home was too far away from
the Waveshift Realm! I’m definitely going to arrive much later than
the other Daolords. If I can procure the information regarding the
Waveshift Realm which Daolord Solesky has, I might be able to acquire
one of those jade seals even though I’ll arrive later than the
others.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed elder
strode forwards through the skies, each step causing ripples of light
to spread out. Soon, he arrived in the skies above Vastheaven Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth. Solesky.
Are you present?” the white-robed elder asked calmly. Rumble… his
voice echoed within the skies around the area. A short while later,
four figures flew out of Vastheaven Palace. It was Ji Ning, Daolord
Solesky, Daolord Battlemaster, and Daolord Brightfish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All avatars.” The
white-robed elder glanced at them, then shook his head and frowned.
Avatars were disposable. Each one represented ten million cubes of
chaos nectar and quite a bit of effort, but for the sake of the
Daomerge… even fairly poor Daolords like Solesky and Battlemaster
would just grit their teeth and bear it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Him? The ‘Junior
Radiant King’?” Daolord Solesky’s face turned white.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s actually
him?” The faces of Ning and the others turned pale as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amongst the supreme
Daolords of the Endless Territories, there was a particularly
powerful Daolord who had been given the respectful title of the
Radiant King. He was a terrifying Daolord who was ranked third in the
Endless Territories. As for the ‘Junior Radiant King’, he
belonged to the same race as the Radiant King but was slightly
weaker, ranking amongst the second-tier Daolords. However, he stood
at the very peak of power amongst the second-tier Daolords and was
considerably stronger than Kongsan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them
belonged to the same race and used similar techniques. The Junior
Radiant King’s true Daoist title was actually Yanmi. He could thus
be addressed as Daolord Yanmi, but most simply referred to him as the
Junior Radiant King.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m sure you know
that my heart is like light itself. You will be unable to shake my
heart unless your heartforce skills have reached a truly unfathomable
peak,” the white-robed elder said calmly. “For me, wiping out
Vastheaven Palace is a very easy task. Solesky, I imagine you know
why I am here. Give me everything you know about the Waveshift Realm,
or I will have no choice but to attack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky had an
ugly look on his face. Battlemaster and Brightfish were both anxious
as well. They had guessed long ago that the power Ning had displayed
was enough to scare off the vast majority of Daolords, but… this
concerned the Voidsea Jadeseals! Perhaps the supreme Daolords who
were completely confident in their abilities would head straight to
the Waveshift Realm, but the ones who were slightly less confident
would all come here to try their luck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And indeed, it was a
matter of trying their luck. Everyone knew that the chances of
Solesky handing the information over was quite low… but for the
sake of the Daomerge, they would still give a try, no matter how low
their chances were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Seeing the
looks on the faces of the four, the white-robed elder let out a cold
snort. Whoosh! He suddenly seemed transformed into a dazzling sun
that radiated eye-piercing radiance. His light stretched out into
infinity as multiple clones of him seemed to appear. Countless clones
of him quickly filled the skies, resulting in what seemed like
trillions of white-robed elders appearing above and surrounding the
four Vastheaven Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you don’t hand
the information over, I’ll have no choice but to wipe you out and
destroy Vastheaven Palace!” The trillions of white-robed old men
all spoke out at the same time, their voices booming in the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Yanmi, if
you wish to wipe out Vastheaven Palace, you need to ask me for
permission first!” Ji Ning’s cold voice rang out in response.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 22 - A Clash
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless
white-robed elders standing in midair all turned to stare directly at
Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth?”
The countless white-robed elders smirked. “I’ve heard long ago
that the newest Daolord of Vastheaven Palace, Daolord Darknorth, is
an incredible figure who is also a Heartforce Cultivator! Then… let
me see just how much ability you have, Daolord Darknorth. I have
countless clones right now. Are you able to find the real me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning let
out a cold snort. BOOM! The surrounding area of countless kilometers
around began to tremble and rumble as an enormous illusion of a world
manifested above. This vast world had valleys, rivers, seas,
mountains, and an extremely prominent and utterly enormous
sword-shaped mountain at the very center of it. The enormous
heartworld projection came crashing straight down!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless mountains
in the surrounding area were instantly crushed into dust, almost as
though an enormous hand had just slapped down upon them. The
heartworld projection had descended!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless
white-robed elders who had been glowing with light were also put
under incredible pressure. Ning’s heartworld projection was on par
with his nine novessence arts and possessed incredible power. One
white-robed elder after another disappeared like popping bubbles, and
soon a mere 529 white-robed elders remained in the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Looks of
astonishment appeared simultaneously upon the faces of the remaining
529 elders. “What a powerful heartworld projection!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of a
heartworld projection was a testament to the power of a cultivator’s
heartworld. The greater the heartworld, the stronger the projection.
Ning’s powerful heartworld projection was incredible even amongst
Heartforce Cultivators; he could be considered as having reached the
second-tier!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s actually
managed to keep a few clones active.” Ning swept the 529
white-robed elders with his gaze. “The Junior Radiant King lives up
to his reputation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If the Radiant King
himself was present, you wouldn’t be able to wipe out a single one
of his clones,” the many white-robed elders smirked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps.” As
Ning’s words came out, his heartforce swept out yet again. It
lashed out like a wave towards the hundreds of white-robed elders,
only to discover that every single one of them stood in the path of
this wave. Clearly, every single white-robed elder contained part of
the old man’s soul and truesoul. Boom! Boom! Boom! Heartforce
Eradicator! Ning’s heartforce crashed directly against the soul and
truesoul of the white-robed elder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impressive. However,
you won’t be able to do anything to me. Prepare to receive my
blow!” The many white-robed elders all waved their hands, causing a
total of nine black swords to appear in the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother, stay
far away from me,” Ning warned mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood. Be
careful and don’t be reckless!” Daolords Solesky, Brightfish, and
Battlemaster all quickly retreated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them felt
nervous. This was going to be a dangerous battle. If Ning’s true
body was here, he would probably be able to win with ease, but he
only had an avatar which had 70% of his true power… and most
importantly of all, he didn’t have the Northbow swords! Ever since
those swords had drained so much golden sand from the shattered core
of that planet, they had evolved to reach a terrifying level of
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed elders
all separated as the nine black swords appeared in the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Which one is the
real one?” Ning was quite puzzled. Without question, the true body
was amongst the 529 and was controlling those nine divine black
swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unable to find my
true body? Feeling a bit anxious? Haha, I’m able to maintain more
than 500 clones, and you won’t know which one to attack. That’s
why it is guaranteed that you will lose this fight.” The hundreds
of white-robed elders all laughed and then roared, “Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the nine
divine black swords in the skies transformed into nine dark streaks
of light… or to be precise, they transformed into nine black
strands of silk! They moved at incredible speeds, at least fifty-nine
times the speed of light. And this was with them being pressured by
the heartworld projection! Otherwise, they would strike even faster.
According to the stories, the true Radiant King’s flying speed
alone had already surpassed the limit of a hundred times the speed of
light. The Junior Radiant King was naturally somewhat inferior in
comparison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m able to attack
you, but you aren’t able to attack me. You lost this battle before
it ever began, haha…” The many white-robed elders all laughed
loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Ning stood
there calmly despite facing the nine attacking black threads. Whoosh!
Whoosh! Streams of sword-intent began to manifest in the area around
him. All of them began to tangle together like a group of fish,
instantly forming an enormous vortex-world of Yin and Yang. This
enormous Yin-Yang world was centered around Ning, forcing any and all
attacks to go through it first.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was Ning’s
Yin-Yang Sword Domain! However, it was formed purely out of
sword-intent and not his nine novessence arts, and so they only had
20% of the power of the original.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
The nine black threads plunged directly into the Yin-Yang
vortex-world. Although they once more slowed down, they still quickly
reached Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuck off!” Ning
let out a loud shout as he slapped out with both hands at once.
KABOOM! His twin palms were like two enormous mountains slamming
outwards as he manifested the Heavenbreaker sword-intent of his Omega
Sword Dao. His two palms were indescribably large and filled with
overbearing brute force, but also moved in a unpredictable and
marvelous way. The Omega Sword Dao was a perfect whole, after all;
none of its stances, not even a brute-force one like this, contained
any ‘stupid’ or ‘clumsy’ weaknesses. Not only was this attack
ferocious, it was also unpredictable and marvelous. The nine black
threads were unable to avoid it and so were forced to strike those
two enormous palms head on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! A
series of explosions rang out as the nine black swords were all
knocked flying backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” The many
clones of the Junior Radiant King all had looks of shock on their
faces. “My nine swords are centered around the Dao of Light. They
are incredibly fast and attacked from different directions… but
none of them were able to avoid that attack?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could scarcely
believe it. But of course, he had no idea that Ning’s true skill
lay in close combat, thanks to his Dao of the Sword! The Dao of the
Sword was meant for combat, and Ning was the master of the Omega
Sword Dao; he had no flaws at all in close combat. Forget about nine
swords, even ninety-nine or more swords would be unable to penetrate
his airtight defenses. Ning hadn’t even had to use his defensive
Soleheart stance in order to deal with those nine swords; he had
fought them head-on! Clearly, they had posed no threat to him at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lightshadow!” A
baleful look was in the Junior Radiant King’s eyes. Instantly, the
nine black swords in the skies transformed into a total of 320 black
swords, every single one of which was able to endure the pressure of
the heartworld projection and survive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His heartworld
projection is incredibly strong. I’m normally able to manifest
countless sword-shadows, making my enemies unable to tell which are
real and which are fake, but his heartworld projection is making it
so that I’m only able to manifest a bit over three hundred.” The
white-robed elders all stared intently at Ning. “Try this a second
time!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
The 320 black swords transformed into black threads that once more
shot towards Ning. This time, the old man spread them out even
farther, making them attack Ning from every single direction, filling
the area around Ning from head to toe with attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there in the
air. Faced with this omnipresent attack, he simply waved his palms
again. Those two enormous palms struck out like two enormous wheels
that merged together into a whole, defeating all of the attacking
black swords and actually destroying a few of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was his Omega
Sword Dao - Yin-Yang! Although it was primarily a defensive stance,
it did have some offensive power built into it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What!? He withstood
it all?!” The many white-robed elders were all shocked and enraged.
“Then I’ll have no choice but to use my forbidden arts to kill
him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The white-robed
elder’s many clones all shone brightly. Countless streams of light
mixed together, causing the entire Vastheaven Everworld to be
illuminated by them! This light was so dazzling to behold that it
truly did light up every single corner of this entire everworld! The
weaker cultivators of the Vastheaven Everworld all raised their heads
to stare at the light in the skies, puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s going
all-out.” Seeing this, Ning realized that the white-robed elder’s
repeated failures had caused him to feel so anxious as to go all-out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is he going to use
the legendary [Lumislayer]?” This was Ning’s first guess. The
legendary Radiant King was ranked third amongst the Daolords of the
Endless Territories, while Palace Lord Dawnstar was ranked second.
Both, however, were actually on par with each other in power. The
Radiant King’s fame in the Endless Territories came from his three
supreme killing techniques, and not even ordinary Eternal Emperors
would dare receive these three blows head-on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to the
information on the star map which the Brightshore Kingdom had given
Ning, the Junior Radiant King, Daolord Yanmi, was able to use two of
those killer attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Omega Sword Dao
is the perfect Dao for combat. I want to see just how powerful these
so-called ‘killer attacks’ are!” Ning felt complete confidence
in himself and his chances, but the distant Daolords Solesky,
Battlemaster, and Brightfish were all filled with worry as they
watched from afar.

Chapter 23 - The Radiant King’s Three Killer Attacks
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many clones of the
Junior Radiant King, Daolord Yanmi, all glowed with dazzling light
that illuminated the entire Vastheaven Everworld. All of them shouted
out in unison: “DESTROY!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
BOOM! BOOM! All of the light that had been illuminating the
Vastheaven Everworld gathered together to form nine pillars of
radiance! The nine pillars of light each contained a sword in the
center, and they shot towards Ji Ning with terrifying and destructive
power. These nine light pillars didn’t really have anything
mysterious or profound to them; what they had was frontal,
overwhelming, crushing power! They were so powerful that the three
Vastheaven Daolords watching in the distance all turned pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just what I wanted.”
Ning laughed loudly as he once more struck out with his palms.
Whoosh! This time, an enormous black hole appeared in the area around
Ning that swallowed up everything in its path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! A
series of muffled, heavy collisions could be heard, but the black
hole around Ning didn’t dissipate in the slightest. “Hah! Is that
all you have?” Ning’s loud laughter rang out throughout the world
around them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Daolord
Yanmi was shocked. “Impossible. How could he have endured my attack
that easily? Even if his avatar is comparable to top-grade Eternal
treasures, he should’ve been blown backwards and been completely
unable to resist the power of my attack!” His plan had been to
knock Ning off his feet, then use his light to bind and tie down Ning
during Ning’s moment of helplessness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But… Ning had
actually taken his blow head-on?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can his avatar
be as powerful as this? If his true body was here, would he be
crushing me instead of vice-versa?” Daolord Yanmi could hardly
believe it. “This was one of the three killer attacks created by
the Radiant King, the [Lumislayer]. Although this is the weakest of
the three attacks, this result is still…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the light
vanished, and Ning’s true body appeared once more. He stared at
Daolord Yanmi, then shook his head. “Daolord Yanmi, you truly have
disappointed me. So this is the first of the three legendary killer
attacks of the Radiant King? If the Radiant King himself used this
[Lumislayer], not even Eternal Emperors would dare to receive it
head-on. But you… you are lacking by far.” Ning’s Omega Sword
Dao had reached the ultimate apex in both offense and defense. The
only way to breach his defense would be through an overwhelming
disparity in power. Clearly, although his avatar only had 70% of his
true body’s power, it was still roughly on par with Daolord Yanmi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He blocked it.”
Daolord Solesky let out a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth’s Sword
Dao truly is on par with his heartforce. He was actually able to
endure the [Lumislayer] with ease.” Daolord Brightfish sighed in
amazement. “He truly is incredible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But the situation is
still quite unfavorable for him.” Daolord Battlemaster frowned.
“The Junior Radiant King has manifested over five hundred clones.
Darknorth can do nothing but passively accept the man’s attacks.
There’s no way for him to counter-attack at all. None of his
counter-attacks would land on the Junior Radiant King’s true body.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky nodded
somberly as well. “Yes. This is going to be a passive, one-sided
battle. If he can’t hit back, it won’t be easy to win.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to what
I’ve heard, the Junior Radiant King is able to use only the first
two killer attacks of the three.” Daolord Brightfish said
anxiously, “In comparison, the [Lumislayer] is actually the weakest
of the three attacks. Next is the [Lumihilator], with the strongest
being the legendary [Lumipocalypse].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slay.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Annihilate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Apocalypse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were the three
legendary killer attacks. According to the legends, the
[Lumipocalypse] was created and practiced by the Radiant King alone.
It was this technique which allowed him to be recognized and
acknowledged as the third most powerful Daolord of all the Endless
Territories. However, the principle of this attack was to first
injure the self, then injure the foe!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ordinary Eternal
Emperors would probably be slain in a single blow by this attack. One
could imagine how strong it was! Given that even the Radiant King
himself would be injured when using this attack, there was no way the
Junior Radiant King ‘Daolord Yanmi’ was qualified to use it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that so?”
Daolord Yanmi had an ugly look on his face, and he was verily
brimming with murderous intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hear that you can
use two of the three killer attacks of the Radiant King. I wonder how
strong the second attack is?” Ning’s eyes gleamed with
excitement. He wanted to see just how strong the so-called
[Lumihilator] was and how it measured up to his own attacks, such as
the Blood Drop stance and the Shadowless stance! The Radiant King
himself normally just used the [Lumihilator] in combat, as the third
killer attack would cause him severe injuries. Thus, he wouldn’t
use it without a very good reason.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then have a taste of
annihilation for yourself.” Daolord Yanmi’s hundreds of clones
suddenly all vanished into thin air. Whoosh. They dispersed into
motes of light that reformed into a single Daolord Yanmi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning narrowed his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m fairly weak,”
Daolord Yanmi said in a soft voice. “Thus, I’m unable to maintain
my clones while using the [Lumihilator]. The Radiant King, however,
is able to launch this attack with all of his clones at once, making
it impossible to tell which is real and which is false. That is true
power! However… against you, my strength is enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately grew
vigilant. Daolord Yanmi was done to just a single body now, and it
didn’t seem all that powerful… and it was precisely the fact that
he had reserved all of his power that Ning felt all the more
vigilant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Yanmi produced
a single black sword in his hand. “Annihilate,” he murmured
softly. Swoosh! His entire body seemed to merge together with that
sword and transform into a dazzling strand of golden light. Even
though he was under the pressure of the heartworld projection and the
Yin-Yang Sword Domain, he still moved at seventy-two times the speed
of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What terrifying
speed.” Ning was stunned. He himself was far slower than his
opponent. “However… you wish to fight me in close combat? Hmph.
Close combat isn’t all about speed.” Faced with the attacking
strand of golden light, Ning struck out with both hands, forming
sword-fingers with them to block.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang! Clang!
Clang! Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This power of this
strand of golden light came from pure speed. Just as it started to
clash against Ning’s fingers and be blocked by them, it instantly
changed directions. The strand of golden light continuously circled
around Ning, moving at terrifying speeds as it attacked him again and
again, almost as if it was bouncing between multiple mirrors. Ning
was forced to rely on his Omega Sword Dao - Soleheart and pour all of
his efforts in to defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is this
possible?! How could his defenses be completely flawless? How can his
avatar keep up with my speed?!” Daolord Yanmi was stunned even as
he executed this killer attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Lumihilator] could
be described by one word - fast! It vastly surpassed all other
techniques in this area, and it was able to continuously change
directions. Generally speaking, experts on the same level as the
wielder would at most be able to block three or four times before
they were no longer able to handle the changes in direction and were
defeated! To date, when fighting opponents on the same level, Daolord
Yanmi had only ever seen opponents rely on special techniques such as
‘invulnerable bodies’ to endure this attack. In all his life, he
had only encountered two figures who were able to actually use their
weapons to block this attack… with Ning being the second of the
two!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first was the
legendary number one expert of the entire Endless Territories. But of
course, back then the man had merely been a Daolord of the Third
Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He really is quite
fast. Incredibly fast, in fact, and the changes in direction are fast
as well. This single attack is virtually all-encompassing and
omnipresent. Its speed and agility alone allows the wielder to
dominate much of the Endless Territories and defeat the vast majority
of Daolords. However, its actual close-combat techniques are fairly
weak. Its defenses are quite weak, and its attacks are excessively
fixed and not sufficiently unpredictable. I’m able to easily tell
where the next attack will be coming from.” This was Ning’s
private evaluation. “Anyone faster than him would be able to defeat
this attack with ease.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning also knew
that this current level of speed was in spite of his heartworld
projection and his Yin-Yang Sword Domain. Even the most supreme of
Daolords like Ninedust would generally be unable to keep up with
these attacks. As for the Radiant King, he himself was already able
to move at a hundred times the speed of light. One could imagine how
fast his [Lumihilate] would be!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Failed. Failed.
Failed again…” Daolord Yanmi was increasingly anxious. He had
launched more than a thousand attacks in an incredibly short period
of time, but all of them had been blocked by Ning. Ning was clearly
much slower than him, but Ning’s defenses were so airtight,
flawless, and perfect that he wasn’t able to find a single opening
at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve tested out
both of your killer attacks, and they seem quite so-so. Time for my
counter-attack!” Ning’s heartforce instantly surged out, silently
and soundless infiltrating Daolord Yanmi’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At present, Ning had
two incredibly powerful heartforce attacks! This was his second one -
the [Dreamstar]! The [Heartforce Eradicator] focused on a head-on
clash, while the [Dreamstar] focused on illusions!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Daolord Yanmi
had been focused on this furious battle, but he suddenly sensed his
soul and truesoul being entranced. Illusions began to appear in front
of him, but he instantly brought himself back into wakefulness as his
mind let out a furious shout, destroying the illusions before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, right at this
moment… Ning’s right hand pierced directly through his chest!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…” Daolord
Yanmi was stunned. He realized that in the end, the illusions had
disrupted his concentration after all, albeit for just a brief
instant… but he had slowed down during that instant, allowing Ning
to seize the opportunity to strike him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
Ning was surprised as well. “He should have an Eternal armor
protecting his body. Why was I able to so easily pierce into his
chest?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth,
you are very powerful. Your close combat skills are just as strong as
your heartforce skills.” Daolord Yanmi ignored the heavy injure as
he stared at Ning, then sighed. “I imagine it will be difficult to
find anyone on our level of power who is capable of defeating you.
Most likely, only the most supreme of first-tier Daolords would be
able to beat you. You’ve beaten me, and I have no excuses to make.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Daolord Yanmi’s
body instantly dissipated into countless streams of radiant light.
The light quickly reassembled into a second Daolord Yanmi off in the
distance. He stared at Ning, then smiled. “This is what the true
secrets of having a body of light incarnate are all about. Not only
can my body transform into countless clones, I’m also virtually
invulnerable! Although you are a bit stronger than me, you aren’t
able to kill me. Alas… I had been hoping to find a chance to
improve my odds, but I ended up running into someone like you. It
seems my chances of acquiring the Voidsea Jadeseals really are slim.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After speaking, he
turned and took a single step forwards, then vanished without a
trace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to stare
in the direction Daolord Yanmi had disappeared into. He murmured
softly, “A body of light incarnate?” All second-tier Daolords had
extremely strong life-preserving abilities. Kongsan, for example, was
nigh-invulnerable thanks to his ‘darkness incarnate’ body.
Daolord Yanmi’s life-preserving ability was just as strong as
Kongsan’s had been. Beating him wouldn’t be difficult, but
actually killing him would be very difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And similarly, killing
Ji Ning would also be extremely difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Waveshift
Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed youth
whose long golden hair glimmered with radiance was strolling slowly
through the realm. The youth was quite handsome, and none of the
other cultivators dared to even look him directly in the eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was the Radiant
King, one of the truly supreme Daolords of the Endless Territories,
ranked at the very top of the listings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I told him long ago.
Daolord Solesky would merely leave his avatar at Vastheaven Palace,
with all the other disciples having led long ago. Clearly, Daolord
Solesky has already decided to let his avatar perish in battle if
need be.” The Radiant King shook his head. “Yanmi and the others,
however, still harbored their foolish illusions and hoped to gain
some intelligence.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To Solesky, that
information represents his chances of succeeding in the Daomerge. How
could he possibly be willing to tell others about it? Only those weak
Daolords would harbor any illusions that they would win the
information from him. All of the truly powerful Daolords chose to
waste no time in heading straight to the Waveshift Realm. Every
single moment might give them an advantage in acquiring the Voidsea
Jadeseals.” A hint of a smile was on the Radiant King’s face.

Chapter 24 - Entering the Waveshift Realm
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three spacetime
tunnels of the Brightshore Kingdom were used quite frequently in
recent days, because quite a few wandering Verge-level Daolords had
hastened back and traversed them enroute to the Badlands Territory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A white-robed
youth emerged from the dark vortex exiting one of the tunnels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth.”
Suddenly, a voice called out to him. Ji Ning turned his head, only to
see a smiling, golden-robed elder beam at him. “Daolord Darknorth!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Goldsaber?”
Ning recognized the old man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That I am. I feel
quite embarrassed when I look at you. It took this old man years to
reach the Verge as a Daolord. Just a short while ago, you were a
World-level cultivator, but now you are more powerful than me! I
heard that even the Junior Radiant King, Daolord Yanmi, was unable to
defeat your avatar. Impressive, truly impressive,” the golden-robed
elder sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Word of the battle
between Ning’s avatar and Daolord Yanmi had indeed spread
throughout the Endless Territories. In truth, Solesky and
Battlemaster had done this on purpose, so as to ensure that the other
Daolords would give up their fantasies and withdraw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve heard some
important information that I’m not sure if you are aware of,
Daolord Darknorth,” the golden-robed elder said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” Ning
asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just a few hours
ago, Winesage of the Dark Kingdom has appeared in the Badlands
Territory. By now, he’s already entered the Waveshift Realm!” the
golden-robed expert said solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Winesage?” Ning’s
face turned slightly pale. Winesage of the Dark Kingdom? He was one
of the legends of the entire universe, because he was now publicly
acclaimed as the number one Daolord of all the Endless Territories!
It was actually something of a joke; the most powerful Daolord of the
noble Endless Territories actually stemmed from the outsider
organization known as the Dark Kingdom. Alas, no one could deny how
terrifyingly strong Winesage was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anyone in any era who
was publicly acknowledged as being number one possessed truly
incredible power. Daolord Featherdress herself had been the number
one Daolord of her era.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winesage was supposedly
skilled in the Dao of Darkness… and he was also a Heartforce
Cultivator! The legends said that as a child, he was born into and
grew up within a world of slaughter. The Dark Kingdom was an outsider
organization, making it very difficult for them to truly establish
themselves in the Endless Territories. Thus, all of the geniuses who
grew up within the Dark Kingdom were extremely violent and brutal,
with the Dao Alliance not intervening at all! It was hard to imagine
the difficulties and torments which Winesage experienced.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a result, he became
a notorious alcoholic, using alcohol to douse away his worries… but
in one alcohol-induced dream, he suddenly came to master an
incredible heartforce art known as the [Slaughterfiend Field]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was only expected
that Winesage would go to the Waveshift Realm.” Ning was quite
calm. “Now that the Voidsea Jadeseals have emerged, I imagine that
most of the most powerful Daolords will all go there. Given
Winesage’s power, how could he not?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s not the
only thing I have to share,” the golden-robed elder said. “Winesage
actually acquired a Universe treasure!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning
called out in astonishment, “A UNIVERSE treasure?! Are you sure
about that?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dead sure. Brother
Darknorth, I heard this just a short while ago myself. I imagine that
you’ll receive word soon as well,” the golden-robed elder said.
“The Waveshift Realm is in a state of chaos right now, and many of
the Daolords who aren’t confident in their chances have begun to
gather together into groups. More than ten thousand Daolords of the
Dao Alliance joined forces to set up a grand formation outside the
Waveshift Realm to prevent the Aeonians and the Daolords of the Dark
Kingdom to enter the realm! And indeed, they were able to stop the
Daolords of both organizations for a time. However, when Winesage
appeared and was faced with the grand formation set up by over ten
thousand Daolords of the Dao Alliance, he ended up using his Universe
treasure and forced a way into the Waveshfit Realm!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Universe
treasure?” Ning still couldn’t believe it. He had run into
several Universe treasures by now. The first one had been the
shattered sword in the Sword Palace, while the second had been the
indigo greatsword of the Sword Hegemon in the Genesis Lands of the
alternate universe. The third had been within that cave deep inside
the Terror Starsea, the longstaff that had been left behind by that
ancestor of the Ancient cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of them, however,
had taken a liking to Ning! There was no way to bind Universe
treasures by force. This was a case of the weapon choosing the
wielder, rather than the wielder choosing the weapon! Every single
Universe treasure contained a truly inconceivable amount of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was already the
number one Daolord of the Endless Territories. If he has a Universe
treasure, he’s going to be absolutely unstoppable.” The
golden-robed elder sighed. “And… to me, it’s inconceivable that
a Universe treasure would ever choose a Daolord. When Daolords fail
their Daomerge, death is a certainty. Based on what I know, Winesage
has already been alive for an extremely long period of time. I
imagine he only has a few thousand chaos cycles left before he
reaches the limits of his lifespan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Generally
speaking, Universe treasures would only choose Eternal Emperors! The
number of Daolords in the Endless Territories who had acquired
Universe treasures could be counted on one hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth, are you planning to go to the Waveshift Realm as well?”
the golden-robed elder asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Would you like to
travel with me?” the golden-robed elder immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need. I’ve
already made an appointment with a friend,” Ning explained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then I won’t force
it.” The golden-robed expert knew that he was much weaker than Ning
and would just slow the latter down. “Although my chances are slim,
I’m still going to go to the Waveshift Realm. If I go, I’ll at
least have a slim chance. Haha! However, I’m definitely going to
work together alongside a group of other Daolords. We’re not like
those supreme Daolords who dare to travel solo or in small groups.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but sigh. For the sake of the Daomerge, even the weaker Daolords were
still willing to risk it all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Word quickly spread
like wildfire throughout the Endless Territories, stunning everyone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Winesage? What an
interesting kid.” The Netherlily Hegemon of the Ancient cultivators
smiled with praise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Every member of the
Dark Kingdom is a madman. They are crazy towards themselves and even
crazier towards their descendants. Still, they ended up rearing a
fine young fellow.” The Windrain Hegemon was perpetually in a state
of slumber, but he had woken up due to this business with the Voidsea
Jadeseals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth and
Bertulu are both Heartforce Cultivators as well. I had thought that
they would have a shot at overtaking Winesage once they became
Daolords of the Fourth Step, but it seems that hope is gone.” The
almighty Brightshore Hegemon shook his head. “Their only chance
lies in acquiring a Universe treasure of their own… but that chance
is far too slim.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It wasn’t that the
Brightshore Hegemon underestimated Ning and Bertulu. Rather, it was
that Universe treasures simply contributed an overwhelming amount of
power to their wielders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Vastheaven
Palace. Ning’s avatar and Solesky’s avatar were holding a
meeting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, are you
sure about entering the Waveshift Realm?” Daolord Solesky asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll get there in
a few years,” Ning said. “If I miss this opportunity, a second
one like it may never come again. Of course I have to go in! I have a
friend as well who is a member of the Ancient cultivators and who is
even stronger than I am.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Solesky
nodded and said heavily, “If you are going to go inside, take
this.” As he spoke, he handed over a jade slip.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…” As soon
as Ning saw the jade slip, he had an idea as to what it was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is everything
which I know regarding the Waveshift Realm,” Daolord Solesky said
seriously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t accept
this.” Ning hesitated. This would give him a faster starting point
and let him maintain a lead over this opponents. Daolord Solesky had
entered much earlier than the other supreme Daolords had, and he had
Daolord Badlands’ incarnation assisting him. Given Badlands’
mastery over Numerancy, the two had no doubt learned a great deal
regarding the Waveshift Realm. This information truly would be
priceless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two years ago,
Badlands and I encountered King Gorsch.” Daolord Solesky said
softly, “Fortunately, Badlands managed to take advantage of some of
the formations and barriers within the Waveshift Realm itself to
trick King Gorsch, allowing us a narrow escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Waveshift Realm
is now filled with many dangers. Even though I have Badlands helping
out, I’m not sure that I can avoid all these dangers,” Daolord
Solesky said. “However… you must remember that no one else
besides you is permitted to read this. You aren’t allowed to tell a
second person about this. We’re brothers, you and I… but I don’t
owe anyone else this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After you go inside,
be careful. From what I’ve heard, the top ten Daolords of the
Endless Territories have all gone inside! There are also some
low-key, little-known Daolords who are just as powerful as them who
have also gone inside,” Solesky instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You need to be
careful as well, big brother. I’ll try to join up with you as soon
as I can,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After leaving the
Terror Starsea, Ning had relied on his dimension-transcending
abilities and the Brightshore Kingdom’s spacetime tunnel to hasten
towards the Badlands Territory. Despite that, it still took him 112
years before arriving.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two figures emerged
from a dimensional tunnel to appear in the void above the Badlands
Everworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Ninedust,
you can go to the Waveshift Realm first. I’ll meet up with you in
an hour,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is there something
you need to do?” the Ninedust Sectlord asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to make a few
arrangements.” Ning didn’t explain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Got it. I’ll wait
for you, but hurry up. Don’t dawdle! We’re already years behind
most of the other Daolords,” the Ninedust Sectlord said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, then
opened up yet another dimensional tunnel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was heading to the
Three Realms. The Three Realms was separated from the Badlands
Territory by layers of dangers; ordinary teleportation methods were
useless against these regions! However, Ning’s ability to transcend
space allowed him to move directly to the Three Realms. He was going
to place his most important Dao-cultivating treasure, the Stone
Censer of Reunion, within the Three Realms alongside his Primaltwin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The skies outside above
the Waveshift Realm. Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord had gathered
together here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many people.”
Ning and the Ninedust Sectlord stared at the vast, seemingly endless
cloud-shrouded realm that lay before them. This was the Waveshift
Realm… and an endless cluster of figures could be seen outside of
it. Daolords, tens of thousands of Daolords! They had set up an
absolutely enormous formation which covered the entire Waveshift
Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard that
Winesage was able to break through this formation and force his way
inside. Quite a few of the Daolords of the Dark Kingdom and the
Aeonians managed to charge inside alongside him.” The Ninedust
Sectlord sighed. “Just looking at the formation, I can tell that
I’m far from being a match for Winesage.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No confidence in
yourself?” Ning smirked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Plenty of
confidence. The Voidsea Jadeseals aren’t necessarily going to be
won by the strongest,” the Ninedust Sectlord quickly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then cut the crap.
Let’s go on in!” Ning urged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” The
two transformed into streaks of light that flew straight towards the
realm before them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s Daolord
Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, Daolord
Darknorth of our Dao Alliance?” The ten thousand-plus weak Daolords
who were part of the grand formation didn’t move to stop Ning or
the Ninedust Sectlord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Aeonians and the
members of the Dark Kingdom would all be stopped, but all others were
granted entry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and let’m
inside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth
seems quite confident. He actually dares to go inside with just one
other Daolord partner.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Darknorth’s
avatar alone is stronger than Yanmi. How strong must his true body
be?” The other Daolords all chatted amongst themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninedust…
the two were significantly less well-known than the likes of
Fiendqueen Dustrain, Winesage, Palace Lord Dawnstar, or the Radiant
King. However, when they joined together they were definitely on par
with the most elite of Daolords. There were actually quite a few who
were like Ning and Ninedust, both incredibly powerful and
comparatively low-key.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m more powerful
than you, but as of right now you seem to be more famous than me.
That kinda pisses me off.” The Ninedust Sectlord sent Ning a
disgruntled mental complaint as they flew forwards together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s because
you’ve been too low-key,” Ning sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, yes I have.”
The Ninedust Sectlord agreed. “Now that I’ve become a Daolord of
the Fourth Step, I need to find a suitable opportunity to spread my
name throughout the Endless Territories. Hell, I should at least rank
in the top ten in the Endless Territories.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ll have plenty
of opportunities in the Waveshift Realm. All you need to do is just
pick one of the other top ten and beat them, and you’ll instantly
rise to fame,” Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Watched by over ten
thousand Daolords, the two flew through the formation and advanced
into the Waveshift Realm, shoulder-by-shoulder.
