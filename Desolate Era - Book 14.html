Chapter 1 - Homecoming
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world of the Grand
Xia. Stillwater Commandery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A spatial ripple
appeared in the air above Serpentwing Lake. From within, out strode a
plainly dressed youth, a snowy white hound by his side and a little
azure serpent around his arm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning stared
downwards at Serpentwing Lake. He murmured softly, “When I left
here, I fled in such a pathetic state. But now…no one should even
think about forcing me, Ji Ning, to leave again!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt closer to
this lake than anything else. If it hadn’t been because the
Youngflame clan was so much more powerful than him back then, how
could Ning have beared to part from it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. With a single
step, Ning arrived within Brightheart Island, at the very center of
Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The buildings of
Brightheart Island had all been rebuilt. There were quite a few
servants and guards present. As Ning strolled forward through the
sand, he quietly gazed at everything and everyone. His divine sense
had long ago encapsulated the entire island. “When I fled,
Brightheart Island had been leveled by the Youngflame clan. I didn’t
expect that it would have been rebuilt, and that it would be built to
look exactly the way it did in the past. However…it seems as though
there is no one here that I recognize.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine that elder
sister Autumn Leaf is still at the City of Ten Thousand Swords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning took a walk around
Brightheart Island. He visited the place where Autumn Leaf had
previously stayed, as well as the place where his father had once
lived. The servants and guards didn’t see him at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Brightheart Island of
Serpentwing Lake was Ning’s home. Coming home was truly a wonderful
feeling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This time…no one
should even think about destroying Brightheart Island again,” Ning
murmured softly. “Uncle White. It’ll be up to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
behind Ning spoke out. “I’ve analyzed quite a few grand
formations at Mount Innerheart, and within some of the secret tomes
on formations there were also some hidden formations of supreme
power. Although I haven’t thoroughly comprehended them all…simply
setting them up in accordance with the instructions will prove
simple. In the future, the entire Swallow Mountain region, all
hundred thousand kilometers of it, will be surrounded by hundreds of
layers of grand formations! Formations within formations within
formations; not even Celestial Immortals will dare barge in here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A powerful school or
sect would definitely layer many terrifying formations around its
headquarters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In order to lay down a
formation, one would first need to procure a formidable formation
technique, and then go buy enough treasures to actually set it up.
Thus, the formations of major schools were usually built up by
successive generations of disciples of the school. The longer a
school’s history, the more complicated and powerful its many
layered formations would be, to the point of causing any enemy to
hesitate!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning and the
Whitewater Hound didn’t have that sort of long history and
background, they were the disciples of Mount Innerheart!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Formation tomes
generally weren’t valued that much, and so the formation tomes
which Uncle White had acquired on the sixth floor of the Divinities
Palace were already some of the supreme formations of the entire
Three Realms. Naturally, he had learned an enormous number of
formidable formations. Some he had thoroughly mastered, while others
he had not, but even those he had not mastered, he could still lay
them out according to the instructions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White,”
Little Qing said, “I heard that some major schools take up hundreds
of thousands of kilometers, all of which is completely covered up by
formations, some of which are set down by generations of Loose
Immortals and Celestial Immortals. You need to make sure that our
formations aren’t weaker than theirs!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are of Mount
Innerheart; our formations are unfathomably more profound than the
formations of those so-called major schools,” Uncle White said
confidently. “With enough magic treasures…I can turn the entire
Swallow Mountain into an unbreakable steel dome.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. When the time
comes, let’s pay a trip to the imperial capital and buy some
formations materials. Uncle White, think about what you need and
prepare a list,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will. I’ll come
up with some of the most supreme killing formations that I’ve
learned from those formation manuals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later.
Outside the City of Ten Thousand Swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gates to the city
were open. Ning led a snowy white hound inside through the city
gates. The gateguards couldn’t see them at all; naturally, they
wouldn’t bar their way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The changes are so
significant.” Ning murmured softly, “In the past, the City of Ten
Thousand Swords had many ordinary mortals within it, and there were
many hawkers lining the streets. Now…everything has changed. There
are very few mortals here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many former
residences of the City of Ten Thousand Swords had all been
demolished, and the entire city had been completely renovated in a
beautiful manner!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the city, there
were now far more soldiers! There were also many more men and women
that were dressed in absolutely beautiful clothes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even I can barely
recognize this place. I feel as though the City of Ten Thousand
Swords has been transformed into an enormous private estate,” Uncle
White sighed in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning swept
forward with his divine sense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within an estate, there
were two powerful Immortal Diremonsters who were leisurely sipping
wine - Immortal Duohe and Immortal Witchsui. Their faces suddenly
changed; they could sense an incomparably powerful, almost
crushingly-strong divine sense sweep past them! Just from this divine
sense alone…they could tell that the wielder was above ordinary
Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals. It was extremely rare for Loose
Immortals to have such a terrifying divine sense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
Immortal Duohe and Immortal Witchsui both were shocked. “An enemy!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Puzzled looks quickly
appeared on their faces. The divine sense seemed rather familiar…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Ji
Ning?” They shared a glance of disbelief…but indeed, when they
carefully checked again, that surge of divine sense did indeed belong
to Ji Ning. However, it was even more powerful and graceful than
before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Witchsui,
Immortal Duohe, we’ll meet at Darknorth Palace in a bit,” Ning
sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright,” the two
Diremonster Immortals assented.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a secluded
courtyard in the City of Ten Thousand Swords. Autumn Leaf was taking
care of her flowers. She had lived by herself for the past few
decades, quietly focusing on her training. Without planning to, she
actually made a breakthrough and reached the early Wanxiang level.
Although Ning had previously provided her with some help, and
although this was partially due to the fact that the Ji clan now had
a prodigious Dao-repository, her own talent clearly was exceptional
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Auntie.” A youth
walked in, a look of absolute delight on his face and a look of
yearning in his eyes. “Auntie, auntie, my swordplay has reached the
‘one with the world’ level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Autumn Leaf
turned around, smiling as she looked at the youth. “One with the
world?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right right! When I
was out adventuring and fighting Diremonsters, I suddenly made a
breakthrough and my swordplay reached the ‘one with the world’
level,” the youth said excitedly. “Auntie, you promised me to
teach me a powerful sword-art when I reached the ‘one with the
world’ level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf smiled. But
suddenly…her body trembled. A look of disbelief and delight
appeared in her eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The youth was
immediately puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Rocky, hurry
up and head back. Auntie has something to do,” Autumn Leaf said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But Auntie, you
promised to teach me swordplay…” The youth was rather hesitant,
unwilling to leave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go back for now,”
Autumn Leaf said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…fine.” The
youth turned and left helplessly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the youth left,
the courtyard once more became quiet. Autumn Leaf hurriedly stared at
the surrounding area with agitation, searching for that familiar
figure. And right at this moment, a fur-clad youth suddenly appeared
out of nowhere, not too far away in front of her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master!” A
look of excitement was on Autumn Leaf’s face. He looked just the
same as he always had; he hadn’t changed at all. “Young master.
You came back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. I’m back.”
Ning nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Will you be
leaving?” Autumn Leaf asked softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not this time,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tears appeared in
Autumn Leaf’s eyes. She nodded repeatedly. “Autumn Leaf will
definitely take good care of you, young master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It wouldn’t feel
right if anyone else was to take care of me,” Ning said with a
smile. “Let’s go and see Uncle Truekeep and the others.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Autumn
Leaf immediately followed him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The City of Ten
Thousand Swords. Darknorth Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the complete
overhaul of the City of Ten Thousand Swords, the most important
palace of the the entire Ji clan became this place, the Darknorth
Palace. It was named ‘Darknorth’ after Ning’s own Daoist title,
of course! Ever since news had spread of Ning’s victory in the
Conclave of Immortal Destiny, the entire Ji clan had celebrated with
wild abandon. This was a glory which the Ji clan had never before
even imagined of in all of its history!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning had become the
absolute most glorious figure in the Ji clan’s entire history!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Truekeep,
Granny Shadow, Immortal Duohe, Immortal Witchsui.” Ning walked into
Darknorth Palace, then called out to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only four people were
present within the palace. Clearly, the news of Ning’s return was
too shocking and sudden; none of the other formidable figures of the
Ji clan had been notified yet. His return was to be kept a secret for
now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s good that you
are back. It’s good that you are back!” Granny Shadow looked at
Ning, a hint of excitement and delight in her eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where’s the former
patriarch and the others?” Ning couldn’t help but ask.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Because they reached
the end of their lifespans…my big brother and Ah Xing have both
passed on,” Granny Shadow sighed. “After they left, I spent all
my time by myself within the Dao-repository, waiting for my end to
come as well. Who would’ve thought that after being within it for
so long, I’d actually end up making an unexpected breakthrough?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sighed. The former
patriarch, Ji Ninefire, as well as the old servant Ah Xing had both
died. Of the older generation, only Granny Shadow remained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, before they
died, they learned of the fact that you, Ji Ning, became the champion
of the Conclave of Immortal Destiny,” Granny Shadow said excitedly.
“They were both excited and proud. Our Ji clan actually produced a
scion that became one of the most glorious figures of the entire
Grand Xia Dynasty. This is an incomparable honor for our entire clan!
Right…after you became champion, you suddenly disappeared for
thirty years. Did you go follow a Celestial Immortal to study the
Dao?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Immortal
Witchsui said with a laugh, “Only a truly peerless genius could
become champion of the Conclave. It is quite normal for such a genius
to be taken on by a Celestial Immortal; in fact, even Pure Yang True
Immortals and Empyrean Gods would consider accepting such disciples.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Witchsui was
of Celestial Immortal Witchriver’s lineage; naturally, he knew
about True Immortals and Empyrean Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I did indeed leave
to go studying,” Ning said with a nod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had already
prepared his explanation for his thirty-plus years of disappearance.
The explanation was…he had left to go studying!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Studying with who? Who
was his master? That would be a secret! The more mysterious it
seemed, the more caution it would inspire in careful-minded folk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If my gaze is
correct…fellow Daoist Ji Ning, you are now a Void-level Earth
Immortal,” Immortal Duohe said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not just that; both
of fellow Daoist Ji Ning’s spirit-beasts have become Void-level
Earth Immortals,” the nearby Immortal Witchsui added.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Granny
Shadow, Patriarch Ji Truekeep, and Autumn Leaf all stared towards
them in astonishment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they were
delighted by the fact that Ning had become a Void-level Earth
Immortal, this was as they had expected, because they had heard long
ago about Ning’s Primaltwin being capable of killing Loose
Immortals. Given that Ning had also gone to study the Dao with a
powerful figure, what was so strange about him now having reached the
Void-level and become an Earth Immortal? But the two spirit-beasts
had also become Void-level Earth Immortals?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
smiled and nodded, then said, “I can see that the Ji clan has
changed quite a bit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thanks to the help
of Princess Xiyue, the squads which the Youngflame clan had stationed
in the Ji clan’s territory left long ago.” Truekeep tamped down
the curiosity he felt, then explained, “And given the additional
fame and glory you won at the Conclave of Immortal Destiny, Ji Ning,
who would dare antagonize our Ji clan now? We haven’t expanded;
we’ve just continued to stabilize around Swallow Mountain. Over the
past few decades, Swallow Mountain’s defenses have become
airtight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Ji clan hasn’t
changed that much; by comparison, Stillwater Commandery has changed
much more.” Truekeep let out a sigh. “The entire Stillwater
Commandery is now vastly different from what it was like when you
left. Even the Marquis of Stillwater has changed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Marquis of
Stillwater has changed?” Ning was surprised. “To who?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two principal
contenders for the position of Marquis of Stillwater had been
Northmont Yin and Northmont Blacktiger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The current Marquis
of Stillwater…is Northmont Yin,” Truekeep said.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_2___Ji_Ning_is_Back"></A>
Chapter 2 - Ji Ning is Back
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northmont Yin?”
Ning was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then what of
Northmont Baiwei and his father, Northmont Blacktiger?” Ning
hurriedly asked, “Are they doing alright?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Internicine struggles
within ancient clans could be incredibly devastating; generally, the
losers would have dire ends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know about the
relationship between you and Northmont Baiwei,” Ji Truekeep said,
“So I kept abreast of this matter. Northmont Blacktiger and his son
continue to live within Stillwater City and continue to reside within
the Northmont Blacktiger Estate. Although their power is not as it
was before, they aren’t at risk of dying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning finally let out a
sigh of relief. Still…he was quite surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Based on what he
understood, the struggle within the Northmont clan of Stillwater for
the position of Marquis would be extremely cruel and savage; the
loser would be driven out of their estate and perhaps even expelled
out from Stillwater City to some other places. In an extremely
serious case, they might even be sent to a completely different minor
world with the assignment of subjugating it for the clan. There, they
might live out the end of their days. Unexpectedly, after Northmont
Yin had become the Marquis, his most powerful foe, Northmont
Blacktiger, was still able to reside in Stillwater City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the time needed
to boil a kettle of tea, Ning finished asking his questions and felt
a bit more relaxed. He then said, “I’m going to make a trip; I
should be back in ten days or half a month or so.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning,” Granny
Shadow said in her gravelly voice, “The outside world is very
chaotic right now. You must be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chaotic?” Ning was
puzzled. “Why is it chaotic?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Truekeep explained,
“Our Ji clan is permanently stationed here at Swallow Mountain, and
so we don’t know too much about the chaos in the outside world.
What we do know, however, is that in the past twenty to thirty years,
many tribes and clans within Stillwater Commandery have been wiped
out! The entire Stillwater Commandery is in a state of enormous
upheaval right now. Of course, the annihilated clans and tribes were
all fairly weak tribes that had no Immortals…but there were still a
number of annihilated clans that were comparable to Snowdragon
Mountain back in its heyday.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning felt
as though something was off. In Stillwater Commandery, powers
comparable to Snowdragon Mountain were already fairly strong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Powers with Immortals
guarding them, by contrast, would be considered truly first-rate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Above them would be the
eight supreme powers; the Black-White College, the Skysplitter Sword
Sect, the Hundred Flowers Fairyland, the Heavenly Saint Church, the
Blood God Church, the Dragonhunter clan, the Eastriver clan, and the
Bluewood clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most supreme
powers, of course, were the Northmont clan as well as the local
Raindragon Guard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Powers comparable to
Snowdragon Mountain…they all have extremely deep and stable roots;
it’s rare for one of them to be wiped out, even in a thousand
years. How is it that a number of them have been wiped out in twenty
to thirty short years?” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ji clan stays
here at Swallow Mountain. We’re not too sure,” Truekeep said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning had left
Mount Innerheart, his master had warned him of the dangerous
undercurrents within the Three Realms, claiming that even he himself
might fall. Now, upon returning to Stillwater Commandery, he
discovered that local regions were already beginning to turn chaotic…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A great secret most
likely lies behind the chaos in Stillwater Commandery,” Ning mused
silently to himself. “It seems I need to be even more careful than
I anticipated. If even Master must be extremely careful…this little
bit of power I have is nothing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Granny Shadow. Uncle
Truekeep.” Ning immediately said, “Given the state of chaos
Stillwater Commandery is in, your actions are correct. It is best for
our Ji clan to peacefully remain here at Swallow Mountain. Mm…I’m
going to make a trip. I’ll be back in ten days or so. Autumn Leaf,
no need to follow me; wait here for my return.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Autumn
Leaf nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Duohe,
Immortal Witchsui…the safety of my Ji clan will depend on your
efforts,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are only acting
as is proper. Fellow Daoist Ji Ning, you rescued all of us from the
Immortal estate; it is right and proper for us to help out,”
Immortal Witchsui said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The monsters of the
Immortal estate are living here at Swallow Mountain as well. We shall
prosper together or perish together with the Ji clan.” Immortal
Duohe spoke out warmly as well. In the past, for the sake of their
clan, they had sworn a thousand year oath…but now that Ning had
come back as a Void-level Earth Immortal, as had his two
spirit-beasts, their attitudes had changed significantly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the air a few
thousand kilometers outside of Stillwater City. A spatial ripple
appeared, then a fur-clad youth walked out, a snowy white hound by
his side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Around Ning’s arm was
a little azure snake. The snake raised its little head, staring into
the distance, then said excitedly, “We’re finally at Stillwater
City. Hahaha, I, Little Qing, have become a Void-level Earth
Immortal. I’d be considered an expert even here in Stillwater City
now!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning rode the wind as
he flew towards Stillwater City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m back. I wonder
if Master is at the Black-White College.” Ning quickly saw the
distant Black-White College; when Ning had left, Immortal Diancai had
gone out adventuring to temper himself. Nearly forty years had passed
since then; Ning wondered if he was back yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning flew
directly into the Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the marquisate
of Stillwater. There were many crystal globes hovering in midair,
each being watched over by an Immortal cultivator.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone flew
directly into Stillwater city!” A cultivator quickly noticed the
scene that just appeared within one of the watched crystal balls. He
immediately reported this aloud, and soon had his report verified by
someone else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A fur-clad youth, an
Azure Skysnake, a Whitewater Hound.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This person should
be the person who became the champion of the Conclave of Immortal
Destiny more than thirty years ago, then disappeared without a trace
- Adept Darknorth, Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Intelligence reports
regarding Adept Darknorth are classified as top-priority. Quick, go
report this!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, this intelligence
report was transferred to higher-ups.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Northmont clan of
Stillwater kept an extremely tight watch over its enfeoffed
territory. In Stillwater City at least, anyone who dared to fly about
in the open had to be clearly investigated. In fact… whenever there
was an especially powerful ripple of elemental energy anywhere in the
entire vast commandery of Stillwater, it would be discovered and
investigated!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, when
Immortal Firedragon made his breakthrough in Swallow Mountain, the
Northmont clan of Stillwater immediately discovered it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ji Ning that
disappeared more than thirty years ago after the Conclave of Immortal
Destiny?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This information
needs to be reported to the Patriarch right away!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The news continued to
climb through the ranks. And soon…the news made its way to
Celestial Immortal Hunchmont.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hunchbacked old man
with white hair who held a gnarled wooden staff took a single step
forward and appeared in midair, then flew towards the direction of
the Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard that Sword
Immortal Evergreen of the Crimsonbright League had intended to take
Ji Ning as his disciple…but it seemed as though Ji Ning didn’t
take him on as his master, nor did he apprentice himself to any of
the other Immortals or Empyrean Gods affiliated with Daofather
Crimsonbright. In fact…the Immortals of the Crimsonbright League
have no idea where Ji Ning is at all.” Celestial Immortal Hunchmont
quietly pondered over this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s disappearance
had briefly caused a stir. It must be understood that even Pure Yang
True Immortals like Lu Dongbin had been interested in taking Ning as
a disciple…and in fact, Lu Dongbin had been extremely eager to do
so. However, the Grand Xia Emperor had resolutely refused to agree,
insisting on keeping Ning for the Crimsonbright League.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But in the end…?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Almost everyone who had
been in the Skylight Palace for the Conclave had been a Celestial
Immortal. The news of this matter had quickly spread. All of those
Celestial Immortals were under Daofather Crimsonbright’s command,
and so they were all investigating this matter. They all had learned
that Sword Immortal Evergreen had sought to take Ning as a disciple,
but Ning had refused and disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…no matter how
they searched, none of the Immortals under Daofather Crimsonbright’s
command could find out who had taken Ning on as a disciple. Everyone
guessed that Ning had most likely ended up not joining Daofather
Crimsonbright’s side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So where had Ji Ning
gone to?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why didn’t he take
Sword Immortal Evergreen as his master?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Who had he taken as his
master? Or did he even have a master at all? Was he wandering alone?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This became a mystery!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You all seem to be
having a happy chat.” The staff-holding Celestial Immortal
Hunchmont arrived before the Headmaster’s Hall in the Black-White
College. He strode inside, sweeping the people within with his
long-browed, deep gaze. There were more than ten Immortals gathered
here. Thirty years ago, the Black-White College didn’t have this
many Immortals. During the past period of time, however, Stillwater
Commandery had simply become too chaotic, and so the Primal Daoists
with very deep levels of enlightenment such as Daoist Jadesea, who
had previously been taking their time, all decided to make their
breakthroughs. They had all reached the Void-level and become Earth
Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Hunchmont.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, all the
Immortals of the Black-White College saluted respectfully. Ning
saluted as well. “Senior Hunchmont.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning returned?”
Celestial Immortal Hunchmont nodded lightly, his eyes lighting up.
“It’s only been thirty years, but both you and your spirit-beasts
have reached the Void-level as Earth Immortals. Monsters train much
more slowly than we humans do, but your two spirit-beasts have both
reached the Void-level…it seems the past thirty-plus years
represented a huge stroke of fortune for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The short elder nearby,
Immortal Fivecraze, let out an emotional sigh. “We were just
discussing this as well. Becoming a Void-level Earth Immortal is no
easy task. Ning and both his spirit-beasts…well, our Black-White
College now has three more Earth Immortals. Naturally, all of us are
extremely happy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Hunchmont nodded, then said, “Young friend Ji Ning, you disappeared
all those years ago, drawing quite a bit of attention. Where did you
go for the past period of time?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled. “I went
to take on a master and to study.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take on a master?”
Celestial Immortal Hunchmont was intrigued. He hurriedly asked,
“Might I ask who?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forgive me for not
being able to tell you,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Hunchmont laughed. “I won’t force it, I won’t force it.” But
in his heart, he secretly mumbled to himself, “It seems one of the
powers of the Three Realms must’ve run off with him, which is why
he isn’t willing to say his master’s name; I imagine he doesn’t
want to cause trouble. However…for his master to be so daring means
that he is most likely a formidable figure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The question of who
Ning had taken on his master was indeed quite an intriguing one. This
was because any power who took on Ning as a disciple would have at
least somewhat offended Daofather Crimsonbright’s side!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…the
Crimsonbright League wouldn’t hold anything against Ning
personally. This was because if one was to take on a disciple, the
disciple had to be willing! True Immortals, Empyrean Gods,
Daofathers…anyone taking on a disciple had to ask if the disciple
was willing to accept him as a master! If Ning was unwilling, nobody
could force him. For Ning to willingly run off with someone else and
take him or her as his master only meant that the Grand Xia Emperor
would have to suffer this loss in silence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you are free,
young friend Ji Ning, you can pay a visit to the marquisate of
Stillwater,” Celestial Immortal Hunchmont said with a chortle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Definitely,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. I won’t
interrupt your reunion with your comrades any longer.” Celestial
Immortal Hunchmont immediately turned, still-leaning on his gnarled
staff, and gracefully departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, Stillwater
Commandery is a bit chaotic right now. You need to be careful.
Although our Black-White College stands on the side of the Northmont
clan of Stillwater…we can’t just stupidly offer ourselves up and
die for them for no reason,” Immortal Fivecraze said in a low
voice. All the other Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals present all
nodded and looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the Sloppy
Daoist were the two mighty future pillars of their Black-White
College! They didn’t wish for Ning to be taken advantage of.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “I
understand. Right…has my master returned to the Black-White
College?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your master came
back just a few days ago. He’s in closed-door meditation right now;
most likely, he is going to attempt his Celestial Tribulation soon,”
Immortal Fivecraze said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tribulation?” Ning
was surprised.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 3 - Blood God Church
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, Ji Ning met with
Immortal Diancai.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a quiet,
secluded courtyard. There was a gourd of Immortal wine, two wine
cups, a master, and a disciple. The two were drinking wine and
chatting with each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, I didn’t
disturb your meditations, did I?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was just engaging
in ordinary meditation; I wasn’t in a prajna-state of sudden
enlightenment. What’s there to disturb?” Immortal Diancai looked
at Ning, then nodded with satisfaction. “Ji Ning, you are far more
powerful than you were in the past. When you first entered my
tutelage, you were a piece of unpolished jade; you were quite young.
But now, your divine sense is a bit more powerful than even mine; you
truly are the peerless genius who became the champion of the Conclave
after having trained for merely thirty or so years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you keep praising
me this much, Master, I’m going to start wiggling with delight,”
Ning joked with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You little punk…”
Immortal Diancai laughed, then shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said seriously,
“Master, are you truly planning to take on your Celestial
Tribulation soon? This is something that you need to be extremely
cautious about; you can’t be the slightest bit over-confident in
handling it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know that. Of
course I know that. There are countless Earth Immortals and Loose
Immortals, but it’s rare for the entire Grand Xia world to produce
a single Celestial Immortal in a million years.” Immortal Diancai
continued, “But times are changing. In the past twenty, thirty
years, there were multiple Earth Immortals who successfully overcame
their Celestial Tribulation and became Celestial Immortals in the
Grand Xia world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Multiple?!” Ning
was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Immortal
Diancai nodded. “The greater a storm, the more experts are born
from within! And during my previous period of training, my
subconscious was telling me…that a great storm is coming. If I want
to overcome my tribulation and become a Celestial Immortal, I have to
do so before this storm comes. Only then will I have a chance. If I
delay…I’ll probably die within it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An Immortal’s
subconscious senses were usually very accurate. In truth, ever since
he had returned to the Grand Xia world, Ning himself had
subconsciously felt as though a terrifying tempest was about to
erupt. However…he didn’t sense that he needed to make his
breakthrough before it. Clearly, with his success in training the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art], Ning’s chances of survival were much
greater than Immortal Diancai’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Ning
suddenly waved his hand, and a man-high pile of books suddenly
appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s this?”
Immortal Diancai said, puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Dao-Repository,”
Ning said. “You can look at these three books, Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning pulled out three
thick tomes from the pile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai
immediately accepted the three books, then began to flip through
them. These had been acquired by Ning in the Crescent world after
killing the monster kings and the evil Patriarch! It must be
understood that these powerful figures were generally extremely
self-confident; in order to prevent other powers from destroying
their Dao-Repositories, they would generally carry a copy with them
at all times. When the Flamewing King had destroyed the Qi Empire, he
had acquired a portion of the Qi Empire’s Dao-Repository, which
Ning now naturally had as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A fine sword-art. A
fine sword-art!” Immortal Diancai’s eyes were shining as he
flipped through a second book. He said excitedly, “This directly
guides one through the Grand Dao!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that the Qi Empire needed only a few tens of thousands of years to
establish an Empire that spanned a million kilometers. How incredible
had its Dao-Repository been? The Twelve Monster Kings of the Eastern
Flows and the evil Patriarch were all comparable to Celestial
Immortals; the Dao-Repositories they had built up were similarly
astonishing. Although there was no way they could come close to
comparing to Mount Innerheart’s, their repositories were ten times
superior to the Black-White College’s!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, these
Dao-Repositories…?” Immortal Diancai looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
Master. Your disciple acquired them with his own power; they don’t
come with any strings attached. I prepared them for you, Master, and
for the Black-White College,” Ning said. Because of the rules of
the Old Patriarch, the supreme arts of Mount Innerheart were
absolutely not to be taught to any outsiders. There were no such
restrictions, however, on the techniques Ning had acquired from the
monster kings and the evil Patriarch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Black-White College
had ten-plus Earth Immortals and Loose Immortals, all of which were
extraordinary. With these Dao-Repositories, their level of power
would rise once again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Ji clan?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had used an ink
technique to duplicate copies for the Ji clan. In addition…Ning
believed that as he grew increasingly powerful, the Dao-Repositories
he would acquire would also become increasingly formidable. For the
dreams of his father, for the dreams of the deceased Patriarch
Ninefire and the others, and for the sake of himself as a descendant
of the Ji clan, he would naturally do everything he could to make the
Ji clan flourish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good, good, good.
These Dao-Repositories are all quite incredible.” Immortal Diancai
was truly excited. “The three sword-arts manuals you picked out are
all of great help to me and have given me insight. I need to
immediately go into closed-door meditation and ponder on them. My
chances of overcoming the tribulation are now a bit greater.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These three sword-arts
manuals were all comparable to the complete [Three-Foot Sword]; they
were truly superb tomes on the Dao of the Sword! In the current
Black-White College, there were only two Sword Immortals at the Void
level; Ji Ning and Immortal Diancai. No one would fight with Immortal
Diancai over these tomes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wonderful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Earth
Immortals and Loose Immortals of the Black-White College were now
gathered at Immortal Diancai’s place. Upon seeing the piles of
Dao-Repositories, they were instantly all overjoyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Divine ability,
[Nine Melodies of Virtue].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Divine ability,
[Bloodshadow Evasion].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Secret art,
[Thousandstar Soulscour].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Pure Yang-level Ki
Refining Technique. Our Black-White College has no Pure Yang-level Ki
Refining Techniques!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This one is a Pure
Yang-level Ki Refining Technique as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A formation here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is this a technique
for creating constructs?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All sorts of tomes on
the Dao were present. The Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals could
feel the blood boiling in their veins as they read.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just quietly
sighed to himself. At Mount Innerheart, there were quite a few Ki
Refining Techniques that were at the Daofather level! There were many
sword-arts created by Daofathers, but unfortunately Mount Innerheart
techniques could not be taught to others. Thus, he could only give
the repositories of the monster kings and the vile Patriarch to his
school…and yet, this was already enough to make them go wild with
joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Earth Immortals and
Loose Immortals of the Black-White College were all extraordinary
figures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past,they didn’t
have a truly top-tier Dao-Repository. Now that Ning had given them
one, it was guaranteed that all of them would once more increase in
power. Even Immortal Fivecraze was laughing loudly right now. “With
this Dao-Repository, the fortunes of our Black-White College have
improved tenfold! Back during the Conclave of Immortal Destiny, when
little Sloppy entered the top six and Ji Ning became champion, I knew
that our Black-White College was in for an era of tremendous luck…and
today, I’ve finally seen the fruits of that luck. With this
Dao-Repository, haha…even I myself can live for at least another
ten thousand years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Fivecraze had
expected that after roughly nine centuries or so, he would no longer
be able to withstand the next trial from the Three Calamities and
Nine Tribulations, but with these new Dao-Repositories, his insights
would deepen and his strength would grow; naturally, he would now be
able to live longer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Immortal
Diancai were walking within a path inside the Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, a
Dao-Repository is a school’s foundation. With these new ones, the
Black-White College will grow more powerful, and will become
comparable to some of the supreme schools of the entire Grand Xia
Dynasty.” Immortal Diancai looked at Ning. “This is all because
of you. The contribution you have made this time is too, too great.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some disciples
preferred to give powerful Dao-Repositories to their own tribes
instead. It was very rare for them to give so much to their school.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It really was
nothing.” Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Currently, it isn’t
just Stillwater Commandery that is in a state of chaos; there are
dangerous undercurrents within the entire Grand Xia world, causing
all sorts of trouble. With these Dao-Repositories, the supreme Loose
Immortals and Earth Immortals of our Black-White College will rise to
a new level of power. As a result, more members of the Black-White
College will be able to survive this storm.” Immortal Diancai
looked at Ning. “The arrival of a Dao-Repository at such a critical
moment is worth more than ten Dao-Repositories that come after the
storm passes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was puzzled.
“Master, how exactly is our Stillwater Commandery in a state of
chaos?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You don’t know?”
Immortal Diancai didn’t understand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I just returned to
the Grand Xia, and I didn’t have a chance to chat too much with old
brother Fivecraze before you left your meditations, Master,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai
nodded. “Then I’ll give you a rough idea. Stillwater
Commandery…right, roughly ten years ago, that friend of yours named
Northmont Baiwei suffered an assassination attempt and nearly died.
The assassination attempt was here in Stillwater City!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning was
shocked. “Within Stillwater City? But…but this is a direct
challenge to the Grand Xia Dynasty!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Violence was forbidden
within the commandery cities of the Grand Xia. This was the law! When
the likes of the Youngflame clan sent out the likes of Immortal
Floatcloud, they were sending out Deathsworn who were willing to die!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is Northmont
Baiwei doing now?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was lucky enough
to survive, and so he’s naturally doing fine,” Immortal Diancai
said. “During the past twenty, thirty years…there have been more
than a hundred assassination’s within Stillwater Commandery.
Although we all suspect that it was the Blood God Church behind them,
that’s just our suspicion; we have no proof. Without proof, it
isn’t appropriate for the Grand Xia Dynasty to intervene.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said, puzzled,
“The Blood God Church…one of the eight great powers of Stillwater
Commandery? They have this sort of audacity?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than a hundred
assassinations within Stillwater City…this was too crazy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why wouldn’t they?
They have more audacity than you can imagine.” Immortal Diancai
shook his head. “The Blood God Church has always been an
association of madmen…and in recent days, they have exploded forth
with astonishing power. They butted heads with the Northmont clan
multiple times recently, and it was actually the Northmont clan that
was at a disadvantage each time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning could
hardly believe it. The Northmont clan of Stillwater held the
marquisate for this entire region! The Blood God Church was merely
one of the eight strongest powers here. Logically speaking, if the
Northmont clan wanted to deal with the Blood God Church, it wouldn’t
be too hard for them to completely wipe it out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Blood God
Church’s power is far greater than it appeared in the past,”
Immortal Diancai said. “The leader of the Blood God Church battled
against Celestial Immortal Hunchmont…and even Celestial Immortal
Hunchmont was unable to do anything to him. Quite a few bases and
cultivator armies of the Northmont clan have been forcibly wiped out
and uprooted by the Blood God Church. In battles at the Loose
Immortal level or at lower levels, the Northmont clan has never been
able to seize the upper hand. All that can be said is that both sides
are fighting a tight battle against each other.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could scarcely
believe what he was hearing. An exalted marquisate was actually
unable to wipe out just one of eight major powers within its
demesnes?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The leader of the
Blood God Church wasn’t this powerful in the past.” Immortal
Diancai shook his head. “I even fought with him, the ‘Son of the
Blood God’, in the past. In such a short period of time…he’s
actually raised his power to the Celestial Immortal level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Northmont clan
of Stillwater is feeling some pain now. They want to pull in the
other powers to deal with the Blood God Church together,” Immortal
Diancai said. “But not just our own Stillwater Commandery is in a
state of chaos; the entire Grand Xia Dynasty is in a state of chaos.
How could the various tribes and schools dare act rashly?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could things
have ended up this way?” Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire Grand Xia
was in a state of chaos; it seemed as though the previous order had
already been torn apart. It was as though there was an incomparably
terrifying invisible hand moving behind the scenes, guiding
everything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The storm sweeping
the entire Grand Xia world, the sudden increase in power of the Blood
God School…these things have caused us to guess that there should
be a tremendous secret behind the rise of the Blood God School. Ji
Ning, you must not be a fool and charge blindly forward into it. This
is something for the Northmont clan to worry about,” Immortal
Diancai instructed. “During a storm, during a tribulation…you
need to be extremely careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded. “Master, go rest for now. I’m going to go meet with my
fellow disciples.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your fellow
disciples? Do you know where your junior apprentice-brother, Mu
Northson, has gone?” Immortal Diancai asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No idea. We haven’t
met for thirty-plus years; I was planning to go see him.” Puzzled,
Ning asked, “What, where is he?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai shook
his head. “More than twenty years ago, Mu Northson and his
Dao-companion both disappeared!”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_4___Those_Retainers_From"></A>
Chapter 4 - Those Retainers From Back Then
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Missing?” Ji
Ning’s heart trembled. He hurriedly asked, “Since when did he get
a Dao-companion? Who is his Dao-companion? And this ‘disappearing’
that happened twenty-plus years ago; are there no clues about it at
all? Can’t we ask the Heavenly Treasures Mountain to help out?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon seeing now nervous
Ning was, Immortal Diancai immediately explained, “After you became
the champion of the Conclave, some of the disciples of the
Black-White College that were outside returned here. Mu Northson
returned to Stillwater City as well, spending most of his time
training in his art of cconstructs. Occasionally, he would gather
with Northmont Baiwei as well as some of the other members of the
younger generation here in Stillwater City. During one of these
gatherings, he met with a female disciple of the Thousand Rivers
School, ‘Adept Yuxia’. Soon after they met, they grew to be quite
close and ended up becoming Dao-companions.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These two
Dao-companions had very deep feelings for each other, and quite a few
members of the younger generation here in Stillwater City envied
them. They were a celebrated couple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But after a period
of time, both he and his Dao-companion vanished. Generally speaking,
when disciples of the Black-White College go out adventuring, they
will inform people within the College, or leave behind a message of
some sort. But neither Mu Northson nor Adept Yuxia left any messages;
they just vanished.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Black-White
College looked into this matter; we even asked the Northmont clan of
Stillwater to help out, as well as the Heavenly Treasures Mountain.
However, we were still unable to find any traces of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They seemed to have
completely vanished from this world!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hearing his master’s
words, Ning grew even more panicked. He said hurriedly, “Can it be
that there have been traces of them in the past twenty-plus years?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“None.” Immortal
Diancai shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was really worried
now. It didn’t add up. This made no sense at all. Northson wasn’t
the unreliable sort. Northson was a true lifelong friend for Ning,
and friends with others besides! If he truly did have to leave
because of an important reason, he would’ve left a message for Ning
at least.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“During the past
twenty-plus years, even the number one intelligence organization in
the world, the Heavenly Treasures Mountain, wasn’t able to find any
trace of him at all,” Immortal Diancai said. “Northson’s
parents died long ago; he had no other kin. Adept Yuxia, however, did
have a tribe behind her, with both parents and elders; both of her
parents are alive, but they don’t have any news of her either.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…don’t
panic,” Immortal Diancai said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His life-tablet?”
Ning immediately asked. Given how long Northson had been missing for,
he was very possibly dead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mu Northson’s
life-tablet remains intact…but his Dao-companion’s has
shattered,” Immortal Diancai said. “Neither of them left behind
any messages before disappearing; they should’ve both met an
unusual circumstance. However…Northson has remained alive during
the past twenty-plus years. He probably won’t die that easily.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was worried now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson’s
Dao-companion had perished! This meant that their disappearance
involved a matter of great danger!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since he’s alive,
my best guess is that he is trapped in a special area that he can’t
leave for now,” Immortal Diancai said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No matter what, he had
to find out a way to investigate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go and rest for now.
I’m going back into my closed-door meditation,” Immortal Diancai
said. “The three sword-arts manuals you gave me have inspired me
significantly; if there’s nothing important, don’t bother me. I’m
going to be in seclusion for an extended period of time. Most likely,
once this seclusion ends, I will begin my Celestial Tribulation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That fast?” Ning
hadn’t expected his master to be in such a rush even after he had
given his master those three sword-arts tomes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I believe these
three sword-arts tomes will be enough to allow my sword techniques to
rise to a higher level in a short period of time. However…the
reason I can rise to a higher level in such a short time is because
of all of my accumulated experiences over the past years! If I want
to rise any further, however, I’ll probably need another century,
or perhaps even longer…and I have the feeling that I can’t wait
that long!” Immortal Diancai said softly, “That sense of pressure
and threat which my subconscious can sense…it is telling me that I
cannot afford to waste any time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After separating from
his master, Ning returned to the Darknorth Peak, the place within the
Black-White College which was reserved for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sumptuous feast had
been prepared within a courtyard inside Darknorth Peak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While Ning had been
chatting with Immortal Diancai, he had instructed the Whitewater
Hound and Little Qing to go back to Darknorth Peak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother.” Three figures within the hall bowed
reverently. A short little figure fell to his knees. “I pay my
respects to you, elder.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning swept them with
his gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the three was
Meng Roch, who looked as honest as always but now seemed even more
muscular than before. Next to him was a tall, skinny youth with a
deep gaze; this was Cloudship, who was now far calmer and more stable
than he had been before. Finally, there was a woman dressed in black
gauze, whose gaze remained as charismatic and alluring as before;
Cloudjade, who had been so young and fresh. She was holding the hand
of a child in her own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s gaze
fell upon the child.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, this is my child, Cloudease,” Cloudjade
said nervously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We haven’t met for
a few decades…to think you have a child now!” Ning laughed, then
nodded. “Meng Roch, it seems you are quite talented as a Fiendgod
Body Refiner; you’ve already trained to the Wanxiang level.
Cloudship, you have done well too.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he spoke, Ning sat
down. “Come, all of you, sit,” Ning said with a laugh.
Immediately, all the others sat down as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Years ago, when we
heard that you became the champion of the Conclave of Immortal
Destiny, and that your Primaltwin had killed a Loose Immortal, all of
us were filled with veneration and admiration. Now, we’ve finally
met you again, senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning,” Cloudship
laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded calmly.
“Right. Have you been well, these past years? Weifang, Forgard,
Nethersun; where are they?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had taken on a total
of six retainers. They were Meng Roch, Cloudship, Cloudjade, Weifang,
Forgard, and Nethersun.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Should I…or
should…” Cloudship looked towards Roch and Cloudjade.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother, why
don’t you tell him,” Cloudjade said. Roch nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cloudship looked
towards Ning, then said, “Senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning, you
have left Darknorth Peak for nearly forty years. Ever since you left,
the six of us trained diligently. Meng Roch is extremely talented as
a Fiendgod Body Refiner, and so focused on that, rarely leaving the
College. Nethersun, Forgard, Weifang, and myself would often go out
and adventure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forgard was
originally very powerful, but his potential was limited, and he
improved very slowly. Roughly ten years ago, when adventuring, he was
killed by another peak Zifu Disciple,” Cloudship said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Forgard…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had been a loyal
guard of Northmont Baiwei. He had appeared quite simple and honest,
and Ning originally had high expectations for him. However…after
getting to know him, Ning had realized that Forgard had slowly begun
to change after entering the Black-White College, causing Ning to
feel rather disappointed. And now, unexpectedly, he had ended up
dying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Weifang was
extremely talented, even more so than the rest of us,” Cloudship
said. “However…he became Dao-companions with a female cultivator
of the Hundred Flowers Fairyland. There ended up being some disputes
between him and that female cultivator, and in the end, a senior
apprentice-brother of that female cultivator actually killed him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning was
shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had heard long ago
that some Dao-companions would grow to hate each other, betray each
other, and even fight against each other. But he really didn’t
expect that this would happen to one of his six retainers!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nethersun?” Ning
asked. “Is he dead too?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nethersun left long
ago. He went back to his homeland. Based on what he said to us when
he left, he probably won’t come back in the future. He will
probably stay back at his homeland and protect it,” Cloudship said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded gently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cloudjade became
Dao-companions with a young master of the Eastriver clan, Eastriver
Bluecloud,” Cloudship said, and as he did, he instantly grew so
angry he began to grind his teeth. “Eastriver Bluecloud was a rare
genius, and he even became a member of our Black-White College.
Because he also likes to train in the sword, others often flattered
him as the ‘second Immortal Darknorth’. However, compared to you,
senior apprentice-brother, he is unfathomably inferior.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning drank his wine,
listening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Both I and my little
sister misjudged him. He came from a large clan, after all, and was
quite young; after he entered the Black-White College, especially
after he started hanging around with some of the other young masters
of Stillwater City, he changed. He began to buy quite a few female
slaves to play with, and he even started to hit and curse at my
little sister. Enraged, she separated from him, then brought little
Cloudease back to Darknorth Peak. Eastriver Bluecloud even wanted to
cause her some trouble, but thanks to your reputation, senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, he didn’t dare to act too rashly,”
Cloudship said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cloudjade sat there,
eyes red. She said softly, “I’ve embarrassed myself before you,
senior apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cloudjade truly was an
extremely alluring beauty. When she had first entered the Black-White
College, Ning’s own subordinates including Weifang, Nethersun, and
Forgard had all pursued and courted her. There were quite a few
ordinary disciples within the Black-White College who had courted
her, but she had her sights set higher and had taken an interest in
none of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Who would’ve thought
that in the end, she would end up choosing a talented young master of
the Eastriver clan, Eastriver Bluecloud, a formal disciple of the
Black-White College?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unfortunately…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end…this had
been her aftermath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Meng Roch
has become the most formidable of us,” Cloudship said. “Brother
Meng Roch is extremely talented as a Fiendgod Body Refiner, and in
fact Immortal Fivecraze took a liking to him and took him on as a
disciple, making him a formal disciple of the Black-White College. He
has his own mountain peak now, but he’s always continued to live
here, not moving away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning looked
towards Roch with surprise, then laughed. “You’ve become a formal
disciple? Old brother Fivecraze has exceptionally astute judgment;
since he’s taken a liking to you, it must mean that your future
truly is limitless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If it hadn’t been
for you, senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning, helping me enter the
Black-White College so many years ago…I don’t know where I would
be right now,” Roch said honestly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Roch
didn’t show the slightest bit of arrogance; it seemed as though of
his six retainers, Roch was the only one who was particularly
impressive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s the other
five. As for me…” Cloudship chortled. “Only after training for
many years did I discover that I actually like the art of
constructs.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six retainers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two died. One returned
home. Cloudship was low-key, while the devilishly alluring Cloudjade
was now a single mother. Only Roch, who had originally been the
weakest of the six, had suddenly soared in status, becoming a formal
disciple of the Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning had returned to
the Black-White College. When he was strolling outside with Immortal
Diancai, many disciples of the Black-White College saw him. News of
this quickly spread, and the Heavenly Treasures Mountain naturally
learned of this as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The champion of the
Conclave of Immortal Destiny, Ji Ning, has once more returned to the
Black-White College after a thirty-year disappearance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spread the word.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than a thousand
Immortal cultivators were sending out intelligence reports.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were many, many
people who were paying attention to Ji Ning in the Grand Xia world.
Aside from the likes of Ninelotus, Princess Xiyue, and the Youngflame
clan, there were also many hidden powers that had long ago turned
their attention to Ji Ning, the champion of the Conclave who had so
mysteriously vanished! After all…everyone knew how extraordinary
that Conclave had been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That was a Conclave
where two participants had been chosen by Daofathers to become
personal disciples! Ji Ning had been the champion of that Conclave,
but he hadn’t become a member of Daofather Crimsonbright’s
league; instead, he had vanished without a trace.

Chapter 5 - The Number One Assassin’s Guild of the Grand Xia
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the very peak of a
grand mountain, there lay an ancient tower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A gray-robed figure was
advancing towards the toward at high speed, like a streak of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entrance to the
tower was guarded by a pair of black-armored guards. These two guards
stretched out their arms, barring the entrance. One of them growled,
“This is a restricted area. No access permitted.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve come per the
orders of the clan leader. I have important news to report to the
Patriarch.” The gray-robed man respectfully handed forward a
hidebound scroll.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” One of the
guards accepted the scroll, then entered the tower. As for the
gray-robed man, he respectfully, quietly departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first floor of the
tower. A tall, skinny elder with long, narrow eyes was seated
silently in the lotus position; it was Celestial Immortal Arcanum of
the Youngflame clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch.” The
black-armored warrior entered, saluted respectfully, then offered the
scroll with both hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum
opened his eyes. Waving his hand, he caused the hidebound scroll to
fly to him, then calmly instructed, “Leave me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The
black-armored guard hurriedly departed, once more taking up silent
guard outside the entrance to the tower. He had been standing outside
this tower for more than a hundred million years now; ever since he
had been created, he had spent the majority of his life guarding this
tower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Patriarch
Arcanum unfurled the scroll, calmly looking at its contents.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm?” Patriarch
Arcanum frowned. “That brat, Ji Ning, has returned? And not just
him; even his spirit-beasts have returned, and both have actually
reached the early Void level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No one doubted that
Ning had the ability to reach the Void level. After all, even before
the Conclave had begun, Ning’s Primaltwin, at the peak Primal
Daoist level, had been able to kill a Loose Immortal. It was very
normal for Ning to become an Earth Immortal after thirty years. But
for both his spirit-beasts to reach the Void level and become Earth
Immortals…this was very abnormal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because humans
had a much higher level of comprehension than monsters. For the two
spirit-beasts to both become Void-level Earth Immortals clearly meant
that they had already surpassed the level of comprehension necessary
of Earth Immortals! Even though Whitewater Hounds and Azure Skysnakes
were Godbeasts, logically speaking, they shouldn’t be able to train
at such a pace! Monsters were innately slow at training. For them to
train so quickly…they must have encountered some sort of unique
fortune!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems that during
his thirty-year disappearance, this Ji Ning must have had a stroke of
luck.” Cold light flashed through Patriarch Arcanum’s long,
narrow eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone.”
Patriarch Arcanum suddenly called out, his voice passing through the
void and entering another space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice echoed within
this other space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black fog door
appeared not too far away from Patriarch Arcanum. Four figures
emerged from the black fog door. There was a handsome youth, an
ancient elder, a big fellow who carried a large clock with one hand,
and a wizened, white-haired elder whose eyes were shut.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four walked over,
then sat down in the lotus position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arcanum, why have
you called for us?” The handsome youth asked calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What important
matter has occurred, for you to call the four of us over?” The man
holding the golden clock said in a low voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other two were
silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were
Celestial Immortal Patriarchs; they were the true pillars of the
Youngflame clan! Because of the dangerous undercurrents currently
flowing within the world of the Grand Xia, even Celestial Immortals
like them were being very cautious. All five of them, Patriarch
Arcanum included, were stationed here and guarding this divine tower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, take a
look.” Patriarch Arcanum waved his hand, and the hidebound scroll
flew out to levitate in midair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four Celestial
Immortals all took a look, and the wizened elder with closed eyes
swept it within his coresense as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That Ji Ning is
back?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Naturally, they all
knew Ji Ning’s name. During the previous Conclave of Immortal
Destiny, they weren’t yet aware of how special it was, but after
its conclusion…the Grand Xia world began to be filled with
dangerous undercurrents. In fact, a storm was about to burst upon the
entire Three Realms…and so they understood that a great tribulation
was about to come to pass.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As they saw it, an
enormous storm like this might be easily overcome by True Gods or
Daofathers, but things would be dangerous for Celestial Immortals
like them. During every single previous storm, large numbers of
Celestial Immortals had perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three Realms are
in a turbulent state. That previous Conclave will most likely have
given birth to future major powers of the Three Realms. Two
competitors in that Conclave became disciples of Daofathers!”
Patriarch Arcanum growled, “And this Ji Ning; he became the
champion of that Conclave. He disappeared in a mysterious fashion for
thirty years, but didn’t become apprenticed to any of the Immortals
or Fiends of the Crimsonbright League. And now, even his two
spirit-beasts have both become Void-level Earth Immortals! Without
question…during the past thirty years, this Ji Ning has had a
tremendous stroke of luck!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He probably became
apprenticed to one of the major forces of the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other four
Patriarchs all nodded in agreement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He is a survivor of
the Yuchi clan. Our Youngflame clan wiped out their entire lineage.
His mother was named Yuchi Snow; all of Yuchi Snow’s kinsmen died
in the hands of our Youngflame clansmen. This Ji Ning hates our
Youngflame clan, without question,” Patriarch Arcanum said. “What’s
more, our Youngflame clan even sent a Loose Immortal Deathsworn to
assassinate him. It is most likely going to be very hard to resolve
this enmity between us!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I had originally
thought that he would become apprenticed to a True Immortal or
Empyrean God under the command of Daofather Crimsonbright, but
unexpectedly he did not.” Patriarch Arcanum said excitedly, “If
he had become apprenticed to Sword Immortal Evergreen, then for the
sake of giving the Sword Immortal face, it wouldn’t be appropriate
for us to act. Now, however, we have nothing to worry about. Even if
he became apprenticed to an expert of the Three Realms…that expert
is not a member of the Crimsonbright League! He has no authority over
us!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus, I feel…that
we need to eradicate him as soon as possible! While he is merely a
Void-level Earth Immortal, we need to eradicate him!” Patriarch
Arcanum was extremely forceful in his words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s
reasonable!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A pity we don’t
know who his master is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who cares who his
master is? As long as he isn’t of our Crimsonbright League, what
have we to worry about?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The various major
powers of the Three Realms were like local hegemons that dominated a
specific region. It was very sommon for the Fiends and Immortals
under their command to fight against and slaught each other…and
generally, the major powers wouldn’t intervene, so long as other
major powers also didn’t intervene. The major powers would
generally all be quite calm in watching those of the younger
generation do battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even when disciples
died…the only thing that could be said was that their skills were
insufficient.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Struggles and battles
within the Three Realms were very common! Thus, as Patriarch Arcanum
and the others saw it, Ning joining the Crimsonbright League would
actually be much more troublesome; after all, that would mean they
were all on the same side, and Ning’s master would be able to
easily deal with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since Ning had not
joined the Crimsonbright League…things had become much easier for
Patriarch Arcanum and the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have nothing to
worry about, but it’s best to be cautious. I feel as though we need
to figure out who his master is! The Three Realms have a number of
madmen who are extremely protective of their disciples, and quite a
few have even assaulted the Celestial Court in the past. One of them
might just be willing to take revenge upon us for killing his
disciple,” the handsome youth said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mmm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sunfish’s words
are reasonable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning’s master
dared to abscond with him, giving our Crimsonbright League no face. I
imagine his master…truly is an extremely audacious fellow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum,
hearing the words of his peers, couldn’t help but frown. “What
are you afraid of? First of all, there’s very few madmen who would
be truly willing to assault the territory of our Crimsonbright
League; I refuse to believe that one of them just so happens to be
his master. Secondly…even if one of them is, given the state of
chaos the Three Realms are in, who would dare to act rashly in a time
like this, even if they would do so normally?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arcanum’s words
are reasonable, but as I see it, we should invite the Bloodcloud Hall
to do it,” said the wizened elder whose eyes remained closed this
entire time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the room
fell silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ask the Bloodcloud
Hall?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s going to
cost quite a price.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine the
Bloodcloud Hall will ask quite a bit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum, on
the other hand, actually nodded. “Drywood’s words are correct.
Since everyone is worried about the mysterious master behind Ji Ning,
then let us have the Bloodcloud Hall act instead. When they take on
missions, they swear oaths to the Dao of the Heavens not to reveal
anything; they won’t let anyone know that it was us who asked them
to do it. Spending a bit of treasure to buy some peace of mind…I
feel that it is worth it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine. I agree.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. It’s best
to invite the Bloodcloud Hall; we can just consider it as us using
some treasure to purchase Ji Ning’s life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s settled,
then.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch, you
handle this matter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum
nodded lightly. Naturally, he wouldn’t decline. That very day, he
quietly left this tower and headed to the Bloodcloud Hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within an enormous
mountain that stretched hundreds of thousands of kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum
arrived within a mountain gorge, holding an insignia. The mist within
the gorge swirled everywhere, but deep within it, a large, tall
teleportation tower could be seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This way, please.”
There was a member of the Bloodcloud Hall standing there, looking at
Patriarch Arcanum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a single step,
Patriarch Arcanum entered the grand teleportation array. The
teleportation tower then lit up, and swoosh! Patriarch Arcanum
disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Patriarch
Arcanum stood atop the clouds. Here, atop the clouds, there was
another towering teleportation array.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum
stared into the distance. He saw a vast, endless sea of blood-colored
clouds, and the faint outlines of a building hidden deep within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s the
Bloodcloud Hall?” Patriarch Arcanum felt startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Bloodcloud Hall…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an extremely
mysterious power. It had suddenly appeared thirty years ago, and it
had handed these insignias to all of the major powers of the Grand
Xia world. Only supreme powers of the likes of the Northmont clan of
Stillwater or the Youngflame clan were qualified to receive these
insignias. As for powers on the level the Black-White College, they
weren’t even qualified to know about the Bloodcloud Hall’s
existence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By relying on the
insignia, one could go to some mysterious places, then be teleported
to a completely different world. Bloodcloud Hall was within this
mysterious world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No one knew there the
Bloodcloud Hall was actually located!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As long as one is
willing to pay the price, any Immortal or Fiend in the world of the
Grand Xia aside from the Xia Emperor can be assassinated by our
Bloodcloud Hall!” These were the bold words issued forth by the
Bloodcloud Hall. And indeed, they truly did have tremendous,
terrifying power; during the past thirty short years, they had
already assassinated more than ten Celestial Immortal Patriarchs!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bloodcloud Hall had
thus become acknowledged by all the supreme powers as the ‘numer
one assassin’s guild of the Grand Xia’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bloodcloud Hall also
protected its customers’ information, to the point of even swearing
oaths to the Dao of the Heavens to not leak any of it at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum was
quickly led to a quiet flower garden. Although he was led here,
Patriarch Arcanum wasn’t sure about the path he had taken. “This
Bloodcloud Hall must be an enormous, powerful estate-type magic
treasure. Space within it is in a state of flux, and so I cannot
determine the true pattern within it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within theflower
garden.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A silver-robed maiden
was seated opposite of Patriarch Arcanum. Between the two of them lay
a stone table, with a scroll placed atop it. The scroll was their
contract.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill Ji Ning?” The
silver-robed maiden said softly, “He was the champion of the
Conclave of Immortal Destiny. He disappeared for thirty years; he was
most likely taken by a True Immortal or Empyrean God as a disciple.
In fact, there’s a sliver of a chance that it was a Daofather who
took on a genius like him for a disciple. His Primaltwin was able to
defeat a Loose Immortal all those years ago; I imagine his power must
be much, much higher now. He might even be comparable to a Loose
Immortal who has lived for a million years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you taking the
mission or not?” Patriarch Arcanum growled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are. Of course we
are.” The silver-robed woman laughed calmly. “As long as you are
willing to pay the price.”

Chapter 6 - An Arrival From the Heaven Realm
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Price? What sort of
price?” Patriarch Arcanum’s long, slender eyes narrowed as he
looked at the silver-robed maiden.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-robed maiden
responded with a calm smile, “For example…three top-grade
Immortal-ranked magic items, or items of equivalent value.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The corners of
Patriarch Arcanum’s eyes instantly twitched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Top-grade
Immortal-ranked magic treasures? Three of them?” Patriarch Arcanum
had heard that the Bloodcloud Hall charged a high price, but he was
still stunned by what they requested.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ning has
only trained for around seventy years!” Patriarch Arcanum couldn’t
help but growl, “Less than a century! He is currently at most
comparable to a Loose Immortal who has lived for five hundred
thousand years! The chances of him being comparable to a Loose
Immortal who has lived for a million years is virtually negligible.
To kill a young fellow like him, you want to charge me three
top-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasures?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t get angry.
This is a business deal; both of us have to be willing to take part
in it.” The silver-robed maiden laughed. “Indeed, the chance that
Ji Ning has the power of a Loose Immortal who has lived a million
years is very low…but the main issue with this mission does not lie
with Ji Ning himself; Bloodcloud Hall holds a young fellow like him
in no regard at all. The main issue with this mission is the master
who stands behind him! He was the champion of the Conclave. His
thirty-year disappearance…no one knows who his master is! Perhaps
as we assassinate him, he will shatter some sort of talisman and his
master will suddenly appear! Bloodcloud Hall estimates his master to
be a True Immortal or Empyrean God at the very least; once his master
appears, the squad which we sent out will undoubtedly perish! Since
we are taking on a major risk, we naturally are going to request a
high price!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Pure Yang True
Immortal or an Empyrean God; either would be considered an expert of
the Three Realms. In the world of the Grand Xia, the Xia Emperor was
the only Pure Yang True Immortal present!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the assassins
Bloodcloud Hall sent out were to run into True Immortals or Empyrean
Gods, they would unquestionably perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Patriarch
Arcanum shook his head. “Stop trying to fool me. When experts of
the Three Realms train disciples, they all let them go out into the
world to experience danger on their own. If their disciples are
killed, those disciples can only blame themselves for being less
skilled than their foes! How can experts and major powers of the
Three Realms so casually intervene? That would be the same as abusing
those of a lower status!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-robed maiden
smiled. “Ji Ning’s background is significant. Three top-grade
Immortal-ranked magic items, or treasures of an equivalent value.
This is what Bloodcloud Hall requires!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…” Patriarch
Arcanum gritted his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you are
unwilling, then you can leave, Celestial Immortal Arcanum.” The
silver-robed maiden continued to smile at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum
gritted his teeth, then pulled out some Immortal pills,
spirit-ingredients, Immortal-ranked magic treasures, and an enormous
amount of liquefied elemental essence. Although he had come
prepared…top-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasures were very
important for Celestial Immortals, and the Youngflame clan wouldn’t
easily hand them out. They would rather use other treasures to make
up for them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This should be
enough.” A savage light flashed through Patriarch Arcanum’s eyes.
His heart was bleeding at the cost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is enough.” The
silver-robed maiden nodded. “Celestial Immortal Arcanum, don’t
worry; Bloodcloud Hall definitely won’t inform others of this
assignment. I can swear an oath to the Dao of the Heavens regarding
this. As for Ji Ning…Bloodcloud Hall will make careful
preparations, so as to ensure our success. Within a year’s time, he
will die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good. I’ll await
the good word from you, then.” Patriarch Arcanum nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three top-grade
Immortal-ranked magic treasures. This was a price that was neither
high nor low. Celestial Immortals who had lived as long as he had
would generally all have several top-grade Immortal-ranked magic
treasures on them. In fact, some truly supreme Celestial Immortal
Patriarchs might even have Pure Yang treasures on them! Thus, for the
Youngflame clan as a whole, producing three top-grade Immortal-ranked
treasures would cause a bit of heartache but not bankrupt them. At a
critical time like this, with the Three Realms in a state of
turbulence, they were willing to pay this level of price in order to
eliminate a threat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial capital of
the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was standing atop
a cloud, flying through the wide streets of the imperial capital. He
had spent a day within the Black-White College of Stillwater, then
had visited his good friend Northmont Baiwei before heading to the
imperial capital of the Grand Xia. This was a time of turbulence in
the Three Realms, after all; the sooner he could purchase materials
for setting up formations, the better.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“King Yan’s
Estate.” Ning saw a familiar estate from the distance. After having
arrived, he was naturally going to first visit his cousin before
going to the Heavenly Treasures Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Ning led the
Whitewater Hound in flying to the estate, Little Qing wrapped around
his arm as always.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are young master
Ji Ning?” The estate guards recognized him right away, and they
revealed looks of surprise on their faces. Thirty years was a fairly
short period of time for Immortal cultivators; they had begun their
services here well over thirty years ago, and so they naturally
recognized him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wish to see the
princess,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master Ji
Ning, please wait a moment. I’ll go make the report right away.”
Instantly, a guard flew into the estate to make the report.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, a group of people
came out from the estate, the leader being his cousin, Princess
Xiyue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Princess
Xiyue looked at Ning, an expression of excitement instantly covering
her face. “I just heard last night from the Heavenly Treasures
Mountain that you returned. I was planning to go find you after
finishing some affairs here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It should be me who
comes to visit you, Princesss.” Ning noticed that next to her was a
tall, handsome man with white skin who appeared to be rather close to
her. He couldn’t help but laugh. “This is…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” An awkward
expression appeared on Princess Xiyue’s face. She immediately said,
“This is young master Feng Yungu from the Windlocked Isles of the
Heaven Realm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve long heard of
your famous name, brother Ji Ning. Today, I see that you truly are
extraordinary.” The tall, handsome young master Yungu spoke in a
modest manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gave him a glance,
then nodded in secret; this Feng Yunge acted quite modestly and put
on no airs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry on in. Why are
you standing here in the doorway?” Princess Xiyue said hurriedly
while sending a stealthy mental message to Ning. “Cousin, unless
something unexpected happens, this young master Yungu will most
likely become my husband.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?” Ning was
mentally stunned. He hurriedly sent back, “Cousin, the two of
you…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He will marry into
King Yan’s Estate,” Princess Xiyue sent to him. “In the future,
I am going to resurrect the Yuchi clan; thus, I can’t marry out
into another clan. As for this young master Yungu…because the Grand
Xia Dynasty is allied with the Windlocked Isles of the Heaven Realm,
quite a few of the imperial Xia clansmen have become Dao-companions
with the disciples of the Windlocked Isles. I could tell that he’s
not bad, and he’s also quite obedient; he was even willing to marry
into King Yan’s Estate. That’s why I decided to accept him as my
Dao-companion.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Windlocked Isles of
the Heaven Realm?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Xia Dynasty?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s not only
willing to marry into her family, he’s also obedient to her
wishes…and I can tell that he seems to be the humble sort.” Ning
nodded privately. His cousin was completely focused on vengeance; a
husband like this would perhaps be good for her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cousin, you don’t
need to pay too much attention to young master Yungu; his status in
the Windlocked Isles of the Heaven Realm isn’t very high, and his
power is ordinary, but he’s an extremely good-natured person,”
Princess Xiyue sent. “However…another disciple of the Windlocked
Isles is currently present within King Yan’s Estate. He, too, is
pursuing me; he wants to marry me and take me back to the Windlocked
Isles with him. His name is Feng Yunpeng; his status within the
Windlocked Isles is extremely high! He is one of the two sons of the
master of the Windlocked Isles, and the Grand Xia Emperor long ago
instructed the imperial Xia clansmen are not to cause trouble with
him. You need to be careful as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? Don’t worry,”
Ning replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They entered the
estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuchi Xiyue prepared a
welcoming banquet for Ning. The three of them chatted quite happily
with each other. Young master Yungu seemed to have a bit of an
innately self-abasing character; in front of Ning, at least, he acted
very modestly and self-deprecatingly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, I heard that
the champion of the Grand Xia’s Conclave of Immortal Destiny, the
peerless genius Ji Ning, had arrived here at King Yan’s Estate.
Xiyue, why didn’t you inform me? You were wrong in not doing so.”
Accompanying a loud laughter, a youth dressed in gaudy golden Daoist
robes came walking in. The youth’s eyes twinkled like the stars,
and his aura was quite extraordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Behind him were two
powerful servants. One had the aura of a Fiendgod; he was most likely
a Void-level Fiendgod! The other was an extremely powerful Loose
Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master
Yunpeng, I didn’t want to disturb you,” Princess Xiyue said with
a laugh. “Please sit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Feng Yungu hurriedly
rose to give up his own seat, sitting down in a lower seat. As for
young master Yunpeng, he sat down directly after Princess Xiyue, face
to face with Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, this is
young master Yunpeng, a genius of the Windlocked Isles of the Heaven
Realm. He, too, is an expert who is a Void-level Earth Immortal,”
Princess Xiyue said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings to you,
young master Yunpeng,” Ning said, clasping his hands slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young master Yunpeng
gave Ning a clearly rather indifferent glance, but as he did, his
face changed slightly. With a laugh, he said, “Oh, so you’ve
become a Void-level Earth Immortal, Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just the early-stage
Void-level. Compared to you, young master Yunpeng, I’m a bit
lacking,” Ning said modestly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” Young
master Yunpeng laughed smugly. “I hear that you are on very good
terms with Xiyue. You have to help me dissuade her! She’s insisting
on marrying that useless thing over there; isn’t that an utter
desecration of a heavenly treasure?” As he spoke, he gave the
nearby Feng Yungu a disdainful look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No matter how good of a
temper Feng Yungu had, he couldn’t prevent his face from
changing…but immediately afterwards, he lowered his head slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young master Yunpeng’s
laughter became even more wanton. “Xiyue and I, by contrast, are a
perfect match!” As he spoke, he reached his hand out to stroke
Princess Xiyue’s. Princess Xiyue moved away slightly, her face
sinking. “Young master Yunpeng.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine, fine, fine. I
won’t rush things.” Young master Yunpeng laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all, Princess
Xiyue had a Celestial Immortal, King Yan, behind her. Given that the
Windlocked Isles were an ally of the Grand Xia Dynasty, he didn’t
want to cause any problems either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master
Yunpeng.” Ning felt an extreme distaste towards this person, but he
still changed the subject. “I hear that you come from the
Windlocked Isles of the Heaven Realm. I haven’t been to the Heaven
Realm yet; why don’t you tell me about of the Heaven Realm and help
broaden my horizons?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young master Yunpeng
frowned. Introduce the Heaven Realm? Him? Who did Ji Ning think he
was? Asking him to introduce the Heaven Realm to him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…he gave
Princess Xiyue a sidelong glance, then said with a calm snort, “The
Heaven Realm is quite large. The eastern part of the Heaven Realm is
managed by the Celestial Court, while the western side is managed by
the Buddhists of Mount Ling 1. But of course, there are many asuras
and devas who live throughout the Heaven Realm, and they have
naturally joined together to form powers. Our Windlocked Isles can be
considered one of those powers, I suppose.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard that after
you became the champion of the Conclave, Ji Ning, you decided not to
take on Sword Immortal Evergreen as your master, and you also didn’t
take on any of the Immortals or Fiends of Daofather Crimsonbright’s
league as your master. Instead, you vanished…I wonder, where did
you go, brother Ji Ning?” Young master Yunpeng’s eyes lit up as
he asked this question; clearly, he was quite curious about this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Naturally, I went to
study with my master,” Ning said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who?” Yunpeng
asked. “Where did you study?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master has ordered
that I cannot tell others.” Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young master Yunpeng
couldn’t help but frown.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning disliked this
young master Yunpeng very much. He immediately said, “Princess
Xiyue, I’m going to the Heavenly Treasures Mountain to buy some
items. I’ll leave now.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 7 - A Single Arrow
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Princess
Xiyue could tell that this young master Yunpeng wasn’t a dcent
person. Although Ji Ning had endured it for her sake, in his bones,
he remained a proud person; if too much time passed, problems would
most likely occur. She immediately agreed, “Alright, Ji Ning, you
can go to the Heavenly Treasures Mountain. We’ll meet some other
time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Heavenly
Treasures Mountain?” Young master Yunpeng raised an eyebrow,
glancing sideways at Ning, then immediately said, “Xiyue, it’s
been a long time since we’ve gone to the Heavenly Treasures
Mountain. Since brother Ji Ning is going, let’s go with him. Yungu,
would you agree?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Feng Yungu had been
sitting there quietly this entire time. Upon hearing young master
Yunpeng speak, he hurriedly nodded. “Sure, sure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, seeing this,
couldn’t help but frown. This person his cousin wanted to get
married to was a bit too craven.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiyue!” Young
master Yunpeng looked towards Princess Xiyue, who could only nod.
“Fine, let’s go together then.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Princess
Xiyue, young master Yunpeng, and Feng Yungu were naturally
accompanied by a host of servants. They all rode aboard an
Immortal-ranked flying ship, and in an awe-inspiring manner, they
flew out into the imperial capital of the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This high-grade
Immortal-ranked treasure-vessel of mine has been infused with an
‘Azure Polaris Spirit’; in terms of speed alone, it is comparable
to a top-grade Immortal-ranked flying ship,” young master Yunpeng
said in an extremely smug manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced sideways
at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This young master
Yunpeng really did have quite a few treasures; to buy an
Immortal-ranked flying ship such as this, even five million kilograms
would be far from sufficient.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little brother, just
endure it for now,” Princess Xiyue sent mentally to Ning. “Although
this young master Yunpeng is quite talented in cultivation, he is
innately arrogant and overbearing. Still…since his Windlocked Isles
and our Grand Xia Dynasty are allied, he wouldn’t dare cause too
much trouble. Just ignore the crap he is spewing out, little
brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cousin, given how
arrogant and overbearing he is, why are you letting him remain within
the King’s estate?” Ning sent back and asked, “I trust that if
King Yan asked him to leave, he definitely wouldn’t stay.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although he’s
arrogant and overbearing, he’s trying to woo me; naturally, he
often buys some gifts for me,” Princess Xiyue said. “In order to
rebuild the Yuchi clan in the future, I naturally need to store up
some treasures for it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cousin, you…”
Ning was flabbergasted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you starting to
look down on me, cousin?” Princess Xiyue sent back calmly, “I
don’t care about these matters; I swore an oath long ago that I
would definitely carry out my father’s wishes. I will rebuild the
Yuchi clan! For the sake of the Yuchi clan, I am willing to do
anything…including give up my life! All I need to do right now is
endure this young master Yunpeng’s nonsense and give him a bit of
hope, and he’ll continue to often gift me with treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning truly didn’t
know what to say.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. I
won’t let him take any advantage of me whatsoever; the best thing
in the world is the thing you cannot get. If I let him take advantage
of me, he wouldn’t be pursuing me in such a fervent manner. His
treasures? I’ll take them. But him? In the end, he’ll just slink
away in disgrace!” Princess Xiyue sent back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense the
determination within his cousin’s heart. He couldn’t help but say
with worry, “That Feng Yungu…I feel as though the two of you…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You feel he isn’t
worth of me, right? It is precisely because he is an absolute
good-for-nothing coward that I am willing to marry him. Otherwise…how
could I be able to completely control him?” Princess Xiyue sent
back. “Don’t worry. I have Grandpa’s help; I can take care of
small matters like this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cousin, if there’s
anything you need, arrange for a message to be sent to me. Don’t
forget that I, too, am of the Yuchi clan,” Ning sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. I still have
you, little brother,” Princess Xiyue sent back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main headquarters
of the Heavenly Treasures Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within an extremely
tall and luxuriously decorated banquet hall, a feast was in
procession. The pillars outside this hall were so tall that someone
standing atop the pillars could stare down at the entire imperial
capital of the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master
Yunpeng, you brought little sister Xiyue again. It seems as though
our Heavenly Treasures Mountain is about to have even more business
come our way,” the white-robed Fairy Azurewillow said with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha! It pleases
me to do this for Xiyue!” Young master Yunpeng laughed loudly,
giving Ning a sidelong glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the way over, Ning
and Yuchi Xiyue had constantly been sending mental messages to each
other. Young master Yunpeng had noticed…that the relationship
between them seemed to be clearly much closer than the relationship
two ordinary friends would have! This caused him to feel rather
displeased inside. “Hmph, he’s merely the champion of the Grand
Xia Dynasty’s Conclave! Today, here at the Heavenly Treasures
Mountain, I’m going to cause you to lose tremendous face!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Ji Ning,
what have you come to the Heavenly Treasures Mountain to purchase?”
Young master Yunpeng said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said calmly, “Just
some materials and raw ingredients.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment,
the Whitewater Hound by Ning’s side transformed into human form.
Uncle White waved his hand and two hidebound scrolls flew from him to
Ning. Uncle White sent mentally, “Ning, child, there’s a list of
items here for setting down layers formations that are capable of
overawing even Celestial Immortals, making them afraid to trespass
within.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second list
consists of the items necessary to set down three supremely ferocious
formations that I found at Mount Innerheart. In addition, these three
supremely ferocious formations can even link with each other…they
are so powerful that I imagine even True Immortals and Empyrean Gods
would be wary of them. There is no way True Immortals and Empyrean
Gods can force their way through these three formations; only True
Immortals and Empyrean Gods who are experts at formations might be
able to break them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are that
incredible?!” Ning was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…the
treasures needed on the second list are quite precious, even though
they aren’t extremely rare,” Uncle White sent. “If you don’t
have enough, then just buy the items on the first list; that will be
enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning handed over the
two hidebound scrolls to Fairy Azurewillow. “Fairy Azurewillow,
take a look at the list of ingredients and materials on these two
scrolls. Does your Heavenly Treasures Mountain have them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the main
headquarters of the Heavenly Treasures Mountain; even if Celestial
Immortals came here to shop, we’d be able to accommodate them, much
less just a few precious materials.” Smiling, Fairy Azurewillow
accepted the lists. Upon seeing the first one, however, her face
instantly changed. She gave Ning a surprised glance, and then she
looked at the second hidebound scroll.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time, Fairy
Azurewillow was truly stunned!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She was just a bit
surprised upon seeing the first list, but the second list truly
stunned her…because the items requested were simply too shocking!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not cleared to
handle something like this. A moment, please,” Fairy Azurewillow
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fairy Azurewillow,
even you aren’t cleared?” Young master Yunpeng, watching from the
side, smirked. “It’s just a few ingredients and raw materials,
not Immortal-ranked magic treasures. Can it be that the items which
brother Ji Ning have chosen are extremely strange and rare?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A silver-haired man
appeared out of nowhere within the hall. The invisible pressure and
presence he gave off…everyone present understood that he was a
Celestial Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch.” Fairy
Azurewillow handed the two hidebound scrolls to him. “These are the
lists of ingredients which Ji Ning needs. There are two lists.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-haired man
nodded, accepted the lists, then looked at the first one. He said
calmly, “The first list will require 4.3 million kilograms of
liquefied elemental essence!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuchi Xiyue, Feng
Yungu, and the others all felt a sense of pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than four million
kilograms?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pretty pricy,” the
nearby young master Yunpeng said in a nonchalant manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-haired man
then looked at the second hidebound scroll. When he did, even his
face couldn’t help but change. After staring for a long moment, he
lifted his head to look at Ning, a complicated look in his eyes.
“Young friend Ji Ning…are you sure you aren’t playing a little
joke on us?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since I’ve written
a list, I naturally wish to buy the items on it,” Ning said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How much liquefied
elemental essence does the second list cost?” Young master Yunpeng
asked. He felt that he was quite wealthy and magnanimous; he would be
able to afford even a top-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Liquefied elemental
essence?” The silver-haired man shook his head. “Treasures like
this…no amount of liquefied elemental essence is enough for them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young master Yunpeng’s
face changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fairy Azurewillow,
Princess Xiyue, Feng Yungu, and the others were all stunned. They
were all fairly experienced, and so they knew…liquefied elemental
essence was fairly useful for those below the Celestial Immortal
level, but was of increasingly little use to the true experts of the
Three Realms. For example, Ning had to use Immortal pills in order to
train in the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortals and
Daofathers absorbed prodigious amounts of natural elemental ki; thus,
ordinary liquefied elemental essence was like water to them; it was
extremely common.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True treasures could
only be traded for using other treasures!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How much at least?”
Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At least ten
top-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasures,” the silver-haired man
said. “Or a low-grade Pure Yang treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pure Yang treasure?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone present was
shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, was
quite calm. These materials were to be used to set up a series of
formations so ferocious that they could block even True Immortals or
Empyrean Gods, unless the True Immortals or Empyrean Gods were
extremely skilled in the art of formations. To be able to set up
formations of such power for the cost of merely a single low-grade
Pure Yang magic treasure…that wasn’t bad at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At least ten
top-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasures? Not even ordinary
Celestial Immortals have that much. All of my treasures combined
would most likely be worth just three or four top-grade
Immortal-ranked magic treasures.” Young master Yunpeng felt an
enormous pressure bear down upon him. He was proud of how wealthy he
was and how many treasures he had, but he was now completely stunned.
“There’s no way he can afford that. No way.” He stared fixedly
at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone was staring at
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Will this treasure
suffice?” Ning waved his hand, and instantly a faint tidal wave of
fire burst forth it. Within Ning’s palm there was a fiery arrow!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This arrow was the
arrow which Ning had acquired from the gorge within the Riverfang
Mountains. The most precious treasures the Fiendgod corpse had on it
consisted of the high-grade Protocosmic ‘Rahu Bow’ and the two
fiery arrows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Truly powerful, divine
archers all had custom-made arrows, and the price of each arrow was
prodigious. Ning had chatted with the Rahu Bow before, and the Rahu
Bow had said this: “This type of arrow is known as a ‘Firetruth
Arrow’; although they are vastly inferior to me in value, each of
them are still comparable to a low-grade Pure Yang treasure in
value.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had sighed in
amazement upon hearing this as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single arrow
would cost him the equivalent of a low-grade Pure Yang treasure. How
could he not feel heartache at the cost?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…with the
appearance of the flaming arrow came a powerful aura of might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is…?” The
silver-haired man’s face changed. He carefully inspected the arrow,
even using his coresense on it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A single arrow?”
Young master Yunpeng actually secretly shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that a
single arrow is comparable to ten top-grade Immortal-ranked magic
treasures?” Both Princess Xiyue and Fairy Azurewillow were puzzled.
Although they were experienced, they knew very little about the truly
powerful divine archers of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After inspecting the
arrow for a long time, the silver-haired man looked towards Ning. He
said in a low voice, “It suffices!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I also need you to
add an extra fifteen million kilograms of liquefied elemental essence
into the deal!” Ning said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Princess Xiyue and the
others were all stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-haired man
hesitated a moment, then nodded seriously. “Fine. Our Heavenly
Treasures Mountain can add another fifteen million kilograms into the
mix!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young master Yunpeng’s
face changed. He couldn’t help but swallow, his earlier arrogance,
smugness, and brashness all evaporating. His greatest source of pride
was in his wealth, but he suddenly realized that a single arrow from
Ning had completely crushed him in this respect. As for backers?
Given that Ning had vanished for thirty years, he at least had a True
Immortal or Empyrean God as a backer; in this respect as well, Ning
was definitely not inferior to him.

Chapter 8 - Qi, the Primordial Divine Archer
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Princess Xiyue, Fairy
Azurewillow, Feng Yungu, and the others were watching in amazement.
That arrow in Ji Ning’s hand…it was actually worth such a
precious amount of money! This was simply inconceivable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…Ning had
always been a man of mysteries.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he had first
arrived at the imperial capital of the Grand Xia, he had purchased
the elemental peacock plumes. Afterwards, he had seized the
championship of the Conclave of Immortal Destiny…and then refused
to accept Sword Immortal Evergreen as his master, instead
disappearing for over thirty years. Upon his return, his power had
increased greatly; for him to now produce an arrow of such great
value wasn’t too inconceivable, all things considered!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, this arrow was
simply too valuable; the likes of Princess Xiyue could only feel
shock and awe, rather than jealousy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn. Damn!” Young
master Yunpeng, however, felt extremely jealous right now. He was the
unhappiest of the lot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could the arrow
which Ji Ning produced be worth this much?!” Young master Yunpeng
knew that his personal strength was perhaps inferior to Ning’s, but
he had felt certain that he had far more treasures! This was his
greatest source of self-confidence…but a single arrow from Ning had
completely crushed him in this regard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young master Yunpeng
felt unhappy. Deeply unhappy!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine. Then I’ll
engage in this trade with the Heavenly Treasures Mountain,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go make the
arrangements.” The silver-haired man nodded, then immediately began
sending mental messages to make the arrangements.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly turned
his head to glance at Princess Xiyue. Smiling, he said, “Princess,
when I first entered the imperial capital of the Grand Xia, I was
surrounded by danger, but you stretched out your hand to aid me. To
this very day, I haven’t had a chance to repay you…if there’s
anything you wish to buy today, Princess, then I, Ji Ning, will buy
it for you as a gift.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Princess
Xiyue was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ning…” A
hint of anger instantly flashed past young master Yunpeng’s eyes.
He had been wooing Princess Xiyue this entire time, and had been
relying on his wealth to do so! For Ning to suddenly plan to give her
gifts as well…if his gifts were more valuable, then that would be
the same as crushing him underfoot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Feng Yungu
raised his head to give Ning a glance as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fairy Azurewillow said,
“Young master Ji Ning, Xiyue has been hoping for a mobile Immortal
estate that she could carry on her person, but even the cheapest of
such estates would cost at least five hundred thousand kilograms of
liquefied elemental essence. Alas, young master Yunpeng wasn’t
quite willing to part with such a sum.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young master Yunpeng’s
face instantly turned white.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five hundred thousand
kilograms wasn’t a small figure; it was enough to purchase an
ordinary low-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasure! If he were to
casually toss out half a million kilograms just to chase after a
girl…if this sort of gift-giving became habitual and he ended up
failing, he would probably be out five million kilograms or more!
Succeeding was one thing, but failure meant it would have all been
for nothing! Although young master Yunpeng was the son of the master
of the Windlocked Isles, he still had to calculate his expenditures.
The most valuable gift he had given Princess Xiyue was worth merely a
hundred or two hundred thousand kilograms or so; over the course of
the past half year, all of his gifts combined were worth just barely
half a million kilograms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Azurewillow.”
Princess Xiyue was rather unhappy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A mobile Immortal
estate?” Ning suddenly laughed. “I was once lucky enough to
acquire such an estate, but since I already had one, I’ve never
used the second one. It’s the perfect present for you, Princess.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
and a small, exquisitely designed Immortal estate appeared within his
palm, glowing with golden light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone present turned
to look at it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Immortal
estate…?” Everyone was curious. Even young master Yunpeng frowned
as he looked at it; none of them could quite tell how valuable it
was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After he had
successfully overcome the fifth level of the Wargod Hall, he had
acquired a set of Heaven-ranked magic treasure, the Waterbreaker
Godshark Swords. After becoming champion of the Conclave, he had
arrived at Mount Innerheart, and during his thirty-plus years there
Ning’s [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] had broken
through to the thirteenth stage. Since that represented an advance to
the Primal Daoist level, he had been permitted to choose another
Heaven-ranked magic treasure from the Treasure Hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By then, Ning already
knew that Heaven-ranked magic treasures weren’t going to be of much
use to him in the future; what he needed was Immortal-ranked
treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…Ning couldn’t
let this opportunity of choosing a treasure from the Treasure Hall to
go to waste. Thus, Ning had chosen an item that was of fairly high
value; simply put, he had chosen an item that he could use to sell
for a great deal of liquefied elemental essence. Thus, he had chosen
a mobile Immortal estate, a ‘Goldlight Immortal Estate’. Ning had
been planning to sell it here to trade for Immortal-ranked magic
treasures, but he had risen in power more quickly than even he had
expected, and had acquired the treasures left behind by that ancient
Fiendgod ccorpse. By now, this Goldlight Immortal Estate was nothing
to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s set of
Waterbreaker Godshark Swords were worth roughly one million kilograms
of liquefied elemental essence! This Goldlight Immortal Estate,
however, was on an even higher level of value!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What generosity and
magnanimity, young friend Ji Ning! Your gift to a beauty is actually
an Immortal estate such as this.” The silver-haired man laughed.
“This Immortal estate is worth at least four million kilograms of
liquefied elemental essence!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Four million
kilograms!?” Fairy Azurewillow, who had intentionally been causing
some trouble, was shocked as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That much?”
Princess Xiyue felt that this was far too much.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young master Yunpeng’s
face became even more unsightly. “Four million kilograms…how can
this Ji Ning be willing to give up an estate like this? How can he?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He hadn’t even been
willing to buy an Immortal estate that was worth half a million
kilograms, but now Ning’s very first gift was worth four million
kilograms. How could the ‘wealthy’ young master Yunpeng not feel
choked?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s too much. Too
much.” Princess Xiyue shook her head hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is nothing to
me,” Ning laughed. “And I’m preparing to stay at King Yan’s
Estate for quite some time; how can I stay for so long without
bringing a little gift?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quite some time?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young master Yunpeng
felt even more miserable now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was staying at King
Yan’s Estate. If Ning stayed here as well, they would repeatedly
run into each other. In terms of reputation…Ning surpassed him, as
he had become champion of the Conclave. In terms of background…Ning’s
backer was probably more formidable. In terms of personal
strength…given that Ning’s Primaltwin had been able to kill Loose
Immortals when it had been merely at the Primal Daoist level, there
was no need to even compare the two of them. And now in terms of
wealth…young master Yunpeng’s wealth had been his greatest source
of confidence, but even in this regard, he had been crushed in an
utterly dominating manner!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More importantly of
all…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The princess didn’t
like him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She would rather marry
Feng Yungu than marry him. Previously, young master Yunpeng had felt
that he was superior to Feng Yungu in every way, which was why he had
felt so confident when staying at King Yan’s Estate. But now…Ji
Ning had appeared! Ji Ning crushed in him every aspect, and he
appeared to be so close to the princess!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiyue,” Young
master Yunpeng suddenly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm?” Princess
Xiyue looked towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young master Yunpeng
smiled. “I’ve spent quite a bit of time here at the Grand Xia
Dynasty. It’s time to go back to the Heaven Realm. Help me convey
my thanks to King Yan; I won’t be going back to King Yan’s
Estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go!” Young
master Yunpeng immediately led his two servants away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just like that…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young master Yunpeng
departed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Princess Xiyue was
startled for a moment, and then she looked towards Ning. She sent
mentally, “Little brother, this was your plan all along, right? You
wanted to force him to leave?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s the son of
the master of the Windlocked Isles; someone like him is naturally the
proud sort. The reason why he was at King Yan’s Estate was because
he felt he was superior to Feng Yungu in every way,” Ning sent
back. “All I had to do was to make him feel as though he was
inferior to me in every single way, as though he would feel miserable
every time he saw me. Given that you don’t like him, cousin…of
course he would choose to leave on his own, rather than feel angry
all the time here!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…” Princess
Xiyue sent resignedly, “Fine. Since you’ve chased off that little
rich boy, you can put away your mobile Immortal estate. This is a
critical point in time for you; you’ll need many treasures for the
upcoming storm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cousin, I gave you
this Immortal estate, which means it is yours! A few million
kilograms is a minor sum to me now; compared to this arrow of mine,
it is worth far, far less. In addition, I’ve received an extra
fifteen million kilograms today; there’s no need for you to refuse,
cousin,” Ning sent back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Princess Xiyue looked
towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And…I really don’t
want you to force yourself to suffer. Even if you are to choose a
Dao-companion, you should choose someone you like. Don’t casually
choose someone like this Feng Yungu,” Ning sent mentally. “Don’t
let yourself suffer any further.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Princess Xiyue suddenly
felt an ache in her heart. She couldn’t prevent the tears from
coming to her eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Treasures, liquefied
elemental essence…your little brother has them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If enemies come…your
little brother will help you kill them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take this Immortal
estate, elder sister. In the future, when your little brother grows
even stronger…forget about Immortal-ranked magic treasures, I’ll
even be able to casually gift you with a set of ten Pure Yang
treasures,” Ning sent solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Princess Xiyue looked
at Ning. “Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The resurrection of the
Yuchi clan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This wasn’t just his
cousin’s wish; this was Ning’s wish as well. Although his mother
had never spoken to him of it, Ning could sense that his mother had
always been thinking of her Yuchi clan. His mother’s heart was not
with the Ji clan; it had always been with her Yuchi clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the sake of his
mother…Ning, too, wished to resurrect the Yuchi clan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, this was a task
for not just his cousin, but also himself!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiyue, look at how
excited you are. You are so excited that you are crying!” Fairy
Azurewillow laughed, “But if someone were to give me a mobile
Immortal estate, I’d be extremely excited as well. Young master Ji
Ning…” As she spoke, she looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I found a
Dao-companion long ago,” Ning said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh. I heard about
this; the Rainbowflame Fairy, Yu Wei. She’s Patriarch Lu’s
disciple.” Fairy Azurewillow suddenly turned her head as a
black-robed elder walked over, respectfully handing over a
storage-type bracelet to the silver-haired man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-haired man
handed it straight to Ning. “Young friend Ji Ning, take a look; are
these the items from the list that you needed?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White, take a
look,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Uncle White nodded. He
immediately bound the storage bracelet, then quickly began to scan
through the many precious materials within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Someone without
sufficient skill wouldn’t be able to set up such peerlessly
ferocious formations, even if they had all the necessary materials.
Even Uncle White merely understood how to set up these three supreme
formations; he didn’t truly understand the mysteries within them.
This was because they were simply far too complicated; that was why
even True Immortals or Empyrean Gods would find it hard to break
through them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everything’s
correct.” Uncle White nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby
silver-haired man instantly smiled, then handed Ning a jade bottle.
“There are fifteen million kilograms within.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then let this arrow
go to the Heavenly Treasures Mountain.” Ning handed it over to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Precisely
speaking…it goes to the Xia Emperor,” the silver-haired man said
with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled for a
moment, but then he nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Behind the Heavenly
Treasures Mountain stood the Grand Xia Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now that this deal
is concluded…young friend Ji Ning, if you acquire any other
treasures, our Heavenly Treasures Mountain will always welcome you
here to sell them. I, Skyfox, will personally come welcome you.”
Only now did the silver-haired man tell them his name.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Skyfox?” Ning was
secretly startled. “So it’s him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Xia Emperor
had two spirit-beasts who had become Celestial Immortals. One was a
skyfox, and it was this skyfox who had established the Heavenly
Treasures Mountain for the Grand Xia Emperor. He was in complete
control of the Heavenly Treasures Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the darkness of
space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A blurred figured was
seated in the lotus position. Suddenly, a silver-haired man appeared
out of nowhere within the void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, here is the
arrow which Ji Ning just traded to our Heavenly Treasures Mountain.”
The silver-haired man respectfully offered the arrow. The flaming
arrow hovered there in space, emanating ripples of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This arrow…this is
a Firetruth Arrow. It is the most famous type of arrow which was
created by Divine Archer ‘Qi’ 1 of the Primordial Era. Even I
would perish under the power of a single one of these arrows,” the
black-robed Xia Emperor said in a low voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was of the lineage
of the Primordial Imperial Clan, and had lived through that period of
time. Even in the Primordial World of Pangu, there were only a few
extremely famous divine archers. All of them had their own
specialties, and anyone could recognize their arrows at a single
glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When Pangu’s World
was shattered, the most powerful treasures were quickly seized away
by the various major powers. Since Ji Ning has acquired one of these
arrows…then he most likely has a connection to one of those major
powers; otherwise, how could he have acquired a treasure like this?!
In addition, Ji Ning didn’t apprentice himself to anyone in
Daofather Crimsonbright’s league…but Master actually ordered me
not to investigate this matter. Ji Ning must have a Daofather behind
him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Keep a close eye on
Ji Ning. The Three Realms are currently in a state of chaos; Ji Ning
can become our friend, but he absolutely must not become our enemy.”
The black-robed Xia Emperor’s voice echoed forth within the
darkness of the void.

Chapter 9 - Laying Down the Formations
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cousin, no need to
send me off.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was bidding
Princess Xiyue farewell in midair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Didn’t you say
earlier that you were going to stay at King Yan’s Estate for an
extended period of time? Why are you leaving after shopping at the
Heavenly Treasures Mountain?” Princess Xiyue truly didn’t wish to
part with him. Her grandfather, King Yan, had just recently become a
Celestial Immortal; thus, he spent much of his time in secluded
meditation, and rarely had time to accompany her. In addition, Ji
Ning was of a similar age to her; there were many topics she could
discuss with him but not her grandfather. Naturally, she wanted him
to stay longer by her side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given that the Grand
Xia world is now filled with dangerous undercurrents, I need to go
back as soon as possible and set up layers of formations around the
Ji clan’s Swallow Mountain region,” Ning said. “I will
permanently stay in the Swallow Mountain region. If you are free, you
can come visit me there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Permanently?”
Princess Xiyue was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had acquired many
techniques at Mount Innerheart, be it Ki Refining, Fiendgod Body
Refining, or sword-arts manuals. All of them provided guidance
towards the level of Daofather of the Great Firmament. He also had
the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], the [Starseizing Hand], [Houyi’s
Archery], and the [Torch Dragon’s Eye], some of the most supreme
divine abilities of the Three Realms. He needed to spend time on
training these techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given that the Three
Realms were about to be engulfed by a storm…Ning did indeed plan to
permanently live at Serpentwing Lake as he awaited Yu Wei’s return.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s good. I’ll
be able to find you there whenever I want. You need to be careful; my
grandfather also told me that the world has been quite chaotic
lately. Even multiple Celestial Immortals have perished,” Princess
Xiyue said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know. Don’t
worry. Others might be able to kill Celestial Immortals, but killing
me will be very difficult,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Princess
Xiyue revealed a look of surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “Don’t
forget that I just returned after studying with my master. Alright,
enough talk; I need to go now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, Ning led
Little Qing and Uncle White in using a spatial teleportation to
vanish from the air above the imperial capital of the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This little brother
of mine…it seems as though these thirty-plus years have been
extraordinary for him.” Princess Xiyue let out a relieved sigh. The
more powerful Ning became, the more relaxed she would be.
“However…his words were a bit too much. ‘Others might be able
to kill Celestial Immortals, but killing him will be very difficult’?
It’s like he’s implying he’s more powerful than Celestial
Immortals. I imagine that his master probably bestowed some sort of
protective item upon him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Princess Xiyue charged
downwards towards her residence, flying back into King Yan’s
Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time, Princess
Xiyue’s guess was wrong. In terms of power, Ning truly was on the
level of a Celestial Immortal Patriarch by now. Most importantly of
all, Ning had trained in the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]; it would be
extremely difficult for others to injure him. And through the
‘Seventy-Two Transformations’ the arcane art permitted…if he
transformed into the Grand Xia Emperor, even King Yan probably
wouldn’t be able to tell any difference at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was why, generally
speaking, those who trained in the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] were
incredibly talented in staying alive. Ning’s training in the arcane
art was the reason why Patriarch Subhuti had permitted Ning to depart
from his tutelage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, Ji Ning
suddenly left Stillwater City and headed towards the imperial
capital.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The imperial capital
remains the most dangerous place in the Grand Xia world for us.
That’s not the place for the assassination. Continue to watch over
him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swallow Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After using a spatial
teleport to return here from the imperial capital of the Grand Xia,
Ning immediately summoned the high-level Ji clansmen. The latest
generation of Wanxiang Adepts and Zifu Disciples were all clustered
together in one hall, including the likes of Ji Mo and the others who
had been provided guidance by Ning. Now that the clan had a stable
footing, all of their talents received good resources for
cultivation; their situation was far better than the situation had
been in the past for Ji Ninefire, Ji Truekeep, and the others. Thus
Ji Mo, for example, had already become a Wanxiang Adept.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only upon being
summoned here did they learn that Ji Ning had returned! All of them
were utterly overcome with joy. The younger generation of Ji clansmen
had long ago begun to idolize Ning; after all, becoming the champion
of the Conclave was something out of legends! That was an event where
the geniuses of the entire world came together in a competition!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I agree! Of course I
agree. Stillwater Commandery is in a chaotic state right now; if
Uncle Ji Ning plans to set down layers of mighty formations around
Swallow Mountain, then that means that our Ji clan shall have a
foundation that will flourish for countless generations!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. With these
grand formations, we will no longer need to fear the Youngflame
clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I agree.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I agree as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not a single Ji
clansmen was in opposition. Ning’s words were like music to their
ears! Ning had told them that once the formations were established,
even Celestial Immortal Patriarchs could forget about barging through
them. Only individuals who surpassed the power of Celestial Immortals
had a chance of making it through!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that in the entire world of the Grand Xia…even for the likes of
ancient clans that had existed since the Fiendgod Era, such as the
Northmont clan of Stillwater or the Youngflame clan, Celestial
Immortals represented the height of their power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With these grand
formations protecting it, Swallow Mountain would become an absolutely
secure location; the Ji clan could safely and stably flourish within
this place!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A truly powerful clan
had to have an extremely safe base. Some of them even hid their
headquarters within unknown minor worlds! Naturally, the Ji clan
wished for such a secure base as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And Ning wasn’t lying
when he had told them these things!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three supremely
ferocious formations also included a ‘sealing’ component; this
sort of grand sealing formation couldn’t be broken through
technique, they had to be destroyed through raw force! Unless one had
the power of a True Immortal or Empyrean God, there was no way
whatsoever to break through.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A snowy white hound was
standing in the sky. Behind him, a series of glistening, gem-like
rocks appeared out of nowhere. There were a total of 108 such rocks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The snowy white hound
stared far away, towards the peak of a mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Swish! Swish! Swish! Instantly, the stones hovering around him shot
out like meteors, piercing deep into various parts of the mountain.
Immediately afterwards…the mountain peak itself vanished, and
circles of blurry light began to manifest around the mountain peak
with the appearance of clouds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The final
formation-base of the ‘Eighteen Hypnotic Illusions’ has been
established.” The snowy white hound let out a relieved sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he activated the
formation, every part of the Swallow Mountain region, including the
mountain peaks, the rivers, the lakes, and the wildernesses all began
to summon the elemental power of heaven and earth. At the same time,
the various formation-bases began to resonate with each other,
joining together into an enormous combination formation. Every single
part of the formation came together in a marvelous, perfect manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the entire
hundred thousand kilometer region of Swallow Mountain seemed to have
been transformed into a truly hypnotic, illusory area. Unless one had
a talisman issued by the Ji clan, anyone who entered would
immediately become forever lost within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing Lake.
Ordinary mosquitoes were flying about, and some would often fly into
Brightheart Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In wild areas,
mosquitoes were extremely common. However, these were very ordinary
mosquitoes; they couldn’t even be considered monsters. Even Ning’s
divine sense could find nothing strange about them at all.
However…the core of this ‘Eighteen Hypnotic Illusions’
formation was Serpentwing Lake. After the formation was activated,
although its core location of Serpentwing Lake appeared as ordinary
as usual…there was now no way at all for these ordinary mosquitoes
to fly towards Brightheart Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An ordinary commandery
city of the Grand Xia. Within an estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A skinny man whose eyes
glowed with green light suddenly appeared within the courtyard. In
the courtyard, there was a black-robed man who was leisurely sipping
tea. The man had long, unbound black hair, and in his forehead there
was a vertical slit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master,” the
skinny man said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm?” The
long-haired, black-robed man looked over. “What is it??”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The entire Swallow
Mountain region has become covered by a strange illusory formation.
Even my little ones are completely unable to penetrate it; they have
become completely lost within it, and they aren’t even able to
return.” A hint of resentment was in the green, glowing eyes of the
skinny man. Those mosquitoes were indeed extremely ordinary, but they
were linked to his mind; this was no easy task!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The
long-haired, black-robed man frowned. “An illusory formation? It
seems as though Ji Ning has returned to Swallow Mountain to set down
formations for it. It is fine; since the Ji clan wishes to establish
Swallow Mountain as their foundation for flourishment, they will
naturally need to maintain contact with the outside world. That means
merchant caravans will be sent to and from it, and the Ji clan will
guide them through the formations, ensuring them that they won’t be
lost. You no longer have to worry about this matter any further; I
will arrange for others to go keep a watch on things. Rest and build
up your strength; I imagine that you won’t be able to recover your
‘little ones’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all, even if
someone else was sent into Swallow Mountain, they wouldn’t be able
to recognize which of the mosquitoes were ‘special’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright,” the
skinny man assented in a low voice, and then he departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The long-haired,
black-robed man quickly began to give instructions a different
subordinate. This seemingly ordinary commandery city of the Grand Xia
was, in reality, one of the important bases for Bloodcloud Hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bloodcloud Hall used
all sorts of tools to investigate. Mosquitoes, merchant caravans,
scrying arts…even possession arts! They began to use every method
they had to infiltrate Swallow Mountain!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But as each of the
great formations of the Whitewater Hound began to be erected,
especially in the Serpentwing Lake region, it became rare for even
the Ji clansmen to encounter Ji Ning. Only Ji Truekeep, Granny
Shadow, and a few others could go directly to see him. Even the likes
of Ji Mo and the others had to first request a meeting. Thus, it
became extremely hard for even Bloodcloud Hall to determine whether
or not Ji Ning was actually staying at Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The same ordinary
commandery city as before. A white-haired elder said in a lowered
voice, “Swallow Mountain is now surrounded by layers of grand
formations. One of my clones was accompanying a merchant caravan in
investigating the place, and the number of formations that I’ve
already uncovered is enough to cause even Celestial Immortals to
become lost after entering it. One has to use a Greater Teleportation
Dao-seal to flee the place. Now, it seems, Swallow Mountain is
completely under Ji Ning’s control. Within this region, Ning can
use the formations to his advantage; killing him there is extremely
unlikely. Just investigating the various formations, especially the
dangerous ones, is essentially suicide. I imagine a large number of
Loose Immortals would have to die in the process.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
long-haired, black-robed man nodded. “Since even you feel this way,
Elder Chu, then it seems Swallow Mountain truly is not an appropriate
place for assassination. Then…let us wait. Wait for Ji Ning to
leave Swallow Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The very same day in
which Elder Chu was making a report to Bloodcloud Hall. The skies
above Brightheart Island was filled with plumes of snow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After tirelessly
working day and night for forty-nine days, I’ve finally set up the
first of the three supremely lethal formations.” The white-robed
Uncle White let out a laugh, but his gaze was filled with exhaustion.
“I really didn’t dare to be slightest bit careless. If I was even
slightly careless, everything would’ve gone wrong, and most likely
some of those ingredients would’ve been imploded and destroyed by
elemental energy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sorry for the
trouble, Uncle White.” Ning had an understanding of formations as
well; he knew very well that even being able to merely set up these
three supreme formations required one to have the ability of a
grandmaster of formations. This was because even Ning felt his head
grow dizzy when he simply looked at the arcane mysteries contained
within the formations, to say nothing of actually laying them down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It wasn’t so bad.
I’ve already set up one of the three supreme formations; the entire
Swallow Mountain region is already stabilized. I can take it a bit
slower for the other two,” Uncle White said with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As they were chatting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” A voice
rang out from far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately arose
and turned around; it was the voice of the clan leader, Ji Truekeep.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, Immortal
Fivecraze of the Black-White College has arrived.” Truekeep walked
over, Immortal Fivecraze by his side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother
Fivecraze.” Ning immediately went forward to welcome him. Because
he was now a Void-level Earth Immortal, according to the rules of the
Black-White College, the two of them had to refer to each other as
they would equals of the same generation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, your master
has left his secluded meditation. He is preparing to undergo his
Celestial Tribulation in nine days!” Immortal Fivecraze said
solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nine days?!” Ning
was instantly stunned.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_10___The_Celestial_Tribu"></A>
Chapter 10 - The Celestial Tribulation
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is your
master’s own decision,” Immortal Fivecraze said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning immediately
understood. The Celestial Tribulation was the most important event a
cultivator would encounter in his life; generally speaking, they
would choose to attempt it at a time whispered to them by their
subconscious. Since his master had chosen to attempt it nine days
hence, then that meant that his master would have the greatest chance
of success nine days from now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But even though that
would be the ‘greatest chance’…the chance was still
comparatively slim. After all, the Grand Xia world had countless
Void-level Earth Immortals, but often more than a million years would
pass without a single Celestial immortal arising! Only in a time like
this, when the Three Realms were in a state of upheaval, did the
Grand Xia see multiple Earth Immortals overcome the tribulation
during the past twenty, thirty years. But even then, only a few had
succeeded. Spread out across 3600 commanderies and four seas…the
chances were still extremely low!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very few people know
that your master is attempting the Celestial Tribulation nine days
from now. You can’t tell anyone,” Immortal Fivecraze instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand.”
Ning looked at the nearby Ji Truekeep. Truekeep nodded. “Don’t
worry; I won’t tell anyone. Right…the two of you can chat in
private.” Truekeep knew exactly how major a matter this was, and so
he immediately departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the hall, only
Ji Ning, Immortal Fivecraze, and the Whitewater Hound were left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your master is going
to attempt the Celestial Tribulation, but his chances are less than
one in ten thousand. The tribulation is simply too hard. Thus…we
need to ensure that no one disturbs him,” Immortal Fivecraze said
seriously. “That is why your master will definitely need protectors
during his tribulation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Protectors?” Ning
nodded. “I will naturally serve as a guardian for my master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I discussed this
matter with your master already. This time, the only people
protecting him shall be you and me; just the two of us,” Immortal
Fivecraze said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two?” Ning was
surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your master has
gained new insights after perusing the Dao-repositories you brought
back to the Black-White College. His power has advanced exquisitely!”
Immortal Fivecraze said. “I have gained insights as well, and my
power is comparable to a Loose Immortal who has lived for six or
seven hundred thousand years. The other Loose Immortals of the
Black-White College, by comparison, are a bit weaker.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Primaltwin was
able to kill Loose Immortals all those years ago, when it was merely
a peak Primal Daoist. Given your training speed, I imagine it must
now be at the late Void-level; after thirty years, you are probably
no weaker than me,” Immortal Fivecraze said with a laugh. “There’s
no need to be modest at a time like this; the more powerful you are,
the more confident your master will feel during his tribulation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “I
should…be no weaker than Immortal Northwalker was in the past!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Fivecraze was
instantly startled. It must be understood that the Immortal path grew
increasingly difficult as one progressed through it, and that the
chances of becoming a Celestial Immortal were extremely low. The
chances of becoming a True Immortal or Empyrean God? That was even
rare, even if one’s vision spanned the entirety of the Three
Realms. Every single commandery had Loose Immortals at the five
hundred thousand year power level, but there were very few in the
entire Grand Xia Dynasty who were at the level of a million year old
Loose Immortal. As for Loose Immortals who had lived for millions of
years…it was rare for the entire Grand Xia Dynasty to have a single
such person!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You?” Immortal
Fivecraze could hardly believe it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My child Ning has
long ago mastered the full nine stances of the [Three-Foot Sword].
He’s even improved on it,” the nearby Whitewater Hound said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent!” A look
of wild joy appeared on Immortal Fivecraze’s face. He said
jubilantly, “Wonderful, wonderful, absolutely wonderful! Ji Ning,
in terms of sword-arts alone, you are probably the most powerful
figure our Black-White College has ever seen!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Fivecraze
sighed in absolute amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This Ji Ning who stood
before him…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He himself was like a
sword! Swords were objects that were used to charge forward, to cut
with incomparable sharpness! Ji Ning was like a sword who chopped
through all the bushes and thorns that lay in his path. Years ago, as
a youth, he had become the champion of the entire Conclave of
Immortal Destiny! After the past thirty-plus years…he had mastered
and even perfected the [Three-Foot Sword] of Immortal Northwalker,
customizing it for his own use!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What sort of talent was
this? After a few more decades or a century, how powerful would he
become?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The sword is my
body.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The sword is my
life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The sword is my
path.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Fivecraze
nodded as he looked at Ning. “When every Sword Immortal embarks on
the Dao of the Sword, they will understand their own sword-hearts and
these principles. But understanding is easy; action is hard! There
are very, very few who can truly reach this level, and in this vast
world, countless Sword Immortals have fallen. I can sense, however,
the towering sword-intent radiating from you, a sword-heart that is
simply inconceivable. You truly were born to be a Sword Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, many years
ago, the likes of Lu Dongbin had already felt certain that Ning was
born to be a peerless Sword Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason for his
current success was partially because of his experiences from his
past life, but also because of his parents in this life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His father had given
him a sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His mother had given
him a heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After chatting for a
short while, Ning asked, “Is master in a rush? If he isn’t in a
rush, I’ll stay one more day here at Serpentwing Lake; I’ll
reunite with all of you at the Black-White College tomorrow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are planning to
leave the Black-White College in three days and head to the chosen
tribulation area,” Immortal Fivecraze said. “We have a day to
spare. You can make your preparations here at Serpentwing Lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What will be the
tribulation area?” Ning couldn’t help but ask.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That is a secret for
now,” Immortal Fivecraze said. “Once your master’s enemies
learn of it, they will immediately head to that location to attempt
to ruin your master’s tribulation. Thus, the tribulation area is
something which only your master knows at present. Even I don’t
know. After we head arrive there, we shall know.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “That’s
for the best. If only master himself knows, there’s no fear of it
leaking.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. Make your
preparations; I’m leaving now.” Immortal Fivecraze left right
away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, Little Qing was
called back by Ji Ning. Within the courtyard was Ji Ning, Uncle
White, and Little Qing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master is about to
undergo his Celestial Tribulation. This matter is extremely
important; we can’t be reckless in preparing for it,” Ning said
with absolute solemnity. “That’s why both I and Uncle White are
leaving…and we’ll leave Swallow Mountain in your hands, Little
Qing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The formations of
Swallow Mountain were too numerous and too complicated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even those lower-class
formations required experts who were at least at the Primal Daoist
level to completely control them. But right now, aside from Ning, the
most powerful members of the Ji clan were only at the Wanxiang stage!
As for the supreme formations…just activating them would require
the power of a Void-level Earth Immortal, but there was no way Ning
would teach the secrets of these formations to the monsters of the
Witchriver Immortal Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Actually, I really
want to go as well. The Celestial Tribulation…I’ve never even…”
Little Qing stopped midway through her words as Ning gave her a look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, I know what
really matters,” Little Qing hurriedly said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White, Little
Qing…both of you, hurry up and raise your power to the late
Void-level today,” Ning said. “These two jade bottles each
contain 2.5 million kilograms of liquefied elemental essence.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning trained in the
[Darknorth Sutra], which allowed one to train all the way to the
Daofather level, and yet his Primaltwin had only needed 2.5 million
kilograms to go from the peak Primal stage to the late Void-level.
Uncle White and Little Qing had both already reached the early
Void-level; 2.5 million kilograms of liquefied elemental essence
would be more than enough to let them reach the late Void-level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember, don’t
train to the peak of the Void-level, no matter what,” Ning warned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. We
aren’t anywhere close to being prepared for the Celestial
Tribulation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While Uncle White and
Little Qing trained, Ning’s true body entered the Still Room of the
underwater estate. For the sake of his master’s tribulation, Ning
was going to raise his power to the highest level possible as well!
Fortunately, he had acquired 15 million kilograms at the main
headquarters of the Heavenly Treasures Mountain; although he had
spent some of it to purchase a few treasures, he still had more than
ten million kilograms left!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The handsome,
delicate-looking fur-clad youth seated himself atop the netherwater
jade bed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In front of him was a
tiny jade bottle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Begin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A torrent of liquefied
elemental essence flooded out from the jade bottle, forming an
awe-inspiring lake within the Still Room. Around Ning, a dark vortex
appeared, and the limitless amount of essence began to disappear as
it drew near the dark vortex, having been sucked into Ning’s Zifu
Region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Zifu Region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His golden lotus, after
absorbing an enormous amount of essence, began to shudder and grow
out from within that scorching sea of Primal Fire. The golden lotus
was constantly growing taller, and both its petals and its stem began
to quickly increase in thickness. The elemental ki within the golden
lotus grew increasingly pure as well, so pure that it would cause
one’s heart to tremble. At the same time, that adorable little
lotus seedpod at the very top of the golden lotus began to slowly
increase in size, and within the heart of the lotus seedpod, an
unripe lotus seed took form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The late Void
level!” Everything came to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The now-enormous golden
lotus swayed within the Primal Fire that blazed atop the back of the
continent-sized Turtle-Snake. This golden lotus was now the absolute
most dazzling ‘location’ within the entire Zifu region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon reaching the late
Void level, the ‘Goldlotus Primal’ was already extremely
powerful; it was just a hair away from complete perfection.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The next day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Uncle White, and
Little Qing gathered together for a meal. They had all increased in
power to the late Void-level the previous night. After the meal,
Little Qing was left behind to protect Serpentwing Lake, while Ning
led Uncle White towards the Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Black-White
College. Immortal Diancai’s abode.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you came.”
The black-robed Immortal Diancai was seated in the lotus position
atop a jade bed, a calm look on his face. “Sit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next to him was a
prayer mat, seated atop which was Immortal Fivecraze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, then sat
down on another prayer mat while the Whitewater Hound lay down behind
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard senior
apprentice-brother Fivecraze say that you’ve already mastered the
complete nine stances of the [Three-Foot Sword], and that you have
perfected it?” Immortal Diancai said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai
smiled. “Good. With you having reached such a level in the
sword…even if I fail my tribulation, I’ll still feel satisfied.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, how can you
say such things?” Ning said frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m just making
conversation. It seems you aren’t even as calm about this as I am,”
Immortal Diancai said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was indeed nervous;
after all, the chances of success were simply far, far too low. If
his master were to fail…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai,
seeing this, simply laughed. He understood Ning’s temperament very
well; Ning was a passionate man who cared deeply about his feelings
and his relationships! For the sake of his relationships, he could
even give up his life! It was precisely because he had come to
understand Ning’s personality over their many years of knowing each
other that Immortal Diancai felt so extremely fond of this disciple
of his. That was why he treated him with such sincerity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Whitewater
Hound is coming as well?” Immortal Diancai asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “Master,
don’t underestimate Uncle White. He is extremely talented in
formations, and when I went to study from my master, Uncle White
learned some extremely profound formations as well; he can be
described as a grandmaster of formations. I wouldn’t dare proclaim
him as being the best in the entire Grand Xia Dynasty…but here
within Stillwater Commandery at least, he would be one of the top
two.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Both Immortal
Diancai and Immortal Fivecraze revealed looks of delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anyone who dared refer
to himself as a grandmaster of formations would definitely be an
extraordinary person.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed
confidently. In terms of the Dao of Formations, Uncle White was
indeed a grandmaster. In addition, however, Uncle White knew how to
set up some extremely rare and exceedingly powerful formations, and
so even other grandmasters of formations would lose to him in a
competition of formations! That supremely ferocious formation that he
had set up around Swallow Mountain, for example; most likely, there
were extremely few people in the entire Grand Xia Dynasty who could
set up such a powerful formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, the
Grand Xia Dynasty definitely had individuals who were superior to
Uncle White in formations; for example, that formation surrounding
the imperial palace of the Grand Xia was something that only a truly
major power could set up! It was several levels higher in power than
the formations around Swallow Mountain.

Chapter 11 - Four Great Tribulations
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since you’ve
arrived, Ji Ning, that means we are all present. Let’s head out
tonight to the tribulation area, then,” Immortal Diancai said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Immortal
Fivecraze exchanged a glance, then both nodded. “Fine. We’ll head
out tonight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This tribulation had to
be kept top-secret. Ning and the others didn’t dare be even the
slightest bit careless. Even during a normal situation, one would
have to be extremely careful in attempting the Celestial Tribulation,
but given that the Three Realms were currently in a state of
chaos…Ning and the others naturally had to be even more careful
than normal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Late night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai,
Immortal Fivecraze, Ji Ning, and the Whiteweater Hound stealthily
used a spatial teleport to depart from Stillwater City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the air above an
awe-inspiringly vast sea, a spatial ripple suddenly appeared. Three
human figures accompanied by a large, snowy white hound appeared from
within the ripple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where are we?”
Ning looked at the surrounding area. Because it had been his master,
Immortal Diancai, who had used the spatial teleport, not even Ning
knew where they were exactly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The great Darknorth
Sea,” Immortal Diancai said. “The location that I’ve chosen for
my tribulation is a minor world which I discovered by accident when I
was adventuring through the Darknorth Sea as a child. This minor
world was extremely well-hidden, and it is extremely well-suited for
attempting the tribulation. Follow me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clouds instantly
appeared around them as Immortal Diancai used a technique to lead
Ning, Immortal Fivecraze, and the Whitewater Hound in quickly flying
forward. Soon, an island appeared in the distance. The island was
scorchingly hot, as there was a live volcano atop it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The entrance to that
minor world is within the volcano on that island.” Immortal Diancai
led the group to fly into the air above the island, then charged
straight into the mouth of the volcano.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The region within the
volcano was extremely strange. A large amount of lava was bubbling
and frothing about.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai
quietly glanced at one corner of it, a complicated look in his eyes.
He said softly, “In my youth, I was young and arrogant; I roamed
the world in a fearless, untamed manner. And now, I am about to
attempt my tribulation…life truly is a marvelous, strange thing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Immortal
Fivecraze could both sense that Immortal Diancai’s mood seemed
rather off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For this
tribulation…if I fail, I shall die!” Immortal Diancai said
softly. “If I die…then I’ll reunite with you, junior
apprentice-sister.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within his memory…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a young,
carefree, brilliant genius youth; Immortal Diancai, the number one
peerless genius of his generation within the Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With him was a
reincarnated Immortal maiden who was known as Fairy Drizzlerain, and
who had countless admirers and pursuers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They adventured
together, shoulder-to-shoulder, expericing life-and-death events
together. They had roamed through countless places, entering mountain
ranges and passing through seas. And then, one day, they had
encountered an ancient Primal-level Fiendgod of fire. The ancient
Fiendgod had emerged from within the lava…and their parting on that
day truly became an eternal one. The flames of the Fiendgod caused
his junior apprentice-sister’s soul to be shattered…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Ning was
shocked. His master was actually planning to die if he failed?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that the Celestial Tribulation was extremely dangerous; even the
Goldlotus Primal would be heavily wounded. Some would realize halfway
through the tribulation that they wouldn’t be able to succeed, and
so they would give up, choosing to become a Loose Immortal. Because
the amount of damage sustained by each person’s Goldlotus Primal
was different, the purity of the elemental ki would vary amongst
Loose Immortals. Formidable ones were comparable to peak Void-level
Earth Immortals, while weaker ones might only have elemental ki
comparable to early-stage Void-level Earth Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some Earth Immortals,
however, would go welcome the tribulation with the intent of rather
dying to it than giving up!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This did indeed give
someone a significantly higher chance of overcoming the Celestial
Tribulation. But at the very end, if they failed…then their souls
would be shattered!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You still haven’t
forgotten.” Immortal Fivecraze shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forget? Why should I
forget? How could I bear to forget?” Immortal Diancai replied
softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said, “Master,
leave yourself a sliver of a chance, so that you can have a chance at
reincarnation. If you fail in this life, you might succeed in the
next one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to try and
dissuade me.” Immortal Diancai shook his head. “My decision is
made. Let’s go. Let’s go inside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lava below them
suddenly parted as Immortal Diancai led them deeper downwards. At the
very deepest part, a winding tunnel suddenly appeared. Immortal
Diancai led them through the tunnel in an extremely familiar manner,
and a dark cave soon appeared before them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go in.” Immortal
Diancai led Ji Ning and the others to fly into the black cave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a world that
was filled with an infinite aura of death. Even the mountains had
turned black, while the earth itself was a sickly yellow. Not a
single hint of green could be seen, and no ordinary grass lived here.
This world only had a strange type of vegetation that was pitch-black
and covered by spikes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The side of a large
mountain began to ripple and shake. Immortal Diancai, Immortal
Fivecraze, Ji Ning, and the Whitewater Hound flew out from within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such a strong aura
of death?” Immortal Fivecraze frowned as he stared at the
surrounding area. “What happened to this minor world? Logically
speaking, even if it suffered some sort of disaster, given the power
of the Solar Star and the Lunar Star, it should have eventually
recovered.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This was a world
where a Fiendgod of fire hid within,” Immortal Diancai said. “The
Fiendgod caused this minor world to become completely filled with
lava, causing all the living creatures within it to perish. Although
that Fiendgod is now dead, for this minor world to recover…a very
long period of time will be needed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was easy to ruin a
minor world, but in order for it to recover, a million years would be
needed or perhaps even longer. Only then would new vegetation arise
and new creatures and birds be born.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This minor world is
extremely well-hidden, and it has no living creatures; I don’t have
to worry about any ordinary life-forms being killed as collateral
damage. It is very well-suited for my tribulation attempt,”
Immortal Diancai said. “In a normal situation…chances of being
discovered while undergoing a tribulation in such a well-hidden place
should be very low. However, now that the entire Grand Xia world is
in a state of chaos…I’ve heard that quite a few Void-level Earth
Immortals have suffered attacks during their tribulations of late.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. All
Void-level Earth Immortals choose extremely well-hidden places for
their tribulations…but they were still discovered and assaulted,”
Immortal Fivecraze agreed somberly. “We have to be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
Master. Leave everything to me and big brother Fivecraze,” Ning
promised solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Immortal
Diancai nodded, then began to fly far away. Ji Ning, Immortal
Fivecraze, and Uncle White hurriedly flew after him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After flying for a
period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai
descended upon a wide area that had been completely scorched black.
He then sat down in the lotus position…and began to wait quietly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After eight days,
the Celestial Tribulation shall descend. Everything will be up to
your master, then.” Immortal Fivecraze was worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He will have to rely
on himself.” Ning was worried, too.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the Celestial
Tribulation descended, all outside sources of help were forbidden.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even Daofathers of the
Great Firmament wouldn’t dare to intervene and assist others in
their tribulations. If anyone tried to help someone else defeat a
Celestial Tribulation…then the tribulation would instantly unleash
a divine punishment upon the offender, even if the offender was a
Daofather. If the Daofather immediately stopped, that was one thing,
but if he tried to continue and resist…even the Daofather would be
annihilated by the divine punishment!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, from ancient days
till now, no one ever dared to help someone else resist a Celestial
Tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even setting up
formations was considered ‘outside help’. If Immortal Diancai
himself had been the one to set up the formations, that wouldn’t be
as much of an issue! At most, the formation would be destroyed and
the power of the Celestial Tribulation would be increased. But if
someone else, such as Uncle White or Ji Ning, was in control of the
formation…then the two of them would suffer divine punishment!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the reason why
Ning hadn’t invited his master to go to Swallow Mountain for the
tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were far too many
places in the world with extremely formidable formations. The
headquarters of powerful sects all contained exceedingly mighty
formations; for example, the formation within the imperial citadel of
the Grand Xia was something which a major power had set up. If a
Void-level Earth Immortal could temporarily borrow the strength of a
formation to fight the Celestial Tribulation, then overcoming it
would become far too simple!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All sources of outside
help were completely forbidden! The Celestial Tribulation was the
test which all Immortal cultivators faced on their Immortal path!
Even experts in the Dao of Formations such as Uncle White would only
be permitted to use magic treasure formations, such as the Fuxi Staff
Formation. When the Celestial Tribulation truly descended, they would
be allowed to use the Fuxi Staff Formation to defend against it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Heavenraker] and
the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] were all considered types of
sword-formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, formations
that were locked onto one location and which were set up using
precious ingredients were considered outside sources of help!
[Heavenraker], the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], and the Fuxi
Staff Formation, however, were all considered part of one’s own
strength.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Ning
suddenly walked over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes?” Immortal
Diancai raised his head to look towards Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, I have five
top-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords. If you use them, your
chances of overcoming the Celestial Tribulation shall be greater.”
Ning willed it, and five pitch-black Immortal swords suddenly
appeared out of nowhere to hover next to him. These were the
Heavenraker Immortal swords. Ning had already dispersed his elemental
ki from within them; they had become ownerless items now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai was
stunned. “Five top-grade Immortal ranked swords?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Top-grade
Immortal-ranked…and five of them?” Immortal Fivecraze revealed a
look of crazed joy as well. “Wonderful! Ji Ning, you truly have
been hiding some incredible secrets.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Items at the level of a
top-grade Immortal-ranked flying sword could no longer simply be
purchased; they had to be traded for! Five such swords, and all from
the same source…they were far more valuable than the combined value
of all of the Immortal swords Ning had acquired from killing the
monster kings and that vile Patriarch. These were items from the
underwater estate’s Treasure Hall; they were naturally exceptional!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take them,”
Immortal Fivecraze said with a chortle. “Your disciple is telling
you to use them; are you going to be wishy-washy about it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Immortal
Diancai’s aura instantly changed. “With these five top-grade
Immortal-ranked flying swords, my chances of overcoming the Celestial
Tribulation shall be much greater…at least for the first three
tribulations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial
Tribulation was divided into a total of four great tribulations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were the wind
tribulation, the fire tribulation, the thunder tribulation, and the
demonheart tribulation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first three could
be blocked, but they would grow increasingly powerful and terrifying;
the vast majority of Void-level Earth Immortals would perish over the
course of the first three tribulations. The thunder tribulation in
particular…bolts of divine lightning would crash down, completely
disintegrating the bodies of many Void-level Earth Immortals. The
Goldlotus Primal would be heavily injured by the slamming
thunderbolts, and many were so terrified that they would give up and
flee, becoming Loose Immortals. In the past, Immortal Juhua had also
failed during the thunder tribulation…and it was because he didn’t
have any good Immortal-ranked magic treasures!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he had top-grade
Immortal-ranked magic treasures, given Immortal Juhua’s power and
Dao-heart, he might’ve become a Celestial Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Your chances
are now much greater…but you still need to be careful. The
Celestial Tribulation…magic treasures are only one part of your
power. When iron is being forged, it has to rely on its own innate
hardness. The Celestial Tribulation primarily tests one’s personal
power,” Immortal Fivecraze said seriously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand.”
Immortal Diancai nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even many disciples of
True Immortals or Empyrean Gods would fail during their tribulation.
Generally speaking, disciples of True Immortals or Empyrean Gods all
had top-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasures, and yet many still
failed. Clearly, the Celestial Tribulation was different for each
person! The more monstrously talented someone was, the more powerful
one was, the more ridiculously terrifying the Celestial Tribulation
would be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One day after another
went by
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai
familiarized himself with the Heavenraker swords, then began to wait
quietly. Ji Ning, Immortal Fivecraze, and the Whitewater Hound also
quietly stood to one side, standing guard for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And finally…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a gentle wind
began to blow, rustling Immortal Diancai’s Daoist robes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai opened
his eyes. “Senior apprentice-brother Fivecraze, Ji Ning, brother
White…stand guard for me. My Celestial Tribulation has begun.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
could sense that the nearby wind was beginning to slowly grow
increasingly fierce. They couldn’t help but nervously look towards
the seated Immortal Diancai.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 12 - Celestial Immortal Body
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wild wind that had
suddenly arose in this world of death came from every direction. All
the winds surged towards Immortal Diancai’s direction, and Ji Ning,
Immortal Fivecraze, and the Whitewater Hound could all sense how
powerful this wind was. However, they were able to resist it by using
just a bit of elemental ki.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The closer the wind
moved towards Immortal Diancai, the more powerful it became. The wind
gathered from all corners of the world, slowly merging into an azure
windblade. By the time this azure windblade actually flew towards
Immortal Diancai, it had turned such a deep azure color that it could
almost be described as a black windblade.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just staring at it
caused Ning and the others to feel shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Open.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed
Immortal Diancai stood there, the five Heavenraker Immortal swords
floating around him, swiveling. It was as though five rainbows were
swirling around him. Although the terrifyingly powerful black
windblades chopped repeatedly towards him, all the strikes were
blocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Diancai’s sword-arts have already risen to such
a level?” Immortal Fivecraze revealed a look of delight. “Ji
Ning, I had an idea as to what level your master’s sword-arts had
reached…but he is even more powerful than I had expected! Long ago,
I came to the conclusion that junior apprentice-brother Diancai had
the highest chance amongst us of becoming a Celestial Immortal, and
back then his sword-arts were already at an astonishing level. After
adventuring for forty years, and after receiving your Dao-repository,
his sword-arts…they are not one whit inferior to Immortal
Northwalker’s. He truly does have a chance to become a Celestial
Immortal!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning was
filled with eagerness as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everything else aside,
the ‘Five Elements Sword-Intent’ which his master had just
displayed was enough to let Ning know that his master’s sword-arts
were most likely on a level comparable to his own. His master truly
lived up to his reputation as the peerless genius of the Black-White
College with the highest chances of becoming a Celestial Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The savage black
windblades hammered repeatedly against the five rainbows of light,
causing even the surrounding space to crack and fracture.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the black
windblades suddenly vanished. The world actually turned completely
calm and tranquil again…but then yet another series of winds began
to appear. The winds stabbed like sharp needles…and a series of
needle-like spikes began to appear in midair. The thousands of spikes
all gleamed with golden light as they stabbed towards the five
Immortal swords which were in the form of five rainbows of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Savage. Insidious.
Soft. Icy. Blazing…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All sorts of wind came
in an unending flow. In fact, a total of twelve types of skywind
appeared as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, the
surrounding area once more turned calm. For a long period of time, no
further gusts of wind appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
Immortal Fivecraze was startled. “The final part of the wind
tribulation has begun.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was nervous and
restless as well. He looked anxiously towards his master, standing
there in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial
Tribulation consisted of four great tribulations; the wind
tribulation, the fire tribulation, the thunder tribulation, and the
demonheart tribulation. The wind tribulation…it first consisted of
ordinary wind, then types of skywind of different power, and then
finally the most terrifying of all, the Celestial Immortal Wind. This
Celestial Immortal Wind was invisible and formless; it was hard to
locate within the Three Realms, and would only appear during the
Celestial Tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No magic treasures were
capable of blocking the Celestial Immortal Wind; it would form
directly in front of the tribulant’s body, then surge in through
the head. Nothing, not even Daoist robes, would be able to block the
penetrating power of this wind in the slightest!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After surging in
through the head, it would naturally disperse and tear through the
vital organs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What it tested was a
person’s Dao-heart. If one’s Dao-heart was weak, then once the
Celestial Immortal Wind surged in through the head, their body would
most likely instantly melt and transform into dust, allowing only the
Goldlotus Primal to survive and flee. More than 99% of Void-level
Earth Immortals would be defeated by the Celestial Immortal Wind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one’s Dao-heart
was strong and stable enough, then the trial of the Celestial
Immortal Wind would actually be a transformatative baptism, allowing
the tribulant to slowly begin to develop a Celestial Immortal Body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, you have to
hold on,” Ning said, extremely worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hold on.” Immortal
Fivecraze stared at him as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai stood
there by himself, surrounded by those five pitch-black Immortal
swords. He opened his eyes, revealing a smile as he looked towards
Ning and Immortal Fivecraze. “The wind tribulation is over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Immortal
Fivecraze laughed loudly, “I just knew that your Dao-heart had to
be strong, junior apprentice-brother! The wind tribulation was unable
to do anything to you at all. Hurry up and replenish your elemental
ki and prepare for the next tribulation, the fire tribulation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a sigh of
relief as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At least the first
tribulation had been overcome.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, given the
Dao-heart which his master normally displayed, Ning should have felt
quite confident in him. However, right before they entered this minor
world, his master’s emotions had been disturbed, and he had even
spoken of reuniting with his deceased junior apprentice-sister. Ning
had been very worried about the effects of this former relationship
on his master’s heart. Once one’s Dao-heart became even slightly
unstable, then one’s body would quickly be transformed into dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial
Tribulation was truly dangerous. One couldn’t make a single error
in it; a single error would represent a complete failure!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Immortal
Fivecraze, and Uncle White kept their divine senses spread as they
stood vigilant guard for Immortal Diancai, whom they continued to
watch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughly an hour after
the wind tribulation ended.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumbling red clouds
suddenly appeared out of nowhere in the skies; it was as though a
cloud created from an enormous ball of flames had appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fire tribulation
has arrived.” Ning and Immortal Fivecraze both watched nervously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fire tribulation
wasn’t as insidious as the wind tribulation, but it was even more
savage and ferocious! The power of those flames…if a Void-level
Earth Immortal slipped for a single instant, then his body would
instantly be charred into ash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fiery clouds in the
skies slowly descended. Instantly, the temperature of the surrounding
area began to rise, and the air itself seemed to glow with a blurry
red light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crackle crackle
crackle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ground itself began
to turn soft. It began to transform into lava and began to bubble and
froth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai began
to levitate into the air. “Go!” Immortal Diancai pointed with his
finger, and one of the five Heavenraker swords actually flew out,
transforming into a giant serpent of fire that flew through the
skies, stabbing straight towards the enormous fiery cloud, slashing
through it and causing it to grow chaotic and disordered. However,
the Heavenraker sword was quickly knocked flying backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the fiery
cloud began to drop at an even faster pace. Soon, it completely
enveloped Immortal Diancai within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hiss hiss hiss…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The temperature had
risen to a terrifying level, and even the lava within the region had
been completely incinerated and transformed into nothingness. Even
the stones in the distant region where Ning and the others were
watching had been transformed into lava. From this, one could tell
how terrifying the temperature was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…whoosh…crackle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Streaks of skyfire
could vaguely be seen blazing from within the fiery cloud. There was
golden skyfire, black skyfire, green skyfire, and even skyfire that
seemed to flash like the stars…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The various types of
skyfire have descended.” Ning and Immortal Fivecraze both watched
nervously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire fiery cloud
began to converge and coalesce around a single central point.
Suddenly, a human-shaped figure appeared from within it, protected by
five Immortal swords. The fiery cloud had transformed into a blazing
light that was completely insubstantial. The light passed through the
blocking Immortal swords, flying straight into the human-shaped
figure’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a moment, the
entire world turned silent. The surrounding temperature began to drop
at a rapid pace. Immortal Diancai, however, emanated a fiery light as
he hovered there in the skies. Ning stared at his master; his master
was emanating so much fiery light, he seemed to be made out of flames
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The final type of
fire within the fire tribulation…the Celestial Immortal Fire,”
Immortal Fivecraze said worriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Celestial Immortal
Body had to be tempered by wind, fire, and lightning. Only afterwards
could the Celestial Immortal Body be forged. Then, after undergoing
the trial of the demonheart tribulation, the Celestial Immortal’s
Dao-heart would be formed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only after all
tribulations were passed would one become a carefree, unbound
Celestial Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He overcame it.”
The distant Ning revealed a look of joy on his face. He saw that the
distant Immortal Diancai’s body was beginning to slowly turn a
duller color as he slowly returned to normal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai
landed. He immediately sat down in the lotus position, quietly
adjusting his energy levels and recovering his elemental ki.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fire tribulation
is over. Next comes the most dangerous tribulation, the thunder
tribulation!” Immortal Fivecraze murmured softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. The thunder
tribulation.” Ning’s heart clenched as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the four great
tribulations, the final demonheart tribulation was the strangest
tribulation. But the thunder tribulation was the most terrifying one!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thunder tribulation
was the most brutal one of all. Layers of lightning bolts would
descend, continuously rising in power. Even past figures like
Immortal Juhua and Immortal Northwalker had eventually been destroyed
by the power of the continuous, unending thunderbolts, resulting in
their Goldlotus Primals being damaged and them fleeing to become
Loose Immortals. The thunder tribulation was an absolute nightmare!
The vast majority of peerless geniuses would end up perishing in the
face of this tribulation. There were absolutely no tricks that could
be used to block the thunderbolts; each time a bolt descended, you
had to block it head-on. If you couldn’t? You’d be finished!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Simple as that!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder how many
bolts of thunder will fall.” Immortal Fivecraze was worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master has an
extremely high level in sword-arts. His talent is very high, and he
has five top-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords. I imagine there
will be quite a few,” Ning said worriedly as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thunder
tribulation…some Earth Immortals might only encounter nine bolts of
thunder. Others, however, might meet with eighteen, twenty-seven, or
thirty-six bolts…and according to the stories, the highest number
possible was eighty-one bolts!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of the
skythunder would be linked to many factors; in fact, it was also
linked to karmic merit. Still, generally speaking, Ki Refiners would
never suffer the legendary ‘eighty-one bolt skythunder
tribulation!’ Generally speaking, only Fiendgod Body Refiners would
encounter it while undergoing their tribulation. Many monstrously
powerful Void-level Fiendgod Body Refiners would be hammered to death
by the consecutive lightning bolts!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew very well
that although he had already trained in the third stage of the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art], if he were to encounter the eighty-one bolts
of lightning, he would definitely be crushed into nothingness by the
power of those bolts!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope he has less
than 36 bolts,” Immortal Fivecraze whispered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded gently as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ki Refiners were
innately weaker than Fiendgod Body Refiners when it came to
withstanding skythunder. Generally speaking, it would be very hard
for them to succeed if there were more than 36 bolts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another hour passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two enormous
stormclouds suddenly appeared out of nowhere from within the calm
skies. These two stormclouds converged rapidly from different
directions, completely blotting out the sun as they drew close to
each other. Instantly, electric streaks of lightning began to crackle
between the two massive clouds. The awe-inspiring power from within
them caused Ning, Immortal Fivecraze, and the Whitewater Hound to all
feel trepidation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly, the two massive
stormclouds began to merge, and as they combined to form a single
supermassive stormcloud, the supermassive stormcloud began to rotate.
Soon, it the thunder tribulation stormcloud had transformed into a
vortex of lightning and clouds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What an enormous
thunder tribulation cloud.” Immortal Fivecraze’s face suddenly
changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s wrong?”
Ning asked, worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When I faced my
tribulation, it was this thunder tribulation which defeated me.
But…the thunder tribulation cloud I faced wasn’t this big,”
Immortal Fivecraze said worriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! How many
bolts of thunder were you up against during your thunder
tribulation?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t know.
However, the twenty-fifth bolt of skythunder shattered my magic
treasures and blew apart my body. I thus chose to give up and flee,”
Immortal Fivecraze said. “Junior apprentice-brother Diancai will
definitely face far more bolts of skythunder than I did.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as his words came
out…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could hear a
thunderous noise in his ears as an absolutely dazzling bolt of
lightning suddenly streaked down from the lightning-cloud vortex in
the skies, slamming directly downwards towards Immortal Diancai.
</P>

Chapter 13 - My Master
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai stood
there on the ground. His head raised, he stared at the
lightning-cloud vortex, those five pitch-black Heavenraker swords
swirling around him. When that first bolt of skythunder fell down
from the skies…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!” Immortal
Diancai pointed. Instantly, one of the five Heavenraker swords shot
out. It seemed to have transformed into an enormous mountain peak,
carrying incomparable weight and power behind it as it went forth to
welcome the bolt of lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous collision
sound. The Heavenraker Immortal sword, as stable as a mountain, just
trembled for a moment, whereas the bolt of skythunder was completely
dispersed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first bolt of
skythunder is the weakest; even the most ordinary of Void-level Earth
Immortals can withstand it. Given junior apprentice-brother Diancai’s
power and the fact that he has five top-grade Immortal-ranked flying
swords…he will probably only begin to find it taxing when he
reaches the twenty-seventh bolt of skythunder,” Immortal Fivecraze
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning nodded
in agreement. Immortal Fivecraze had been defeated by the
twenty-fifth bolt; if he had top-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords
back then, he probably would’ve been able to make it past the
twenty-seventh as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skythunder…every nine
bolts represented a different level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first nine bolts
were weak. Eighteen bolts were stronger. But twenty-seven bolts,
thirty-six bolts…every nine bolts represented an increase in
lethality. The legendary eighty-one bolts of skythunder…even the
thought of them was enough to terrify.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skythunder exploded
forth with wild fury. One bolt after another came crashing down.
Immortal Diancai was able to use a single one of his top-grade
Immortal-ranked flying swords to block all of the first eighteen
bolts, causing a hint of joy to appear on his face. Although he knew
in theory how powerful theses swords were, only now did he truly
understand how tremendously helpful these top-grade Immortal-ranked
flying swords were during the terrifying thunder tribulation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The nineteenth
bolt of thunder was more savage than the last, and it came down even
faster. It seemed to carry annihilating power within it; it was
clearly on a higher level of power than the previous bolts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That single Heavenraker
sword once more flew up to greet it, still as stable and weighty as a
mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The illusory mountain
around the Heavenraker sword collapsed, and the sword itself was
knocked downwards. The remaining force of the skythunder continued to
crash down towards Immortal Diancai, but Immortal Diancai didn’t
panic in the slightest. He just let out a low growl, and instantly
three of the four remaining Immortal swords around him flew upwards,
glowing with golden light, watery light, and earthen light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Heavenraker
swords formed into a tripartite formation, effortlessly blocking the
remaining power of the skythunder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your master has only
used his Tripartite Sword Formation,” Immortal Fivecraze said.
“Your master was exceedingly gifted, and many years ago he reached
the Dao Realm level in three mastered Dao-Paths. He’s also embarked
on the path of a Sword Immortal. He originally only used three
Immortal swords, and the technique he used the most often was this
Tripartite Sword Formation. However, after training for so many more
years, he’s gained even more insights and has thus developed the
Five Elements Sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slightly.
Indeed. After his master switched to using three Immortal swords, his
power seemed to increase dramatically. He was able to withstand one
bolt of lightning after another, even overcoming the twenty-fifth
bolt which had done in Immortal Fivecraze. He was able to persist all
the way through the twenty-seventh bolt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s time for
another increase in power,” Immortal Fivecraze said with concern.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twenty-seven bolts…this
represented the end of the first three nine-sets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thirty-six would
represent the end of the fourth nine-set!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the twenty-eighth
bolt came crashing down, the Tripartite Sword Formation was suddenly
pressed downwards…but it was still able to withstand the bolt. But
then came the twenty-ninth, the thirtieth bolts…the power of the
skythunder was slowly increasing, and the Tripatite Sword Formation
was beginning to crumble. By the time of the thirty-sixth bolt of
skythunder, Immortal Diancai let out a low growl. Instantly, all five
of the Heavenraker swords flew upwards to welcome this bolt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the five Heavenraker
swords flew upwards, they formed into the illusion of five massive
mountains in the sky, each of a different color. The five Immortal
swords combined their power, becoming incomparably weighty and solid
as they effortless deflected the thirty-sixth bolt of skythunder as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine treasures. A
fine sword-art!” Immortal Fivecraze said excitedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even the
thirty-sixth bolt was blocked.” Ning revealed a look of excitement
as well…but immediately afterwards, his face changed. This was
because an even more terrifyingly powerful bolt of lightning was
beginning to descend from the vortex of lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! Can it be
that your master’s tribulation involves forty-five bolts?!”
Immortal Fivecraze felt shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face turned
solemn as well. Ki Refiners couldn’t be the slightest bit
overconfident in facing their tribulations…because even a tiny
unblocked fraction of the thunderbolt would be enough to completely
blow apart their bodies! Fiendgod Body Refiners, by contrast, would
generally be able to use their bodies to withstand a small amount of
remnant power from the thunderbolts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus…for many,
thirty-six thunderbolts represented a plateau, the conclusion of the
fourth nine-set. Ki Refiners generally had a chance to survive the
first four sets…but after that, chances would grow dim!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thirty-seventh bolt
of skythunder was clearly far more powerful than the previous bolt.
Ning could sense the invisible pressure and power of the bolt just by
looking nat it. The power of this bolt of skythunder was at the level
of a Celestial Immortal already!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From within the five
enormous illusory mountains, the five Immortal swords managed to
block this bolt of skythunder, but they were pushed down strongly in
the process.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such power.”
Immortal Diancai’s face changed as well, but his expression
remained cold and his gaze remained resolute.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He wasn’t going to
retreat or flee!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thirty-eighth bolt
of skythunder came crashing down, and Immortal Diancai once more used
his five top-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords to greet the attack,
managing to force it aside once more. But this time, the five
illusory mountains that represented the five swords were nearly
destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
Watching from the distance, Immortal Fivecraze’s face changed
dramatically. “It’s very hard to say as to whether or not your
master will be able to overcome the forty-fifth bolt of skythunder.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t say
anything; he just watched closely. He could tell this as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given that even the
thirty-eighth bolt was already almost powerful enough to cause his
master’s sword-arts to crumble…it was very hard to say if his
master would be able to make it all the way past the forty-fifth. In
the past, Immortal Fivecraze had succumbed to the twenty-fifth bolt,
rather than the twenty-seventh bolt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lightning-cloud
vortex in the skies spat out the thirty-ninth bolt of skythunder,
even more ferocious than the previous bolts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“BLOCK!” Immortal
Diancai let out a howl. The five Heavenraker swords were like fish
that were swimming against the flow of the river. They carried those
five illusory mountains to greet the bolt of skythunder, but when the
skythunder came hammering down, all five swords were knocked
downwards towards the ground. Still…the bolt of skythunder was
almost consumed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not enough!”
Immortal Fivecraze said frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, Master!”
Ning was panicking as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to hold.”
Immortal Diancai’s face suddenly turned a swollen red color, and
his aura increased explosively in power as well. Clearly, he had just
used a forbidden technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Fivecraze’s
eyes were filled with nervousness. “Your master has used a
forbidden technique to compress and squeeze more power out of his
Goldlotus Primal. I hope that this technique will be enough to help
him withstand the tribulation. It has to be enough. Don’t fail. You
can’t fail!” He had seen far too many of his fellow disciples
fail during the Celestial Tribulation. He had failed. His master had
failed. His brothers had failed…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One after another had
been toppled by the Celestial Tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai was
the most promising one he had seen, and he even had the aid of five
top-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have to hold,”
Immortal Fivecraze murmured.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master…Master…”
Ning’s heart was tight as well. He felt even more nervous than when
he himself was facing life-and-death. Although he had heard long ago
that the Celestial Tribulation was truly frightening, upon seeing the
actual bolts of increasingly powerful skythunder come crashing down
from the skies, Ning became terrified that one of them would actually
strike his master’s body! A single strike…that would be it. He
would be finished!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fourtieth bolt. The
forty-first bolt. The forty-second bolt…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After using the
forbidden technique, the power of Immortal Diancai’s five swords
increased dramatically, and they took on multiple bolts in
succession.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The forty-fourth bolt
of skythunder!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai’s
face was somewhat distorted now, and his eyes were filled with
madness. The five Immortal swords once more flew upwards to greet the
thunder, and the imposing illusion of the five mountains seemed
mighty enough to suppress and seal away this entire minor world. But
in the face of the all-annihilating bolt of skythunder…the five
illusory mountains were dissipated, and all five Immortal swords were
knocked flying backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He blocked it. Just
the last one; the final bolt of skythunder,” Immortal Fivecraze
said worriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master…” Ning
was so frantic, he wanted to charge forward himself to help.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blood was beginning to
appear on the skin of Immortal Diancai’s face. This forbidden
technique was drawing out elemental ki in such a berserk, forcible
way that even blood was being drawn out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The forty-fifth bolt!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Block it again!”
Immortal Diancai seemed to have entered a berserk state, and all five
Heavenraker swords frantically rose. It seemed as though, in this
dire situation, he was able to unleash more power than he ever had
before, and the five illusory mountains once more joined together,
increasing their power by a little bit compared to the past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bolt of skythunder,
representing annihilation, came crashing downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five Immortal
swords were knocked backwards, and a small amount of remaining power
from the skythunder came crashing down towards Immortal Diancai as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“NO!” Ning felt as
though his heart was about to split apart. He was so frantic, his
eyes turned completely red.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“NO!” Immortal
Fivecraze was filled with terror as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Immortal Diancai
actually let out an utterly berserk howl as five more Immortal swords
suddenly appeared above him. These were the five swords which
Immortal Diancai himself had been previously using! He had often used
these five swords…and he only had enough time to transform them
into five streaks of rainbow light before the remaining power of the
lightning crashed down into them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG! The five flying
swords were all knocked flying, with one of them actually stabbing
through Immortal Diancai’s chest, cutting out a bloody hole.
However, the remaining power of the lightning had been completely
dispersed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, hahahaha…”
Immortal Diancai began to laugh. Clutching the wound over his chest,
he raised his head to the heavens and laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Immortal
Fivecraze were stunned for a moment…but in the next moment, they
went berserk with joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He blocked it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master blocked it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sort of feeling,
of victory snached from the jaws of defeat, caused both Ning and
Immortal Fivecraze’s emotions to go through a series of turbulent
changes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But why…”
Immortal Fivecraze raised his head, staring at the lightning-cloud
vortex. His eyes suddenly became filled with despair and terror.
“Why…why hasn’t…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why hasn’t…hasn’t
it dispersed?” Ning could feel a cold feeling sweeping through him
from head to toe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vortex of lightning
in the skies was continuing to swivel…and it was gathering an even
more terrifying amount of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai, still
clutching his chest, was suddenly stunned. He stared blankly at the
lightning-cloud vortex in the skies, his eyes filled with rage and
despair. He unleashed a savage roar from his soul: “Why, why, WHY
ARE THERE STILL MORE?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Six nine-sets…six
nine-sets…” Immortal Fivecraze’s eyes were filled with despair.
“Six nine-sets of thunder. My junior apprentice-brother isn’t the
disciple of a Daofather; he’s not even the disciple of a Celestial
Immortal. Why would the sixth nine-set appear…why…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“F*CK YOU, HEAVENS!”
Ning raised his head as well, letting out a grief-stricken, enraged
roar. Two streaks of tears began to fall from h is eyes. “Master,
master…my master!!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another enormous bolt
of lightning was born from within the lightning-cloud vortex…and it
came crashing downwards.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning felt as though
his heart was being torn apart. This pain filled every part of his
body. Ever since his parents had passed away, he truly had very few
kinsmen. Although his master Diancai always had a strict look and a
cold face, Ning could sense the love and caring his master felt for
him from deep within his heart. His master had the exact same sort of
disposition which Ning’s own father, Ji Yichuan, had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No. No…” Ning’s
heart was filled with nothing but despair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nobody could rescue his
master from the Celestial Tribulation! Even a Daofather of the Great
Firmament would only be able to watch from one side…because upon
interfering, heaven’s punishment would be triggered, causing even a
Daofather who tried to withstand it to perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next…Ning suddenly
felt a powerful desire enter his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve had enough.
ENOUGH!!!” Within his own mind, Ning let out a howl of utter
despair. “I’ve had ENOUGH of this feeling of powerlessness. I
don’t want any more of my loved ones to leave me. I don’t have
it. I WON’T HAVE IT!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His mother had passed
away…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His father had passed
away…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And now, even his
master was going to pass away…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart felt
like it was being chopped apart by knives! An incomparably powerful
desire filled him; the desire to not let him or his loved ones be
toyed with by destiny. A desire to completely control his own
destiny, his own fate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to grow
powerful. More powerful. If I can become like Pangu, capable of
establishing the heavens and forming the earth, or like Nuwa, capable
of repairing the heavens or destroying them…then perhaps the
so-called Celestial Tribulation would be nothing more than a joke in
my eyes.” For the first time in his life, Ning had the goal to
truly stand at the absolute top of the Three Realms, the unquestioned
top, beyond all other powers…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…to be at Pangu’s
level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pangu, he who had
established the heavens and formed the earth, creating the Primordial
World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nuwa, who had mastered
84,000 Daos, and had become heralded as Maiden Nuwa, the ‘Supremely
Benevolent, Supremely Holy Pangu-God’. She had reached Pangu’s
level, and had also become the undisputed number one figure of the
Three Realms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At their levels…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the heavens and
the earth would have to submit, much less the Celestial Tribulation,
which was nothing more than a mere part of the heavens and the earth!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master…” But no
matter what Ning currently desired within his heart, he wasn’t able
to change anything. All he could do…was watch!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning and
Immortal Fivecraze both felt pain and resentment…in this moment, it
was the tribulant, Immortal Diancai, who truly felt utter despair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai
clutched at his chest, head raised. When he saw that the vortex of
lightning and clouds was not dispersing, and was instead nurturing an
even more powerful bolt of lightning, Immortal Diancai felt despair.
“Why are there more coming? Why are there more…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Despair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-sister, I’m coming.” Immortal Diancai’s face turned
calm. He stared at the bolt of lightning forming within the skies,
then pointed towards it. “Go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five Heavenraker
swords all soared into the heavens, preparing to welcome that bolt of
lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time, Immortal
Diancai used the most beautiful, magnificent, and most powerful
sword-art he had ever used since he was born. The five Immortal
swords swirled around each other, joining together as they went to
welcome annihilation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Back when Immortal
Diancai had merely been a third-generation disciple of the
Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young fellow, you
should be filled with the vigor and energy of youth. Why are you like
this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My junior
apprentice-sister is dead. Life holds no meaning for me now. Life
holds no meaning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Life holds no
meaning? Since you feel as though life has no meaning…this old man
actually just so happens to want to kill someone today. Don’t fight
back. Just let me kill you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five unranked flying
swords flew together towards the numb, despairing youth…and
invisible sword-intent instantly transmitted into the youth’s
brain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One sword-stance after
another was desmonstrated…and the sword-art became filled with
increasing despair, the utmost despair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five Elements Sword,
stance eighteen: Minor Five Elements Extermination!” <BR> Each
stance was more complex and inconceivable than the last.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five Elements Sword,
stance thirty-six: Major Five Elements, All Life!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Destiny brought us
together, and so I will teach you this set of sword techniques.
Meditate well on them, young man. Your future path will be a long
one!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That voice had echoed
within his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By the time the young
Diancai had woken up, he could no longer find that old man, no matter
how hard he searched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This stroke of karmic
fortune caused Immortal Diancai to skyrocket in power in sword-arts.
He was acknowledged by all the Loose Immortals of the Black-White
College as having the highest chance of becoming a Celestial
Immortal! After gaining the assistance of Ning’s Dao-repository and
being able to compare the techniques within to his own techniques, he
gained new insights and made another breakthrough, reaching Immortal
Northwalker’s level. But even up till now, he had only reached the
level of the seventeenth stance of the Five Elements Sword!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that the first eighteen stances represented the first half of the
technique. The next eighteen stances were far more mysterious and
profound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old man definitely
was a formidable figure of the Three Realms, given that he was able
to transmit a technique such as this. Clearly, he was just wandering
casually through the Three Realms, and happened upon Immortal Diancai
by chance. Upon seeing that Immortal Diancai had potential, he had
casually taught him this sword technique, then left. This didn’t
mean he had taken Diancai on as a disciple! If he had, he would’ve
taught him Ki Refining techniques, secret arts, and more; in fact, he
would often provide guidance to help Diancai work through anything he
found confusing. The reality was, Immortal Diancai had to rely on
himself and his own efforts in order to resolve any confusions he had
regarding the Five Elements Sword!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai
suddenly understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like the golden
light of the sun piercing through the darkness of the skies. The
thunder tribulation had completely disrupted his emotions, causing
him to rise to triumphant heights, then fall in an abyss of despair.
Now that he was preparing to welcome death…his sword-arts broke
through to a new level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He finally comprehended
what it truly meant to be reach the limits of despair…and what the
true mysteries of the ‘Minor Five Elements, Extermination’
technique truly meant! 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five Elements Sword,
stance eighteen: Minor Five Elements, Extermination!” Immortal
Diancai continued to clutch at his chest, but suddenly…he smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five black flying
Immortal swords in the skies, joined into the illusion of five
massive mountains, had previously each been glowing with a different
color of light. The light had circulated from sword to sword, joining
them together and supporting each other. But Immortal Diancai
suddenly willed them to change…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Space itself seemed to
shake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five illusory
mountains suddenly merged into a single illusion, an enormous
five-fingered mountain. The five mountains had become one! There were
five peaks jutting out from the top of this mountain like five
fingers; each peak was of a different color! The mountain carried
with it a feeling of incomparably heavy despair and depression, as
though its despair could smother and exterminate anything in the
world!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the final
stance of the first half of the Five Elements Sword, the sword-stance
that represented mastery of the first half…Minor Five Elements
Extermination!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The forty-sixth bolt of
skythunder crashed against the five Heavenraker swords which appeared
like a mountain with five fingers stretching out from its peak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire mountain
trembled slightly, and the bolt of skythunder was dispersed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The forty-seventh bolt
of lightning came crashing down!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still holding his
chest, Immortal Diancai just smiled as he stared upwards. The five
Heavenraker swords went up to greet the lightning, and the mountain
peak they formed was incomparably tall and massive, so much so that
its peak seemed to encompass this entire minor world. Once more, it
blocked the bolt of skythunder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…” Immortal
Fivecraze and Ning were both stunned. Both of them had been gripped
by despair, but now they were stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Earlier, junior
apprentice-brother used a forbidden technique to overcome the first
five nine-sets of the thunder tribulation. Why is it that the sixth
set has become so simple for him?” Immortal Fivecraze was
completely flabbergasted. “A sudden breakthrough? But…but…a
breakthrough during the Celestial Tribulation?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt dazed as
well. Generally speaking, one might make sudden breakthroughs in
combat, but the crashing skythunder didn’t carry within it any of
the mysteries of the Dao; it was nothing more than raw, primalistic
strikes of lightning. Could it be that somehow, it had taught his
master something? How did his master’s sword-arts suddenly become
this powerful?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning didn’t
know how his master had made a sudden breakthrough, he still felt his
heart become filled with the utmost of joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…keep
blocking. Keep blocking!” Ning watched eagerly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One thunderbolt after
another continued to come crashing down. Each time, Immortal Diancai
used the ‘Minor Five Elements Extermination’ to defend against
the attack…but starting from the fifty-first bolt, he was clearly
beginning to find it a bit difficult! The power of the fifty-second
bolt caused his five Immortal swords to be smashed downwards by three
hundred meters, and the fifty-third bolt caused the illusory mountain
his swords had created to nearly be dispersed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The last one…the
last one!” Ning and Immortal Fivecraze both stared intently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fifty-fourth bolt
of skythunder came crashing down! This bolt of skythunder was tinged
with a hint of violet light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Block!” Immortal
Diancai’s aura actually grew even more powerful; his Dao-heart had
been baptized by despair and grown even more stronger. The five
Heavenraker swords ferociously battled upwards, transforming into an
enormous illusory mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The skythunder and the
mountain crashed against each other. The mountain was completely
destroyed and the five Immortal swords were blasted away…but the
skythunder was completely dispersed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“HE BLOCKED IT!”
Immortal Fivecraze let out an excited howl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised his head,
staring intently at the lightning-cloud vortex in the skies. Immortal
Fivecraze immediately did the same as well. Both were worried that
even more skythunder would be coming. However…this time, no more
came. The vortex of lightning in the skies began to dissipate towards
the four directions, and as they did, a single streak of electricity
began to swirl around Immortal Diancai’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When this streak of
lightning appeared and descended upon Immortal Diancai, his aura
began to subtly change and grow profound; this was an aura that
completely surpassed that of Void-level Earth Immortals and Loose
Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Celestial Immortal
Body.” Ning and Immortal Fivecraze both revealed looks of delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
Master.” After the final flickers of electricity disappeared, Ning
immediately called out to his master in a loud voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, that was a thunder tribulation of six nine-sets.
It’s utterly unfathomable that a Ki Refiner actually met with six
nine-sets…I imagine that generally, only disciples of Daofathers
and other legendary figures would be subjected to such a tribulation.
But you actually overcame it! Ahaha, I’m in utter awe of you.
Junior apprentice-brother, hurry up and rest up; soon, the demonheart
tribulation will arrive. You’ve already overcome the most dangerous
and most terrifying tribulation, the thunder tribulation; don’t be
felled by the demonheart tribulation,” Immortal Fivecraze said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Immortal
Diancai nodded calmly, a smile on his face. He pointed a finger
towards Ning, and all five Heavenraker swords immediately flew
towards Ning. “I no longer need these five Immortal swords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded,
immediately taking back the five Heavenraker swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The demonheart
tribulation will take a minimum of seven days,” Immortal Fivecraze
said solemly. “Ji Ning, when my junior apprentice-brother is
undergoing his demonheart tribulation…we absolutely cannot allow
anyone to disturb him. If there are any enemies preparing to attack,
they will most likely do so during this final tribulation. You and I
both need to be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Understood.
No one will be permitted to disturb my master,” Ning said seriously
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His true body had
trained in the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]; it was extremely well-suited
for close combat. He truly wasn’t worried about anyone in terms of
a head-on fight. As for his Primaltwin, it had the [Heavenraker]
sword formation, which would be formed from nine Heavenraker Immortal
swords. All by himself, he would be able to deal with two Celestial
Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No one would be allowed
to interfere! No one at all! Regardless of who they were or who their
backer was…they would not be permitted to disturb his master’s
tribulation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Stillwater
Commandery. A ripple appeared in the darkness of the empty skies, and
a white-robed female suddenly emerged from the ripple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She had a slim, pretty
face and a reserved aura, but she was on the level of an Earth
Immortal or Loose Immortal. Her eyes, however, were filled with a
natural arrogance, an arrogance that held all those before her in
contempt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm?” The
white-robed woman stared at the distant mountains. “Here we are!”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 15 - Enemy
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed woman
stood there in the void, staring at the mountain range. She
immediately waved her hand, producing a bronze talisman within it.
She filled the talisman with her elemental ki.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…the talisman
became scorchingly hot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This mountain range
was, in reality, the headquarters for the Blood God Church; it was
known as the Bloodlake Mountains. There were layers of formations
protecting this mountain range, causing even the Northmont clan of
Stillwater to be unable to do anything to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the mountains. A
towering, large palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Above the palace, there
was a jade bed that emanated with a hint of azure light. Seated atop
the jade bed was a blood-robed man whose eyes glowed with a bloody
light. He was the leader of the Blood God Church, the Scion of the
Blood God!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The Scion
frowned, then immediately waved his hand, producing a bronze talisman
of his own. The talisman had become scorchingly hot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Scion was startled
for a moment…then he immediately disappeared from atop the jade
bed. Moments later, he appeared in the air above the mountains. Based
on the resonance from the talismans, he turned to look towards the
white-robed woman’s direction, then took a single step and arrived
before her. He bowed respectfully. “Greetings, Emissary!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yet another
Void-level Earth Immortal is undergoing a tribulation within your
Stillwater Commandery,” the white-robed woman said calmly. “It is
Immortal Diancai of the Black-White College. Here is the detailed
intelligence information about him.” As she spoke, she tossed over
a leatherbound scroll towards the Scion of the Blood God, who
immediately accepted it in a respectful manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed woman
gave the Scion a glance, then snorted and departed gracefully,
quickly disappearing into the distant horizons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Scion stood there
in the air, scroll in hand. He watched in a cold, sinister manner as
the woman left. “A mere Emissary dares to put on such airs before
me? If it wasn’t for the power behind you, I would’ve annihilated
you with a wave of my hand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The Scion
opened the scroll, which had detailed information regarding Immortal
Diancai’s tribulation, as well as a map and directions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s actually in a
minor world, with the entrance being in the Darknorth Sea?” The
Scion couldn’t help but feel a chill as he read the information.
“This mysterious power…they are a bit too all-knowing…how can
they even know about such a well-hidden tribulation location?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had only interacted
with this mysterious power for roughly thirty years…but the more he
interacted with them, the more terrifying he found them to be!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had given him just
a slight bit of help, but that had been already enough to make his
Blood God Church strong enough to tussel against the Northmont clan
of Stillwater. Although their roots weren’t as powerful and as deep
as the Northmont clan’s…there was no way for the Northmont clan
to wipe out the Blood God Church now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They’ve already
given me two intelligence reports regarding Earth Immortals
undergoing a tribulation. This is the third one.” The Scion
frowned. “How on earth did they find out?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A traitor or a spy?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Scion of the Blood
God didn’t believe it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Earth Immortals were
extremely cautious when undergoing their tribulations; they would
only invite protectors that they had absolute faith in! In addition,
they would usually personally use a spatial teleport to go to the
tribulation location; not even the protectors would know exactly
where the tribulation would be attempted. Indeed, Ji Ning and
Immortal Fivecraze weren’t told in advance, and they didn’t know
exactly where in the Darknorth Sea the island they had been taken to
was located!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How did they find
out? This is too incredible. I’ve heard from others that due to the
fact that the Three Realms are filled with dangerous undercurrents,
fate and destiny have been thrown into a state of chaos, making it
virtually impossible for someone to Foretell where a tribulation will
occur,” the Scion mused puzzledly. Normally, powerful experts of
the Three Realms might be able to Foretell through augury some rather
well-hidden mysteries…but fate itself had been thrown into a state
of flux. There was no way to do so now!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder they hold
the Grand Xia Dynasty with no regard. No wonder they dare to act
against the entire Dynasty,” the Scion mused privately. “Doesn’t
matter. I’m not going to make enemies with them; all I need to do
is borrow from their strength to strengthen myself. As long as they
can strengthen my Blood God Church, that’s all that matters.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. This Immortal
Diancai is of the Black-White College; the Black-White College is one
of the strongest supporters of the Northmont clan of Stillwater. They
are one of their most loyal dogs! I need to seize this chance to
wound them,” the Scion nodded to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the
white-robed Emissary had delivered the intelligence report, she
hadn’t ordered the Scion to do anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To kill or not? This
was up to the Scion himself. If he chose not to attack, the
mysterious power wouldn’t care.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Scion of the Blood
God returned to his palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have the seven Law
Protectors come see me right away,” the Scion instructed from atop
his jade bed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” an attendant
said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, seven black-robed
Law Protectors hurried over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, sect
leader,” the seven black-robed Law Protectors said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Diancai of
the Black-White College is currently undergoing his tribulation. The
Black-White College is one of the most loyal dogs of the Northmont
clan; we need to seize this chance to eradicate Immortal Diancai,”
the Scion said calmly. “The other Immortals of the Black-White
College are all within their College; it is very likely that the only
guardians with him right now are his disciple Ji Ning as well as
Immortal Fivecraze, the most powerful member of the Black-White
College.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Make a trip with me.
Let us eradicate these three members of the Black-White College,”
the Scion of the Blood God said. “With these three gone, the
Black-White College will be badly wounded; this is akin to breaking
one of the Northmont clan’s legs.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sect leader, just
the seven of us and yourself? Will it be enough? I heard that this Ji
Ning had gone missing for thirty-plus years; he must have taken on an
expert of the Three Realms as his master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Black-White
College isn’t easy to deal with; even if the seven of us go along
with you, we will still probably suffer some losses even if we win.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven Law
Protectors were all hesitating.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Scion said calmly,
“Don’t worry. I have complete confidence; do you think I would
let the seven of you take on any serious danger?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven Law
Protectors raised their heads to stare at the Sion of the Blood God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The Scion
let out a cold snort, then waved his hand. A small black ship had
appeared within his palm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is…” The
eyes of the seven Law Protectors lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With this treasure
in my hands…I trust you are all convinced now?” The Scion said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We shall naturally
obey your orders, sect leader.” The seven Law Protectors no longer
hesitated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Scion immediately
sent a further mental order: “Three Elders, the seven Law
Protectors and I are going out on a trip. The affairs within the
Church shall temporarily be managed by you three.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry, sect
leader. Leave it to us,” the three Elders replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the Scion in front
and the seven Law Protectors behind, the eight flew high into the
sky, moving like streaks of light. And then, they quickly used a
spatial teleport to disappear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Darknorth
Sea. The air above the island with a volcano.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blood-robed Scion
of the Blood God along with the seven black-robed Law Protectors were
all standing in the air above the island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The entrance to the
minor world is there, within that volcano,” the Scion said calmly.
“Based on our intelligence report, Immortal Diancai should have
spent two days undergoing the tribulation by now. If he failed in
overcoming the fire, wind, or thunder tribulations, then he is most
likely either dead or a Loose Immortal by now. Even if he survived…he
should currently be undergoing the demonheart tribulation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Later, do as I
instructed to you previously.” The Scion swept the seven Law
Protectors with his gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, sect leader,”
the seven black-robed Law Protectors said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Scion of the Blood
God gave the order. Swoosh swoosh swoosh!!! Eight streaks of light
instantly streaked across the sky, entering the mouth of the volcano.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon after they
disappeared, there was yet another a ripple in space near the
entrance to the volcano. Twelve white-robed figures emerged, the
leader a figure with a bloody scar on the arm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The forces of the
Blood God Church of Stillwater Commandery have entered,” a
white-robed youth said with a chortle. “Captain, you truly
predicted everything in a godlike manner; you knew that they would
definitely go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Black-White
College is located right in Stillwater Commandery; over the course of
countless ages, they have always walked in lockstep with the
Northmont clan of Stillwater! The Northmont clan, in turn, has always
protected the Black-White College. Of the eight great powers, the
Black-White College is the most loyal one; naturally, the Blood God
Church will seize this chance to annihilate Immortal Diancai during
his Celestial Tribulation.” The leader, a white-robed man,
continued calmly, “By borrowing from their strength, our own
assassination attempt will become easier.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is there a need for
us to be so cautious in dealing with Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Even our
superiors simply instructed us to be careful of the school behind Ji
Ning; he himself isn’t worthy of such concern. We’ve killed even
Celestial Immortals; how powerful can a young fellow who has trained
for less than a century possibly, even if he is a Daofather’s
disciple?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all spoke out. The
leader, the scarred white-robed man, laughed. “Ji Ning naturally
isn’t worthy of concern, but I’m afraid that if something
unexpected happens, his school might intervene. That’s why this
assassination must be a quick one! We need to avoid anything
unexpected.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Everyone
nodded. They were all mainly worried about Ning’s school, worried
that a True Immortal or Empyrean God might to suddenly appear and
massacre them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No one knew where Ning
had disappeared to during the past thirty-plus years. However, the
intelligence reports which the Bloodcloud Hall had received indicated
that his disappearance…was almost assuredly linked to an
extraordinary twist of fate!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Execute our
assassination plan,” the scarred, white-robed man said solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh swoosh swoosh!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twelve figures
instantly disappeared as they too entered the mouth of the volcano.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the charred
minor world that was filled with an aura of death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai was
seated in the lotus position. Three thousand meters away from him, an
enormous restrictive formation had been set up, and the surface of
the formation glowed with light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the formation
were only two figures; Immortal Diancai and the Whitewater Hound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Immortal
Fivecraze were both outside this grand sealing formation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Earlier, during the
wind, fire, and thunder tribulations, Ning’s group hadn’t dared
to set down any formations…they didn’t wish to disturb the
Celestial Tribulation and incur divine punishment. They would’ve
been finished! But now that they were at the final tribulation, the
demonheart tribulation, setting up a grand restrictive formation no
longer made any difference whatsoever. Ning and Immortal Fivecraze
were both worried about enemies would sneak close through using some
technique to avoid divine sense scans, and so they had set up this
grand sealing formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With it present, one
would have to either break the formation or use a Greater
Teleportation technique in order to reach Immortal Diancai!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is master’s
second day undergoing the demonheart tribulation.” Ning turned to
glance at Immortal Diancai, seated calmly in the lotus position at
the center of the grand sealing formation. No one knew what Immortal
Diancai’s demonheart tribulation was like; generally speaking,
wayward thoughts were easily to withstand, but if one had to
withstand them for an extremely long period of time…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that at least seven days of time in the real world had to pass, but
within the world of the demonheart tribulation, ten thousand years or
more might pass. Some would even forget what reality was, and they
would be completely submerged within the illusory world until finally
they perished!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning was
suddenly startled as a terrifying premonition of danger swept out
from within his subconscious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Danger!” Ning sent
frantically, “Old brother Fivecraze, Uncle White, be careful. I can
sense danger drawing near!” Immortal practitioners generally had
extremely accurate subconscious premonitions. However, Ning was quite
astonished at the fact that he had such a powerful premonition of
danger…because he had already trained in the [Eight-Nine Arcane
Art]! Logically speaking, there should be very few things in the
world capable of threatening him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if enemies came
to attack Master…can it be that the amount of power they prepared
is enough to threaten me as well?” Ning could barely believe it.
“If that’s the case, then we are in for huge trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes suddenly
lit up with torch-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Torch Dragon’s Eye]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He immediately scanned
in every direction with both his divine sense as well as the [Torch
Dragon’s Eye].
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 16 - No Mercy When Striking
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Danger?” Both
Immortal Fivecraze and the Whitewater Hound were startled, but
neither of them doubted Ji Ning in the slightest. As time passed,
they too began to subconsciously sense danger impending.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Fivecraze, in
particular, felt cold fear his heart. He was stunned by this. “What
sort of danger is this? Why is it that I feel so threatened?
Nothing’s even happened yet, but I already feel somewhat
terrified?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?” Immortal
Fivecraze looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White, prepare
to use your formations; no one is permitted to go close to Master.
Old brother Fivecraze, be careful,” Ning instructed. His eyes were
blazing with torch-fire as he continued to scan the surrounding area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the light from
the distance, including refracted light and bounced light, were all
being drawn into Ning’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than sixty
thousand kilometers away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There they are!”
Ning could clearly see a giant black ship that was flying towards
them from far away. Atop the giant black ship, there were eight
blurry figures standing atop the deck. The leader was a blood-robed
man who was filled with an unearthly, baleful aura. Behind him were
seven black-robed individuals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was aware of all
of the famous Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals within Stillwater
Commandery, and had seen pictures of them in scrolls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The leader of the
Blood God Church and their seven Law Protectors?” Ning was
startled. “How did they find out that my master was undergoing the
tribulation here?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His master had led the
three of them into a spatial teleport and directly arrived at this
volcano within the Darknorth Sea; neither Ning nor Immortal Fivecraze
knew exactly where this volcano was! Could it be that his master had
himself revealed it to another? Impossible!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder so many
Earth Immortals have suffered assaults during their tribulation here
in the Grand Xia as of late,” Ning mused to himself. “It seems
the culprit behind these events must have a special method to clearly
sense where a Celestial Tribulation is occurring.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This caused Ning to
feel even more nervous. The power behind these things…what in the
world was it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No wonder even the Old
Patriarch had felt fear. The mere fact that this person was able to
calculate where Earth Immortals were undergoing their
tribulation…this was already something that was entirely
inconceivable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems that things
are as Master said; I cannot fight head-on against this sort of
power. If I prance about in front if it, most likely my fate can be
summarized in one word; death!” Ning could dimly sense that this
approaching storm was going to be like a massive tidal wave which no
one could possibly block; anyone who tried would be smashed apart.
Not even Patriarch Subhuti dared to attempt to block it; if Ning did,
he would undoubtedly be crushed to smithereens as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t dare go
cause trouble for the mastermind. But little shrimps like the Blood
God Church? They are nothing.” This, Ning understood well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is the Blood God
Church.” Ning immediately sent a mental message to Immortal
Fivecraze and Uncle White. “A total of eight have arrived; they are
the sect leader and his seven Law Protectors.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? The Blood God
Church? No wonder my subconscious was telling me that this threat was
so dangerous.” Immortal Fivecraze’s face instantly changed
dramatically as he frantically sent mentally to Ning, “Ji Ning, the
leader of the Blood God Church’s power has increased dramatically;
he is able to compete against Celestial Immortals now. As for his
seven Law Protectors, each of them increased dramatically in power as
well; each are most likely comparable to me. Given the power of the
eight of them…there’s no way I can block them at all. I’d
probably die within a single breath’s worth of time!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven Law
Protectors of the Blood God Church, thirty years ago, were nothing
more than ordinary Loose Immortals! At most, they were perhaps on par
with Loose Immortals who had lived for a hundred thousand years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, however, they had
all increased in power enormously, at the five hundred thousand year
level, very close to Immortal Fivecraze’s own level!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
grew solemn as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should we do?
How should we stop them?” Immortal Fivecraze was restless and
nervous. “They are too powerful, far more powerful than the three
of us. Ji Ning, although you are comparable to senior Northwalker,
there are eight of them. So long as a single one of them goes to
fight against junior apprentice-brother Diancai, they’ll be able to
kill him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the demonheart
tribulation, one’s mind would be completely subsumed within the
demonheart world. There was no way to fight back in the real world at
all. Thus, Ning’s group not only had to overcome the foe, they also
had to be able to completely block the eight of them. If a single one
managed to slip by…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave it to me.”
Ning’s eyes were filled with a sharp light. “Old brother
Fivecraze, go into the grand sealing formation right away. Stay close
to my master and protect him. As for these eight…leave them to me.
If any make it pass me, it’ll be up to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Immortal
Fivecraze didn’t hesitate, and the Whitewater Hound immediately let
him inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes blazed
like torches as he watched the giant black ship slowly draw near.
Soon, it reached ten thousand kilometers of Ning. By now, the members
of the Blood God Church could see the distant grand sealing formation
with their naked eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A grand sealing
formation.” The Scion of the Blood God laughed coldly. “It seems
this Immortal Diancai has already overcome the first three
tribulations of wind, fire, and thunder. He is engaged in the
demonheart tribulation. If we didn’t come…he might very well have
succeeded and become a new Celestial Immortal. Alas…this impending
Celestial Immortal of the Black-White College is about to die a
stillborn death at our hands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A powerful divine sense
came sweeping outwards in a wave, crushing down towards the eight of
them. The divine sense roared angrily, “Scion of the Blood God,
seven Law Protectors, I’m asking you to hurry up and leave!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning! He lives up
to his reputation as the number one peerless genius of the Conclave
of Immortal Destiny; his divine sense is able to stretch over ten
thousand kilometers.” The Scion’s own divine sense interacted
with Ning’s. “Ji Ning, your master is undergoing his tribulation,
yes? Don’t deny it; we know it all. Heh heh…I can see that your
master is only being protected by yourself, Fivecraze, and that
Whitewater Hound spirit-beast of yours. Ahaha, that’s too weak.
With this amount of power…there’s no way you’ll be able to stop
me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Scion felt absolute
self-confidence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Scion of the Blood
Good, if you leave now, then I, Ji Ning, shall remember your kindness
in showing mercy on this day,” Ning sent back angrily through
divine sense. “But if you attack…then I, Ji Ning, shall begin a
death-feud with your Blood God Church!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Scion could sense
the savagery and madness within Ning’s voice. He couldn’t help
but feel briefly startled…but then he snickered, “Death-feud? Not
even the Northmont clan of Stillwater was able to do anything to me;
I’m supposed to be afraid of you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seven Law
Protectors, leave Ji Ning to me; I’ll handle him. As for Fivecraze
and that spirit-beast, I’ll leave them to you. While dealing with
Fivecraze…go ahead and kill Immortal Diancai,” the Scion sent.
“Up to the task?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry, sect
leader.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just leave it to us,
sect leader.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven Law
Protectors all felt complete confidence. In truth, they were only
wary of Ji Ning; after all, Ji Ning was simply too mysterious.
However, they now only had to deal with Immortal Fivecraze and that
spirit-beast. They were still quite confident in being able to do so!
The seven of them, joined together, were able to completely crush and
dominate Fivecraze. As for the Whitewater Hound spirit-beast?
According to the intelligence report, it had previously been merely
at the Wanxiang level in the past; although it was now at the
Void-level, it had risen too fast and most likely did not have a
solid foundation. Killing it would be effortless!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine!” The Scion
laughed and said, “Then let’s do it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black ship suddenly
drew near at high speed. Three thousand kilometers. Two thousand. One
thousand…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack,” the Scion
shouted mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go!” The
seven Law Protectors came out in a great show of force as the seven
of them soared into the skies like seven black shadows. Immediately
afterwards, streaks of bloody light began to swirl around them,
joining together into a Blood Dragon that was more than three
thousand meters long. This Blood Dragon was covered with distinct
draconic scales, had long draconic whiskers, and a pair of eyes that
were filled with a killing intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since they were reputed
as the Seven Law Protectors, they naturally had their own joint
formation. Back in the past, when they were weak, they had relied on
this formation to roam Stillwater Commandery fearlessly; now that
they were powerful, they were close to the level of a Loose Immortal
who had survived for a million years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Blood Dragon flew
to one side, avoiding Ji Ning. The giant black warship, however, flew
straight towards him. Atop the deck stood the Scion of the Blood God,
whose eyes were filled with fiendish savagery. His divine sense once
more clashed against Ning’s as he sent, “Ji Ning, you can block
me, but you can’t block my seven Law Protectors. Your master is
definitely going to die. As for you…I actually want to see for
myself exactly how powerful the number one genius of the Conclave of
Immortal Destiny is!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning
laughed coldly as he stood there…but his heart was clenching!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the sake of
protecting his master, Ning had made many preparations. Although the
eight members of the Blood God Church were seemingly powerful…Ning
was completely confident in being able to stop them. There was no way
the eight of them could pose a mortal threat to him…but his
premonitions of danger couldn’t be wrong. Where, then, was the
danger hiding?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All I can do is
handle it when it comes,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Fivecraze
stood a few dozen meters away from Immortal Diancai, seven Immortal
swords swirling around him. His heart was filled with worry. “Ji
Ning said that he’ll block them, and that any that get pass him I
am to handle. But the Scion of the Blood God is now dealing with him
while the seven Law Protectors are attacking this way. How can I
block seven of them? If I, a Loose Immortal who has lived a few
hundred thousand years, were to perish, it wouldn’t matter…but
junior apprentice-brother was able to overcome even six nine-sets of
the thunder tribulation. If he were to be killed by the Blood God
Church, that would be too unfair.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter what…even
if I have to give up this old life of mine…I have to protect my
junior apprentice-brother.” Immortal Fivecraze gritted his teeth,
staring towards the distant Blood Dragon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven Law
Protectors, in the form of a Blood Dragon, radiated an unearthly,
terrifying aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the Blood Dragon
drew close, it suddenly lashed out with its tail. In truth, its tail
was actually formed from multiple Immortal-ranked magic treasures,
including Immortal swords and ribbons!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tail slammed down
directly upon the grand sealing formation, instantly causing it to
crack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this moment, the
Whitewater Hound, who had previously been lying there silently, rose
to his feet. Next to him appeared a black-robed youth; it was Ning’s
Primaltwin! Ning could sense that danger was coming, and so he left
his true body outside the formation to serve as the first line of
defense, while he had his Primaltwin remain within the formation to
serve as the second line of defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want to harm my
master?!” A fierce light flashed through the eyes of the
black-robed Ning, and suddenly, nine seemingly translucent
pitch-black Immortal swords suddenly appeared out of nowhere next to
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nine of them?”
Immortal Fivecraze was both surprised and delighted. “So there were
actually nine of those top-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords…and
Ji Ning, that little kid, actually hid his Primaltwin here. This
little fellow…he scared the crap out of me. But will his Primaltwin
be able to block these seven Law Protectors?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Fivecraze knew
very well that he himself was not. It would all be up to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Riiiiiip.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nine sword-tears in the
sky suddenly appeared, like deep furrows that had been raked into it.
The nine tears were like an enormous web of swords that swept towards
the giant Blood Dragon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” The Blood
Dragon let out an enraged roar that sounded like the merged voices of
all seven Law Protectors, and at the same time it once more slapped
its tail towards it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Riiiiiiip!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nine sword-tears, each
comparable to the strike of an ordinary Celestial Immortal. When
combined…the power of this blow surpassed even the power of Ning’s
true body! When the attacks collided, the tail of the Blood Dragon,
its most powerful part, instantly shattered apart. The
Immortal-ranked magic treasures were all knocked flying back…and
then the rest of the Blood Dragon was shattered as well. The nine
sword-tears then continued forward in beautiful arcs, chopping
towards the seven Law Kings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” The
black-robed Ning’s eyes were filled with nothing but coldness.
</P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sect leader!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven Law
Protectors let out shrill cries of terror. Their
combination-formation had been instantly shattered; this completely
terrified them. They didn’t even think about fighting back. There
was only one thing in their mind; fleeing! The magic treasures that
had been knocked backwards were all re-controlled by the seven Law
Protectors as they instantly began to execute their escaping
techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ji Ning
was using the [Heavenraker] technique, a sword technique that was
extremely well-suited for engaging in group attacks! In addition,
this technique involved nine Immortal-ranked flying swords, whereas
there were only seven enemies!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Swish! Swish! Swish! Under Ning’s control, one tear in the sky
appeared after another, ripping towards the seven Law Protectors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each of the Law
Protectors had Immortal-ranked magic treasures of their own, but by
the looks of it theirs were quite ordinary. One of them, a
silver-haired, hawk-nosed elder, had a total of three flying swords,
whereas a youthful-looking one was controlling a large amount of
stardust. Each of these two Loose Immortals were being pursued by a
pair of Heavenraker swords, while the others were each being pursued
by one!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Block.” The
youthful-looking Loose Immortals was the most powerful of the seven.
His dazzling, sparkling stardust was furiously attempting to block
those two half-illusory Heavenraker swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those two tears in the
sky forcefully tore through all his barriers, slicing apart his body
and revealing a shattered Goldlotus Primal within it. Moments
later…the Primal soul completely dissipated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Die!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sect leader, save
me!” A black-robed, sinister-looking female Loose Immortal called
out frantically for aid, but she too was slashed and slain by one of
the Heavenraker swords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that Ning had completed his overhauling of the ninth stance of the
[Three-Foot Sword] more than five or six years ago. During the past
few years, he had been working on the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] and
learning archery. This, too, was a way of meditating on the Dao! His
improvements in wind and in the Grand Dao of Qiankun were especially
significant, and thus Ning’s sword-arts had naturally become more
exquisite as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of sword-arts,
Ning was at an extremely high level now. In addition, he had nine
top-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords, whereas the seven Law
Protectors mostly had low-grade Immortal-ranked treasures, with just
a few middle-grade; in fact, some of them were still using
Heaven-ranked treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, Ning was
using the [Heavenraker] sword technique, a technique developed by a
Daofather which was perfectly matched to his Heavenraker swords.
Naturally, the power of his attack was increased many times over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each of the nine
Heavenraker swords, even when used separately, were able to unleash
an attack at the level of an ordinary Celestial Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All seven of the Law
Protectors perished!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! The nine tears
in the sky swept backwards, pulling in all of the now ownerless magic
treasures in their wake as they flew back towards the black-robed
Ning, who collected them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…this is…too…”
Immortal Fivecraze’s eyes were filled with wild joy, and he stared
towards the black-robed Ning with a scorchingly excited gaze. “Ji
Ning, those were the seven Law Protectors, the seven famous Law
Protectors! You actually killed them in a single exchange. Everyone
said that when the seven Law Protectors join forces, anyone below the
Celestial Immortal level will find it difficult to fight against
them, but you, you actually…you aren’t at senior Northwalker’s
level, you are even more powerful than he was!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
said, “In terms of my insight into the sword, I’m actually not
that much better than senior Northwalker was. The most important
thing is that I have a set of nine top-grade Immortal-ranked flying
swords, as well as a sword-art which was developed by a Daofather.
Thus, even if an actual Celestial Immortal Patriarch came, my
Primaltwin would be able to give him a fight!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Blood God Church’s
forces had been divided into two groups. The seven Law Protectors had
gone to go after the seemingly-helpless Immortal Fivecraze and
Whitewater Hound, whereas the sect leader, the Scion of the Blood
God, had went to deal with Ji Ning’s true body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prepare to die.”
The Scion stood atop his giant black warship. Long gray awls suddenly
appeared behind his body, their tips glowing with bloody light. A
total of nine of these gray awls appeared before all of them shot
through the skies, forming a vague illusion of a bloody tidal wave as
they moved forward!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine gray awls came
howling forward, carrying the wave of blood with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s true body
stood there, staring towards the distant attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning waved
his hand, and the Thousandbull Sword appeared within it. He filled
the Thousandbull Sword with his late-stage Void-level elemental ki,
and the power of this sword which was very nearly at the level of a
Pure Yang treasure instantly reached a shocking height.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Thousandbull
Sword truly is very close to the level of a Pure Yang treasure; a
magic treasure like this, which was forged by a person, has extremely
exacting requirements in terms of elemental ki. Only Celestial
Immortals can use Pure Yang treasures, and this Thousandbull Sword is
extremely close to that level; amongst Immortal-ranked treasures, it
is a top-grade amongst top-grade items. In the past, I used
early-stage Void-level elemental ki to activate its power, but I
still wasn’t able to fully unleash it. Only after reaching the
late-stage am I able to truly stir its power. However…it still
isn’t time for me to truly unleash its full power!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s subconscious
continued to scream danger to him…but he still couldn’t tell
where the danger was! This restless feeling caused Ning to continue
to hide part of his power, so as to deal with anything unexpected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise.” Instantly,
an enormous Lotusflower Swordland appeared around him. Because the
earthfire and dire-ice in his body had yet to be raised to the
skyfire or skywater level, the power of his Waterflame Lotus was
still inferior to that of the Lotusflower Swordland.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous lotus
bloomed around him, filled with layers of petals. Now that he had a
higher level of comprehension regarding the Dao, the power of his
Lotusflower Swordland had increased as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! One
bloody awl after another came slamming forward, tearing through one
layer of petals after another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gripped his
Thousandbull Sword. Sword-light suddenly flashed in front of him,
blocking each of the sharp awls. Explosive sounds rang out without
end, and sword-ki billowed forth in a torrent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By relying on his
Lotusflower Swordland and his Thousandbull Sword, Ning was able to
knock each of the awls flying backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The Scion was
controlling his magic treasures to attack from afar while also
watching his seven Law Protectors. “This Ji Ning actually is quite
formidable. Although I’ve only used a third of my power, he hasn’t
used his [Three Heads, Six Arms] either. He was able to block while
just using a single Immortal sword. It seems that if I don’t fight
with full power, it will be hard for me to kill him. He’s so
powerful, despite only having trained for a century…it seems people
like him, the number one peerless genius and champion of the Conclave
of Immortal Destiny, truly are quite special. Mm…after the seven
Law Protectors kill Fivecraze, Diancai, and that spirit-beast, we’ll
join forces…and kill Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Scion had thought
things out ‘perfectly’. But he suddenly discovered, to his
amazement…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That a black-robed Ning
had suddenly appeared within the grand sealing formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Primaltwin? Ji
Ning actually split up with his Primaltwin? Isn’t he afraid of them
being divided and conquered? He’s quite suicidal to do this.” The
Scion was merely startled; he didn’t actually panic. As he saw it,
even if the seven Law Protectors weren’t able to suppress Ning’s
Primaltwin when they joined forces, at least they should be on par
with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those are…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nine terrifyingly
powerful Immortal-ranked magic treasures, of such great might that
they caused the heart to tremble. They howled through the air as nine
sword-formations, blasting apart and disintegrating the Blood Dragon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven Law
Protectors fled in a panic, crying out miserably for rescue…but
each of them were caught and killed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Scion was
completely stunned!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Primaltwin was
vastly more powerful than he had expected. Even if he himself were to
strike with full force, there was no way he would’ve been able to
destroy the Blood Dragon with a single blow! It must be understood
that when two sides were roughly on par with each other, one side
would at most be put in a disadvantageous position. To completely
blast apart the enemy…that was generally only possible when there
was a fairly significant difference in power! This Ji Ning’s
Primaltwin was even more powerful then himself, the sect leader!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My seven Law
Protectors are gone…just like that.” The Scion felt utter pain in
his heart. “This Ji Ning is absolutely inhuman. He’s a monster!
He’s trained for less than a century, but he’s even more powerful
than the secret arts I acquired. I imagine that in the entirety of
Stillwater Commandery, only that old bastard, ‘Hunchmont’, is at
his level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My seven Law
Protectors died…I need to teach him a lesson!” A look of savagery
appeared in the eyes of the Scion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The disciples of the
Blood God Church were all famous for their brutal savagery, and the
Scion of the Blood God himself was known to be a madman. In addition,
he had his precious ship with him; why would he leave so easily?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The long awls suddenly
flew backwards, and the giant black warship began to rapidly shrink.
The Scion hid himself into the cabin of the warship, which then
completely sealed itself off like a fortress.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you killed
my seven Law Protectors, but I shall kill your master.” The Scion’s
bellowing voice echoed in the skies, but he secretly mused to
himself, “My losses today were enormous, but killing Diancai should
count as having rendered major merits. I have to get some good
treasures out of this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hadn’t been
paying too much attention to the Scion of the Blood God; he had been
spending most of his time staying vigilant and prepared for the
invisible threat that he continued to sense. He was ready to fight
back at any moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon seeing the Scion
suddenly hide into the shrunken black warship, which was now as
tightly sealed as any castle, Ning just frowned and sent mentally,
“Uncle White, activate your formation and block the Scion of the
Blood God. Don’t let him go close to master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry, Ning,
son.” The Whitewater Hound hadn’t even done anything yet; he was
the true, final protector of Immortal Diancai!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Scion is at
most comparable to a Celestial Immortal; killing him is fairly hard,
but suppressing him is doable,” Ning mused to himself. “And that
precious ship of his is merely a protective item…it doesn’t
actually threaten me. So where is the true danger?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes continued
to blaze with torch-fire as he stared at his surroundings, and his
divine sense continuously scanned the area as well. But he couldn’t
find anything!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed man
suddenly appeared out of nowhere. The white-robed man had a strange,
bloody scar on his arm…and immediately after he appeared, eleven
more white-robed figures appeared out of nowhere, each of them
radiating auras of incredible power! The invisible pressure they gave
off…it seemed as though each of them were comparable to the Scion
of the Blood God! As for the first person who had appeared, the
impression he gave Ning…was that he was far more powerful than the
Scion!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Greater
Teleportation Dao-seal!” Ning was shocked upon seeing them suddenly
appear. “The surrounding area was spacelocked long ago, preventing
any spatial teleportations. The only option is to use Greater
Teleportation. There’s no way one of them could be a freakish
monster who mastered even the Grand Dao of Qiankun…they had to have
simply used a Dao-seal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They were willing to
use a Greater Teleportation Dao-seal, just to catch me off-guard? And
those eleven who appeared afterwards…they should’ve been hiding
in the Immortal estate of the leader.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was instantly able
to draw these conclusions. In turn, these conclusions caused him to
feel even more shocked!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Greater Teleportation
Dao-seals were extremely valuable. For them to be willing to use one
right away…how terrifying would these foes be?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” A
white-robed youth in the group let out a fierce-looking grin, then a
complicated pattern of light appeared around him, forming into a
runic formation. The strange runes hovered into the air, emanating a
dark light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other white-robed
figures were all doing the same. The runic formation created by the
leader involved runes that were even larger and even more
complex-looking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Form!” Suddenly,
an enormous black serpent appeared in the skies. The eyes of this
giant serpent were golden, while its body seemed to be filled with a
strange power that was able to shake the Heavens and the Earth, as
though it had taken command of the surrounding world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Primordial
Godbeast…the Ba-Serpent?!” Ning was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most supreme
Godbeasts of the Three Realms were all born in the Primordial Era.
They were all comparable to Fiendgods of Primal Chaos in power…and
in fact, some of them actually were Fiendgods of Primal Chaos. For
example, Primordial Godbeasts such as the ‘Raindragon’, the
‘Garuda’, and the Torch-Dragon were actually born from the
universe out of chaos; thus, they could be classified as Fiendgods.
However, because they also served as the original progenitor for many
different types of Godbeasts, with countless Godbeasts having some
degree of their blood and lineage, they could also be classified as
Godbeasts as well, the most supreme and ancient of Godbeasts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Blood Dragon
created by the seven Law Protectors through their formation could be
considered the product of a very ordinary combination-formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But a formation that
could form a Primordial Godbeast…such formations were all extremely
formidable, and when they joined into a Godbeast, they would possess
amazing, incredible powers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although all this took
time to describe, it happened in a flash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twelve white-robed
figures instantly appeared through a Greater Teleportation Dao-seal,
then immediately joined into an enormous Ba-Serpent. The Ba-Serpent,
capable of shaking the Heavens and the Earth, opened its enormous,
bloody maw. The space around its mouth instantly became distorted, as
though it was devouring the very world itself. An unearthly, powerful
attractive power instantly locked onto Ning’s body. Although Ning
was a Fiendgod Body Refiner and immediately worked to resist…he was
completely unable to resist the devouring power. Not too long ago,
there was a Celestial Immortal Patriarch who had similarly been
unable to resist and who had been devoured by this Ba-Serpent, then
perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the distant Immortal
Fivecraze and Whitewater Hound watched…the enormous Ba-Serpent
devoured Ji Ning with a single bite!
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 18 - The Ba-Serpent and Ji Ning
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Ba-Serpent?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Fivecraze and
Uncle White were both shocked, especially Uncle White, who knew
exactly how powerful Ji Ning had become. And yet, even he had been
unable to resist that devouring force, and he had been swallowed by
the Ba-Serpent in one gulp!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning’s
Primaltwin was safe, they all knew that in terms of long-term
potential, the true body was far superior to the Primaltwin; after
all, the Primaltwin was merely a Ki Refiner, and so it was much
weaker comparatively.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a terrifying
Ba-Serpent!” The Scion of the Blood God, located within the cabin
of the small black warship, was able to see what was going on
outside. The heaven-shaking Ba-Serpent in particularly caused him to
feel completely stunned. “The power of this Ba-Serpent…its aura
is even more powerful than that of that old bastard Hunchmont. Why
has a force suddenly emerged to act against Ji Ning? Is this a force
that comes from outside the world of the Grand Xia?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Scion knew his own
limits; clearly, these twelve white-robed figures that had suddenly
appeared out of nowhere were far more powerful than him! That
Ba-Serpent alone…it was capable of suppressing Celestial Immortal
Patriarchs!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A peerless genius of
this generation, Ji Ning, has most likely just perished,” the Scion
murmured to himself. “Hmph. Hmph. It’s for the best. Now, I shall
let your master join with you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the Scion of the
Blood God began to charge towards the grand sealing formation. Within
the ‘body’ of the Ba-Serpent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. An incomparably
ferocious devouring force, one which Ning was completely unable to
fight back against, had drawn Ning into the giant bloody maw of the
serpent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After being
swallowed…the entire world turned dark. Ning just felt that he was
constantly sinking downwards…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Transform.” As he
began to sink, Ning immediately executed the [Three Heads, Six Arms]
divine ability. Six Immortal swords appeared within his hands as
well; they were the Thousandbull Sword, three of his Darknorth
swords, and two of the Wavebreaker Godshark Swords! This was
primarily because Ning no longer had other Immortal-ranked flying
swords on him; the Wavebreaker Godshark swords were top-grade
Heaven-ranked flying swords he had acquired from the Treasure Hall of
the underwater estate, and so they weren’t that much weaker than
low-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, Ji Ning, now
that you’ve entered the body of the Ba-Serpent, you are dead for
certain.” A wild laughter could suddenly be heard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, you are
dead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop struggling.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even Celestial
Immortals will perish in here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Voices rang out from
every direction. At the same time, quite close to Ning, a long awl
suddenly shot out from a meaty ‘wall’. The awl flashed with a
sinister light and moved lightning-fast. It even manifested the faint
illusion of an azure hornet as it stabbed towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of Ning’s six
arms which wielded a Darknorth sword knocked the awl flying away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immediately afterwards,
other types of magic treasures and secret arts attacks began to fly
towards Ning from every which way. Because Ning was within the body
of the Ba-Serpent, and the attacks were suddenly coming from the
fleshly ‘walls’ within the body as well as the bones of the
serpent, the attacks came from a very short distance, repeatedly
catching him off guard. This caused Ning to find things quite
difficult for now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waters of Heaven!”
Ning’s six swords struck out simultaneously, and illusions of water
streams began to appear, one after another. A large amount of water
began to swirl around Ning, causing the world around him to seem to
change into a world of water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This technique also
came from the ninth floor of the Divinities Palace, and it was also
created by a Daofather. This was a sword-art on par with the
[Heavenraker] - the [Waters of Heaven]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Heavenraker] was
well-suited for group attacks, and also against single-target foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Waters of Heaven] was
most suited for defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, I won’t be
able to block this way.” Ning found defense to be incredibly
difficult. As the saying went, two fists found it hard to fight
against many hands. Although Ning currently had six arms, he was
facing twelve opponents right now! The opponents each controlled many
magic treasures, and every single attack was quite fearsome. The fact
that the attacks were launched from such close range also made it so
that Ning had very little reaction time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems I’ll have
to rely on the Thousandbull Sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been wanting
to keep this supreme technique of the Thousandbull Sword hidden, so
as to suddenly annihilate all his enemies in a surprise attack.
However…these wild, chaotic attacks from his foes were already
enough to force him to unleash this attack, an attack which Ning’s
true body had only grown capable of unleashing after reaching the
late Void-level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Primordial
Nightriver…emerge!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Savagery filled Ning’s
eyes, and the pure, late Void-level elemental ki within his body
flowed into the Thousandbull Sword, completely activate the
formation-diagram within the sword! Instantly, the sound of waves
could be heard as an enormous, wide river suddenly appeared in the
area arounding him. When the river appeared, part of it manifested
within the body of the Ba-Serpent, while part of it manifested
outside of the body!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because the
entire Nightriver was fully ten thousand kilometers long!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Activating the
Nightriver effect required a very high amount of elemental ki…but
its might was similarly powerful to the extreme.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The waves of the river
bellowed forth, sweeping across the entire region. The twelve
white-robed members that made up squad ‘Earthnine’, hidden deep
within the body of the Ba-Serpent, were all shocked. As the waters of
the primordial river known as the Nightriver crushed upon them, and
as the river water outside the body of the Ba-Serpent ground down
upon it, their Ba-Serpent Formation began to creak and crack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t panic. This
is the power of a formation-diagram of an Immortal sword; it only has
the power to constrict and suppress. A single formation-diagram won’t
be able to do anything to the Ba-Serpent!” The leading white-haired
man immediately sent mentally to the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Scion of the Blood
God had been trapped within the formation. Although he could see the
distant Immortal Diancai and Whitewater Hound, he wasn’t able to
draw any closer to them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That whitewater
hound is merely using the Fuxi Staff Formation; how is it that his
formations are this powerful?! I’ve trained for hundreds of
thousands of years, and I have some insight into the art of
formations, but I haven’t been able to find a single flaw in this
formation at all.” The Scion of the Blood God was completely
stymied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment,
the sound of massive explosions could be heard from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Scion turned to
look in that direction. He could still see the giant Ba-Serpent in
the outside world; he was simply unable to fly over there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ba-Serpent?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A river?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Uncle White and
Immortal Fivecraze turned to look as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From afar, a three
kilometer Ba-Serpent had been completely swept up into an enormous,
awe-inspiring river that was more than ten thousand kilometers long.
The waters of the river were furiously churning around the body of
the Ba-Serpent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, the massive
river began to rapidly shrink, from ten thousand kilometers to a
hundred kilometers, then down to ten kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ten kilometer river
was now roughly comparable in size to the three kilometer Ba-Serpent.
The power of the river grew as it shrank, and it continued to coil
and churn around the Ba-Serpent. There was even water flowing in and
out of the Ba-Serpent’s body, nose, and mouth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">ROAR!!! The Ba-Serpent
raised its head, letting out a furious growl as it twisted and
turned, struggling to free itself. But the river didn’t budge in
the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Captain, the
pressure from the waters of the river is too great, and it has
covered every single part of the Ba-Serpent’s body. We’re using
up far too much elemental ki in maintaining this Ba-Serpent
Formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Captain, what should
we do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were beginning to
grow nervous. Normally speaking, once a foe entered the body of the
Ba-Serpent, there was no way the foe would be able to find the twelve
of them. They could attack as they pleased at a close distance from
the ‘flesh’ and ‘bones’ of the Ba-Serpent, with attacks that
would be very difficult to defend against. Thus, the enemies would
usually be quickly dominated and destroyed! However, despite being
trapped within the Ba-Serpent, this Ji Ning actually had a method to
deal with the entire creature at once!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A formation-diagram?
A formation-diagram?! Generally speaking, only Pure Yang treasures
have formation-diagrams. Even if this Ji Ning does have a Pure Yang
treasure…logically speaking, he has to be at the Celestial Immortal
level to use it. How could a formation-diagram have appeared?!” The
captain was puzzled and frantic as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nightriver Painting
of the past was something which required one to first draw the enemy
into painting before being able to use the river to suppress and
weaken the enemy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, after the
countless years of refining by the spirit of the underwater estate,
the Nightriver Painting had already become the formation-diagram of
the Thousandbull Sword. Once the formation-diagram was activated, the
Nightriver would instantly appear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was what made
formation-diagrams so special! And this was also the reason why the
Thousandbull Sword could be described as comparable to a Pure Yang
treasure!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ning
definitely has some sort of powerful treasure on him.
However…following that principle, once we kill him, that treasure
will become ours,” the captain sent mentally. “We must kill Ji
Ning at all costs. Activate the forbidden technique!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The forbidden
technique?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Captain, do we
really have to activate it?” These were Immortal cultivators, not
Deathsworn; they naturally felt a degree of self-interest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The captain shouted
mentally towards them, “This treasure is capable of allowing a
Void-level Earth Immortal to command the power of a
formation-diagram, which means that it is no less valuable than a
Pure Yang treasure in might! Ji Ning definitely has many treasures on
him; once we acquire them, then hmph…all of us will benefit from
it. Even if you suffer harm to your foundations, it will be worth it.
Don’t hesitate; the more time we waste, the more elemental ki we
will have wasted. If you continue to hesitate…don’t blame me for
being merciless!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine. Let’s do
this!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing their
captain’s threat, they no longer hesitated. They simultaneously
executed the forbidden technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ‘Ba-Serpent
Formation’ was an ancient, powerful formation which had been passed
down by the Bloodcloud Hall that required twelve Immortals to
execute. Aside from normal attacks, it also possessed three levels of
forbidden techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These three levels of
techniques were extremely complicated; given the insights into the
Dao which the members of squad ‘Earthnine’ possessed, only the
activation of the first level was possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, this first
level already possessed nigh-limitless power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twelve white-robed
men, hidden within the body of the Ba-Serpent, all used the same
forbidden technique simultaneously. The runic formations that had
been hovering in the air around them slowly began to turn a bloody
color, and additional blood-colored runes began to appear as well.
These bloody runes hung there in the air, and once the forbidden
technique was activated…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ba-Serpent Hell -
Godslayer!” The white-robed leader with the bloody scar let out a
low growl, his voice echoing within every part of the Ba-Serpent’s
body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the bloody light
and the bloody runes began to suddenly move about at high speed. They
flowed forth from those twelve locations within the Ba-Serpent,
moving towards the direction of the Ba-Serpent’s abdomen.
Immediately afterwards, within the dark abyss of the abdomen of the
Ba-Serpent, a region of blood suddenly appeared. The bloody light and
the bloody runes all swirled around each other within this region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s three-headed,
six-armed form was gripping a total of six mighty swords as he strove
to block the suddenly attacking magic treasures. “I have to come up
with a way to flee from the Ba-Serpent’s body. If I’m unable to
escape…I’ll be like fish meat on the chopping board.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? Why have the
attacks stopped?” Ning found out to his amazement that the weapons
and arts that had been attacking him had suddenly disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But suddenly
afterwards…the devouring force increased dramatically in power, and
with a swoosh, Ning once more sank downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Plonk. Ning fell
straight into a bloody lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a lake of
blood located within the abdomen of the Ba-Serpent. Above the lake of
blood were bloody runic symbols which hovered and shimmered. Upon
falling into the lake, Ning immediately struggled to try and fly out,
but the sucking power of the lake was simply too great. Ning was
firmly trapped within it, completely unable to escape. At the same
time…Ning could sense a powerful corrosive force begin to be
applied to every single part of his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Captain, is Ji Ning
dead?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This forbidden
technique, ‘Ba-Serpent Hell’, has very powerful corrosive
properties. Even ancient Void-level Fiendgods which are legendary for
how powerful their bodies are will be corroded and dissolved, then
perish. There’s no way this Ji Ning will be able to survive it.”

Chapter 19 - A Spatial Tear
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time…they were
ridiculously wrong!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By relying on this
technique, they could indeed corrode and melt away even a Void-level
fiendgod, and even ordinary Celestial Immortal Patriarchs would
perish to this technique. Unfortunately…the person trapped within
the Ba-Serpent Hell was Ji Ning. Ji Ning, who had reached the Third
Cycle of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]! Ji Ning’s flesh was
comparable to Immortal-ranked magic treasures. Although their
Ba-Serpent Hell technique was very corrosive, there was no way it
could corrode Immortal-ranked magic treasures!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t just let
myself remain trapped in here. I have to get out.” Ning executed
the [Heavenly Transformations], causing his body to expand
enormously. The bloody lake was now only able to reach Ning’s
kneecaps.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six Immortal swords in
his hands, Ning began to wildly and wantonly hack away at the
stomach-walls of the Ba-Serpent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang! Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ba-Serpent was
trembling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This guy didn’t
die yet?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could it be that
the Ba-Serpent Hell is unable to kill him?!” The twelve were all
stunned. They hurriedly sent out their divine senses to investigate,
and as they did, they discovered…that there was an enormous
three-headed, six-armed youth who was standing in the middle of the
bloody lake, whose fur-clad body was glowing with a hazy golden
light. The bloody lakewater was completely unable to harm him at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant was even
wildly hacking away at the stomach-walls of the Ba-Serpent, each
strike containing enormous power. Given that the surging waves of the
Nightriver filled every part of the Ba-Serpent, crushing down upon
it…the twelve white-robed figures were using up elemental ki at an
enormously fast rate in order to maintain the Ba-Serpent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This kid has trained
for less than a century; he’s merely a Void-level Earth Immortal.
How is it possible that he can withstand the Ba-Serpent Hell?” None
of them could believe it. This was something which they had executed
only after paying a heavy price, damaging their Goldlotus Primals.
They were confident that this would definitely succeed…but who
would’ve expected that the end result would be failure?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It must be that
golden light on his body! That golden light…it must be the aura of
a protective magic treasure. It’s precisely because of that magic
treasure that he’s able to resist the Ba-Serpent Hell!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. He’s
probably taken on a True Immortal or Empyrean God as his master; he
must’ve been given a protective treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That must be it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Protective treasures
won’t be able to be maintained for too long. After its energy is
used up, this Ji Ning shall die for certain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their level of
experience was limited, after all; although they knew some of the
powerful divine abilities of the Three Realms could allow one’s
body to become comparable to magic treasures, Ji Ning was only at the
fifteenth stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens].
They felt that even if Ning trained in protective divine abilities
such as the [Pentabolt Vajra], there was no way he could use them to
resist their Ba-Serpent Hell.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, they guessed that
it must be a protective treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A protective treasure
bestowed by a True Immortal or Empyrean God…upon being activated,
it could protect the bearer for a time, but once the energy and power
within it was used up, it would become useless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But we are only
going to be able to sustain the Ba-Serpent Hell via our forbidden
technique for the time needed to boil a kettle of tea.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If the power of Ji
Ning’s protective treasure is used up, then we’ll have won. But
if the Ba-Serpent Hell is dispersed first…are we supposed to use
the forbidden technique again?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Captain, what should
we do next?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The others were all
awaiting the captain’s order. None of them wanted to use the
forbidden technique again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciples with
backers and sects behind him are always difficult,” the white-robed
man muttered back mentally. “There’s nothing we can. Carry out
the backup plan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s do it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all immediately
acknowledged the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This ‘backup plan’
was to borrow strength from another party…but as a result, the
rewards they would get for killing Ji Ning would have to be divided
up as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
used the Fuxi Staff Formation to tremendously powerful effect. The
Ba-Serpent might be able to forcibly break through and threaten his
formations, but the leader of the Blood God Church, the Scion of the
Blood God, was hidden within that black warship; he wasn’t willing
to go all-out, and so he definitely wasn’t able to break open the
formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Uncle White and
Immortal Fivecraze watched the outside world with worry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">High in the air, a
giant river was twisting and coiling around an unfathomably powerful
Ba-Serpent. The Ba-Serpent was struggling and roaring with rage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break apart!” The
Ba-Serpent spoke out in the human tongue, then let out another
enraged roar as its tail struck out hard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Space itself was torn
apart, and on the other side a sea could vaguely be seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that this minor world was very close to the Grand Xia major world.
The entrance to the volcano was a stable corridor between worlds, but
some sufficiently powerful experts were absolutely capable of opening
a corridor through their own power. For example, Patriarch Arcanum
had done just that in ripping a tunnel into the world of the
Witchriver Immortal Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This strike by the
Ba-Serpent was absolutely comparable to a blow from Patriarch
Arcanum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. After ripping
apart the fabric of space…although the Ba-Serpent remained
entangled within the Nightriver, it charged into the spatial tear and
returned to the world of the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The minor world grew
quiet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are gone?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They disappeared?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Uncle White and
Immortal Fivecraze were all quite flabbergasted. They hadn’t
expected that the enemy would tear open the fabric of space and
depart from this minor world. They both looked with concern towards
the black-robed Ning, who was fairly close to them. It must be
understood that it was Ning’s true body that had just been taken
away! His true body was far more important than his Primaltwin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning,” Immortal
Fivecraze said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to worry
about me.” The black-robed Ning shook his head, then sat down in
the lotus position, quietly protecting his master, Immortal Diancai.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No matter what, he
absolutely wouldn’t permit anyone from disturbing his master’s
tribulation. His Primaltwin had to stay here and protect his master!
As for his true body…his true body had the underwater estate. If he
truly did encounter a life-threatening situation, he could go ahead
and hide into it, even though that meant revealing the existence of
the estate. After all, his true body was very important; only his
true body was capable of executing techniques such as the [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art] and the [Starseizing Hand].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The air above the
Darknorth Sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vast sea was
incomparably quiet. From far away, one could see a ship advancing
through the seas, a merchant vessel from a surrounding island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The air above the sea
split apart, and an enormous monstrosity came hurtling through the
spatial tear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was an enormous
serpent that was three thousand meters long. Its body was entangled
by a surging river which coiled around it like a rope.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s that?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good heavens!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Diremonster?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many mortals who
were aboard that merchant vessel, as well as a few ‘powerful’
Xiantian experts, all stared in stupefecation. However, with but a
single movement, that massive, three kilometer serpent disappeared
into the horizon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was able to
clearly sense what was going on outside, thanks to the Nightriver
which the Thousandbull Sword had created.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? We’re at the
world of the Grand Xia? And this should be the Darknorth Sea,” Ning
guessed to himself. At the same time, he continued to wildly brandish
his six swords, hacking and slashing at the stomach of the
Ba-Serpent. The Ba-Serpent trembled repeatedly as the elemental ki of
the twelve white-robed figures was used up at a rapid pace. They were
forced to take out some spirit-pills and swallow them to replenish
their energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. The Ba-Serpent
easily used a spatial teleportation, arriving at the air above a wide
mountain range located within the vast continent of the Grand Xia
Dynasty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A mountain range?
This is the place the Ba-Serpent’s spatial teleportation took it
to?” Ning mused to himself, still trapped within the Ba-Serpent’s
body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the
incomparably imposing waters of the Nightriver began to expand
wildly, from ten kilometers to its normal ten thousand kilometer
size! The endless amounts of river water instantly filled the
mountain range below. However, Ning remained quite careful; he didn’t
wish to let the waters of the Nightriver harm any mortals by
accident. He mainly wanted to test the surrounding environment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formations!” Ning
was shocked by what he discovered. A fog had instantly appeared
within the great mountain range, completely ensconcing the Nightriver
within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good. We’re
trapped within a formation. My ten thousand kilometer Nightriver is
only able to test a small portion of this formation; clearly, this is
an absolutely enormous formation. It seems this mountain range must
be a secret base.” Ning realized that this must be a place like his
own homeland, Swallow Mountain, which was now protected by layers of
grand formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Powers such as the
Skysplitter Sword Sect, for example, all had many great formations
protecting their headquarters. It was the same principle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The mountain range
which this Ba-Serpent had descended into was assuredly a similarly
dangerous place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Grand Xia Dynasty.
Flamedoor Commandery. The Eastwoods mountain range.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eastwoods mountain
range was the location of a sect known as the Eastwoods Sect!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“General.” The
leader of the Eastwoods Sect spoke with incomparable respect. “A
Ba-Serpent has suddenly appeared within the Eastwoods mountain range,
and around it is a river that is ten thousand kilometers long. It is
extremely powerful. Are these the people from Bloodcloud Hall which
you previously mentioned, general?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the front of the
hall was seated a tall, muscular, handsome, silver-armored youth. The
silver-armored youth’s aura was very powerful, at the Celestial
Immortal level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems those
useless pieces of crap at Bloodcloud Hall were unable to kill Ji
Ning, so they brought him here to my place,” the silver-armored
youth laughed disdainfully. “They weren’t even able to kill a kid
like Ji Ning, who has trained for less than a century. How
embarrassing! Mm…sect leader of the Eastwoods Sect, this is your
territory. You go ahead and control the grand formation to help the
Ba-Serpent and deal with Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sect leader of the
Eastwoods Sect said respectfully, “Yes, General.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his heart, however,
he was sighing. He was the sect leader of a supreme sect, but over
the course of a single night thirty years ago, the entire Eastwoods
Sect had become completely ‘brainwashed’. Even he himself was
sealed with a Reincarnation Seal and forced to become an obedient
servant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big Han,” the
silver-armored youth suddenly called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A shadow materialized
within the darkness; it was a a man with sideburns. He said with
tremendous respect, “Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored
youth said, “Bloodcloud Hall sent people to assassinate Ji Ning.
They agreed with me before doing so that if they were unable to do
anything to Ji Ning, that they would come here to the Eastwoods
mountain range…and just a short while ago, the forces of Bloodcloud
Hall used their ‘Ba-Serpent Formation’ to bring Ji Ning here.
Accompany the sect leader of the Eastwoods Sect; when the time comes,
you can act to help.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” the
sideburned middle-aged man said with respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. I’m going to
go take a look in the ‘forbidden area’. If there’s nothing
critical, don’t bother me,” the silver-armored youth instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” the
sideburned man repeated once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The leader of the
Eastwoods Sect assented as well, but in his heart he felt puzzled.
Ever since this mysterious power had descended thirty-plus years ago
and took over the entire Eastwoods Sect, they had first set down
increasingly, terrifyingly powerful formations around the mountains,
then had designated one particular region within it as a ‘forbidden
region’. The original members of the Eastwoods Sect were completely
forbidden from entering the region; if they did, they would
definitely die!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only the silver-armored
general and his subordinates were able to enter that place. As for
what was within it? Not even the leader of the Eastwoods Sect knew.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flows of the
distant Nightriver were still furiously smashing downwards, crushing
some nearby mountains and shattering giant trees. The Ba-Serpent
continued to struggle to escape from the confines of the Nightriver.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come with me, leader
of the Eastwoods Sect.” The face of the sideburned man changed, and
he let out a sharp bark as he led the leader of the Eastwoods Sect
away to go help the forces of Bloodcloud Hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored
general stared towards the distance, then shook his head. “This Ji
Ning is actually this hard to kill…he truly lives up to his
reputation as the champion of the Conclave of Immortal Destiny.” He
took a single step forward, then vanished. He was going to the
forbidden region.

Chapter 20 - Trapped
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sideburned man and
the leader of the Eastwoods Sect moved as fast as lightning. They
soon arrived at the place where the Ba-Serpent was located.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sideburned man
sighed in amazement at what he saw. The massive, ten thousand
kilometer river seemed to be like a living creature. It struck out
with wanton abandon; how could the local mountain peaks, gorges, and
trees possibly withstand its strikes? They were all instantly
shattered and broken apart. As for the Ba-Serpent that was trapped
within the massive river, it appeared to be even less restrained;
clearly, the river was only able to somewhat bind its power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Earthnine, do you
need my help?” The sideburned man called out loudly. Filled with
elemental ki, his voice echoed within the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Activate the
formation. Don’t let Ji Ning escape,” the massive Ba-Serpent
roared furiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry!”
The sideburned man chortled merrily, then glanced sideways at the
leader of the Eastwoods Sect. “No problem handling a small request
like this, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rest your mind,
milord,” the leader of the Eastwood Sect said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Ba-Serpent
suddenly opened its giant bloody maw. Rumble…a human-shaped figure
was suddenly spat out from within it. It was a three-headed,
six-armed youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning did a
somersault in midair, then stood there in the sky, six swords in his
six arms. Laughing loudly, he said, “It seems this is all you are
capable of. Earlier, you were bragging about how even Celestial
Immortal Patriarchs would die when trapped…but didn’t I come out
in perfectly fine shape?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as he came out,
Ning noticed the formations in the surrounding area. Formations were
everywhere, making it difficult for even his divine sense to search
the area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Torch-Dragon’s
Eye].” Ning’s eyes began to glow with torch-light. He stared at
the surrounding area, only to discover that he could still only see
to a distance of a thousand kilometers. This was because of the fog
in the area blocking much of the light; even the [Torch-Dragon’s
Eye] was only able to penetrate to a certain extent through the fog.
If he didn’t have this divine ability…he’d probably only be
able to see to a distance of one kilometer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ba-Serpent hung in
the air in the distance, its golden eyes focused on Ning. It spoke in
the human tongue: “Ji Ning, today you shall most certainly die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You shouldn’t talk
so big,” Ning smirked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are trapped
within our formations; are you going to be able to escape?” The
Ba-Serpent growled, “Even if you have a Greater Teleportation
Dao-seal…once we join forces, you can forget about teleporting
away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there in
midair, pondering. Dao-seals and magic treasures weren’t absolutely
failproof. Lesser Teleportation Dao-seals were precious protective
treasures for Xiantian lifeforms and Zifu Disciples, but if combat
caused the surrounding space to be disturbed or locked when one
attempted to use them, then there would be no way the Lesser
Teleportation Dao-seals could be activated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The same principle
applied to Greater Teleportation Dao-seals as well; they, too, had
their limits!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Greater Teleportation
Dao-seals were indeed powerful, and they even allowed one to teleport
from one world to another. However…the process of actually
activating the Dao-seal and releasing the power within it involved
the person merging with space itself. If one suffered an extremely
powerful attack that disrupted the energy of the Dao-seal, then the
Greater Teleportation would be disrupted and unable to complete!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Dao-seal could ignore
a weak disruption attempt, such as those from ordinary Primal Daoists
or Loose Immortals. Thus, for Primal Daoists and Void-level Earth
Immortals and Loose Immortals, these Greater Teleportation Dao-seals
were extremely valuable protective treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But a powerful
disruption attempt would render Greater Teleportation impossible. At
the Celestial Immortal level, their attacks were more than enough to
disrupt the energy of a Greater Teleportation Dao-seal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for True Immortals
and Empyrean Gods, they were able to completely disintegrate a
Greater Teleportation Dao-seal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofathers? Such seals
were nothing more than a joke in the face of a Daofather’s might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning had been
within the Ba-Serpent, he had been suffering attacks nonstop. And the
attacks of these foes were all at the Celestial Immortal level! They
were more than enough to disrupt a Greater Teleportation Dao-seal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If they push me too
far, I’ll just go hide inside my Immortal estate. Although the
defensive power of the mobile one I carry with me isn’t that
strong, it’s still enough to withstand their attacks for a brief
moment. That will be more than enough for me to use a Greater
Teleportation Dao-seal to escape! However…that’s as good as
throwing away my mobile Immortal estate.” Ning felt his heart ache.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This Immortal estate
had been given to him as a gift by the giant yellow bear! It was used
to hide his underwater estate. In terms of price, it was on a
slightly higher level than even the Goldlight Immortal Estate which
he had given his cousin. It was most likely worth five million
kilograms of liquefied elemental essence or more!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In order to flee, Ning
would have to sacrifice both a Greater Teleportation Dao-seal and his
mobile estate. Unless absolutely necessary, he wouldn’t choose to
do this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old Han, why haven’t
you activated the formation to attack Ji Ning yet?” The Ba-Serpent
roared angrily. “He has a protective treasure on him, but after its
energy is used up…I want to see how much longer he’ll be able to
hold on after that!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, fine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Big Han, who had been
watching from afar, laughed and assented. He instructed the nearby
Eastwoods sect leader, “Go ahead. Bring out everything you have;
broaden the horizons of those useless pieces of crap from Bloodcloud
Hall.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” the
Eastwoods sect leader said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This mountain range was
the headquarters of the Eastwoods Sect; it naturally was protected by
many layers of powerful formations. As the sect leader, he was
capable of actively unleashing their power! However, he didn’t know
anything about the even more powerful formations which the
silver-armored general, that Celestial Immortal, had laid down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking, the
original formations of the Eastwoods Sect were more than enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Divine Ashfire!”
The Eastwoods sect leader immediately brought out one of the most
powerful techniques of his sect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a grand
formation that was tens of thousands of kilometers in size began to
activate the natural energy of the world. A large amount of fire
elemental energy began to gather, circulating through the formation
and becoming transformed in midair to dull red tendrils of flame that
seemed ready to go out at any moment. The dull red tendrils of flame
began to appear everywhere, quickly forming an enormous firebird.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three hundred meter
tall dull red firebird flew straight towards Ning. “Roaaaar!” The
Ba-Serpent charged once more towards Ning as well, howling madly. The
power of its tail was quite astonishing, and multiple Immortal-ranked
magic treasures came flying out as well as some powerful techniques,
all of which were aimed towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, the power
of this Divine Ashfire is quite formidable; not even Celestial
Immortals dare to take it head-on. Even if you have a protective
treasure on you…how long will you be able to hold on for? After its
energy is used up, you will die.” The Ba-Serpent continued to
attack while spitting out words in the human tongue, seeking to
disturb Ning’s concentration.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bring everything you
have. Do you think this ‘Divine Ashfire’ will be able to do
anything to me?” Ning stood there in midair, not caring at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the dull red
firebird drew near, a large amount of fire quickly swept forward to
envelop Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Divine Ashfire
technique was mainly dangerous for Ki Refiners. It might pose a
threat to some Fiendgods that had weak defenses, and might be able to
burn apart Earth-ranked magic treasures…but upon encountering
Heaven-ranked magic treasures, it would begin to find breaking
through to be onerous. At most, it would be able to damage an
ordinary low-grade Heaven-ranked magic treasure. As for higher
quality Heaven-ranked treasures, they were able to ignore the power
of the Ashfire. As for a Fiendgod Body Refiner like Ning?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” Ning
laughed, his body once more emanating with that hazy golden light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Ning was
intentionally releasing that golden light from his body. He wanted
the foe to think that he had some sort of protective treasure on him,
so as to conceal the fact that he had trained in the [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art]. Although it would definitely be revealed at some point
as they continued to fight…if the enemy was to misjudge his true
strength, then he would have an opportunity to take advantage of that
and perhaps wipe them out at one go!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Divine Ashfire
blazed against him, and the massive Ba-Serpent struck at him
repeatedly. Multiple Immortal-ranked magic treasures came crashing
down upon him with the weight of mountains, and techniques in the
shape of dragonsnakes, massive trees, and more also came hammering
towards him. There was even skyfire and other techniques aimed his
way! All of these attacks came flying towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning caused the waters
of the Nightriver to billow in every direction, suppressing and
slowing down everything. At the same time, he sent his sword-light
flying everywhere, knocking aside each attacking treasure in a truly
valiant manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Strange.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve nearly
exhausted my elemental ki twice, and I’ve eaten quite a few
spirit-pills. How is this Ji Ning still able to hold on?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is it that he’s
been able to keep his protective treasure active this entire time?
The energy of protective treasures generally come from True Immortals
or Empyrean Gods filling the treasure with their own power; once the
power is gone, the treasure is useless. How is it able to hold on for
so long?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Big Han, watching the
battle from far away, began to frown. “I believe your Eastwoods
Sect has a ‘Seven Supreme Thunders’ formation, yes? Hurry up and
activate it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eastwoods sect
leader hurriedly said, “Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a dark cloud
appeared in the skies above the grand formation. Lightning appeared
within the dark clouds, and bolts of lightning came hammering down,
all striking towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, these
lightning bolts aren’t even enough to tickle me.” The
three-headed, six-armed Ning stood there in midair, the waters of the
mighty Nightriver surrounding him, the dull red flames blazing
against him, bolts of lightning crashing down up him, the Ba-Serpent
striking at him, and magic treasures swirling around him…but like
Lord Buddha himself, Ning just stood there, his entire body glowing
with golden light. His sword-light flashed everywhere, easily
deflecting all of the oncoming attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing this, Big Han
frowned. “This is trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that all you
have? Aren’t you guys always quite cocky in front of us, in front
of Bloodcloud Hall? Why is it that you are completely useless right
now?” The distant Ba-Serpent, growing frustrated, shouted angrily
in the human tongue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Big Han
gritted his teeth, then waved his arm. A strange golem appeared next
to him, a golem that looked like a cat. Its body was feline, but it
had three tails and just a single eye. This golem had a total of four
legs, was thirty meters long, and there was actually an opening on
its back. The sideburned ‘Big Han’ flew straight into the golem,
and then with a clanking sound, the opening on the back became
completely sealed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This construct was
similar to a ship, but it could be used to attack as well as defense.
It was an incomparably precious golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I refuse to believe
a little brat that’s trained for less than a century can really be
this tough.” The ‘Threetailed Thundergod’ construct let out a
furious roar, then transformed into a streak of lightning that flew
straight towards the distant Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning noticed the jagged
bolt of lightning that was flying towards him from afar. His eyes
were filled with blazing torch-light, and he instantly could tell
that this was a strange construct of some sort. “It seems quite
powerful; a construct of such power is rarely seen even in the
Black-White College. I didn’t expect to encounter such a formidable
construct in a place like this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still…although
it’s powerful, it’s not a match for me.” To ‘greet’ this
new opponent, Ning used the most powerful of his six swords, the
Thousandbull Sword, to ‘welcome’ it to the fray.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” The
Threetailed Thundergod construct slashed out with its sharp claws,
its blow seeming to carry enormous power. Its knife-sharp claws moved
lightning-fast as he clawed towards Ning. Where the claws passed,
space itself split apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A streak of sword-light
in the shape of a divine black dragon howled forth to meet the sharp
claws.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Threetailed
Thundergod was knocked flying backwards. Only a few moments later did
he manage to come to a halt. Then, with an enraged roar, it once more
charged forward to attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No matter how wildly
they all attacked, and despite the fact that Ning had only six arms
to counter their tens of hands, resulting in an occasional attack
striking him…his Fiendgod body, covered by that blurry golden
light, was able to easily withstand all assaults without being
damaged in the slightest. This caused the enemies to feel that Ning’s
protective treasure was truly something remarkable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big Han, stop
fighting so madly. This Ji Ning has plenty of tricks up his sleeve;
there’s nothing we can do to him at all. Hurry up and find your
master! Let him come up with a solution. If even if he has nothing,
then Bloodcloud Hall will be forced to resort to our final option,
regardless of whether or not it succeeds,” the scarred white-robed
leader within the Ba-Serpent sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine. I’ll notify
my master,” Big Han immediately sent back.
</P>

Chapter 21 - The Cauldron of Divine Venomflame of the Nine Heavens
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, protected by
the Nightriver, was being attacked from every corner. But suddenly,
the ‘Threetailed Thundergod’ construct turned tail and flew away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want to go?”
Ning’s eyes blazed with torch-light. He immediately executed the
[Obscuring Wind of the Nine Heavens] divine ability. Although he had
acquired it just recently, it was a technique-focused divine ability.
In addition, Ning had already thoroughly mastered the Windwing
Evasion, and thus he was quick to master part of the mysteries of
this [Obscuring Wind of the Nine Heavens] technique. It could be said
that he had gained a basic level of skill in it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When this divine
ability was executed, a wild wind began to howl around Ning as he
chased after the construct.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Construct, you want
to leave?” The six Immortal swords in Ning’s hands repeatedly
hacked down towards the fleeing construct.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One ray of sword-light
after another came crashing down upon the body of the construct.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The construct was
slammed into the ground, and a spiderweb of cracks appeared in the
ground beneath it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Earthnine, you
useless pieces of crap, hurry up and help me stop Ji Ning. If you
don’t stop him, I won’t be able to leave. How the hell am I
supposed to inform Master?” Big Han sent a frantic mental message
while muttering to himself, “This Ji Ning is way too fast. I was
quite some distance away from him, but he was able to catch up in a
flash.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Squad Earthnine was
also shocked by Ning’s speed. Still, they immediately moved to
help. The enormous body of the Ba-Serpent came slithering over,
coiling around Ning as multiple magic treasures began to assault him
as well. As it did, the Ba-Serpent roared back, “You’re the
useless piece of crap! Do you think it’s easy to deal with this Ji
Ning? It’s not that we are weak, it’s that he’s too much of a
monster. I have no idea what sort of treasure is generating that
golden light, but no matter how we attack him, we aren’t able to do
anything to him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Big Han seized this
moment to hurry and flee. In truth, he knew that squad Earthnine
wasn’t to blame; he had used his construct to launch attacks
earlier, and he knew that Ji Ning truly was a monster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was like a rock, a
hard bone that wouldn’t break or crack. What was one supposed to do
to him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After fleeing far away,
Big Han was able to escape the field of battle, thanks to the
obscuring fog in the area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Milord.” The
leader of the Eastwoods sect came to greet him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going to go
see the general. You watch here. Don’t let Ji Ning escape,” Big
Han instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright,” the
Eastwoods sect leader said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Big Han quickly
departed, and the Eastwoods sect leader watched as Big Han
disappeared into the distance. Only after he was gone did the sect
leader mumble to himself, “So what if I don’t let him leave? None
of you were able to do anything to him when attacking him.” He then
lifted his head to once more stare at the besieged, three-headed,
six-armed Ning. He couldn’t help but feel admiration for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a monster who
had shocked the world more than thirty years ago, seizing the
championship of the Conclave of Immortal Destiny. And now…he was
truly formidable. Even squad Earthnine of Bloodcloud Hall was unable
to harm him in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eastwoods mountain
range. The forbidden area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a dark palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored
youth was seated in the host’s position, sampling fine wine. Before
him was seated a red-robed elder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m almost out of
patience. Qu Huan, you truly have disappointed me greatly,” the
silver-armored youth said, a beastskull goblet of wine in hand. He
stared at the wind as he said these words calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“General, don’t be
impatient. Don’t be impatient,” the red-robed elder said
hurriedly with an ingratiating smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not impatient,
but the Master is!” The silver-armored youth said coldly, then
raised his head to glance sideways at the red-robed elder. “You
should know very well how important your mission is. You’ve spent
more than ten years on it…how much longer before you complete it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-robed elder
said hurriedly, “We’re already doing everything we can. If you
send some more people to help us out, General, we might be able to go
a bit faster.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“More people?” The
silver-armored youth shook his head. “Everyone is tight on
personnel right now. The other generals all have their own
assignments to carry out as well; where am I supposed to go find more
people? The Master has already begun to push me. I’ll give you
three more years. If you aren’t able to finish within three years…I
won’t kill you myself, but you need to make your preparations for
reincarnation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-robed elder was
filled with worry. He hurriedly said, “It’s not enough. How can
three years be enough? Given the number of people we have…we will
need at least five years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You must finish
within three years. If you do not…” The silver-armored youth
waved his hand. “Hurry up and beat it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The
red-robed elder gritted his teeth. “Your subordinate shall
definitely do everything possible to finish within three years.” He
then left obediently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The palace hall once
more turned quiet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored
youth drank some more wine, then shook his head helplessly. “Ever
since I came to this major world of the Grand Xia, I’ve been living
the life of a mouse. I’m always hiding. How irritating! I wonder
when the battle will come. After taking over this major world, I’ll
be able to live a carefree life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, Master.” A
voice shouted from outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored
youth frowned, then barked, “Have you no sense of propriety? Stop
screaming and kicking up a fuss.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Big Han
came in, then hurriedly smiled, “Sorry, I was panicking.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” The
silver-armored youth said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I went along with
the Eastwoods sect leader to help out, and we used the protective
formations the Eastwoods Sect has. I even personally intervened, but
we weren’t able to do anything to that Ji Ning,” Big Han said
hurriedly. “Squad Earthnine have no other options left. They are
asking for your help, Master. If you are helpless as well, then
they’ll prepare for their ‘final option’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Final option?” The
silver-armored youth snickered, “Those useless pieces of crap from
Bloodcloud Hall. Whenever they fail in their assassination attempt,
they’ll use that so-called ‘final option’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But that option has
killed quite a few Celestial Immortals,” Big Han couldn’t help
but say.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those Celestial
Immortals died due to stupidity!” The silver-armored youth shook
his head. “No matter what…squad Earthnine of Bloodcloud Hall has
always been on quite good terms with me. I’ll give them a hand. Go
and summon nine of my Fiendguards and prepare to use the Divine
Venomflame of the Nine Heavens Cauldron. If they can kill Ji Ning,
that will naturally be a joyous affair, but if even this technique
fails to kill him…then have squad Earthnine come up with another
method. If they want to use their so-called ‘final option’,
that’s up to them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright,” Big Han
said in a low voice, “But Master, aren’t you going to fight?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Me? Fight? Do you
think it was easy for me to make it past all the tribulations and
calamities, eventually becoming a Celestial Immortal? If a Celestial
Immortal wants to stay alive for a long period of time, he needs to
have a bit of judgment. He needs to clearly understand when to act
and when not to act.” The silver-armored youth snickered, “This
Ji Ning might have a True Immortal or Empyrean God behind him, or
perhaps even a Daofather! If I were to personally intervene, what if
the power behind Ji Ning were to come out and instantly crushing me
to death. Wouldn’t that be a shame?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now, of course, if I
was given a good enough offer, I might be willing to risk it…but
this mission only involves three piddling top-grade Immortal-ranked
magic treasures. The main Bloodcloud Hall office is keeping one of
them, while squad Earthnine is taking part as well. How much can
there be for me? They want me to take on such risks for just a tiny
reward?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored
youth shook his head disdainfully. “Big Han, you and the rest of
the old brothers who accompanied me to the world of the Grand Xia for
the purpose of enjoying ourselves. Naturally, when we need to fight,
we shall…but we need to always consider whether it is worth it or
not. As for this assassination mission of Bloodcloud Hall? Its
success, its failure…what the hell does it have to do with us?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, right,
right.” Big Han hurriedly said, “Master, you are wise.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Divine
Venomflame of the Nine Heavens Cauldron is the most powerful killing
formation which has been set down here at the Eastwoods mountain
range. Even amongst Celestial Immortals, only extremely powerful ones
can withstand it. The vast majority will be annihilated in one blow,”
the silver-armored youth said. “I’m giving them face by having
nine of my Fiendguards activate this killing formation. Alright,
hurry up and go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, yes, yes.”
Big Han hurriedly left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored
youth immediately stood up and walked outside of the palace hall.
Soon, Big Han came back leading nine plainly dressed bronze-armored
Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“General,” the nine
Fiendguards said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big Han has told you
everything, yes? Hurry up and go control the formation to kill Ji
Ning,” the silver-armored youth instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, General.” The
nine Fiendguards assented respectfully, then quickly departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, let’s go
take a look as well. I want to see if this peerless genius of the
Grand Xia world is able to survive within this grand formation of
mine, or if he will be burnt to ash.” The silver-armored youth
leisurely walked out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were three
figures atop a mountain peak. They were the silver-armored youth, big
Han, and a black-robed youngster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciple, you came
with me, your master, to the world of the Grand Xia,” the
silver-armored youth said with a laugh. “Today, Master is going to
give you the chance to see…the person known as the number one
peerless genius of the world of the Grand Xia. He’s trained for
less than a century, roughly the same as you, but he is far more
famous than you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-haired
youngster said confidently, “How strong can he be?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ll know soon
enough,” the silver-armored youth said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A figure suddenly flew
over. It was the Eastwoods sect leader. He said respectfully, “I
greet you, General.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disperse the fog,”
the silver-armored youth said with a laugh. “Let my disciple have a
chance to see how powerful this Ji Ning is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The sect
leader immediately obeyed the order. Instantly, the distant fog began
to dissipate, allowing everything to become clearly visible. Even
here, at the distant mountain peak, one could see an enormous
three-headed, six-armed giant battling in the distance against the
even more massive Ba-Serpent, as well as the surging waters of the
Nightriver.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored
youth laughed. “Disciple, what do you think?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed
youngster stared intently into the distance. He could sense the
terrifying power of the Ba-Serpent, capable of shaking the world
itself, as well as the power of those many Immortal-ranked magic
treasures. However…the three-headed, six-armed giant youth was able
to block all of these attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So powerful.” The
black-robed youngster was somewhat stunned. “He…can it be that he
is already a Celestial Immortal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although he is not a
Celestial Immortal, he has a Celestial Immortal’s power,” the
silver-armored youth said with a sigh. “At the Wanxiang level or
the Primal level, fighting someone of a higher level is fairly
common…but the difference between a Void-level Earth Immortal and a
Celestial Immortal is absolutely enormous. For him to still be able
to fight those at a higher level, despite being an Earth Immortal…is
something that is truly rare. More importantly, this Ji Ning has
trained for less than a century. Disciple…do you see the
difference, now?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed
youngster gnawed at his lips as he watched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…suddenly, a
mountain peak began to levitate into the skies at the southeastern
horizons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…suddenly, a
second mountain peak began to levitate into the skies of the
northwestern horizons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One mountain after
another began to levitate into the air. Fortunately, thanks to the
grand formation protecting the entire Eastwoods mountain range, those
who were outside the mountain range were completely unable to see
this. They had no idea how vicious the battle within the mountains
had grown.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, a total of nine
mountain peaks were hovering in the air, spread out in every
direction. Each mountain peak was covered with swirling, fiery red
runes, causing the aura of power emanating from the mountains to
slowly grow more and more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This invisible aura
quickly encompassed nearly the entire Eastwoods mountain range.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because this
was the most powerful killing formation available to the Eastwoods
Sect, capable of attacking any place within the mountain ranges. Even
this mountain peak, where the black-robed youngster and the
silver-armored youth were located, could be assaulted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, this killing
formation…” The black-robed youngster’s face changed as he
sensed the threat from this formation. “This formation is going to
be used against Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The aura from the
formation alone was enough to cause the black-robed youngster to feel
fear in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew exactly how
powerful this killing formation was. Just a tiny portion of it was
enough to annihilate him.

Chapter 22 - The Curtain Call?
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning stood there in
midair, commanding the flows of his Nightriver.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s face
suddenly changed. He saw mountain peaks begin to levitate into the
air in every direction. A total of nine mountains levitated upwards,
each one covered with colossal, fiery red runes. Ning’s pupils
contracted as he stared at them. “Using mountain peaks as
formation-foundations…refining entire mountains into magic
treasures…then joining them together into a formation?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wasn’t
completely ignorant of formations. He understood them, and he knew
that given how much effort had gone into this formation, this one was
definitely an absolutely top-notch formation. Perhaps it was slightly
weaker than the supremely ferocious killing formations of Swallow
Mountain, but it was still most likely capable of threatening the
lives of Celestial Immortals. As to exactly how strong it was…he
would only know when he personally experienced it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where did these
assassins come from, for them to possess such powerful tools?” Ning
still had no idea who exactly was trying to kill him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had some suspicions,
but he wasn’t completely confident.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine levitating
mountains that lined the horizons were suddenly connected by a streak
of runic light. It was as though chain links were joining the
mountain peaks together. Soon, the countless fiery runes began to
flow together into a cycle, causing the nine mountain peaks to join
together into one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ba-Serpent, which
had been battling against Ning this entire time, suddenly retreated
and attempted to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want to leave?”
Ning, who had been battling in close combat against the Ba-Serpent
for quite some time now, immediately let out a loud roar. “If I’m
going to be attacked by this formation, then you can forget about
leaving!” Ning immediately used the [Obscuring Wind of the Nine
Heavens], moving at a much faster speed and instantly catching up to
the Ba-Serpent. Ning immediately transformed into a three hundred
meter tall giant, then plopped his butt down directly down onto the
body of Ba-Serpent while grabbing onto its body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No matter how the
Ba-Serpent tried to struggle, and no matter how it tried to swing its
tail, Ning kept a firm lock on it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If this grand
formation is going to attack me, then I insist on us getting a taste
of it together.” Ning roared loudly with arrogant laughter, his
hair wild and unbound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is
troublesome.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Captain, this Ji
Ning is too fast; the Ba-Serpent isn’t able to shake him off. He’s
now seated firmly atop the Ba-Serpent’s body. When the formation
attacks, we’ll probably be hit as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This killing
formation the Eastwoods Sect is using is the ‘Divine Venomflame of
the Nine Heavens Cauldron’; there’s no way we can withstand
that.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t panic. The
general won’t act recklessly; he’ll definitely perfectly control
the Cauldron and focus its power on Ji Ning. Just a small amount
might end up hitting the Ba-Serpent,” the captain sent back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as the members of
Bloodcloud Hall were chatting amongst themselves, a vortex of flame
began to appear in the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This flame was composed
of two different colors. The flames were jade-green in color, but at
the center was a violet flame!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…the flames
continuously swirled, and the more they swirled, the more enormous
they became. Soon, they reached the maximum size that could be
supported by this formation, having become an enormous,
mountain-sized conflagration. Crackling sounds could be heard within
this conflagration; the sound came from the violet flames in the
center, where flashing lightning could be seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning rode atop the
Ba-Serpent, controlling the river while doing so. He raised his head.
“So it is the Divine Venomflame of the Nine Heavens…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was of the Mount
Innerheart League, after all; after having spent so much time on the
mountain, he had naturally reviewed all of the publicly available
‘common knowledge’. He knew what the Divine Venomflame of the
Nine Heavens was…it was a type of fire that was on the level of
‘truefire’ in terms of power. However…because it was too evil
and chaotic, mixing too many different types of energy, there was no
way an Immortal could nurture and cultivate this sort of fire within
the body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The mountain-sized
conflagration began to crash downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ba-Serpent
struggled frantically, but Ning rode atop the Ba-Serpent’s back,
not letting it escape at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flames of the
conflagration completely enveloped Ning. However, the flames were
extremely agile; under the control of the nine Fiendguards, they only
surrounded Ning, allowing the Ba-Serpent to escape virtually
unscathed. But of course, Ning was striving against the Ba-Serpent,
trying to pull it into contact with the flames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, this Divine
Venomflame of the Nine Heavens is quite hot, quite scorching. It
feels just like taking a nice, warm bath in hot water.” Ning,
bathed in flames, looked just like a Fiendgod. Roaring with laughter,
the Ba-Serpent still in his clutches, he said, “Come, come, come,
let’s bathe together!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But, but…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both the forces of
Bloodcloud Hall and the silver-armored general were all completely
stupefied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored
general was truly stunned. “He is actually using his body to resist
it…he didn’t dodge or hide into his Immortal estate?” He had
thought that Ning would hide within his Immortal estate; upon Ning
doing so, Bloodcloud Hall’s forces would instantly tear apart
space, immediately delivering it to a rather ‘dangerous location’.
Within the Three Realms, there were naturally some extremely
terrifying places; thus, after hiding into a mobile Immortal estate,
one had to immediately use a Greater Teleportation Dao-seal.
Otherwise, once one was shoved into one of the danger zones of the
Three Realms, one would almost assuredly perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not even the Divine
Venomflame of the Nine Heavens can harm him?” The nearby
black-robed youngster was stunned as well. “How can this be? That’s
the Divine Venomflame of the Nine Heavens!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why can’t it be?”
The silver-armored youth said in a low voice, “Don’t you see it
happening before your very eyes?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Big Han and
the Eastwoods sect leader were both similarly stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eastwoods sect
leader gave an envious glance towards Ji Ning, who appeared like one
of the invincible Fiendgods of legend. To him, both the Ba-Serpent
and the terrifying Venomflame both seemed like naught but toys; they
weren’t able to do anything to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is it a protective
treasure? Or a protective divine ability?” The silver-armored youth
stared into the flames, towards Ning, who was covered by faint golden
light. “It is almost inconceivable for a protective item to be able
to last for this long…but then again, perhaps a Daofather has given
him a particularly unique treasure. But if he’s using a divine
ability…I imagine the only possibility is the legendary [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If it’s the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art]…the implications are terrifying. Only very,
very few True Gods and Daofathers of the Three Realms possess it…and
they will generally only transmit it to their personal disciples.”
The silver-armored youth was secretly rather shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Three
Realms, the True Gods and Daofathers were all scattered into various
regions where they ruled like local hegemons. But even amongst their
ranks, only very, very few were in possession of the [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art]. The vast majority of True Gods and Daofathers, such as
Grand Emperor Xuanwu or Daofather Crimsonbright, simply didn’t have
the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], much less teach it to disciples. Thus,
very few individuals in the Three Realms were in possession of this
divine ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only a personal
disciple of a supreme Daofather could possibly possess this divine
ability!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if it is ‘just’
a protective treasure…someone capable of giving away a marvelous
treasure such as this must have a terrifyingly great background,”
the silver-armored youth mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fiendguards, since
you are unable to injure Ji Ning, then go ahead and disperse the
Venomflame!” The silver-armored youth immediately sent the mental
order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The nine
Fiendguards instantly assented to the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right away, the nine
mountains that were hovering in the skies began to call back their
runes as they began to sink downwards to their original location.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Earthnine,” the
silver-armored youth sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“General,”
Earthnine sent back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even this killing
formation of mine is unable to do anything to Ji Ning. I’m giving
up. As to whatever Bloodcloud Hall plans to do, I can’t be bothered
to interfere,” the silver-armored youth sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Earthnine immediately
sent back, “Understood. This mission is nowhere close to being
worth a mere three top-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasures. Even
ten wouldn’t be enough. I won’t bother you with this matter
anymore, General. I have no other choices left, just the final
option.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The
silver-armored youth assented.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning rode atop the body
of the Ba-Serpent, watching as the Divine Venomflames of the Nine
Heavens dissipated. He couldn’t help but laugh; he knew long ago
how powerful the flames were, and knew that his physical body was
absolutely capable of ignoring those flames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tell me, who are you
people? Who told you to come assassinate me?” Ning barked. “If
you tell me, I’ll release you. Otherwise…I’ll keep messing
around with you. Although it’s hard for me to escape this
formation, you’ll be trapped here alongside me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, I admit
that you are formidable, but…threaten us? Hmph!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ba-Serpent spoke
out in the human tongue, then suddenly flew off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning rode atop the body
of the Ba-Serpent, following its movements.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trapped within this
formation, Ning would probably have to rely on a Greater
Teleportation Dao-seal to escape. However, if he kept a firm grip on
the Ba-Serpent…unless the Ba-Serpent was willing to remain within
the formation as well, once it left, Ning would be able to go out
with it. This was the reason why Ning kept such a firm grip on the
serpent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooosh. The Ba-Serpent
flew forward, flying through mountain forests as many formations
automatically parted before it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The massive Ba-Serpent
suddenly disappeared into nowhere as the twelve white-robed figures
re-appeared. The leader, the white-robed man with a bloody scar,
waved his hand to collect all of the other eleven, then immediately
flew towards a nearby location in front of him, his movements
lightning-fast. On the ground in front of him, there was a
pitch-black, fog-covered cave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the Ba-Serpent
disappeared, the white-robed man was already quite close to the
entrance of the cave, and so he instantly charged into it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Ning charged
after the white-robed man, but a few meters away from the cavern
entrance, he came to a sudden halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning stared
at the black, foggy cavern entrance before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entrance wasn’t
that large, and it appeared quite ordinary. However…there was no
way he could tell exactly what was within the cave. He couldn’t
sense the aura of the white-robed man within it at all either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems…this cave
is rather mysterious.” Ning stood in front of the cave, hesitating.
Because he couldn’t sense any auras at all from the entrance, he
had no idea what was inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ba-Serpent had
fled, but Ji Ning had remained atop the Ba-Serpent’s back. After
the Ba-Serpent was dispersed, the forces of Bloodcloud Hall had all
fled into the black cave. All of these things were seen by the
silver-armored youth, the black-robed youngster, Big Han, and the
others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So the forces of
Bloodcloud Hall truly did use their ‘final option’.” The
black-robed youngster had used a divine ability, causing spots of
starlight to appear within his eyes. He could clearly see to a great
distance. “I wonder if this Ji Ning will enter or not. If he
enters, then he will definitely die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True Immortals or
Empyrean Gods might survive if they go in, but as for this Ji Ning…no
matter how powerful his protective treasure is and no matter how
formidable he is, he’ll definitely die,” the silver-armored youth
said. “Of the Celestial Immortals who were killed by Bloodcloud
Hall, quite a few died after they foolishly chased the Bloodcloud
Hall assassins all the way into the cave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This cave entrance…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Was in reality a
portal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It led to a very
mysterious place, a place that was countless times more dangerous
than the Eastwoods mountain range.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 23 - Celestial Immortal
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning stared at the
black, foggy cave entrance in front of him for a moment, hesitating.
This clearly was no ordinary cave. Neither his divine sense nor his
[Torch-Dragon’s Eye] and other senses were able to discover
anything about the cave at all! However…Ning truly wanted to know
who it was who was trying to kill him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The world of the
Grand Xia is currently filled with dangerous undercurrents; it’s
best to be cautious. It’s best if I don’t go into unknown
places.” The reason why Ning had acted so arrogantly and brashly
earlier was because everything was under control…but the depths of
this black cave were beyond his understanding.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly departed
from this region, but he was still surrounded by layers of
formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning casually chose a
mountain peak at random, sitting down in the lotus position atop it,
then laughed loudly, “If you have any other abilities, use them to
your heart’s content! If you don’t attack me…I’m going to use
my Greater Teleportation Dao-seal to leave now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice echoed within
the skies, but no one came to attack him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It isn’t the time
to leave yet,” Ning mused to himself. “Master is still undergoing
his tribulation in that minor world. If the assassins wish to
continue to assault me and lose track of me, they’ll probably go
back to that minor world. I might as well stay here then!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, he didn’t
go in,” the black-robed youngster said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Because he’s not
an idiot,” the silver-armored youth said, shaking his head. “The
Celestial Immortals who went in previously were all overconfident;
they felt that their power was more than enough to ensure that they
would survive. But how could they have known…that the tunnel leads
to one of our true headquarters. Even True Immortals or Empyrean Gods
would at most be able to escape with their lives from that place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both the black-robed
youth and Big Han nodded. They had both been there before; they
naturally knew exactly how terrifying that place was. As their
headquarters…it was naturally far more dangerous than this
Eastwoods mountain range.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, Ji Ning is
in our formation. Shall we attack him?” Big Han asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s the point
of attacking him?” The silver-armored youth looked towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Big Han laughed
awkwardly. “There’s no point to us attacking him, but if you were
to attack, Master, wouldn’t you be able to easily capture him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop flattering me,”
the silver-armored youth snickered. “I, your master, know my own
limits. This Ji Ning is quite mysterious; his protective abilities
alone are enough to ensure that all of you weren’t able to do
anything to him with your many frenzied attacks. Even the Divine
Venomflame of the Nine Heavens was unable to injure him. Although I
dislike Bloodcloud Hall, they aren’t weak…and yet even squad
Earthnine in their Ba-Serpent Formation was unable to harm him in the
slightest! I’m not able to kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Big Han just chortled.
He knew that his master tended to be very low-key…but that his
master was in truth enormously powerful. More than ten Celestial
Immortals had died to his master’s hand!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored
youth quietly stared at the distant Ning, speculating internally,
“This Ji Ning’s background must be significant. If he trained in
the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]…then his background must be utterly
shocking! I wonder whose disciple he is?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When divinities
battle, mortals suffer. Compared to those major powers…people like
me are like mortals, while they are divinities.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Low-key. Stay
low-key.” The silver-armored youth had lived for a very long time,
and had experienced very many things. Thus, he knew very well…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That Celestial
Immortals might seem to be very powerful, but in the context of the
entire Three Realms, they were actually nothing more than chess
pieces. There were many danger zones that could cause Celestial
Immortals to perish. Someone like Ji Ning, who had such a terrifying
background…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True, if he killed Ji
Ning, any Daofather behind Ji Ning most likely wouldn’t lower
himself to act against a Celestial Immortal like the silver-armored
man. After all, for a Celestial Immortal to kill someone like Ji Ning
wouldn’t be considered a strong person bullying a much weaker
person. But there were some madmen in the Three Realms who were
wholly unreasonable, and who would fly into a rage and seek vengeance
for any slain disciples!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although there are
very few such madmen…perhaps one of Ji Ning’s uncle-masters or
fellow apprentices number such a madman amongst them,” the
silver-armored youth mumbled to himself. “It wasn’t easy for me
to stay alive for so long; I endured countless dangers before
becoming a Celestial Immortal. I plan to survive this storm. Careful.
Have to be careful; that’s more important than anything else!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, then are we
going to just let Ji Ning stay in the formation? Should we…?” Big
Han looked towards the silver-armored youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just keep him
trapped within the formation. If Bloodcloud Hall wishes to continue
their assassination, let them. We won’t participate any further,”
the silver-armored man said calmly. “If he wants to use a Greater
Teleportation Dao-seal to leave, there’s nothing we can do about
that! As for attacking him? Forget it. Attacking him is a waste of
elemental ki.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” Big Han
assented respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed, one day
after the other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third day after the
failure of the assassination attempt. Patriarch Arcanum was once more
invited to Bloodcloud Hall. He was brought to that secluded garden
once more, and it was still that same silver-robed maiden who
welcomed him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How’d it go?”
Patriarch Arcanum sat down, looking at the silver-robed youth facing
him. “Did you kill Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” The
silver-robed maiden shook her head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No?!” Patriarch
Arcanum was shocked…and then enraged. “I’ve already given you
the treasures, so you should go and kill him. If you weren’t able
to kill him in your first wave of attacks, you should send out a
second wave. In short…you should do what you promised and ensure
that you kill him within the year. As for how you accomplish it? I
don’t give a damn. But you need to do what you promised! This was a
deal! My Youngflame clan has paid the price; you need to hold up to
your end of the bargain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-robed maiden
nodded. “Your words are correct.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum was
startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Per our contract, if
Bloodcloud Hall is unable to accomplish the mission, then we are to
return your treasures to you.” The silver-robed maiden produced a
storage ring. “This is what you gave to me previously; everything
is here. Bloodcloud Hall lost money on this deal, but we’re still
giving you everything back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…you…”
Patriarch Arcanum couldn’t believe it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A contract was a
contract. If the assassination couldn’t be carried out, then the
treasures would have to be repaid! This was something Bloodcloud Hall
prided themselves on…but they rarely actually did this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is Ji Ning very hard
to kill?” Patriarch Arcanum frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we truly had to
kill him, Bloodcloud Hall could indeed do it.” The silver-robed
maiden nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then why don’t
you?!” Patriarch Arcanum asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The price isn’t
high enough.” The silver-robed maiden looked towards Patriarch
Arcanum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s the needed
price?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Twenty top-grade
Immortal-ranked magic treasures,” the silver-robed maiden said. “If
you pay this price in treasures, Bloodcloud Hall will go and kill Ji
Ning. We erred in our estimation of his power, and so we set too low
a price last time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum’s
face turned completely crimson with rage. “Why don’t you just go
ahead and rob me?! You dare to name a price of twenty top-grade
Immortal-ranked treasures? That’s equivalent to two Pure Yang
treasures! That’s enough to invite even a True Immortal or Empyrean
God to come and help out! How dare you name such a price?!” This
price was indeed quite excessive; it would pose an enormous burden
towards the Youngflame clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Invite a True
Immortal or Empyrean God?” The silver-robed maiden chuckled. “Go
ahead and give it a try. Let’s see who would be willing to kill Ji
Ning for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum
gritted his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew very well that
the more powerful an expert was, the more cautious they tended to be.
Perhaps a Celestial Immortal killing Ji Ning wouldn’t be considered
a strong person bullying a much weaker person, but a True Immortal or
Empyrean God killing him definitely would be. If there truly was a
Daofather standing behind Ji Ning…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the Daofather was
able to discover what was happening and was able to rescue Ji Ning
before he died, things wouldn’t be too bad; the Daofather would at
most teach the offender a lesson! But if the Daofather didn’t make
it in time, or if he found out only after Ji Ning died…in his rage,
the Daofather might truly go and slaughter the True Immortal or
Empyrean God in question!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How many True Immortals
or Empyrean Gods would be willing to risk their lives for the sake of
two low-grade Pure Yang treasures?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There should be some
powerful Celestial Immortals that can kill Ji Ning, right?”
Patriarch Arcanum growled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you wish to
invite Bloodcloud Hall to assassinate Ji Ning, then please hand over
twenty top-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasures, or treasures of an
equivalent value. If you aren’t willing, then please leave. Our
business is concluded,” the silver-robed maiden said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum
ground his teeth. Twenty…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suppressing his anger,
Patriarch Arcanum asked in a growl, “How powerful is Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want to know?”
The silver-robed maiden said, “This is a bit of valuable
intelligence. If you are willing to return the storage ring and its
contents to me, I can tell you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph!” Angered,
Patriarch Arcanum rose to his feet, turned, and left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What a joke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An intelligence report
worth three top-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasures?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After watching
Patriarch Arcanum leave, the silver-robed maiden shook her head. “You
idiotic fool. If you ask Bloodcloud Hall to kill Ji Ning, all you
need to do was pay us enough treasures. But if you want to do it
yourselves? Even if you were to summon your ancient Patriarch who
first arose in the Fiendgod Era, and even if he was able to kill Ji
Ning when using all his power…the price you would pay would be a
price vastly beyond what your clan is capable of withstanding.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master wouldn’t
lie to me. He’s suspected of having learned the [Eight-Nine Arcane
Art]! Not even Master was qualified to learn such a technique.” The
silver-robed maiden was stunned by this bit of news.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From the detailed
intelligence report they had gained from their assassination attempt,
Ji Ning either had an unearthly powerful protective item or had
trained in the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]! Either possibility had
tremendous, extraordinary implications.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bloodcloud Hall
specialized in carrying out extraordinary tasks. If the price was
high enough, they would still dare to kill Ji Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed, one day
after the other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the minor world.
The scorched, cracked, barren earth here would cause any who saw it
to feel despair towards life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why hasn’t Master
woken up yet?” The black-robed Ning stared at the nearby Immortal
Diancai.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The demonheart
tribulation will last for at least seven days, but at most…it’s
hard to say.” Immortal Fivecraze shook his head. “Your master has
only spent ten days in the demonheart tribulation. Don’t be
impatient.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
black-robed Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And how is your true
body doing? Is it in any danger?” Immortal Fivecraze asked,
worried. The nearby Whitewater Hound looked towards Ning as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
laughed helplessly. “Don’t worry. I really am not in any danger
at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Immortal Fivecraze
and Uncle White couldn’t help but worry. If Ning’s true body
truly was completely safe, it would’ve already returned to this
minor world. And yet, it hadn’t. What they didn’t realize…was
that Ning was intentionally keeping his true body in the Eastwoods
mountain range, so as to draw the attention of his foes and prevent
disaster from befalling his master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me out. Ji Ning,
Fivecraze, just let me out. You won’t be able to kill me; what’s
the point of keeping me trapped here?” Trapped within the
formation, the Scion of the Blood God, still within his little black
ship, was calling out loudly. He truly felt regret for coming here.
Although by relying on his ship, he made it impossible for them to
harm him…he was trapped within this formation and unable to escape.
He had no idea that the enemy included such a formidable formations
expert.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning,
Immortal Fivecraze, and Uncle White couldn’t even be bothered to
look at the Scion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were just going to
keep him locked up in here!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he was permitted to
leave, he might stir up more trouble. It was best to keep him trapped
here! That way, they wouldn’t worry about him disrupting Immortal
Diancai’s tribulation later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Suddenly, the
black-robed Ning, Fivecraze, and Uncle White all turned their heads
to stare at Immortal Diancai, still seated in the lotus position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai had
already opened his eyes. Within them could be seen two things;
infinite ancientness, and a hint of tears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master!” The
black-robed Ning called out excitedly.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_24___Whither_the_Immorta"></A>
Chapter 24 - Whither the Immortal Treasure?
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother!” Immortal Fivecraze looked excitedly towards
Immortal Diancai.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them just stared
with bated breaths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai’s
eyes were open. He remained seated in the lotus position, but
rainbow-colored clouds suddenly began to appear in the skies. These
fortuitous clouds descended around Immortal Diancai, and in the
ground around him there began to manifest petals of a golden lotus
flower. It seemed as though Immortal Diancai was seated atop an
enormous golden lotus. Murmurs of what sounded like celestial music
could be heard from the world around him. Of course, this wasn’t an
actual melody; rather, it was the sound of the Heavens and the Earth.
Just listening to it, one would feel as though it was filled with
infinite mysteries.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time, a
terrifying aura of power began to descend, completely enveloping
Immortal Diancai.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such terrifying
power.” The black-robed Ji Ning and the others all felt their
hearts tremble, even though they were barely touched by the power
itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous flood of
natural power began to gather around Immortal Diancai. His body now
began to manifest the ‘aura of an Immortal soul’, something which
one would have only after becoming a Celestial Immortal. His energy
was transforming on a fundamental level as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From the Zifu stage to
the Void stage, one merely had ‘elemental ki’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After becoming a
Celestial Immortal, the power of the soul and all other powers would
completely merge into one power. The lotus-bud at the top of the
Goldlotus Primal would draw in the essence of all the other types of
power, fusing them into one and then refining them into a single
brilliant golden pellet, a ‘Jindan’. 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This new power could be
described as either dharmic energy or Immortal energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The great path of
the Jindan, the great path of the Jindan…once the golden pellet
enters my flank, then my destiny shall no longer be subject to the
Heavens.” Immortal Diancai laughed softly, “All shall become one,
a perfect, flawless whole…from this day forth, there shall be no
more Three Calamities, no more Nine Tribulations. I have truly become
a carefree Immortal, having escaped the rules of the Three Realms and
the binds of the Five Elements.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
Master. Felicitations, Master!” The black-robed Ning walked over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, junior
apprentice-brother, oh, junior apprentice-brother…you didn’t let
us down! Ahahaha…” Immortal Fivecraze was the most excited person
right now. “After countless years…our Black-White College has
finally produced a second Celestial Immortal. A Celestial Immortal!
True immortality, an infinite lifespan…a Celestial Immortal!!! And
one who overcame six nine-sets of the thunder tribulation! Haha, even
if this crazy old man was to die right away, it would be worth it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were differences
in power amongst Celestial Immortals as well. Ordinary thunder
tribulations, such as those with two nine-sets or three nine-sets,
wouldn’t be too powerful. By contrast, some extraordinarily
powerful Fiendgod experts might be capable of overcoming nine
nine-sets and become Empyrean Gods, immediately comparable to Pure
Yang True Immortals in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? What’s going
on here?” Immortal Diancai was startled. He asked in surprise,
“What’s that little black ship inside this formation?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Celestial Immortal
Diancai, congratulations to you!” A person emerged from within the
little black ship; it was the sect leader of the Blood God Church,
the Scion of the Blood God. Laughing loudly, he said, “It’s quite
rare to be able to see the birth of a Celestial Immortal. Still…you
have to thank this fine disciple you have here. He killed seven of my
Law Protectors, then trapped me here. If it wasn’t for the fact I
wanted to see if you would become a Celestial Immortal, Immortal
Diancai, I would’ve left long ago. Alright…no more playing around
with you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Scion returned to
his ship. Then, with a rumble and a ripple…he disappeared into thin
air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had been clenching a
Dao-seal when he he was speaking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Made him waste a
Greater Teleportation Dao-seal. Worth it.” Immortal Fivecraze
laughed and nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s this he
said about killing seven Law Protectors?” Immortal Diancai frowned.
“And Ji Ning, this is your Primaltwin, yes? Where’s your true
body?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having known Ji
Ning for so long, Immortal Diancai knew quite well that Ning himself
liked to wear furs, while his Primaltwin usually wore black robes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “These
are all just minor matters.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me be the one to
tell you.” Immortal Fivecraze called out excitedly, “Junior
apprentice-brother, you have no idea. When you were undergoing your
demonheart tribulation, everything happened just as you predicted;
someone came to attack you. First came the Scion of the Blood God; he
came in person, commanding his seven mighty Law Protectors to assault
you. This precious disciple of yours showed of all his might…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Fivecraze was
in an absolutely divine mood as he blabbered on and on. Finally, he
finished his tail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai looked
towards Ning, feeling a hint of guilt in his heart. “Disciple,
sorry for the trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s fine. My true
body is fine as well. In addition, the second group of assassins, the
stronger ones, they came for me, not for you, Master,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai shook
his head. “Because I was undergoing my tribulation, you were
distracted and had to worry about me; that’s the reason why they
chose this opportunity to assassinate you. In a normal situation
where you didn’t have to worry about me…you probably wouldn’t
even have had to fight. You could’ve slipped away long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough, enough! No
need for the two of you, master and disciple, to stand on such
ceremony,” Immortal Fivecraze laughed loudly. “Our Black-White
College now has a Celestial Immortal. This is a joyous event! Come,
come, come. Hurry back to the Black-White College and let all of our
fellow disciples learn of this and celebrate. You became a Celestial
Immortal! That is the dream of every Immortal cultivator.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are we going to just
publicize the fact that Master became a Celestial Immortal?” Ning
asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Fivecraze
laughed. “We would like to keep it a secret, but since even the
Scion of the Blood God knows about it, news will quickly spread.
Thus, we should still inform the Earth Immortals and Loose Immortals
of the Black-White College. We should also notify Celestial Immortal
Hunchmont of the Northmont clan of Stillwater.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Celestial Immortal
Hunchmont?” Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There is a deeper
meaning in this. The reason why our Black-White College is
established directly within Stillwater City is because we long ago
decided to share weal and woe with the Northmont clan of Stillwater,”
Immortal Fivecraze said. “The reason why the Black-White College
can recruit all the geniuses we want from throughout the entire
Stillwater City and not be impeded in the slightest is because of the
Northmont clan; without their permission, how could this be
possible?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, now that you are a Celestial Immortal, the
Northmont clan will definitely want to further deepen the
relationship between themselves and our Black-White College,”
Immortal Fivecraze laughed. “And of course…our Black-White
College has toiled so hard on their behalf. Now that you became a
Celestial Immortal, they need to prepare a valuable gift to
congratulate you. Junior apprentice-brother, aren’t you lacking in
formidable Immortal swords? Now let me think…where should we get
such precious treasures? How about…from the Northmont clan of
Stillwater?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Compared
to those ancient clans, Ning was a bit lacking in treasures; after
all, his Primaltwin needed all the Heavenraker swords for the
[Heavenraker] sword-formation, while his true body needed six
Immortal-ranked swords, but didn’t have them! If he wanted to help
out his master, he ideally had to offer five formidable
Immortal-ranked swords; after all, his master already had five
Immortal-ranked swords, just somewhat weak ones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the Northmont
clan had existed for countless generations after obtaining the
marquisdom for Stillwater Commandery back during the Fiendgod Era.
They had given birth to a number of Celestial Immortals, and they
definitely had quite a few treasures. The Youngflame clan was capable
of bringing out even twenty top-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasures
if necessary; although the Northmont clan was a bit weaker, they
still had quite a deep foundation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go. Back to
Stillwater City,” Immortal Fivecraze urged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time, they didn’t
need to so carefully creep into the dimensional corridor; rather,
they tore a hole through space and returned straight to the world of
the Grand Xia, then immediately used a spatial teleport to return to
Stillwater City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eastwoods mountain
range. One particular mountain, surrounded by layers of formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was seated in the
lotus position here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master became a
Celestial Immortal.” Ning’s face was covered with delight; he
felt as though his heart and soul had just become much less burdened.
“I want to prepare a valuable gift to congratulate master as well,
but alas…all of the Immortal-ranked treasures I obtained from
killing those seven Law Protectors were quite ordinary.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven Law
Protectors had previously all been ordinary Loose Immortals, after
all; it was only thanks to a secret technique that in the past twenty
to thirty years, they had increased their levels of power to that of
a five hundred thousand year old Loose Immortal. But although their
power levels had risen, their magic treasures hadn’t changed much
yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time for me to go
back now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why Ning had
allowed himself to be pummeled like a beanbag without fleeing was
because he didn’t want to disrupt his master’s tribulation. Now
that the tribulation was over, it was time for him to go back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning rose to
his feet, staring at the surrounding area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where exactly am I,
and what is this place? Where in the Grand Xia Dynasty is it? Why is
such a terrifyingly strong power hidden here?” The twelve
white-robed figures who had attacked him…the terrifying killing
formation, ‘Divine Venomflame of the Nine Heavens Cauldron’…that
mysterious, foggy black cave entrance…Ning could tell from these
things that this place was definitely quite extraordinary!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to
investigate. After suffering for so long, I need to at least ensure
that I know who it is that caused me so much trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition…the
world of the Grand Xia is in a state of chaos right now. This hidden
power is most likely one of the causes of it. Only when one knows
both one’s self and one’s foe can one win a hundred battles
without fail,” Ning mused to himself. Perhaps investigating this
place might bring him some danger, but by relying on the ‘Seventy-Two
Transformations’ of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], I can infiltrate
and investigate this place. Not even True Immortals or Empyrean Gods
would be able to discover who I truly was, unless they have a special
divine ability that can see through the ‘Seventy-Two
Transformations’…but those are far too rare.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go!” Ning
immediately activated the Greater Teleportation Dao-seal he had taken
out. Swoosh! Ning instantly disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“General,” the
Eastwoods sect leader reported, “Ji Ning has already used a Greater
Teleportation Dao-seal to leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If he’s gone, he’s
gone.” The silver-armored youth didn’t care one whit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A million kilometers
east of the Eastwoods mountain range. Ning suddenly appeared out of
nowhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By relying on his
Greater Teleportation Dao-seal, he could’ve teleported straight
back to Swallow Mountain or Stillwater City, but Ning had to find out
just who it was that had trapped him in that location. Thus, he had
only teleported a million kilometers! He refused to believe that the
enemy base spanned a million kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Ning flew
towards the air above an ordinary commandery city. Sweeping it with
his divine sense, he instantly found the most powerful person within
the city; a Zifu Disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning used a
spatial teleport to appear in the person’s study.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was an old man in
the study, leafing through some books.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who are you?” The
old man lifted his head, instantly shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going to ask
you some questions,” Ning said, and the old man’s gaze instantly
turned lost and dull.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Which commandery is
this?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flamedoor
Commandery,” the old man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled.
Flamedoor Commandery; it wasn’t too far away from Stillwater
Commandery, just two commanderies away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is the name of
this city?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Weirflow,” the old
man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned. There
were far too many commandery cities, and they often changed names.
Once a tribe took over a commandery city, they would often change its
name. For example, the first commandery city the Ji clan had taken
over, they had renamed to the City of Ten Thousand Swords. Precisely
because commandery cities changed names so often, maps generally
wouldn’t even have city names written down for most of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Which mountains and
rivers are nearby?” Ning asked. “Large-scale ones.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“More than a hundred
thousand kilometers east of the city, there is a vast mountain range
that spans tens of thousands of kilometers known as the Goosewine
Mountains,” the old man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes
immediately lit up. The Goosewine Mountains?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had long ago
memorized a map of the entire domain of the Grand Xia Dynasty. He
quickly ascertained his current, exact location! Upon doing soon,
Ning quickly was able to calculate who was located a million
kilometers away from him: “The Eastwoods mountain range…the
Eastwoods Sect! So that’s where they were hiding!”

Chapter 25 - The Old Patriarch of the Northmont Clan of Stillwater
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After calculating that
the mysterious mountain range had been the Eastwoods mountain range,
Ji Ning didn’t immediately go to verify it. Instead, he used a
spatial teleportation to return to Stillwater City. His master had
just broken through to become a Celestial Immortal, after all; he had
to be present for the announcement. If his true body wasn’t, his
master and Immortal Fivecraze would probably still feel uneasy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stillwater City. The
Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although it was noon,
and although there had just been a big blizzard, the Headmaster’s
Hall of the Black-White College was a place of joy right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am going to tell
everyone a piece of earth-shatteringly good news. Our Black-White
College…has given birth to a Celestial Immortal! This is the second
Celestial Immortal our Black-White College has had since our
founding!” Immortal Fivecraze spoke out loudly from the front of
the hall, his voice echoing within it. The entire hall suddenly
turned silent, a queer, shocked silence. All of the Void-level Earth
Immortals and Loose Immortals were staring at Immortal Fivecraze in
disbelief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ten days ago, Ji
Ning and I guarded junior apprentice-brother Diancai as he underwent
the wind tribulation, the fire tribulation, the thunder tribulation,
and the demonheart tribulation. After overcoming these four great
tribulations, junior apprentice-brother Diancai has become a
Celestial Immortal.” Immortal Fivecraze’s voice continued to echo
out within the hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Celestial
Immortal?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Diancai!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Diancai!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, has your
master truly become a Celestial Immortal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You idiots! Do you
think I’d lie to you about something like this?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, I have
indeed become a Celestial Immortal, thanks to the protection of Ji
Ning and senior apprentice-brother Fivecraze.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the entire
Headmaster’s Hall turned into a storm of joy. Everyone called out
in celebration, especially after Immortal Diancai personally released
his aura of might. After everyone felt the aura of a Celestial
Immortal coming from him, they began to rejoice even more!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To become a Celestial
Immortal…the implications were extraordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that back in the annals of history, when the Black-White College gave
birth to a Celestial Immortal, its status had risen to become
equivalent to the Northmont clan of Stillwater and the local branch
of the Raindragon Guard. Celestial Immortals were truly unaging. They
would live for a very long time, and so long as they were alive, the
entire sect would have a firm foundation..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As all the Loose
Immortals and Earth Immortals were celebrating with wild agitation
and excitement, Immortal Fivecraze sent Immortal Jadesea to the
Northmont clan of Stillwater. He personally went to request a meeting
with Celestial Immortal Hunchmont to notify him of this matter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Did you just say
that Immortal Diancai has become a Celestial Immortal?” Celestial
Immortal Hunchmont was very stable and solid, but even so he revealed
a look of astonishment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortals
were far too rare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Normally speaking, it
was extremely rare for even a single one to appear in a million years
within the world of the Grand Xia Dynasty. Even now, with the Three
Realms in a state of chaos, they still were very, very rare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Hunchmont, I
wouldn’t dare lie about something like this,” the former
headmaster, Immortal Jadesea, said with a laugh. “When senior
apprentice-brother Diancai underwent his tribulation, he had Ji Ning
and senior apprentice-brother Fivecraze protecting him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good, good, good.”
Celestial Immortal Hunchmont leaned on his wooden staff, laughing as
he spoke. “This is good news for the entire Stillwater Commandery.
Go back now; I’ll make some preparations, then head to your
Black-White College.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. I’ll leave
now.” Immortal Jadesea bowed respectfully, then immediately
departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Hunchmont hesitated slightly within the room, then quickly departed,
moving to a palace that the Northmont clan usually used for
discussing major affairs. As he did, he barked, “Shut the palace
doors. Everyone, depart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The guards
all respectfully acknowledged the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the palace door
was shut, the enormous palace became shrouded within darkness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Hunchmont waved his hand, and eight enormous candles suddenly began
to blaze, lighting up the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder brother,”
Hunchmont called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the eyes of
a sculpture of a strange beast that was located above the throne at
the front of the hall suddenly lit up. It glanced towards him, and
then the beast sculpture’s mouth moved as well. “Hunchmont. What
is it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder brother, our
Stillwater Commandery has given birth to a Celestial Immortal,”
Hunchmont said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who?” The strange
beast sculpture asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Diancai of
the Black-White College,” Hunchmont replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The strange beast
sculpture said, “The Black-White College has the closest of
relationships with our Stillwater Commandery. This has been true for
countless years. After becoming a Celestial Immortal, Immortal
Diancai will naturally stand on the side of our Northmont clan of
Stillwater. Especially during a time like this…the more powerful
the Northmont clan’s forces are, the better. This is absolutely
wonderful news.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Hunchmont
nodded. “That’s what I thought as well. But elder brother,
Diancai has just made his breakthrough; what sort of gift should we
give him? His sword-arts are based on the Five Elements; he is most
suited for using five Immortal swords. Why don’t we give him a gift
of five high-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you remember how,
back in the Fiendgod Era,” the strange beast sculpture said, “I
battled against Patriarch Fiveghosts at the Yuchang River, then slew
him? I acquired a set of five Immortal swords from that battle. I
still have them. Give them to this Immortal Diancai.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But those are five
top-grade Immortal-ranked swords!” Hunchmont was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Times are changing,”
the strange beast sculpture said. “In a normal era, a gift of five
high-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords would already be quite an
incredible gift…but you know as well as I do that the entire world
of the Grand Xia is shaking right now. Even I can vaguely sense in my
subconscious that a storm is coming…and it is very possible that
our Northmont clan of Stillwater shall perish within it. Thus, it is
important that we not be stingy at a time like this. Only when you
are willing to give some things up are you able to gain even more
important things!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After we give him a
set of five top-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords, he will
naturally feel grateful towards us…and thus we will have firmly
pulled this Celestial Immortal Diancai under the Northmont clan’s
war-banners. The Northmont clan of Stillwater currently only has two
Celestial Immortals; if we count in Diancai, then we shall have
three! That will make the foundations of the clan to be even more
secure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder brother, your
plans are far-sighted,” Hunchmont said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This elder brother of
his had lived for far longer than he had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, this ‘elder
brother’ was born unfathomably many generations before he had been.
However, because both were Celestial Immortals, they considered
themselves to be of the same generation in addressing each other.
Still…Celestial Immortal Hunchmont revered this person greatly,
because this person was the true foundation for the strength and
prosperity of the Northmont clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When you bring those
five Immortal-ranked flying swords over, invite Celestial Immortal
Diancai and that Ji Ning to come. I wish to see them both,” the
strange beast sculpture said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder brother, you
wish to see them?” Hunchmont was amazed; even within the Northmont
clan, the vast majority of the many generations of marquises had no
idea that there was such a powerful Patriarch who was still alive.
This was the reason why the generations of marquises were so cautious
and reserved, not causing any trouble; they didn’t know exactly how
powerful their clan was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I certainly have to
see Celestial Immortal Diancai; after all, in the future, when the
storm truly erupts, he will be fighting alongside us,
shoulder-to-shoulder. As for Ji Ning? His background is
extraordinary, and in the end, he might prove to be even more
important to us than Celestial Immortal Diancai,” the strange beast
sculpture said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Headmaster’s Hall
of the Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many Loose
Immortals and Earth Immortals, along with Immortal Diancai, were all
gathered here. There was a feast ongoing. Just as the feast was
halfway through and as everyone was celebrating, a hunchbacked old
man entered the hall, leaning on a wooden staff.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Hunchmont.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Hunchmont.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone immediately
rose to their feet. Even Ning rose.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
fellow Daoist Diancai,” Celestial Immortal Hunchmont laughed.
“You’ve overcome the four tribulations of wind, fire, thunder,
and demonheart; you are now a Celestial Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve only brought
one thing with me. I’ve heard, fellow Daoist Diancai, that you are
skilled in a Five Elements sword-art. Our Northmont clan just so
happened to have a set of five top-grade Immortal-ranked flying
swords in our treasury, and so I brought them to give them to you,
fellow Daoist. Fellow Daoist Diancai, you absolutely must not
decline.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Top-grade
Immortal-ranked??”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five of them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Am I hearing
things?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Loose Immortals and
Earth Immortals of the Black-White College began to sent mental
messages to each other. They had all guessed that the Northmont clan
would bring congratulatory gifts, but they hadn’t expected that the
gifts would be so valuable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was shocked upon
hearing this as well. He had guessed that the gift would be five
high-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords, not top-grade! The
Northmont clan truly was generous!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai was
similarly shocked. Naturally, he hurriedly moved to refuse; this gift
was far too valuable, bringing great pressure to bear down upon him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Diancai, don’t
refuse!” Celestial Immortal Hunchmont feigned anger. “If you keep
refusing, I’m going to turn and leave!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only then did Immortal
Diancai accept the gift.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The celebratory banquet
continued until past midnight, when it finally concluded. Celestial
Immortal Hunchmont stealthily sent a mental message to both Ji Ning
and Immortal Diancai, and so after the banquet, the two of them both
headed towards the Marquisate of Stillwater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Marquisate of
Stillwater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Immortal
Diancai, and Celestial Immortal Hunchmont were walking together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Hunchmont,”
Ning laughed, “We’ve arrived at the Marquisate. Senior, you can
tell us what this is about now, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Hunchmont laughed. “Patriarch Unity of our Northmont clan wishes to
see you two.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch Unity of
the Northmont clan?” Ji Ning and Immortal Diancai were both
startled; where did this additional Northmont clan Patriarch come
from?! When Ning had been weak, he had even thought that perhaps the
Northmont clan didn’t have so much as a single Celestial Immortal;
it was only later on that he learned of Hunchmont’s existence. He
hadn’t expected them to have a second one!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but sigh in amazement. The roots of an ancient clan such as this one
truly were extremely deep.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be…the
Supreme Sword Immortal, Celestial Immortal Unity?” Immortal Diancai
cried out in shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Celestial
Immortal Hunchmont chortled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, who is this
‘Supreme Sword Immortal’, this ‘Celestial Immortal Unity’?”
Ning asked, puzzled. Immortal Diancai explained, “I learned about
him by accident. The Northmont clan of Stillwater has had quite a few
Celestial Immortals in its history, but over the course of countless
ages, most are presumed deceased. The most dazzling one of them all
was this Supreme Sword Immortal! He existed back during the Fiendgod
Era, and he submitted himself to the Xia Emperor’s rule, battling
and fighting on the Xia Emperor’s behalf. Countless Fiendgods and
countless Immortals died to his sword, and in the end, he won a
marquisdom for the Northmont clan; the marquisdom of Stillwater
Commandery. However…according to the legends, he perished during
the Milky Way War. How is it that he is still alive?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, upon hearing
this, was stunned. This old fellow had existed as far back as the
Fiendgod Era, and had won the marquisdom for the Northmont clan?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, Patriarch
Unity was indeed badly wounded during the Milky Way War, but he
didn’t actually die. Still…that battle was a major blow for the
Old Patriarch. The Old Patriarch felt so much grief, it was as though
he had died. He never showed his face in the world again. Countless
years have passed, but there has never been any word regarding the
Old Patriarch as far as the outside world has been concerned, and so
that’s why everyone believed him to have perished,” Celestial
Immortal Hunchmont explained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai now
understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The five Immortal
swords gifted to you came from Patriarch Fiveghosts, who Patriarch
Unity slew back during the Fiendgod Era.” Celestial Immortal
Hunchmont laughed. “It was the Old Patriarch who personally
instructed for those swords to be given to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai
nodded, then said to Ji Ning, “Ji Ning, when you see senior Unity,
you must not behave improperly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He felt tremendous
curiosity towards this Patriarch Unity; this was a truly legendary
figure, one who had led his clan to rove the world in the Fiendgod
Era, fighting and conquering countless foes before suddenly vanishing
for seemingly all eternity. It must be understood that for a person
to hide himself so thoroughly as to completely sever all contact with
all other Celestial Immortals was quite a painful choice. Not
everyone had an ability like Ning’s ‘Seventy-Two
Transformations’, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here we are. My
elder brother is right inside.” Celestial Immortal Hunchmont stood
outside a seemingly ordinary courtyard.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 26 - The State of Affairs
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He pushed open the door
to the courtyard. This was a very large courtyard, with grapes,
willow trees, apple trees, and other types of trees within it.
However, because it was winter, it naturally appeared a bit desolate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon entering, Ji Ning
felt as though this was the residence of an ordinary mortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, Ning locked his
gaze upon a distant gray-robed youth. The gray-robed youth’s head
was raised, and he was looking at a willow tree. “It’s been a
long time since I’ve returned to the Grand Xia…but this courtyard
is still laid out the same way it was in the past. It hasn’t
changed at all. Hunchmont…thank you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the only
place you like to stay in, elder brother. I naturally had to keep it
in good shape,” Celestial Immortal Hunchmont said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gray-robed youth
turned his head to look at them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Immortal
Diancai were both startled. The gaze of this gray-robed youth was as
deep and penetrating as the waters of an icy pool. His aura was
extremely profound. Although the two knew very little about him, both
Ning and Immortal Diancai could feel…that if they were to fight,
they probably would be far from being a match for this figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems he is a
supreme figure amongst Celestial Immortals,” Ning mused to himself.
There could be huge differences in power amongst Celestial Immortals,
much like how Ning, despite being merely a Void-level Earth
Immortals, could effortless sweep groups of Loose Immortals and Earth
Immortals with his power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings to you,
senior Unity,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings to you,
fellow Daoist Unity,” Immortal Diancai said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was still
technically at the Void-level, after all; since he was unwilling to
reveal his status as a Daofather’s disciple, he naturally addressed
Celestial Immortals the way most ordinary Void-level Earth Immortals
would; as ‘senior’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Diancai? Ji Ning?”
The gray-robed youth looked at the two of them, a hint of a smile on
his face. He then casually pointed at nearby wooden chairs. “Sit.”
With a gesture from his hand, all the dust disappeared from the
chairs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gray-robed youth
was the first to sit down. He even produced a tea kettle and teacups,
pouring each of them a cup. “This is green tea. You can drink it
after boiling it; it is a fairly common refreshment in many major
worlds. However, it’s a bit rarer in our world of the Grand Xia.
Have a taste. I personally planted this tea tree and personally
collected the tea leaves.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Immortal
Diancai were both rather startled. They immediately tasted it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense a
thick aroma waft into his mouth and spread throughout his entire
body, the flavor limitless. “Good tea.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you like to
drink tea as well?” The gray-robed youth asked curiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled. He
hurriedly replied, “I occasionally drink it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, just now Ning
was unconsciously drawing from his tea-drinking experiences from his
past life on Earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tea is quite
flavorful. I took on many masters to study this art, to study various
types of tea trees, how to plant tea trees, how to select the right
soil, and use the proper type of water…” The gray-robed youth
laughed. “Haha, enough of that. I’m happy to talk about this all
day, but I imagine that you would be bored senseless by it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai asked
curiously, “Fellow Daoist Unity, you’ve taken on many masters?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All mortals,” the
gray-robed youth laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mortals?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai and Ji
Ning both felt startled; a Celestial Immortal who was willing to take
on a mortal as a master? Not just anyone could do something like
this!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I invited the two of
you over for a nice chat,” the gray-robed youth said with a laugh.
“A storm is about to befall the Three Realms, and the world of the
Grand Xia is naturally not going to be able to avoid it. In addition,
there are some hidden powers who are making use of this storm to
cause waves of their own. In truth…ever since the Milky Way War,
I’ve been living the life of an ordinary mortal. I’ve been quite
relaxed…but this can no longer continue.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The life of an
ordinary mortal?” Immortal Diancai frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you wish to live
a longer live, then you need to avoid being stained by karma,” the
gray-robed youth said with a laugh. “What is karma? If you have a
friend, and your friend falls into danger, you will naturally go help
him; this is karma! If someone like me always hides within a minor
world of mortals and doesn’t interact with any Celestial Immortals,
with all my friends and enemies believing me to be dead…then they
naturally won’t come bother me. This can be considered ‘severing
karma’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I live a carefree
life. Naturally, I’m able to live a long, long life.” The
gray-robed youth looked towards Immortal Diancai, then laughed,
“After this storm ends, fellow Daoist Diancai, you should also set
up a ‘false death’ then hide yourself in a minor world of
mortals. You can live for trillions of years and still probably
wouldn’t perish…unless, of course, you encounter yet another
storm like this one, which no one will be able to avoid.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Immortal
Diancai were speechless upon hearing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They understood…that
this was indeed a fine way to ‘live a long life’. However, not
everyone had this sort of willpower, to go live the life of a mortal
despite being an exalted Celestial Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Unity, you
say that no one will be able to avoid this coming storm?” Ning
hurriedly asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps the truly
exalted Daofathers will remain safe,” the gray-robed youth said,
“But for Celestial Immortals like us, and perhaps even for True
Immortals and Empyrean Gods, I wager…it will be hard to avoid this
storm. Based on what I know, this storm is about to envelop the
entire Three Realms. A small place like our Stillwater Commandery has
also been thrown into chaos. For example, the rise of the Blood God
Church!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, you should
be able to eradicate the Blood God Church, right?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eradicating them
would naturally be easy. If I made a trip, they would be immediately
wiped out. But if I did that, then the Northmont clan of Stillwater
will most likely be viewed as a dangerous source of trouble for that
hidden power,” the gray-robed youth said. “Thus…we shall simply
continue the low-level struggle against them. We’ll slowly play
with the Blood God Church. The biggest benefit of going with the flow
is that when the true storm comes, we’ll all be able to join
together to fight side-by-side.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai asked,
“A hidden power? Which power?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t know
either. I imagine you, Diancai, also know that the Grand Xia Dynasty
is currently in a state of great chaos. Clearly, the various evil or
berserk clans and sects now all have hidden supporters,” the
gray-robed youth said. “In fact, I suspect…that some marquises
have already thrown their support to the hidden power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The marquises have
changed their loyalties?!” Ning and Diancai were both shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The waters are far
too muddy right now. No one knows exactly what is going on. Not even
the Xia Emperor dares to truly exert his power right now. Everyone is
building up their power, waiting quietly to fight,” the gray-robed
youth said. “It is the Xia Emperor’s job to deal with the hidden
power; as for us, all we need to do is survive. To allow our clans
and sects to survive! Thus, I hope that both of you, Ji Ning and
fellow Daoist Diancai, shall stand together alongside myself and
Hunchmont. If we join forces…we’ll be able to protect the
Black-White College, protect Swallow Mountain, and protect the
Northmont clan of Stillwater.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Immortal
Diancai exchanged a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of them nodded,
agreeing to this alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One chopstick is easily
broken. A bundle of chopsticks are hard to break!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because the Black-White
College had a long-standing relationship with the Northmont clan,
Ning and his master naturally decided to fight on their side and ally
with them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder if you two
seniors are aware…of any powers within the world of the Grand Xia
who are skilled in the Ba-Serpent Formation?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ba-Serpent
Formation?” Looks of puzzlement appeared on the faces of the
gray-robed youth and Hunchmont.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are some
powers in the Three Realms that are skilled in the Ba-Serpent
Formation, but as for the world of the Grand Xia…I truly haven’t
heard of any.” The gray-robed youth shook his head. “Hunchmont,
have you heard anything? You are often here at the Grand Xia; you
should know more than me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I haven’t heard of
anything either. The Ba-Serpent Formation is no ordinary formation.”
Celestial Immortal Hunchmont shook his head as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The next dawn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning arrived at the
Heavenly Treasures Mountain of Stillwtaer City. One of the
Diremonster Immortals of the Mountain, a Celestial Fox Immortal,
personally came to greet him. She was the highest-ranking member of
this branch of the Heavenly Treasures Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Ji
Ning, might I ask why you have come to my Heavenly Treasures
Mountain?” The Celestial Fox Immortal was astonishingly alluring,
and her bewitching body was sinuous and curvaceous beneath the gauze
she wore.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said, “I wish to
investigate regarding a technique known as the Ba-Serpent Formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ba-Serpent
Formation?” The Celestial Fox Immortal was startled. “Alright.
Fellow Daoist Ji Ning, wait a moment. I’ll go look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He ended up waiting
nearly a full hour.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared in
astonishment as a silver-haired man suddenly appeared before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he had gone to the
imperial capital of the Grand Xia to sell off that arrow, he had
encountered this individual, ‘Skyfox’. The reason why many of the
branches of the Heavenly Treasures Mountain of the Grand Xia Dynasty
were all managed by Celestial Foxes was precisely because the main
Heavenly Treasures Mountain was established by this individual,
Patriarch Skyfox - the silver-haired man before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Ji
Ning, you wish to learn about the Ba-Serpent Formation?” The
silver-haired man looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Skyfox, why
have you come to Stillwater?” Ning asked, surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-haired man
laughed. Ever since the Xia Emperor had become convinced that Ning
had a huge background, the Heavenly Treasures Mountain had naturally
elevated Ning’s status in their eyes to an extremely high level. He
was given more latitude than even most Celestial Immortal Patriarchs.
When he made an intelligence request, this request was instantly
relayed to the main headquarters, and once the main headquarters
knew, Patriarch Skyfox had personally hurried to Stillwater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know that you wish
to learn of the Ba-Serpent Formation, and so I came,” the
silver-haired man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Does this involve
something major?” Ning asked, surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The
silver-haired man nodded. “Very major. This intelligence report is
very precious as well. The Heavenly Treasures Mountain wouldn’t
even give this report to most Celestial Immortals…but the Xia
Emperor views you with great favor, and so we can give it to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hearing that the Xia
Emperor viewed himself with favor, Ning couldn’t help but say in a
rather helpless way, “The Xia Emperor isn’t angry at me for not
accepting Sword Immortal Evergreen as my master?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your choice of a
master is primarily your own affair. No matter what, you are still a
member of the world of the Grand Xia; you are one of our own. How
could the Xia Emperor be such a petty person?” The silver-haired
man laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly felt
relieved. He could tell that clearly, the Xia Emperor wished to
befriend him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ba-Serpent
Formation…?” Ning looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ba-Serpent
Formation. In the entire world of the Grand Xia, there is only a
single power that knows how to execute it: Bloodcloud Hall,” the
silver-haired man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bloodcloud Hall?”
Ning was puzzled; he had never heard of it before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a very
secretive assassin’s guild; the number one assassin’s guild of
the Grand Xia.” The silver-haired man waved his hand, delivering a
thick tome towards Ning. “There are a series of intelligence
reports here regarding Bloodcloud Hall, as well as the links between
them and some other hidden powers. All of these hidden powers,
including Bloodcloud Hall, belong to a single mastermind, the great
foe of the Grand Xia.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Almost all of the
information regarding the powers serving this enemy mastermind had
been recorded down in this book. This sort of intelligence report was
indeed priceless; the Xia Emperor was actually willing to let him see
it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What, don’t you
want to read it? This is a detailed report that came at a price of
countless lives. Although we aren’t able to completely uncover the
face of the enemy mastermind…we can vaguely make him out now.”
The silver-haired man continued to hold out that thick tome.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed, then
stretched his hand out and accepted it.

Chapter 27 - The Sixteenth Stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the
Nine Heavens]
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughly thirty years
ago, mysterious organizations began to appear throughout the entire
world of the Grand Xia. It seemed as though they had come from
another world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the
organizations was known as Bloodcloud Hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bloodcloud Hall was an
assassin’s guild. It didn’t participate in any political
struggles; whoever gave them treasures, they would help in carrying
out assassinations! They would assassinate anyone from puny mortals
to mighty Celestial Immortals! They could kill anyone in the entire
world of the Grand Xia, aside from the Grand Xia Emperor himself.
Ever since Bloodcloud Hall had appeared in the world of the Grand
Xia, they had delivered talismans to the various supreme marquises,
clans, tribes, and sects. Through the talisman, one could reach out
to Bloodcloud Hall and go to the legendary ‘Bloodcloud Hall world’.
There, they could offer treasures and sign agreements. Bloodcloud
Hall would then go kill their targets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the mission failed,
Bloodcloud Hall would try again. If Bloodcloud Hall chose to give up
the mission, they would return all the treasures taken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If they
succeeded…neither side would owe the other anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was another
power, one known as the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a power that
was far more mysterious than Bloodcloud Hall. The Seamless Gate had
also revealed traces of itself in the world of the Grand Xia roughly
thirty years ago. They had furiously stirred up trouble throughout
the entire world; for example, here in Stillwater Commandery, they
had gifted the Blood God Church, which had always felt hatred towards
the Northmont clan of Stillwater, with secret arts and treasures so
as to help them grow much stronger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, the Blood
God Church had been weak, and so the Blood God Church had suppressed
its hatred for the Northmont clan. Now that they had grown powerful,
and with the blandishments of the Seamless Gate…they had instantly
begun to launch frenzied attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate had
moved to seduce many powers in many places.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They would bestow
treasures and secret arts…and would reward those who killed
powerful figures! The more merits their supporters rendered, the more
gifts they would bestow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is this
Seamless Gate trying to do?” Ning read through the intelligence
report. He couldn’t help but feel dazed and tongue-tied. “They
are causing so much trouble in the entire world of the Grand Xia…they
are causing everyone to kill as many people as possible, and the more
one kills, the more treasures and secret arts one would acquire?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No one knew where the
headquarters of the Seamless Gate was located.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, no one had
even located a gathering point for the Seamless Gate. The seduced
powers all had to wait for the envoys of the Seamless Gate to
personally come visit them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate was
extremely powerful…their white-robed envoys were all Loose
Immortals and Earth Immortals, while their golden-robed envoys were
Celestial Immortals. More than three hundred different Celestial
Immortals had already been verified!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three hundred?!” A
look of utter shock appeared on Ning’s face as he read this figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Terrifying. Utterly
terrifying!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the Conclave of
Immortal Destiny, just a thousand or so Celestial Immortals had come
from throughout the Grand Xia Dynasty to the main hall of the
Skylight Palace. Of course, there were even more who had remained at
home, declining to participate, such as Celestial Immortals Hunchmont
and Unity. The Youngflame clan, in turn, had only sent Patriarch
Arcanum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire Grand Xia
Dynasty most likely had several thousand Celestial Immortals, perhaps
even as many as ten thousand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They represented the
full force available to all the marquises, schools, and sects. They
weren’t necessarily part of the imperial clan’s power! There was
a limit to how powerful the imperial clan was, and in fact there had
even been rebellions led by marquises in the past. Even powers like
the Northmont clan of Stillwater were acting in a low-key manner,
watching passively as events unfolded. There was no way they would
act in an insane manner and go serve as cannon fodder for the
imperial clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have already
discovered more than three hundred Celestial Immortals under this
single organization, the Seamless Gate. In the entire Grand Xia
Dynasty, aside from them, most likely only the imperial clan is this
powerful. None of the other clans or tribes are so strong.’ Ning
was secretly amazed by this. “No wonder not even the Xia Emperor
dares to act rashly; after all, the three hundred-plus so-called
‘golden-robed envoys’ are merely ‘envoys’; they don’t
represent the Seamless Gate’s full power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bloodcloud Hall was
willing to kill anyone for treasures; even the imperial Xia clan
could hire them to take on assassination missions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate
stirred up trouble throughout the world, causing chaos everywhere.
But no one knew anything about the true power, headquarters, or
gathering points for the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aside from these two
major powers, there were other hidden powers as well…but they were
even more low-key, showing very few traces of themselves. These two
major powers were too brash; naturally, there was a bit more
information regarding them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Be it the
already-revealed Bloodcloud Hall and Seamless Gate, or those other
hidden powers…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They shared a
commonality.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all appeared
roughly thirty years ago!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder the Xia
Emperor is being so cautious. Bloodcloud Hall and the Seamless Gate
are already terrifyingly powerful…much less the other hidden
powers,” Ning mused to himself. By now, he had finished reading the
book.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry too
much,” the silver-haired man laughed. “The person who controls
this world of the Grand Xia is still his Imperial Majesty! These
powers that are causing trouble in secret, such as the Seamless
Gate…if they truly had the power to shake the imperial clan, they
wouldn’t be hiding around furtively, not daring to show their
faces, nor would they act in such indirect ways.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was momentarily
startled, but a moment later he nodded. “Right. I understand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It made sense. Even the
likes of the Northmont clan of Stillwater had secret powers behind
them such as Patriarch Unity. As the controller of this entire major
world, and as the Grand Xia Emperor who came from the Primordial
Imperial Clan…how much power had the Xia Emperor built up over the
countless ages? The control the Grand Xia Emperor had over this
entire world was extremely deep. Just look at the Raindragon Guard!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single commandery
city had a Raindragon Guard branch, and every single Raindragon Guard
branch was comparable in power to the local marquis.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Raindragon Guard,
as a whole, possessed utterly enormous power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His Imperial Majesty
was able to bring an end to the era of Fiendgods in this world; he’s
not someone that these minor powers are capable of shaking. The storm
has yet to truly come; this is nothing but a bit of wind and a few
sprinkles of rain.” The silver-haired man smiled as he looked at
Ning. “I imagine, Ji Ning, that you now understand things a bit
better, and also see clearly the overall state of affairs here in the
world of the Grand Xia.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded. “Thank you, senior Skyfox. Oh…I should be thanking his
Imperial Majesty for allowing me to see this intelligence report. If
it wasn’t for this report, I would have no idea about what
Bloodcloud Hall was, to say nothing of the Seamless Gate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If there’s
anything you need, you can go to the imperial capital of the Grand
Xia and seek me out,” the silver-haired man said with a laugh.
“I’ll naturally do my best to help out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Definitely.” Ning
nodded, then suddenly asked, “Right, has there been any news of my
senior apprentice-sister, Yu Wei?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After Yu Wei
accompanied Patriarch Lu in leaving the world of the Grand Xia more
than thirty years ago, she has yet to return. I imagine she is still
training,” the silver-haired man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning led Uncle White
out of Stillwater City, returning to Swallow Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On this trip to the
Heavenly Treasures Mountain, he had gotten the answer he had come
for; the Ba-Serpent Formation was a formation often used by the
assassins of Bloodcloud Hall. The twelve who had tried to assassinate
Ning were then most likely assassins of Bloodcloud Hall. As for who
had invited Bloodcloud Hall to do the deed…the first thought Ning
had was of the Youngflame clan. Aside from them, Ning could think of
no others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After returning to
Swallow Mountain, Uncle White continued to lay down new formations.
He had previously only laid down a single one of the supreme killing
formations; there were two more that had yet to be laid down. As for
Ning, he focused on comprehending the Dao and training. He would
alternate between working on his sword-arts and training archery, in
accordance with [Houyi’s Archery].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was living a
peaceful life, but the world of the Grand Xia as a whole wasn’t
peaceful at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In almost every
commandery, and even in the four seas, the Seamless Gate continuously
fanned the flames of chaos. Everyone, including the members of the
imperial Xia clan as well as the various marquisates, began to grow
cautious. This was because they couldn’t tell who their enemy was;
in fact, they couldn’t even find out where their enemy was located.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And during this period
of time…the Youngflame clan was investigating Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even Bloodcloud Hall
demanded twenty top-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasures! Although
they went too far in what they asked for, based on how Bloodcloud
Hall usually prices their assassination missions, this high request
suggests exactly how difficult the target is to deal with. Ji Ning’s
power must be even greater than what we believed it to be; otherwise,
he wouldn’t have been able to withstand Bloodcloud Hall’s first
attempt.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In thirty or so
short years, he has increased his power immeasurably, compared to
back during the Conclave of Immortal Destiny. If he is permitted to
continue to develop like this…I’m afraid that in thirty more
years, it will be extremely difficult for our Youngflame clan to kill
him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He has to be
eliminated as soon as possible. Otherwise…he will cause a
disaster.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since Bloodcloud
Hall has named such a high price…let’s do it ourselves. We have
to succeed on our first try.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. We have to
plan this perfectly; we need to treat Ji Ning as we would a supreme
Celestial Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone within the
Youngflame clan acknowledged the threat Ji Ning posed to them. In
truth, ever since the Youngflame clan sent people to attempt to wipe
out the Ji clan, the hatred between the two sides had increased to a
very high level. The assassination attempt in the imperial capital of
the Grand Xia caused this feud to become even more difficult to
result.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for this
assassination attempt by Bloodcloud Hall, since Ji Ning had no other
major enemies in the Grand Xia Dynasty aside from the Youngflame
clan, he would probably quickly arrive at the right conclusion…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get rid of him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get rid of him as
soon as possible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Youngflame clan
began their investigations, but Swallow Mountain was completely
impregnable. The terrifying formations surrounding it were even more
frightening than the ones surrounding the Youngflame clan’s
headquarters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no way to
assassinate him within Swallow Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning is in
Swallow Mountain right now. We have to wait.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s wait.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s life in
Swallow Mountain wa quite relaxed. No matter how much turmoil there
was in the outside world, he just quietly trained at home.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winter passed. Spring
came. Then summer. Then late autumn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stayed at
Serpentwing Lake of Swallow Mountain this entire time!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, this entire
time, Ning had wanted to make a trip to the Eastwoods mountain range;
after all, he had suffered an attack there, and that was the only
base belonging to the mysterious power that he knew about. In
addition, based on what he saw, he believed that his opponents
shouldn’t be able to do anything to him. He naturally wanted to go
back! And by relying on his Seventy-Two Transformations, there was no
need for him to worry about his identity being exposed; he could
effortlessly penetrate their defenses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hadn’t gone.
This was because he was waiting for something; for his breakthrough
in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]! He had reached
the fifteenth level of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine
Heavens] more than ten years ago; during recent years, aside from
training in sword-arts and archery, he also trained in the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] every single day. Because
of the power of his body, energy from the Solar Star and the Lunar
Star was filling his body at a truly shocking rate…but at his
current level, each new breakthrough required a similarly shocking
amount of divine power. However, Ning could feel as though his
breakthrough was coming soon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was why he had
refrained from going to the Eastwoods mountain range; after he made a
new breakthrough and his power increased dramatically, he would have
a better chance in his investigations!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Autumn Leaf, I’m
going to rest a bit on the lake. I’ll come back at night. Prepare
some good food,” Ning said with a grin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Autumn
Leaf nodded repeatedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was standing by
the beach. As he waved his hand, a little boat appeared on the
surface of the lake. Ning took a single step forward, stepping into
the boat. The little boat then floated away towards the depths of
Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf watched
from afar. After watching for quite some time, she saw that Ning had
completely disappeared within the distant mist. Only then did she
turn and go back home.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The boat floated on the
lake. Ning lay down within the boat, almost subconsciously beginning
to absorb energy from the Solar Star and the Lunar Star.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…as if
sensing something, Ning opened his eyes. He could sense that the
divine power in his body had reached a limit. He was about to make
his breakthrough! He immediately rose to his feet, then took a single
step forward, leaving the little boat and coming to stand on the
waters of the lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From infinitely far
away, the two Supreme Stars in the void, the Solar Star and the Lunar
Star, instantly began to transmit their power through the void, all
the way down until it reached Ji Ning’s body…

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Divine Solar Tattoo
and Divine Lunar Tattoo on Ji Ning’s back began to become even more
profound and complicated. They were shining brightly, and in the area
around Ning, a golden crow that was surrounded by flames began to fly
about in a circling manner. At the same time, a jade rabbit appeared
as well, filled with an icy aura as it stared upwards into the void,
as though seeing the Lunar Star deep within the depths of infinity.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Solar Star
and Lunar Star continued to transmit a large amount of Lunar
Truewater and Solar Truefire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Water and fire meshed
together like threads being woven into a fabric. Soon, Ning became
completely surrounded by them, as though he was within a giant egg.
Within the egg, through a mysterious method that Ning couldn’t
understand, energy was being transmitted straight into his body,
rapidly and frantically changing it. His body once more began a
fundamental transformation, a transformation brought on by advancing
to a separate level in power. Even his Divine Solar Tattoo and Divine
Lunar Tattoo were beginning to transform.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Above the calm surface
of Serpentwing Lake, a three meter high ‘egg’ was hovering in the
air. One could vaguely make out that the egg was bi-colored. Although
it emanated an invisible field of terrifying power, it didn’t
disturb the surface of the water in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eggshell grew
increasingly thin and translucent. In fact, one could even vaguely
make out a human figure within it. Finally, the eggshell completely
vanished, and a completely naked youth appeared, standing on the
surface of the lake. Moments later, his body became covered with an
exquisitely sewn set of fur clothes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew. I’ve finally
reached the sixteenth stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine
Heavens].” Ning let out a sigh of relief. “I should now be
comparable to an ordinary late Void-level Fiendgod Body Refiner;
before my Fiendgod tribulation comes, I can at most train to the
seventeenth stage. I’m very close to my maximum level of power
possible, prior to my tribulation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once one reached the
eighteenth stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens],
the Empyrean Tribulation would quickly descend. Thus, prior to
attempting the tribulation, one could at most train to the
seventeenth stage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Today’s breakthrough
represented an advance to a major new level. It had thus involved a
fundamental transformation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, Ning could
at most train to the Third Cycle of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art],
because his divine body had reached a limit in power; there was no
way it could withstand any further strengthening. But now that Ning’s
divine body had fundamentally been transformed, he could train all
the way up to the Sixth Cycle of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]!
Alas…the price one would need to pay to reach the Sixth Cycle was
more than a thousandfold the price one needed for the Third Cycle!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ninth Cycle, in
turn, needed roughly a thousand times as many materials as the Sixth
Cycle! The price was heart-clenchingly high. Even Ning’s senior
apprentice-brother, Empyrean God Silvermoon, had merely trained to
the Sixth Cycle. The number of people in the Three Realms who had
reached the Ninth Cycle of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] could be
counted on one hand; they were even rarer than Daofathers or True
Gods!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For a Fiendgod Body
Refiner to advance from the early Void level to the late Void level
represents advancing across two small stages.” Ning mused to
himself, “I imagine that by now, my close combat power is probably
superior to my power as a Ki Refiner.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, as a Ki
Refiner, he could rely on his [Heavenraker] sword formation, which
was somewhat more powerful than his close combat abilities. But
Ning’s divine body was now far too powerful! It must be understood
that Fiendgod Body Refiners were powerful to begin with, and Ning was
now comparable to late Void-level Fiendgods…and he also had the
[Starseizing Hand]! In terms of raw strength alone, when he went all
out, he was even stronger than Celestial Immortals. With the
Thousandbull Sword and his various sword-arts…he would now be
considered a formidable figure, even amongst Celestial Immortals. He
was definitely better now than he was in the past, where he would be
considered a fairly low-class Celestial Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After making his
breakthrough, Ning continued to lie there within his little boat,
floating across the surface of Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like he was
‘showing off’ to his parents after having accomplished something
significant, in the hopes of earning a word of praise from them.
After increasing his level of power, Ning simply floated there in the
waters of Serpentwing Lake. He felt like he was by the side of his
parents; he wanted to let them see how strong he had become. The
gentle sounds of the waves were like the voices of his mother and
father.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My power has
increased greatly after having gone to Mount Innerheart. It is time
to take a look into what happened with my parents after they
reincarnated,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After death,
reincarnation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning naturally had been
thinking about this for quite some time now. He wanted to look into
this matter. As for his parents from his previous life? Ning wanted
to look into what happened to them as well. However, in the past,
Ning was simply too weak; there was no way he could investigate them
at all. Now, Ning could be somewhat considered a ‘powerful’
figure. Still…this was not an era of peace. In a peaceful era,
everything was under the control of the Netherworld Kingdom, making
investigations fairly simple. The Six Cycles of Reincarnation,
however, had been destroyed; it would now be far more difficult to
investigate anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Late night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning returned to
Brightmoon Island. After joining Uncle White, Little Qing, and Autumn
Leaf in eating some delicacies which Autumn Leaf had personally
prepared, Ning once more quietly slipped into his underwater estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The underwater estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
looked at Ning, then laughed. “Congratulations. You’ve broken
through to the sixteenth stage as a Fiendgod Body Refiner; this is a
major leap for you. You now have two more chances to attempt the
Wargod Hall, and can also choose yet another item from the Treasures
Hall. And…I have to say, you’ve grown remarkably patient. You
were actually able to wait until nightfall before coming here, after
you made a break through.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just chuckled. He
then asked, “Last time, I overcame the eighth floor of the Wargod
Hall; the ninth and tenth floor now await me. Senior, how good are my
chances for attempting the ninth floor?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninth floor? Mm…if
your true body and your Primaltwin join forces, you’d just barely
have a tenth of a chance, I suppose,” the giant yellow bear said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just a tenth?”
Ning was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He felt that he would
be considered formidable even amongst Celestial Immortals by now…and
he also had the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] protecting him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How good of a chance
did you think you’d have? When you overcome the ninth and tenth
floors, you’ll receive a Pure Yang treasure,” the giant yellow
bear said. “The seventh and eighth floor have Immortal-ranked
treasures as their rewards, but these two have Pure Yang treasures;
naturally, the difficulty level will have risen exponentially. Based
on my estimations…one needs to have the power of a supreme
Celestial Immortal to be absolutely sure of overcoming the ninth
floor. As for the tenth floor…you’ll need to have close to the
level of a Pure Yang True Immortal to overcome it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning blinked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ninth floor…a
supreme Celestial Immortal?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tenth floor…close
to a Pure Yang True Immortal?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew his own
limits. It must be understood that there was a huge gap between
mastering the [Three-Foot Sword] and mastering the Grand Dao of the
Sword. Thus, although in sword-arts Ning would be considered
formidable amongst Celestial Immortals and would not be considered
weak, he was still quite a ways off from the true peak of power. Most
likely, Patriarch Unity had the strength of a supreme Celestial
Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine, I won’t try
it for now. After all…I only have two chances before becoming an
Empyrean God,” Ning said. “Senior, let’s go. Let’s go to the
Treasures Hall; I want to choose my treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You should be
careful in making this choice. You wouldn’t be able to use a Pure
Yang treasure right now, even if I gave one to you…so the most
important thing for you right now is a good Immortal-ranked magic
treasure. This is your third time choosing one, and so I’ll bring
out all the Immortal-ranked magic treasures which Master left behind
and let you choose from them.” As the giant yellow bear spoke, he
led Ning to the Treasures Hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many magic
treasures within the hall were still levitating high up in the air,
emanating powerful ripples of majesty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…to the
current Ning, the ripples of power were virtually negligible. He was
now able to forcibly seize even Pure Yang treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm, here is the list
for all the Immortal-ranked treasures.” The giant yellow bear gave
Ning a thick tome listing many treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
lowered his head, beginning to flip through it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had already chosen
two Immortal-ranked magic treasures; the first time, he had chosen
the Tripartite Immortal-Locking Circlet, which was a high-grade
Immortal-ranked magic treasure which he had chosen for the express
purpose of giving it to Uncle White, which he had done so long ago.
The second time, he had chosen those nine top-grade Immortal-ranked
swords that could join together into the [Heavenraker]
sword-formation; clearly, this was a much finer treasure. As for this
third time…all of the Immortal-ranked magic treasures were now
available for his perusing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These things are way
better than the Heavenraker swords.” Ning was speechless at what he
saw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the
Heavenraker swords were excellent…compared to the truly top-notch
Immortal-ranked items which Daoist Threelives had collected, they
were far inferior. After all, those nine swords were
template-produced items.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are all the
very best available; most likely, in the current Three Realms, they
would be considered amongst the most exquisite of Immortal-ranked
treasures. When leaving them behind, Master elected not to break up
any of the sets,” the nearby giant yellow bear said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes were
shining with glee as he read through the book.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, this one!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Pentabolt Ship of
Cosmic Light: A top-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasure that could
move extremely fast, as fast as an Empyrean God or True Immortal! And
once one filled it with elemental ki, Pentabolts of Cosmic Light
could be used to attack the enemy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pentabolts of Cosmic
Light were comparable to the Divine Venomflame of the Nine Heavens in
power. If one hid within the ship, the enemies would be unable to do
anything to you, while you could release Pentabolts of Cosmic Light
to strike your opponent at your leisure! Even the vast majority of
Celestial Immortals would perish under such a wild assault; after
all, there were very few who were like Ning, who had trained in
something that was as protective as the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]. This
item alone was definitely no less valuable than a Pure Yang treasure!
This was because there were very few Pure Yang treasures that were
capable of unleashing Pentabolts of Cosmic Light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This one. This is
absolutely…” Ning’s eyes were absolutely huge right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiangang Disha net
formation 1 : This was a terrifying, large formation that was formed
by 3600 top-grade Immortal-ranked flying knives! Once the enemy was
trapped within the formation, the 3600 flying knives would wildly
attack from every direction, in such a flurry that they would be
almost impossible to block. The flying knives themselves would also
be supported by the mysteries of the formation. This set was so
powerful that if a Celestial Immortal were to possess it, it would be
enough for him to arrogantly roam the realms as he pleased. A grand
formation composed of so many top-grade Immortal-ranked flying
knives…no one would be so foolish as to accept even a standard Pure
Yang treasure in exchange for it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, these 3600
top-grade Immortal-ranked flying knives…they are considered ‘one
set’?!” Ning couldn’t believe it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the value of a
flying knife was generally a bit lower than a flying sword…3600
flying knives were equivalent to hundreds of flying swords. And the
Heavenraker swords were merely a set of nine!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course. There are
pleeenty of fine treasures here. In short, all of the fine
Immortal-ranked treasures which Master ever acquired have been left
here. Just keep looking,” the giant yellow bear said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Myriad Extermination
Needles!” Flipping through the book, Ning found the set with the
highest number of top-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a full myriad
of flying needles! Ten thousand flying needles, all contained within
a needle-box. The needle-box itself was already an extremely valuable
top-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasure which had a Dao-diagram
within it. When battle began, one would open the box, and countless
flying needles would come flying out…and the power of the
Dao-diagram was truly terrifying as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stellar Revolutions
sword-formation? Pretty formidable…but it’d be better if it had
more flying swords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Stellar Revolutions
sword-formation consisted of 360 top-grade Immortal-ranked flying
swords that were specially forged in order to unleash the Grand
Stellar Revolutions formation. Once activated, every single sword
would seem to have transformed into a star as it smashed down towards
the foe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was completely
intoxicated as he flipped through the supreme Immortal-ranked magic
treasures he found within this tome. These were the items which
Daoist Threelives had collected for the express purpose of passing
them down to his successors; they weren’t meant for any single
person, but rather an entire generation of successors. Thus, he
naturally had to prepare quite a few items.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 29 - Preparing to Head Out
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Choose carefully,”
the giant yellow bear said with a smirk. “When you come choose Pure
Yang treasures, you’ll have to wait until your third shot before
you once more see such an awesome display.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning nodded. He
understood this, of course. The first time he had chosen
Immortal-ranked magic treasures, he had only been able to choose a
high-grade treasure, the Tripartite Immortal-Locking Circlet. Only on
the second time had he been given the option of choosing the set of
Heavenraker swords. As for the third time…it had been completely
different.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first two times he
would have to choose a Pure Yang treasure, he would have to overcome
the ninth and tenth levels; the number of treasures would probably be
limited. Only after becoming an Empyrean God would he have the third
chance to choose Pure Yang treasures; only then would he have the
chance to see the most powerful treasures on offer within the entire
underwater estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the
prerequisite…becoming an Empyrean God!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean Gods were
comparable to Pure Yang True Immortals in power. To become an
Empyrean God, one would have to overcome nine nine-sets of the
thunder tribulation. In addition, given how extraordinary Ning’s
background was, with him being a successor to both Daoist Threelives
and Patriarch Subhuti…his Empyrean Tribulation would probably be
even more difficult than that of most Fiendgods. Thus, Ning didn’t
dare to be the slightest bit overconfident.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My [Greater Thousand
Swords Formation] requires a total of 729 Immortal swords. Most
likely, for the foreseeable future, I’ll be using top-grade
Immortal-ranked flying swords,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even after he became a
Celestial Immortal, it wasn’t very likely that he would be able to
acquire more than seven hundred Pure Yang treasures, even if he was
able to acquire a few.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had to become an
Empyrean God. The third chance to choose a Pure Yang treasure from
the underwater estate’s Treasure Hall…perhaps there would be a
chance. Just a chance! After all, Daoist Threelives had merely left
behind some of his stored items; he didn’t necessarily have nearly
a thousand Pure Yang flying swords that he could leave behind for use
in a formation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And in addition,
becoming an Empyrean God was far too distant a goal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning planned it, he
definitely had to let his Primaltwin undergo its tribulation first;
only then would he let his true body undergo the Celestial
Tribulation. This was because his Primaltwin was merely a Ki Refiner;
its tribulation would be a bit easier. As for his true body, a
Fiendgod Body Refiner…its tribulation would be utterly terrifying.
Since he knew that, he naturally wasn’t going to let his true body
and his Primaltwin undergo tribulations simultaneously. Ning didn’t
even dare imagine how terrifying the Celestial Tribulation would be
if he did!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, back when
he was living on Mount Innerheart, Ning had often chatted with his
senior apprentice-brother Silvermoon and the others. His various
senior apprentice-brothers had all advised him to have his Primaltwin
be the first to undergo the tribulation. That way, it would first
enter the Celestial Immortal stage, allowing him to comprehend the
Grand Dao of the Sword at a faster rate. Once his level of insight
into it became higher…after his preparations were more
thorough…only then would his true body undergo the tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three Realms are
in a state of chaos. I’ll be relying on this final set of flying
swords to protect myself! I’ll also be using them to withstand the
Celestial Tribulation!” Ning was extremely cautious and careful as
he flipped through the book, reading each page carefully. He saw many
formidable sets of powerful top-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords,
but unfortunately there were no sets of nearly a thousand top-grade
Immortal-ranked flying swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But suddenly, his eyes
lit up and came to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There it is.” Ning
revealed a look of delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Yin-Yang Duality
Thousand Supremes Formation: A sword-formation formed by a set of
five hundred extremely Yin-aligned ‘Sole-Ki Frost Swords’ and
five hundred extremely Yang-aligned ‘Qiangang Inferno Swords’.
They could combine into the Yin-Yang Duality Thousand Supremes
Formation; once formed, Yin and Yang would intersect and fire and
water would converge, annihilating all things. All of the swords were
top-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords; they could be controlled by
two different people at the same time, with one controlling the five
hundred Sole-Ki Frost Swords and the other controlling the five
hundred Qiangang Inferno Swords, with the two working together to set
up the formation. However, all thousand swords could be used by a
single person to establish the formation as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The book had quite a
few mysteries recorded within it. In fact, it even recorded one of
the major formations that could be used with this Yin-Yang Duality
Thousand Supremes Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, there were
some things regarding this formation that were never recorded down.
In truth, this sword-formation had originally been controlled by a
pair of Celestial Immortal Dao-companions. The female Immortal
controlled the Sole-Ki Frost Swords, while the male Immortal had
controlled the Qiangang Inferno Swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Controlling this many
top-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords was simply too mentally
exhausting; there were very few individuals, even amongst Celestial
Immortals, who would be able to control a thousand of these top-grade
Immortal-ranked flying swords to set up the Yin-Yang Duality Thousand
Supremes Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This formation is
far too difficult.” Ning’s face couldn’t help but change as he
read through it. “Although this formation uses swords, it actually
places a higher burden with regards to understanding the Dao of
Formations. These precious Immortal swords are actually merely used
as markers to position the formation; what a waste of fine swords!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were many
Immortals who used swords, but they weren’t necessarily Sword
Immortals!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, Immortal
Fivecraze was a wielder of Immortal swords, while Little Qing’s
weapon of choice was also an Immortal sword. Most likely, more than
half of the Loose Immortals alive all used Immortal swords as their
weapon of choice…but less than one in a thousand of them were Sword
Immortals! In this Yin-Yang Duality Formation, every single sword
served as a formation-base, allowing the establishing of a truly
enormous formation of unearthly power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only in my hands
shall you truly be able to unleash the power of a ‘sword’,”
Ning murmured to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to read.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, he finished
reading the entire book. This book had notes on quite a few sets of
Immortal swords, but there were only two sets of sword-formations
that included more than 729 swords! The swords of the Yin-Yang
Duality Thousand Supremes Formation were divided into Yin and Yang;
in terms of the Dao of Formations, Ning just so happened to be fairly
skilled in harmonizing Yin and Yang, and so he ended up choosing this
set.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This’ll be the
one,” Ning said with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The underwater estate.
The Stellar Hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was seated in the
lotus position within the thatched cottage, holding an Immortal sword
that was emanating an icy cold aura. A small, snow-white snake
suddenly appeared on the surface of the Immortal sword. “Are you
the master of myself and my many sisters?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sisters?” Ning
smiled as he gave this snow-white snake a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All five hundred of
us Sole-Ki Frost Swords are dear sisters to each other,” the little
white snake said, “While those five hundred Qiangang Inferno Swords
are our rowdy brothers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. He
pointed towards the empty air and elemental ki flew out from his
finger, forming into a series of runes. These runes emanated a
blurry, dark light as they simply hung there in the air. These had
been taught to Ning by his master, Patriarch Subhuti, in transmitting
the technique for the [Greater Thousand Swords Formation]; the Old
Patriarch had used up an enormous amount of energy in developing
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later, more
than ten thousand runes had appeared in midair, forming into a
strange, enormous Fiendgod character, ‘thousand’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Condense.” Ning
activated his elemental ki one more time. Instantly, all of the many
runes joined together, transforming into a single rune of
incomparable complexity; this was the ‘Greater Thousand Rune’.
This, too, was a simple rune-fusing technique which the Old Patriarch
had taught him. An expert in runes would be able to instantly
generate this Greater Thousand Rune; Ning, by contrast, had to first
manifest each of the small runes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Combine.” Ning
slapped his palm against the Greater Thousand Rune, then slapped the
side of the Immortal sword, pressing them together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blade of the sword
instantly began to manifest a distorted yet complicated pattern of
runes on it, and it seemed as though the aura of this Immortal sword
had grown sharper as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One down. Another!”
Ning continued to create his runes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One Immortal sword
after another was retrofitted by Ning. To the current Ning, the runes
of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] could probably be generated
with a single thought and within a single breath as he imprinted all
the swords with the Lesser Thousand Rune. However, this Greater
Thousand Rune that was created based off the [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation] and other exceptional skills that involved many treasures
was a far more complicated creature. Just setting up a single Greater
Thousand Rune required more than ten thousand smaller runes; every
single one of them far more complicated than the Lesser Thousand
Rune.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He spent a total of
three days before finally imprinting the last of the 729 Immortal
swords with the Greater Thousand Rune. As for the remaining 200+
swords, Ning temporarily put them away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise, my [Greater
Thousand Swords Formation]!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning tested time and
time again, but he realized that even with the help of the Greater
Thousand Runes, and even though the many Immortal swords would
resonate together as if they were one…his true body and his
Primaltwin, combined, were at most only able to unleash the second
level of the [Greater Thousand Swords Formation], controlling 182
top-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords! This was a maximum limit,
and if his true body needed to also spend some of its attention on
close combat…at most, he would be able to unleash the first level
of the [Greater Thousand Swords Formation].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What terrifying
power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hundred-plus
top-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords, even without using any
formations, just chopping wildly, still made for an awe-inspiring
sight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By relying on the power
of the [Greater Thousand Swords Formation], they could merge their
power together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In an instant, Ning’s
power as a Ki Refiner once more surpassed his true body’s close
combat power as a Fiendgod Refiner!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After making his
breakthrough, Ning remained at Swallow Mountain for a few more times,
carefully testing his close combat power and his [Greater Thousand
Swords Formation]. After stabilizing at his latest level of
power…Ning finally left Swallow Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Flamedoor Commandery.
The air above Weirflow City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was dawn. The air
above Weirflow was cold and crisp. A faint spatial ripple suddenly
appeared, then a fur-clad youth emerged from within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time, Ning had
come alone, primarily because he was relying on the ‘Seventy-Two
Transformations’ for his investigations; it wouldn’t be
appropriate for him to bring Uncle White and the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Last time, I fled a
million kilometers through teleportation; I ended up arriving here,
at Weirflow. My original predictions was the mountain range I was in
was the Eastwoods mountain range, but I don’t know if that was a
correct guess or not.” Ning smiled. “Time to go test it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning flew straight
towards the direction he had fled from previously. While flying, he
would occasionally do a short ten-kilometer teleportation. Soon, Ning
verified that his original hypothesis was indeed correct; that place
was indeed the Eastwoods mountain range of the Eastwoods Sect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Eastwoods Sect?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How should I get
in?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Should I change into
a bug? But the Eastwoods mountain range is protected by formations;
if a mosquito or bug was able to break through it, others would
probably notice.” Ning frowned in a pondering manner…then decided
to begin the area surrounding the Eastwoods mountain range. “I
refuse to believe that not a single disciple of a major school such
as this would enter or leave from time to time!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning first went to the
Heavenly Treasures Mountain to buy some reports regarding the experts
of the Eastwoods Sect, so that he might be able to recognize their
important figures. Ning then set up watch outside the Eastwoods
mountain range, often using the [Torch-Dragon’s Eye] to search the
surrounding area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning searched for three
full days.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are venerable
Primal Daoists, but we are now in such a sorry state that all we can
do is act as messenger dogs and servants. We have to buy Immortal
nectar, Immortal fruit, and all sorts of other queer marvels and
strange beasts to be butchered and cooked. How sad!” A large
warship descended, and two Immortal practitioners walked out from
within it, walking side-by-side, chatting mentally to each other.
They were so cautious that they used mental messages to carry out
their grumblings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even the sect leader
is summoned willy nilly by them; what can Primal Daoists like us do
about it? Forget it. Just endure it. Didn’t that general himself
say that he would definitely leave within a thousand years and give
us our freedom back?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll probably
have died before then.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two Primal Daoists
were complaining. Tens of thousands of kilometers away from them,
there sat a fur-clad youth in the lotus position. His eyes were
glowing with torch-light, and as he saw them from afar, a look of
delight instantly appeared on his face. “Hey, aren’t those two
the Primal Daoists of the Eastwoods Sect? I knew it; an enormous clan
that’s taken up a hundred thousand kilometers of space definitely
has people entering and leaving it. It seems I need to rely on them
to get inside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly
disappeared as he executed a void blink, stealthily moving closer to
them.
</P>

Chapter 30 - Within the Eastwoods Sect
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two Primal Daoists
walked forward, shoulder-to-shoulder. Suddenly, a light flashed in
front of them, then a fur-clad youth appeared out of nowhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who are you?” The
faces of the two Primal Daoists changed as they shouted
simultaneously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! An incomparably
terrifying majesty swept out from Ji Ning’s body, and space within
three thousand meters became completely frozen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wind halted. The
swaying grass froze mid-sway. The hopping grasshoppers paused
mid-jump. The flowing waters of the nearby creek stopped in its
tracks. Even the beads of water spraying into the air from the creek
just hovered there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of the two
Primal Daoists were completely filled with terror and shock…but
they, too, were completely unable to move. When that terrifying Dao
Domain descended, they were completely unable to resist at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Back when he had been
in the Crescent world, Ning had been able to use his Dao Domain to
easily render a squad of Flamewing Guards completely helpless. By
comparison, these two Primal Daoists were actually slightly weaker
than the Flamewing Guards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In you go.” Ning
waved his hand, and an irresistible force drew those two individuals
into his mobile Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning swept the
surrounding region with his gaze; when making his move, he had been
extremely cautious. He had kept his Dao Domain to a radius of merely
three thousand meters, not affecting the area beyond this region at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within his mobile
Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two Primal Daoists
stared at their surroundings in terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is this place?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where are we?!
This…can this be a mobile Immortal estate?!” The two Primal
Daoists, upon viewing their surroundings, could only think of this
one possibility.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Easthill, who was
that youth? How is it that he was able to render us completely
helpless merely through using his Dao Domain? Can he be a Celestial
Immortal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He most likely is on
their level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These two Primordial
Daoists were filled with terror and worry. The enemy’s power was
simply too great; they weren’t able to fight back against him at
all. Not even the more powerful Loose Immortals of their Eastwoods
Sect was capable of using a simple Dao Domain to render them
completely helpless; clearly, this youth’s Dao Domain had surpassed
that of virtually every single member of the Eastwoods Sect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you.”
The black-robed Ning appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, why have you
seized the two of us?” One of the two Primal Daoists, a tall,
skinny man, hurriedly spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, if there’s
anything you need from us, just tell us,” the other Primal Daoist,
a man with triangular pupils, said quickly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
smiled. “It is simple. I want to soul-scour the two of you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Soul-scour?!” The
two instantly revealed looks of terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soul-scouring. If one
was lucky, one might be able to maintain their ordinary faculties, at
most losing a few of their memories. But if one was unlucky…they
might be turned into idiots!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you
should know that killing you is effortless for me,” the black-robed
Ning said. “I can forcibly soul-scour you, but as you should know,
doing that would be quite damaging to you, possibly resulting in the
two of you being turned into idiots. Thus…I hope that the two of
you will accept it and won’t fight back. That way…your
Primal-level souls should be able to maintain normalcy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two Primal Daoists
exchanged a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They felt helpless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why were they so damn
unlucky?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They knew very well
that if they were to resist and be forcibly soul-scoured…then
things would be even more disastrous for them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We accept. Senior,
please spare our lives,” the two said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. I
won’t kill you,” the black-robed Ning said. In truth, based on
the intelligence reports which Ning had received from the Heavenly
Treasures Mountain, these two had done quite a few evil deeds. Given
Ning’s usual temperament, he would’ve killed them long ago…but
if he did, then the life-tablets of the two within the Eastwoods Sect
would shatter, and the Sect would know that they died. Once that
happened, his plan would fail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two Primal Daoists
closed their eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
stretched out his hand, placing it atop the head of the tall, skinny
Primal Daoist. He immediately used the ‘Thousand Stars Soulscour’
technique; this technique was a soulscouring technique which he had
acquired in the Crescent world after killing that evil Patriarch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later…Ning
lowered his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A look of joy appeared
within the eyes of the tall, skinny Primal Daoist. “I’m fine. I’m
fine!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I told you. If you
don’t resist at all, your soul will find it easier to maintain its
normalcy, and in fact very few memories will be lost.” The
black-robed Ning looked towards the other person, the
triangle-pupiled Primal Daoist. That Primal Daoist closed his eyes as
well, accepting the soulscouring. Ning walked over to him, placing
his palm atop his head as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the base of the
Eastwoods mountain range.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So the two of them
were so spineless,” Ning mused to himself. Waving his hand, he
produced a sack that was filled with the items that had been
purchased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughly thirty years
ago, the Eastwoods Sect had suffered a calamity. The majority of its
tougher figures were all wiped out, while a few who were able to
suppress their anger were able to survive. They all hoped for freedom
to come. However…the Eastwoods Sect also had some spineless figures
who even helped the mysterious power act against their fellow
disciples!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Easthill and
Daoist Eastharm were two such spineless figures! They abused their
former ‘fellow disciples’, currying favor with the mysterious
figures as if they were dogs!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Naturally, this
resulted in the two of them being viewed with favor, and they were
even allowed to go out and shop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they did their
utmost to please, the mysterious power still viewed them as nothing
more but dogs. They were absolutely forbidden from going near the
most important ‘forbidden region’; in fact, even the Eastwoods
sect leader was forbidden from entering it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A mysterious power?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The leader is a
‘general’? Supposedly at the Celestial Immortal level?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A forbidden region?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After finishing the
soulscouring, Ning immediately began to pay attention to this
supposed ‘forbidden region’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The forbidden region
was simply too mysterious. After taking over the Eastwoods mountain
range, the mysterious power had designed a certain part of it as a
‘forbidden region’, with many people being sent within it. In
fact, even that ‘general’ would often go inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Change!” Ning
instantly changed, transforming into the appearance of that tall,
skinny Primal Daoist - Daoist Easthill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately headed
straight towards the entrance to the Eastwoods Sect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daoist Easthill has
returned? Where is Daoist Eastharm?” One of the two gate guards
asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It has been a long
time since Daoist Eastharm returned to his tribe, so he made a side
trip this time. I came back first,” Ning said with a smile. Due to
the soulscouring, Ning now knew well that these spineless figures
were rather trusted, and so they were often allowed to return to
their tribes. That way, the spies of the imperial Xia clan wouldn’t
notice anything strange about the Eastwoods Sect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Otherwise…if all of a
sudden, no members of the Eastwoods Sect were returning to their
clans…in an era like this, when the Three Realms were in a state of
turmoil, the imperial Xia clan would definitely investigate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled as he
spoke, then walked in. In a very familiar manner, he walked through
the various formations. He knew exactly how to bypass them, because
of what he had learned through the soulscouring.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon ‘returning’ to
the Eastwoods Sect and handing over the purchased items, Ning chatted
for a while with some of the cultivators of the Eastwoods Sect, then
went to the residence of Daoist Easthill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Change!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A mosquito flew out
from Daoist Easthill’s residence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mosquitos were
extremely common; even if one were to wipe out a swathe of them, the
next night many more would most likely appear, especially since the
Eastwoods Sect was located within a mountain forest. Ning, in the
shape of a mosquito, flew closer and closer to the ‘forbidden
region’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The forbidden region
was layered with increasingly powerful formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The mosquito-Ning was
forced to come to a halt outside the formations, landing on the
ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Step closely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up. Keep in
line! We’re about to enter the formation. If you get out of line,
you’ll be trapped within the eighteen great formations. I really
don’t want to have to go find those guys and ask them to save you.”
A group of black-robed figure was flying towards the formation, with
the one in the very rear urging them to move faster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whap.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As they walked forward,
the foot of one of the black-robed figures was stained with a speck
of mud. This mud was the transformed Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not even Immortal
cultivators would constantly use their power to dissipate the dust
and mud from their feet with every step; how tiring would that be?!
As the group of black-robed figures advanced through the region,
carefully passing through all eighteen formations, the bit of ‘mud’
staining one of their feet was also brought through the eighteen
formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After passing through
the formations…they entered the ‘forbidden zone’. There were
many roving patrols here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The mosquito-Ning was
flying through the forbidden region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place truly is
guarded tightly. What’s going on here?” The mosquito-Ning flew
into a gorge with many mosquitos, maintaining the speed of an
ordinary mosquito. “The deeper I go into this gorge, the tighter
the guard becomes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within the gorge,
there was a castle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The castle was covered
with a layer of light which not even mosquitos could pass into. The
number of black-robed figures patrolling this place was simply
astonishing. All of them emanated auras of tremendous power, at least
at the Earth Immortal or Loose Immortal level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Some of the
black-robed figures are merely at the Wanxiang or Primal level…but
the ones guarding this castle are all Loose Immortals, and there are
more than a hundred of them?” Ning was secretly speechless. More
than a hundred Loose Immortals were standing guard outside; the
number of true guardians must definitely be even greater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This castle…?”
The mosquito-Ning landed, staring at the distant castle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He waited until
nightfall, until a group of gray-robed figures came walking out from
within the castle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Finally, someone
came out from the castle. These people have fairly powerful auras;
they seem to all be Earth Immortals or Loose Immortals. Heeeey…why
are they all…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly
discovered, to his astonishment, that each of the gray-robed figures
had looks of exhaustion on their faces. Their exhaustion was so
evident that Ning could sense it from a great distance away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are all Loose
Immortals or Earth Immortals; how could they become so tired?” Ning
couldn’t believe it; Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals had very
strong minds. Only if their mental energy was utterly exhausted would
they appear like this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mental exhaustion
usually wasn’t that important to Immortals. But if it reached a
certain level…it could become quite terrifying. For example, if an
Immortal, in order to produce a powerful magic treasure, was to work
day and night and use up all his blood and effort, he might even
perish; this sort of event happened quite often within the Three
Realms. Generally speaking, after Immortal cultivators grew tired,
they would rest and relax for a time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can they be so
exhausted? And it’s not just one or two of them, but an entire
group?” Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stupefied!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Towards the back of
that squad of gray-robed figures, there was a fairly small, skinny
gray-robed figure who woodenly walked forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior…junior
apprentice-brother?!” Ning stared in disbelief. That gray-robed
figure was Ning’s junior apprentice-brother, a person he was
incomparably familiar with…it was Mu Northson, who had been missing
for more than twenty years!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mu Northson!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Years ago, he had found
a Dao-compainion and begun to enjoy a happy life. But soon…his
Dao-companion perished, and he himself had vanished as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Black-White College
had searched for him but was unable to find him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had never
imagined…that here, within the Eastwoods mountain range, he would
run into his junior apprentice-brother! Even less did he imagine that
his junior apprentice-brother would end up looking like this!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His body, beneath that
gray robe, had become even thinner and frailer. He clearly had the
aura of a Loose Immortal or Earth Immortal…but Ning could not sense
any power at all coming from him. All he could sense was that his
junior apprentice-brother was like a sputtering candle that could go
out at any moment. His lifeforce was extremely weak, and waves of
exhaustion flowed out from him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The frailness was just
a minor matter; what really mattered was that Ning couldn’t sense
any vigor at all coming from his junior apprentice-brother. It seemed
as though the vigorous, lively youth had completely disappeared,
transforming into someone who seemed like an old man that was on the
verge of death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His face was ashen, and
his hair was a complete mess. In fact, he even had quite a few white
hairs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother…” Ning felt that the white hairs were
particularly painful for him to see.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For an Earth Immortal
or Loose Immortal, there was only one reason a person would develop
white hairs, unless they intentionally used a technique to change it;
utter mental exhaustion. If one was utterly mentally exhausted, one’s
hair might even turn completely white within a single night…or even
perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What on earth
happened?” Ning was truly stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His memories remained
so clear and vivid…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My name is Mu
Northson?” That youthful white-robed youngster had been so full of
vigor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My name is Ji Ning.
I’m sixteen this year. How old are you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fourteen.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That was their first
meeting. That bashful, youthful figure…Ning remembered it all as if
it was yesterday.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, I’ll go with you. Going with you and fleeing
together is bound to be an exciting life.” When Ning had killed
Youngflame Nong, his junior apprentice-brother had shown no
hesitation at all; he had been filled with energy and determination,
even in the face of life as a refugee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What…what in the
world has caused junior apprentice-brother to become like this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
gray-robed Mu Northson…at the decrepit, exhausted Mu Northson.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The group of gray-robed
figures walked past. Mosquitos flew about within the gorge, with one
of them flying behind the gray-robed figures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You only have two
hours to rest,” a black-robed figure barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The group of gray-robed
figures began to separate, each returning to his own residence. The
gray-robed Northson began to move towards his residence, one of the
many residences in this area. He pushed open the door, entered, then
shut the door.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a room in his
residence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson sat in front
of a wooden desk. He picked up a canteen of water, pouring himself a
cup, then began to quietly drink it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was quiet.
Terrifyingly quiet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only sound within
the room was that of the quiet gurgling of water. Northson then put
the cup down silently, then sat there wordlessly, not saying a single
thing. His gaze was straight forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Northson
suddenly waved his hand, and a blocking formation suddenly appeared
within the room. He then waved his hand again, and a wooden figurine
appeared. This was the figurine of a woman, and it was very lifelike.
Northson stared at th figurine, then placed it on the table. Waving
his hand again, he produced another block of wood, then began to
carve it with a small knife. He carved in a very slow manner, sending
wood chips flying everywhere as the block of wood began to gradually
be formed into a woman’s appearance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, the sculpting
was complete.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He placed the wooden
sculpture on the desk, then stared at it. Simply stared at it in a
daze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother!” Suddenly, a voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A fur-clad youth
appeared within the room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That familiar voice
seemed to summon suppressed memories from deep within the soul of Mu
Northson. He raised his head to look…and was suddenly arrested. His
entire body became completely frozen. He just stared at the fur-clad
youth who was standing there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those familiar furs…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That familiar
appearance…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That familiar voice…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those eyes…that gaze…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, senior
apprentice-brother?” A very dry, rusted voice emerged from
Northson’s throat, as though it had been a long time since he had
spoken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother. Junior apprentice-brother!” Ning stared at his
junior apprentice-brother, his eyes moist. “What has happened?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson looked at
Ning. Stared at him. His tears suddenly came cascading down. He
opened his mouth, wanting to cry, but nothing came out. His body just
shuddered, his tears continuing to flow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hurriedly stepped
forward, embracing Northson.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cry, cry. Let it
out. Don’t keep it suppressed in your heart. Let it all come out.”
Ning’s own eyes were red as he spoke softly. He could sense the
endless pain suppressed within his junior apprentice-brother’s
heart. He couldn’t even imagine…he didn’t even want to
imagine…what his junior apprentice-brother had experienced over
these years. What in the world had caused his junior
apprentice-brother, whose Dao-heart had been so strong, to become
like this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense his
junior apprentice-brother’s body trembling within his arms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt as though his
own heart was trembling as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What had happened?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What had happened!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why had it ended up
this way?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let it all come out.
Don’t keep it suppressed in your heart. Cry it all out. Your senior
apprentice-brother is here. Now that I’m here, it will all come to
an end. It will all end,” Ning said, holding his junior
apprentice-brother’s shuddering body in his arms. His junior
apprentice-brother’s tears flowed onto his clothes, even onto his
neck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could feel his
junior apprentice-brother’s tears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AHHHH!!!!” An
agonized cry finally ripped through the room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AHHH….AHHHHHHH!!!!!”
Northson’s cries carried a sound of utter desolation and
hoarseness. He sobbed furiously, howled agonizingly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning tightly held his
beloved friend in his arm, listening to his cries. He could sense the
bottomless, endless depths of pain, misery, grief, and despair
explode forth from the cries. Ning tightly held his dear brother, his
own heart shaking. He felt as though his own heart was being stabbed
by knives.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Splitting pain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What had happened? That
young white-robed youth, the one who could ignore even the threat of
death and choose to follow Ning in fleeing across the world…what
had changed him so?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I swear!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter who did
it! No matter who they are…all of them…each of them…every last
one of them…they will all die. ALL OF THEM WILL DIE!!!” Ning held
his sobbing junior apprentice-brother, his own tears falling down as
he swore an oath in his mind.
