Chapter 1 - The Full Story
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The pain and despair
that he had suppressed for so many years all came howling out with
his cries. Slowly, Mu Northson regained his faculties and let go of
Ji Ning. “Senior apprentice-brother, I’m fine now. I wasn’t
able to control myself just now; I made a fool of myself in front of
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re brothers;
why say such things?” Ning looked towards Northson. “Junior
apprentice-brother, tell me - what happened?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing.” Northson
shook his head. “What was to happen already has.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson looked at
Ning. “Senior apprentice-brother, how did you get here? This is a
forbidden region that is tightly guarded; not even Celestial
Immortals can barge their way inside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at his
tired, downtrodden junior apprentice-brother. He felt pain in his
heart; at a time like this, his junior apprentice-brother was
actually refusing to say anything. Ning immediately said, “I know
this is a forbidden region. I also know…that this is the Flamedoor
Commandery’s Eastwoods mountain range. Given my abilities, if I
want to enter this place, no one will be able to find out. Junior
apprentice-brother, tell me…what has happened?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to ask.”
Northson shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I was faced with
this situation, wouldn’t you ask?” Ning rebutted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson was startled.
It was true. They were like brothers; if Ning was in such a dire
situation, Northson wouldn’t be able to ignore it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tell me,” Ning
said earnestly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother.” Northson looked at Ning. “Telling you would
be harming you. I’ve already been damned; I don’t want you to be
damned as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood that
this must certainly involve an important matter; the number of Loose
Immortals around that castle was enough to tell Ning that the amount
of power that had been gathered here in the Eastwoods mountain range
alone was on the same level as the power available to the Northmont
clan of Stillwater; in fact, it might even be greater. As for the
great power behind this place…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, don’t underestimate me. You know very well that
this is a forbidden region which is not easily entered, but I still
managed to make it in. I’m no longer the same person I was,” Ning
said earnestly. “After the Conclave of Immortal Destiny, I joined a
Daofather’s school and became the Daofather’s disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Old Patriarch had
only forbidden Ning from saying that he was his disciple; so long as
Ning didn’t say the words ‘Patriarch Subhuti’, he wouldn’t be
violating his master’s orders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Northson
was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve trained for
thirty-plus years and my power has increased greatly. I finally
managed to obtain permission from Master to return to the Grand Xia.”
Ning looked at Northson. “Even if I truly do encounter any danger,
my master will intervene and rescue me. The world of the Grand Xia
currently truly is filled with dangerous undercurrents, and there is
even a hidden power that is capable of fighting against the Grand Xia
Emperor himself. But if my master was to intervene, he would be able
to save my life with utter ease…and thus, there is nothing for you
to worry about.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson was dazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You don’t believe
me? Take a look!” Ning waved his hand. Instantly, one top-grade
Immortal-ranked flying sword after another appeared, clustered
together in a tight pile. Because they all had to be kept within this
room, they were all piled on top of one another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These…” Northson
could sense the power of these top-grade Immortal-ranked flying
swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You should be
capable of recognizing these for what they are by now,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Top-grade
Immortal-ranked flying swords?” Northson guessed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
“There are a thousand here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson’s throat
clenched. Even though he was here in this forbidden region where he
had seen a fraction of the true strength of this mysterious power…he
was still stunned by Ji Ning! Top-grade Immortal-ranked flying
swords…every single one of them was extremely valuable. A set of a
thousand was utterly inconceivable!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After I left my
master’s tutelage, my master gifted them to me.” Ning looked at
Northson. “In addition, I was able to easily enter this forbidden
region. Do you believe me now?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson was beginning
to be moved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take a look at
this.” Ning’s body flickered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish. He transformed
into another Mu Northson, dressed in the same gray robes, with the
same exhausted complexion and some white hairs on his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But, but…”
Northson stared in disbelief at Ning. “Even the aura is absolutely
identical…even the amount of karmic virtue is the same! This cannot
be!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why can’t it be?
Change again!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning then transformed
into Immortal Fivecraze, then into the Fiendgod Xiangliu Fang, then
into Youngflame Nong, then into Celestial Immortal King Yan…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He quickly transformed
into more than ten figures the two both recognized before changing
back into his normal appearance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you still
worried about me?” Ning looked at Northson.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I believe you when
you say that you took on a Daofather as your master. I’ve never
even heard of a transformation ability like this one.” Northson
nodded, then said in a low voice, “I know that you, senior
apprentice-brother, definitely wish to understand everything which
happened. Fine…I’ll talk.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a sigh of
relief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson sat down. “We
still have slightly less than an hour…so I’ll start from when I
met Yu Xia. Years ago, in Stillwater City, I met Yu Xia. She was a
disciple of the Thousand Rivers Sect, but was filled with curiosity
towards the Dao of Constructs. But naturally, her ability in the Dao
of Constructs was far inferior to mine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the death of his
master, Northson could be considered the number one expert in the Dao
of Constructs within the Black-White College! This was because there
were very few people within the College who trained in this Dao, and
also because he truly did have a high amount of talent within this
Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yu Xia would often
ask me for guidance, and I’d give her advice.” A hint of a smile
appeared on Northson’s face. “After a long time…the two of us
ended up together, becoming Dao-companions. Those were the happiest
days of my life; I felt carefree and without any worries. Alongside
my Dao-companion, I continued to study the Dao of Formations in a
content, relaxed manner.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yu Xia and I lived
in an out-of-the-way place, atop a wild prairie. We built a house
next to a lake, and we lived a peaceful life there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wish so deeply…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…to have been able
to live there forever.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson shut his eyes.
“But then…that day came. A group of black-robed men arrived, all
of them Loose Immortals, and formidable ones at that. Yu Xia was
merely a Wanxiang Adept, while I had just broken through to become a
Primal Daoist. The two of us were completely unable to fight back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was captured. Yu
Xia was killed. After she died, her soul wasn’t permitted to be
reborn; rather, it was captured as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s pupils shrank.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even after Yu Xia died,
her soul had still been captured?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was brought here,”
Northson said. “Brought here, to this forbidden region. The people
in this region ordered me to help them build constructs.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Build constructs?”
Ning instantly understood. “Those other gray-robed figures…they
were also brought here because they were skilled in the Dao of
Constructs?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. There are
more than one hundred grandmasters of the Dao of Constructs in this
area,” Northson said. “They’ve all been brought here. I suspect
that the Eastwoods mountain range is a gathering point for the
mysterious power behind this place, for more than a hundred nearby
commanderies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned. “One of
the gathering points? You know of other gathering points?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have some
guesses,” Northson said. “During these years, I’ve seen seven
generals come to this place. ‘General’ is a fairly high rank
here, and all of them were at the Celestial Immortal level. The
Eastwoods mountain range has a general who is permanently stationed
here, but on multiple occasions there have been other generals who
escorted deliveries of treasures to this place. In total, I’ve seen
twelve different generals!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twelve Celestial
Immortals? And this was just the tip of the iceberg!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are asking you
to create constructs?” Ning asked. “What sort of construct?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An extremely large
one.” A look of disbelief was in Northson’s eyes. “This power
has an extremely deep level of understanding regarding the Dao of
Constructs; their understanding, compared to the secret arts recorded
down within our Black-White College regarding the Dao of Constructs,
must be billions or even trillions of times greater!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was rather stunned
upon hearing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Billions? Trillions?!
This was too insane.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t think I’m
just talking,” Northson immediately said. “I feel that I am an
extremely talented person with regards to the Dao of Constructs, but
when I first came, they taught me some construct-creation methods
that they felt were fairly low-level. When creating the constructs, I
was inspired by the mysteries and profoundness of them, causing my
level of insight into the Dao of Constructs to rapidly increase.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As my level of
insight increased, they began to let me create increasingly more
powerful constructs. They also bestowed liquefied elemental essence
upon me, allowing me to reach the Void level and become an Earth
Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now, within this
forbidden region, I can be ranked amongst the top hundred
grandmasters of the Dao of Constructs,” Northson said. “Right
now, the other grandmasters and myself are currently working together
to forge an incomparably massive construct. It should be the most
powerful Fiendgod Golem this forbidden region is producing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grandmaster of the
Dao of Constructs?” Ning could hardly believe it. His junior
apprentice-brother had advanced so quickly?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother…you have no idea what life here has been like,”
Northson said. “They squeeze every single drop of usable energy out
of you, forcing you to go all out to construct new constructs! But
every single powerful construct expands our horizons as well. As for
the most powerful Fiendgod Golem we are currently creating…that’s
even more terrifying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How terrifying?”
Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Below the level of
True Immortals or Empyrean Gods…it is all but invincible,”
Northson said seriously. “If a Celestial Immortal was controlling
it, not even ten or a hundred Celestial Immortals fighting together
would be able to stop it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was incomparably
shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be so
shocked. The slightly weaker golems which the other grandmasters and
myself have been constructing, when controlled by Loose Immortals,
all have the combat power of Celestial Immortals.” Northson sighed,
“You have no idea what a deep level of understanding of the Dao of
Constructs this organization has. Those construct formation-diagrams
are incomparably profound; in terms of better understanding the Dao
of Constructs, every single diagram is like a supreme treasure to us.
And here, I’ve already seen more than a thousand such construct
formation-diagrams…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded gently. “So
this forbidden region is being used to produce constructs…but can
it be that everyone is just willing to work here?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can we be
‘willing’?” Northson said with grief, “Nobody is ‘willing’.
Creating these top-tier golems is extremely difficult, and it uses up
a tremendous amount of our mental energy. And yet, we are still
having the life squeezed out of us; the amount of time for rest we
have been given is growing less and less.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We all hate them for
kidnapping us, and in fact many wish to die. I originally wanted to
die as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…Yu Xia’s
soul is in their hands,” Northson said. “If I diligently work to
create golems, I can go visit her once a month and speak with her.
But if I dare to commit suicide…once I die, they will torment her
soul for thousands on thousands of years, never giving her a chance
to be reborn.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but shiver. Never be given the chance to be reborn?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I do not dare kill
myself.” Northson laughed bitterly. “Their general, however, has
voluntarily sworn an oath to the Dao of the Heavens that if we stay
here and peacefully build these constructs, within a thousand years
we will be granted our freedom, and the soul of our loved one will be
released as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Freedom?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A thousand years?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood now. In
one hand, a big stick; in the other hand, a carrot. Although the
people here were being tormented and exhausted, they still saw hope,
and so they were able to endure.

Chapter 2 - The Rescue Plan
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning now knew about
all the twists and turns that had led to the current situation. He
immediately said, “Junior apprentice-brother, I’ll come up with a
way to save your Dao-companion’s soul, then lead you away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although his heart was
filled with a desire for murder, Ning knew very well that the truly
important thing was to rescue his junior apprentice-brother and the
soul of Yu Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s useless.”
Mu Northson shook his head. “There’s no way I can leave the
forbidden region.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why?!” Ning
hurriedly asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This mysterious
power seems to be worried that we might have a Greater Teleportation
Dao-seal hidden within our Zifu region; without killing us, there’s
no way they can find out,” Northson said. “To prevent us from
escaping, when they caught us, they forced us to swear oaths to the
Dao of the Heavens that unless they voluntarily grant us freedom, if
we are to flee this place and go beyond the confines of the Eastwoods
mountain range, we shall have our souls shattered.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning was
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was going to be
trouble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We only have two
paths before us. The first path is the path of death, followed by the
souls of our loved ones suffering for countless ages, never to be
reborn! The second path is to swear the oath to the Dao of the
Heavens, then obediently work hard. Those of us who did not commit
suicide…we are all hoping for our final freedom,” Northson said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded lightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aside from the tight
watch they maintained, they had also forced Northson and the others
to swear oaths to the Dao of the Heavens not to flee. Quite cautious
indeed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You said…‘unless
they voluntarily grant you freedom’?” Ning suddenly asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right,” Northson
said. “After all, the general himself also swore an oath to the Dao
of the Heavens to free us within a thousand years. If we are to never
be given freedom, many people would likely choose suicide instead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning pondered for a
moment, then said, “Right…earlier, you said that you and the
other grandmasters are pooling your abilities to create an
incomparably terrifying Fiendgod Golem…and that if a Celestial
Immortal was to command it, it could be described as invincible
against any foes beneath the True Immortal or Empyrean God level!
Then the creation of this golem must be very hard, right? The
materials are quite precious?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were quite a few
Celestial Immortals who had Pure Yang treasures. For this Fiendgod
Golem to be referred to as ‘invincible against any foes beneath the
True Immortal or Empyrean God level’ had to mean that it was vastly
more valuable than any ordinary Pure Yang treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The creation is
indeed quite difficult.” Northson nodded. “Although all of us are
Loose Immortals or Earth Immortals, and have detailed blueprints, the
golem formation-diagrams within…they are simply unfathomably
profound. We grandmasters are like a horde of ants, diligently
working away at the task. We’ve spent more than twelve years on it,
but we’ve managed to finish more than half of the Fiendgod Golem. I
trust that in two or three more years, we’ll have finished it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for the
materials? They are naturally of enormous value. This mighty golem
has extremely exacting standards when it comes to its materials;
weaker materials are completely unable to withstand the power that
will be circulated through it via the mighty formation-diagrams. To
put it another way…this Fiendgod Golem is the most important task I
have been given since I was brought here! All of the grandmasters
have joined forces to work on it, while the ordinary golem-masters
are merely working on secondary constructs instead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded lightly.
“All the grandmasters have joined forces and have spent twelve
years on it? Most of you, when first arriving, must have been at a
comparatively low level of skill in the Dao of Constructs. By working
on secondary constructs, your skill began to slowly rise to the level
of a grandmaster…which is to say, the main purpose this forbidden
region has had over the past thirty years was to produce this golem!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Northson
nodded in agreement. “As for the precious materials, they are
escorted here by other generals. One time, seven generals came
together in escorting a shipment.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course that was how
it had to be. A construct meant for a Celestial Immortal to control,
that was invincible against all other Celestial Immortals. A few
dozen or a hundred such Fiendgod Golems would probably be enough to
completely sweep through the entire world of the Grand Xia! Ning was
now a disciple of Patriarch Subhuti and had a certain level of
insight into the world…but golems as terrifying as these probably
were superior to even top-grade Pure Yang treasures!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were truly
priceless!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since you are here
working on this golem, then you definitely will come into contact
with it,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Northson
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good. Then I’ll
make a trip with you…and I’ll take away the Fiendgod Golem when
the time is right,” Ning said confidently. “I’ll threaten that
‘general’ and force him to release you and Yu Xia’s soul.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How would you enter?
What will you transform into? That castle is extremely tightly
guarded; no living creatures are allowed in, not even mosquitos,”
Northson said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll change into…”
Ning laughed. “…a hair on your head.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hair?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson was
speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. Swish! He
disappeared into thin air, and then an extra hair appeared on top of
Northson’s head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you think,
junior apprentice-brother?” Ning’s voice echoed out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson, amazed,
reached out with his hand to stroke this additional strand of hair
that had just appeared. “You can do this?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was indeed a
flawless plan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning reappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you transform
into my hair…there’s no way I could recognize you. But is it
possible that someone within the castle might detect you?” Northson
asked, worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even True Immortals
and Empyrean Gods will be unable to detect me,” Ning said
confidently. The ‘Seventy-Two Transformations’ was no ordinary
divine ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Northson
revealed a look of delight. “The other grandmasters and I are
working in a region deep within that castle, where we are forging
that Fiendgod Golem. That region is primarily meant for us
grandmasters; there are only two guards there. No one else will go
there to disturb us. Since there’s no way for us to escape, they
aren’t worried about us at all. So long as you go…you’ll be
able to easily capture that Fiendgod Golem.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But senior
apprentice-brother!” Northson said with worry. “Once you seize
it, everyone in the castle will know right away. In fact, even that
general will immediately be aware of it. If you threaten them, they
might just kill you, then take the Fiendgod Golem back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill me?” Ning
shook his head. “They won’t be able to kill me…so they will
have to choose to lower their heads.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All he had to do was
enter his mobile Immortal estate for just a brief moment, then
immediately use a Greater Teleportation Dao-seal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enemies would
probably truly be forced to lower their heads!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson began to grow
excited as well. His senior apprentice-brother’s plan was indeed
workable. He hurriedly said, “We have to first acquire Yu Xia’s
soul. I’m not afraid of death, but I’m terrified of the thought
that Yu Xia’s soul will be tormented for countless ages.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled for a
moment, then nodded. “Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could threaten them
and force them to submit…but they might just pull out Yu Xia’s
soul to counter-threaten him! His junior apprentice-brother would
rather die than cause Yu Xia to be eternally unable to be reborn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you able to
acquire Yu Xia’s soul?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s been a month
since I’ve seen Yu Xia,” Northson said hurriedly. “After I
enter the castle, I can request to see Yu Xia. Each month, we can see
our loved one a single time! They won’t refuse…they’ll take me
there, then I’ll see Yu Xia. You, senior apprentice-brother, will
immediately strike and seize her soul.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seizing Yu Xia’s
soul, or seizing the Fiendgod Golem. We have to choose between the
two.” Northson began to frown.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “That’s
simple. I’ll first go with you on a trip to the Fiendgod Golem, and
then I’ll go to Yu Xia’s place. I’ll acquire her soul, then
immediately use a Greater Teleportation Dao-seal to immediately head
to the Fiendgod Golem and seize it as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Greater
Teleportation Dao-seal?” Northson said, worried, “But once you
move to flee the Eastwoods mountain range…will you have another
method of escape?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have a few of
these seals,” Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He did indeed. He had
acquired one from the underwater estate, a second from killing
Youngflame Nong, then more than ten from killing the monster kings
and the vile Patriarch on the Crescent world. Every one of the
monster kings had at least one Greater Teleportation Dao-seal on
them; given their statuses, acquiring one wasn’t too hard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And now, given the
number of treasures Ning had and his connection with Patriarch Skyfox
of the Heavenly Treasures Mountain, it wouldn’t be too hard for him
to buy eight or ten Greater Teleportation Dao-seals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First seize Yu Xia’s
soul, then Greater Teleport to seize the Fiendgod Golem.” Northson
asked, “The seizing of the soul will cause alarms to go off within
the castle; I imagine that seizing the Fiendgod Golem will prove
troublesome.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. As
long as we are fast enough, and as long as we immediately Greater
Teleport upon acquiring the soul…there will be no one who can stop
us,” Ning said. “The only person in the entire Eastwoods mountain
range who can threaten me is that general you spoke of. By the time
he hears of the soul being stolen, I’ll have already taken the
Fiendgod Golem as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The plan had more or
less been set. The two of them discussed some of the finer details,
then Northson began to give a introduction to the layout of the
castle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as the two grew
more and more animated in their discussions…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson’s face
suddenly turned ashen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother!” Northson looked towards Ning with worry. “If
you steal Yu Xia’s soul, then threaten them to force them to
release me…they’ll definitely suspect there is a connection
between us. Given that you’ll have to fight when moving to steal
the Fiendgod Golem…you’ll probably have to use your skills as a
Sword Immortal, at which point they’ll know it is a Sword Immortal
they are facing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They would be able
to guess right away that the person who rescued me was most likely
you, senior apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They’ll be able to
tell it from your swords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson stared at
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sighed mentally to
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His junior
apprentice-brother had discovered the flaw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had already been
trapped within this Eastwoods mountain range once; given the power of
that mysterious organization, they probably suspected that he had
trained in the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given that he was then
able to enter stealthily, then steal the Fiendgod Golem despite the
tight defenses and guard…they would probably grow even more certain
that he had used the ‘Seventy-Two Transformations’. After all,
other methods of entry, such as a Greater Teleportation, would cause
spatial ripples and be discovered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The chances of him
being exposed would be very high.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He absolutely could not
underestimate this foe. They were far too powerful…Ning knew this
all along.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother,” Ning said. “Don’t worry. Even if I am
exposed in the end…all I’m doing is rescuing you. To this
mysterious power, a single grandmaster of constructs isn’t that
important. You are nothing more than one amongst many such
grandmasters. It is the Fiendgod Golem which truly matters. So long
as they let you free, I’ll return that to them; they won’t have
lost much. They won’t go so far as to make an enemy out of a
Daofather’s disciple over this matter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson shook his
head. “Senior apprentice-brother, your words are reasonable, but I
can sense how savage and arrogant that organization is…and they
truly are powerful. I don’t want them to act against you. I’d
rather stay here and endure the thousand years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Will you be able to
endure it?” Ning snapped frantically, “Look at yourself right
now. You’ll probably die halfway through it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough!” Ning said
seriously. “If you disagree, then I’ll do it myself, without your
help.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother…” Northson couldn’t believe it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Decide!” Ning
said. “Am I going to do this myself, or are we going to do it
together?”
</P>

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mu Northson stared at
Ji Ning. Finally, he nodded. “Fine. We two brothers shall do it
together.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, that’s
more like it!” Ning laughed, then slapped him on the shoulder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson looked at
Ning, then smiled as well. Deep in his heart, however, he firmly
engraved the memory of this kindness into his soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two hours of rest
time had concluded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gray-robed figures
all returned from their various residences. Northson returned as
well, his hair still disordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you, hurry
up!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed figures
were already snapping at them to move faster, but the grandmasters
remained calm and silent. They completely ignored the black-robed
figures; they were grandmasters of the Dao of Constructs, after all.
If they didn’t work hard, they might suffer some consequences or
punishments, but taking their two-hour rest was ordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The black-robed
figures have very low statuses in this mysterious organization. Those
Wanxiang and Primal level black-robed figures are merely Fiendslaves,
while the Loose Immortal and Earth Immortal black-robed figures are
Fiendserfs.” Ning had already learned a bit regarding this
mysterious organization thanks to Northson’s explanations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A blurry light flowed
across the castle. The gray-robed figures passed through it to enter
the castle, and Northson entered as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s field of
vision changed. Within the castle gateway, he saw a bronze-armored
man whose aura was clearly much more powerful than the individuals he
had seen earlier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bronze-armored
guards? Fiendguards? I wonder how many Fiendguards this location
has,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fiendslaves were at the
Wanxiang and Primal level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fiendserfs were at the
Loose Immortal or Earth Immortal level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fiendguards were
extremely powerful Loose Immortals; as Ning saw it, most likely each
of them was roughly at the power of that vile Patriarch he had
killed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Above them…were the
Fiendlords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fiendlords were the
‘generals’, all of them at the Celestial Immortal level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The corridors within
the castle were deep and gloomy. The surrounding area was divided up
into numerous large regions, each of which had grandmasters of the
Dao of Constructs! Northson, however, continued to walk deeper into
the castle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here we are.” At
the end of the tunnel, a bronze-armored Fiendguard said with a laugh,
“Open up!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby black-robed
Fiendserf quickly pushed the door open. It rumbled open, then the
gray-robed figures entered. As for Ning, in the shape of a strand of
hair, he followed Northson in as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Northson
let out a sigh of relief. “Senior apprentice-brother’s
transformation abilities truly are formidable; the castle is
protected by layers of formations, but it still wasn’t able to
detect him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After entering through
the gate, they were now in an incomparably enormous stand-alone
region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This region was thirty
thousand meters in circumference, and the gray-robed figures were all
standing atop clouds, walking around an enormous golem. The area
around the golem was filled with many materials, and all of the
grandmasters immediately began their fabrication efforts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s huge.”
The hair-Ning stared at the enormous golem. “Although I heard
junior apprentice-brother speak of it…this golem is truly stunning
to behold. So when a Celestial Immortal controls it, it is virtually
invincible to anyone below the True Immortal or Empyrean God level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Per what his junior
apprentice-brother had said, the most important golem within this
forbidden region was referred to as the Fiendgod Golem; it was of the
‘Fiendgod’ class.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Its body was more than
three thousand meters tall. It was pitch-black, and appeared similar
to a crab in appearance. It had eight slender, sharp claws, as well
as two enormous pincers. Its torso was filled with countless runes
that joined together into a formation-diagram that caused Ning to
feel dizzy just looking at it. It was simply too complicated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How savage. Just by
looking at it, I can tell that it was meant for war.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The aura alone which
emanated from this massive, black, half-finished, crab-shaped
Fiendgod Golem was already superior to that of an ordinary Celestial
Immortal’s!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place has
experts in the Dao of Constructs from more than a hundred
commanderies,” Ning mused to himself. “And this is just a single
gathering point…yet it’s already able to create such terrifying
golems. Based on what junior apprentice-brother said…they are able
to produce one in roughly ten to twenty years. Then…across the 3600
commanderies and four seas of the Grand Xia Dynasty…how many
gathering points are there?! How many of these golems are they able
to produce every century?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood,
naturally, that things couldn’t be calculated in this manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all, the
materials required to produce these golems were all extremely
expensive. Many grandmasters in the Dao of Constructs alone wouldn’t
suffice; materials would also be needed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This has merely been
thirty years. But in the many years before they even came to the
world of the Grand Xia?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but feel shock in his heart. This power was simply unfathomable ! No
wonder even Patriarch Subhuti, he who possessed the [Dream of the
Three Realms], felt so worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, Northson
halted his forging, flying towards one of the entrances to this
region. There were two black-robed figures standing at the entrance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What are you doing?
Why aren’t you forging?” One of them barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wish to see my
Dao-companion,” Northson said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“See your
Dao-companion?” The black-robed man frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I haven’t seen her
this month,” Northson said. “I can see her once a month.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine, fine. What a
pain in the ass. Wait a moment, I’ll go inform his lordship,” the
black-robed figure said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson just stood
there obediently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within another region
inside the castle. There were a group of gray-robed figures here as
well, surrounding an enormous golem. They couldn’t help but stroke
the enormous golem in a sad, longing manner. This golem had cost them
their blood, sweat, and tears…but now it had been completed, and it
was going to be taken away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they wore
gray-robes, their statuses were lower than that of Northson and his
fellows. They were also more numerous; they were comparatively less
skilled in the Dao of Constructs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Milord, this ‘Winged
Immortal’ class golem has been finished.” There was a red-robed
elder standing nearby. One of the black-robed figures made this
report respectfully to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The red-robed
elder revealed a smile. “The forging speed is rather slow. These
young fellows from the world of the Grand Xia truly are weak in the
Dao of Constructs. It took so many of them so long just to complete a
single golem of the ‘Winged Immortal’ class.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby black-robed
figure was secretly speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slow? You old bastard,
you don’t even know how to forge constructs, and you have a low
status within the sect as well; the only thing you can do is flatter
the general, which is why you were given the job of overseeing the
construction of these golems. If any of the formal disciples of the
sect who actually trained in the Dao of Constructs was to appear,
you’d probably immediately kneel down and lick their toes, you old
bastard!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Out of the way!”
The red-robed elder walked forward whiel shouting loudly, and the
gray-robed figures quickly retreated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Smiling merrily, the
red-robed elder waved his hand. Instantly, the enormous winged golem,
the ‘Winged Immortal class golem’, was stored into his storage
bracelet. “We’ve finished yet another Winged Immortal class. Heh
heh heh…within the sect, my branch in the forbidden region should
be ranked amongst the top ten in producing Winged Immortals. Once the
Fiendgod-class is completed…we’ll most likely all be awarded many
gifts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Milord, milord.”
Suddenly, a voice disturbed the red-robed elder’s ruminations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-robed elder
glanced sideways irritably. Seeing the lowly black-robed figure
running towards him, he snapped coldly, “You useless piece of
trash…can’t you see I’m busy? What’s this about, with all the
screaming and shouting?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mu Northson wishes
to see his Dao-companion,” the black-robed figure said hurriedly.
In his heart, however, he was cursing at the old bastard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fiendslaves,
Fiendserfs, Fiendguards…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were ranked
according to power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Strictly speaking, this
red-robed elder was merely a Fiendserf. However, he was awarded the
red robes as a gift and sent to oversee the creation of constructs in
this part of the forbidden region. But in truth, as far as strength
went, he was merely on par with the other black-robed figures. Seeing
how arrogantly the red-robed elder acted, the black-robed figures
naturally felt resentment. All of them hoped for the day when the
red-robed elder fell!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mu Northson?” The
red-robed elder pursed his lips. “What a pain in the ass. Fine,
fine, fine. Let’s go see him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were only so many
grandmasters within the castle; he naturally memorized the names of
every single grandmaster clearly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the red-robed
elder saw Northson.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hair-Ning saw the
red-robed Elder as well. Northson had told him long ago that this
red-robed elder was a fairly important figure in the forbidden
region; his name was Qu Huan, and he was in charge of overseeing
those who were fabricating the golems. As far the souls went…it was
this red-robed elder who was in charge of hiding them somewhere
within the castle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson immediately
said, “I wish to see my Dao-companion.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,” the
red-robed elder said irritably. “You all have a chance to see your
family once a month; we’ll definitely make it happen. But you have
to work hard in your fabrications; if you don’t work hard,
then…hmph. You should know what will happen.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson nodded. “I
know, I know.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-robed elder
walked in front, passing through a wide hall, then entering a slender
passageway. Soon, they arrived within a private room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait here. I’ll be
back shortly,” the red-robed elder said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Northson
sat in the lotus position on a prayer mat. This room was very quiet;
the only person present was a black-robed guard who was keeping watch
on him from the door.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-robed elder
appeared once more. He walked into the room, then also sat down in
the losut position. Snorting coldly, he said, “You only have as
much time as needed for a stick of incense to burn down.” He waved
his hand, and a glittering jade sphere flew out. There was a woman’s
figure within the jade sphere, her form lithe and slender, carrying a
hint of sadness within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Xia,”
Northson immediately said excitedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman within the
jade globe looked towards him, then immediately said with excitement,
“Northson.” The voice of the soul, after exiting the jade sphere,
actually reverberated within the room, causing the people present to
be able to hear it with their ears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hair-Ning clucked
to himself in surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
souls were unable to speak verbally. It seems that it was the jade
sphere that allowed this one to speak…but in turn, Yu Xia’s soul
was trapped within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though
Yu Xia and junior apprentice-brother truly do have deep love for each
other,” the hair-Ning observed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northson, I know you
are very tired.” The woman floated within the jade sphere, saying
with worry, “Every time I see you, I feel as though you are even
older and more tired than the last time. If you really can’t take
it any more…then just stop worrying about me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The nearby
red-robed elder snorted coldly. “The two of you really are quite
close to each other.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson just looked at
the woman in the jade sphere. He said hurriedly, “Little Xia, one
day, I will bring you out of here. Definitely.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Work hard in
the service of the general. Within a thousand years, you shall
definitely be set free,” the red-robed elder said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson’s eyes were
filled with tears as he looked at the woman within the jade sphere.
Suddenly, he used his elemental ki to send a mental message to Ning:
“Senior apprentice-brother, kill this Qu Huan and grab the soul.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A single hair from
Northson’s tousled hair suddenly vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immediately afterwards,
a white-robed man appeared out of nowhere. When the white-robed man
appeared, his enormous palm struck out with the full power of the
[Starseizing Hand], slamming down on the body of the surprised and
terrified red-robed elder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the
red-robed elder was instantly transformed into dust. The white-robed
figure waved his hand, collecting the jade sphere, the storage
bracelet, and magic treasures.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_4___Those_Who_Bar_Me__Di"></A>
Chapter 4 - Those Who Bar Me, Die!
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-robed elder, Qu
Huan, had been instantly slain. The black-robed guard standing at the
entrance couldn’t help but feel shocked…but in the next instant,
a streak of sword-light instantly slashed past him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…” The
black-robed figure felt despair. He didn’t even have a chance to
let out a single cry before the sword-light transformed him into
dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
pulled Mu Northson into his mobile Immortal estate, then immediately
used a Greater Teleportation Dao-seal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning disappeared into
thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What just
happened?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why was there such a
powerful ripple?” The black-robed figures all noticed it. Although
Ning had tried to control his power as best he could, he couldn’t
completely block it from leaking out; after all, the entire castle
was filled with guards who had very acute senses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And right at this
moment…a spatial ripple appeared!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Teleportation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Greater Spatial
Teleportation!” The black-robed figures and bronze-armored
Fiendguards all had changed looks on their faces. Although the
defenses here in their castle were extremely tight, there was no way
they could block out a Greater Spatial Teleportation.
However…outsiders knew nothing of the layout within the castle, and
so even if they were to use a Greater Teleportation, it would be hard
for them to teleport into the castle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within the castle,
within that giant, stand-alone region. The many gray-robed figures
here were like ants that were crawling throughout the areas close to
the enormous Fiendgod Golem, constantly forging new parts to further
perfect it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ripples of a spatial
teleportation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the gray-robed
grandmasters present were completely absorbed with their forging; the
many years they had spent on this task had rendered them numb. They
weren’t on their guard at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who are you?” A
gray-robed person noticed the white-robed Ning suddenly appear out of
nowhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An invader!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An outsider!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two black-robed
figures that were responsible for overseeing this stand-alone region
were all shocked. They let out cries of rage, then charged straight
towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning let
out a cold snort. Waving his hand, he caused the enormous, three
thousand meter tall Fiendgod Golem to suddenly vanish into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“NO!!” The faces of
the two attacking black-robed figures completely changed. The invader
had actually come for their Fiendgod-class golem! This was the most
important golem in the entire castle; if it truly was to be lost…then
the outcome would be disastrous for these two black-robed Fiendserfs
who were responsible for guarding this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Streaks of snowy-white
sword-light came sweeping towards them, causing the world to
instantly be frozen. The two black-robed figures were also completely
frozen, then shattered into dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gray-robed figures
in the region all stared in astonishment. Still…all of them were
quite uncaring, and so they simply stood there and watched. They were
filled with hatred towards the power that controlled this forbidden
region; as far as they were concerned, the more black-robed figures
died, the better.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The white-robed
figure is quite formidable. He actually launched an attack within the
forbidden region…and by the looks of it, he even knows about the
Fiendgod Golem. He took it away right away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. He is pretty
powerful; the black-robed figures are all at the Loose Immortal
level, but they were eradicated with one blow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’d be nice if
all of the black-robed men and the bronze-armored Fiendguards were to
die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gray-robed figures
just watched and chatted to the side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bronze-armored
Fiendguard outside the entrance to this region noticed the spatial
disturbance inside. He came charging inside, but could only watch as
the two black-robed figures were instantly killed. There was no
chance to save them at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you KNOW where
you are? Do you really think this is a place you can just break
into?” the Fiendguard let out an angry howl, then produced a
longspear in his hands. He threw it viciously towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swooooosh! The
longspear flashed with golden light, carrying an aura of tremendous
power as it stabbed towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Void-level
Fiendgod?” Ning laughed coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bronze-armored
fiendguards all at least had the power of Loose Immortals who had
lived for a million years. This particular bronze-armored Fiendguard
was one of the most powerful Fiendguards in this area; he was an
ancient Void-level Fiendgod! This was why he had been assigned the
duty of watching this region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“DIE!!!” Ning swept
out with his palm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His palm instantly
transformed, becoming more than three hundred meters long. After
using the [Starseizing Hand], Ning’s palm carried an unearthly
level of power. He slapped downwards, swatting the golden longspear
aside. Although Ning’s [Starseizing Hand] had merely reached the
Third Cycle, it already had the power of a Pure Yang treasure! The
reason why Ning rarely used his hands to attack, preferring to use
his Immortal swords, was simply because he was afraid that others
would find out about him possessing the [Starseizing Hand].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning now
trained in the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], causing his entire body to
become powerful; thus, he could use his hands to attack without fear
of the [Starseizing Hand] being exposed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortals didn’t
necessarily have to use swords all the time. To a true Sword
Immortal, a blade of grass, a stick, a longstaff, a spear, a palm, a
leg…all of these could be used to execute swordplay. Ning’s
enormous, massive palm…glowed with a blurry golden light, as though
it were a giant golden sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?”
The void-level Fiendgod Fiendguard was shocked. Letting out a
growling roar, he used one hand to grab his longspear while using the
other to block towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous palm
struck him directly on his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The powerful Void-level
Fiendgod Fiendguard only had enough time to let out an agonized roar
before his body was blasted apart. Just as his shattered body began
to attempt to heal, a second, similarly enormous palm came slamming
towards him. The two palms merged into a single palm which once more
splattered the body of the Fiendguard. Bang! Bang! Bang! The two
giant palms struck out repeatedly at a lightning-fast speed, each
time shattering the body of the Fiendguard into ever-smaller pieces.
More and more of the Fiendguard’s divine power was used up, and
after just a few more stricks, all of the divine power within his
body had been depleted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In just the blink of an
eye, the Void-level Fiendguard had been killed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such power!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But, but…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s too
incredible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The watching gray-robed
figures were all stupefied by what they saw. They knew exactly how
powerful that bronze-armored Fiendguard had been. A Void-level
Fiendgod! And yet, he had been killed, just like that?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the true
[Starseizing Hand]!” This was the first time Ning had truly
unleashed the power of the [Starseizing Hand] as much as he pleased.
“After I train in the Fourth Cycle of the [Starseizing Hand]…my
hands alone will be comparable to supreme Pure Yang treasures, close
to middle-grade Protocosmic treasures. By then…the power of my
[Starseizing Hand] shall undoubtedly be even greater.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fifth Cycle would
make his hands comparable to supreme Protocosmic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sixth Cycle was the
level which Daoist Threelives had reached; at this level, he would be
able to effortlessly shatter an entire major world with his hands!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning collected the
treasures left behind by the Fiendguard, then charged out of the
region like a primordial Fiendgod in full flight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the black-robed men
and bronze-armored Fiendguards within the castle were quickly
gathering together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Eastwoods
Sect of the Eastwoods mountain range. A silver-armored youth was
fishing in a leisurely manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A spatial ripple. It
was like a stone had fallen into a lake, causing a ripple to spread
in every direction. When it reached the silver-armored youth, his
face instantly changed as he turned to look towards the forbidden
region. “A Greater Spatial Teleportation? Not good!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored
youth instantly transformed into a streak of light, charging towards
the forbidden region. He moved lightning-fast; although the forbidden
region was protected by layers of mighty formations, the formations
were all under his control! He was able to easily bypass all of them,
and he quickly arrived within that massive gorge. He immediately saw
that castle up ahead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sounds of explosions
could be heard from within the castle. Everything was in a state of
the utmost chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“THOSE WHO BAR ME,
DIE!” An icy voice roared out from within the castle. The faces of
the black-robed figures outside the castle were all ashen, and terror
could be seen in their eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s only been a
few moments, but three of my bronze-armored Fiendguards have died
already? Even Bosia died?” When the silver-armored youth sensed
what had happened, his face grew even uglier. The Fiendguards were
the most powerful warriors under his command; he knew all of them
intimately. As he sensed one mighty aura after another be wiped out,
he couldn’t help but feel shocked…and realize how terrifying this
foe was!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had taken him very
little time to return to the forbidden region, but three
bronze-armored Fiendguards had already perished, to say nothing of
the black-robed figures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone dares attack
on my territory?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The next feeling the
silver-robed youth had was a feeling of anger and humiliation that he
had never felt before. This was a proud man!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” The
silver-robed youth could sense that the powerful figure within the
castle had already charged out to the castle gates. The restrictions
within the castle were also under the control of the general, and so
he could clearly sense everything going on within it…as well as the
fact that the Fiendgod Golem had already vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A fiery godbow suddenly
appeared in the silver-armored youth’s hands, and a similarly fiery
arrow appeared as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He pulled the bow!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He fired the arrow!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The arrow shot out,
instantly transforming into an enormous, divine flaming dragon that
surged straight towards the castle gates.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A terrifying
sword-light flew out from the castle gates, transforming into a
divine black dragon. The divine black dragon and the divine flaming
dragon collided against each other in midair, and in that instant, a
white-robed youth walked out from the castle gates. The white-robed
youth was surrounded with a teeming mass of Immortal swords, each one
possessing an unearthly amount of power. They spread out in every
direction, as though escorting their emperor forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed youth
raised his head, looking upwards. He saw the distant silver-armored
youth in the distant skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored
youth lowered his head, looking at the white-robed youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their gazes met in
midair, colliding as though they had mass to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nearly two hundred
Immortal swords? And all of them seem to be top-grade
Immortal-ranked!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A bow? Can it be
that he, too, is a master archer?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each had their own
thoughts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The terrifying arrow
and the light of the [Greater Thousand Swords Formation] collided
head-on. The entire world seemed to go dark for a moment. And
then…with a rumbling sound, rippling shockwaves spread out in every
direction, with the ripples containing hints of sharp light. When the
ripples struck some of the nearby black-robed figures, they were
instantly turned into dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Block!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Block it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than ten Loose
Immortals perished before the rest of the black-robed figures were
able to escape from that ripple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fiendserfs, all of
you, step back,” the silver-armored youth barked coldly. In a fight
on this level…these black-robed Loose Immortals would be nothing
more than cannon fodder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Instantly,
all of the black-robed figures hurriedly fled. They normally liked to
flaunt their power, and they could kill Wanxiang Adepts and Primal
Adepts as easily as killing chickens, but upon encountering this
terrifying figure…it was their turn to become the chickens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fleeing? I have not
permitted it!” The distant white-robed Ning let out an angry roar.
Instantly, a hundred of the top-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords
around him shot out in every direction, striking towards the fleeing
black-robed Loose Immortals. Ning had sworn long ago…that he
wouldn’t spare a single one of these figures who had harmed his
junior apprentice-brother!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are courting
death!” The silver-armored youth was enraged. He waved his hand,
and instantly a black cloud that covered the skies appeared, spreaing
in every direction.
</P>

Chapter 5 - Who Will Give Me My Freedom?
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black cloud was
filled with a resilient power that covered the entire region below.
The hundred top-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords were unable to
penetrate the black cloud, but…Ji Ning’s attack was simply too
fast. Prior to the black cloud appearing, he had killed more than
twenty of the black-robed Loose Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored
youth’s face grew even grimmer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break.” Ning took
back his Immortal swords, then began to condense a streak of
sword-light generated from the second stage of the [Greater Thousand
Swords Formation]. This blindingly bright sword-light transformed
into a divine black dragon which ripped apart the black clouds,
soaring forward with arrogant abandon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
silver-armored youth waved his hand, summoning the black cloud back.
He glanced downwards, seeing that the black-robed figures had already
fled by now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One bronze-armored
Fiendguard after another began to arrive, coming to gather in the air
behind the bronze-armored youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fiendguards, join
into formation and launch a combined attack!” The silver-armored
youth pointed downwards, then shouted, “You are not to attack
separately.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Instantly,
the Fiendguards began to organize into squads of nine, joining into
formations that transformed into Godbeasts that were three hundred
meters long. This type of Godbeast appeared to be a tiger, but had
even sharper claws and even longer fangs, while its fur was shaggier.
Their eyes were filled a cold azure light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Bi’an Godbeast
tiger?” Ning was startled. “Last time, I encountered Bloodcloud
Hall’s Ba-Serpent Formation; I didn’t expect to encounter a Bi’an
Formation this time. This organization really is quite formidable.”
1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless ages ago, the
Ancestor Dragon was born from the primordial chaos. It was the most
ancient of divine dragons, the first to be born from the chaos. It
was even older than the Torch-Dragon! As the first dragon, it became
known as the Ancestor Dragon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ancestor Dragon had
nine sons. 2
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single one of the
Nine Sons of the Dragon possessed tremendous power…and the Bi’an
Tiger was one of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Bi’an
Godbeast tigers charged downwards from midair. Ning raised his head,
staring up at those three Bi’an Godbeasts. He suddenly sensed the
castle behind him beginning to shake. Turning his head, he glanced
backwards, only to see another Bi’an Godbeast charging from him
from the castle gates as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There had also been
some bronze-armored Fiendguards within the castle. Because Ning had
attacked so unexpectedly, they hadn’t had the chance to join
together into a formation yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This white-robed
man’s Immortal swords are quite formidable; he should be a powerful
Sword Immortal who is a Ki Refiner. Although Ki Refining Sword
Immortals are formidable…they hate close combat. If we attack en
masse, and if one of our claws land on him…he’s dead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him. Otherwise,
both the general and us shall be doomed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all harbored
murderous thoughts in their mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of them wanted to
let Ning leave alive. This was because the fact that the Eastwoods
mountain range was being used to manufacture golems was a matter of
the utmost secrecy. Once this location was exposed…the Grand Xia
Dynasty would probably begin a frantic investigation. Now that they
had a specific target, they’d probably be able to uncover even more
gathering spots.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be
understood…that up till now, not a single one of the gathering
points had been exposed yet! Although the Grand Xia Dynasty had
discovered that a few places were rather ‘strange’, they weren’t
sure what the places were doing, and so the Dynasty hadn’t made any
rash decisions yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eastwoods mountain
range gathering point was damnably unlucky. After all…the only
person in the entire world of the Grand Xia who trained in the
Seventy-Two Transformations was Ji Ning. Only he had the ability to
stealthily infiltrate this place! Anyone else would have been
completely unable to enter the area and discover the secrets within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can’t let him
escape!” The silver-armored youth’s eyes flashed with cold light
as he stared down from the skies towards Ning. “If he flees, we’ll
be in big trouble. The Master will definitely blame me for this!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four Bi’an
Godbeast tigers all possessed auras of tremendous power and majesty.
Every single one of them was comparable to the Ba-Serpent of
Bloodcloud Hall which had attempted to assassinate Ji Ning…but this
Ji Ning was no longer the Ji Ning of the past. After reaching the
sixteenth stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens],
his power had skyrocketed once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“F*ck off.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous palm, also
three hundred meters long, swatted down towards one of the Bi’an
Tigers. The Bi’an Godbeast howled and swept out with its sharp
paws, making full use of its extremely long and knife-sharp claws.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant palm, covered
with golden light, completely knocked this Bi’an Godbeast flying.
The other three Bi’an Tigers attacked wildly en masse, but Ning
began to brandish his other palm as well. As he did so, this palm
also instantly increased to a size of three hundred meters, and it
too swatted a Bi’an Godbeast away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three Heads, Six
Arms.” Ning transformed into his three-headed, six-armed form. Now,
six utterly enormous palms were slapping and swatting in every
direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His palm-strikes all
possessed the power of a Pure Yang treasure; they were far superior
to Immortal swords. In addition, using Immortal swords required the
use of elemental ki, whereas his [Starseizing Hand]-enhanced hands
had been transformed into magic treasures long ago; just like the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art], his palms didn’t need to use any divine
power at all. However, actively using the [Starseizing Hand] to
unleash tremendous strength did require the use of divine power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
BOOM! BOOM! Six giant palms, each flashing with a sharp golden light,
struck out like a series of sharp swords, either chopping or
thrusting or swatting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four Bi’an
Godbeast tigers had intended on launching a group assault, but they
were instead knocked flying backwards, one after the other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“General!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“General, this man is
a fiendgod! And his divine body is extremely powerful; his body seems
to be as unbreakable as a vajra. He’s actually able to block our
attacks just using his hands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bronze-armored
Fiendguards all sent hurried mental messages to the silver-armored
youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored
youth, upon seeing this happen from his position in midair, had an
unsightly look on his face. “I didn’t expect that his close
combat abilities would be even more formidable than his
sword-formation abilities.” In truth, if Ning had to use Immortal
swords, his close combat abilities truly would be a bit weaker…but
by relying on the power of his palms, he was actually slightly more
powerful than the second stage of the [Greater Thousand Swords
Formation].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahah! ‘General’…do
you wish to keep fighting? You aren’t able to do anything to me,
while I can leave whenever I want.” Ning’s laughter rang out from
below.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Halt!” The
silver-armored youth barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, all four of
the Bi’an Godbeast tigers hurriedly retreated, coming to hover in
the air to each side of the silver-armored youth. They stared at the
distant, white-robed Ning. All of them were rather shocked…the
thirty-six of them, all Fiendguards, were actually unable to do
anything to this person, even when fighting together. No wonder he
had been able to so effortlessly slaughter them in the castle
earlier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given your power,
you should’ve been able to use a Greater Teleportation Dao-seal to
leave long ago, when you were still inside the castle,” the
silver-armored man said coldly. “But you didn’t. This was for the
sake of Mu Northson, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled. He
had used the Seventy-Two Transformations to completely change his
aura; why was it that this general immediately mentioned Mu Northson?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” The
silver-armored youth looked downwards. He said coldly, “Did you
think I wouldn’t be able to guess that it was you? In the entire
world of the Grand Xia, the only ability that could allow someone to
so stealthily infiltrate this castle is probably you, after using
your Seventy-Two Transformations. When I also noticed that the only
grandmaster within the castle who vanished was Mu Northson…the only
person I could think of who would come to save him would be you, Ji
Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Previously, I wasn’t
completely certain that you trained in the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art],
but now…I am.” The silver-armored man let out a cold laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed youth
below let out a loud laugh as well. His body flickered, then
transformed into that of the fur-clad Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Correct. It is
indeed me. I knew that I wouldn’t be able to hide the fact that I
trained in the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] for too much longer…after
all, last time, I ended up trapped in your Eastwoods mountain range
for quite some time. I didn’t expect you to be able to guess it
right away this time,” Ning said. “I know that this Fiendgod
Golem of yours is quite important. I can give it back to you, but you
have to release my junior apprentice-brother, Mu Northson, and give
him back his freedom.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I trust that
reobtaining a golem like this, comparable to a top-grade Pure Yang
treasure, in exchange for just giving me my junior apprentice-brother
is actually quite a decent bargain,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A decent bargain?
No. This is nothing more than a half-finished golem; it’s not even
finished. It isn’t actually worth that much,” the silver-armored
youth said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps not to
outsiders, but to you, it is extremely valuable. You can work on it
and complete it.” Ning raised his head to stare at the
silver-armored youth. “I have only one request. Give my junior
apprentice-brother his freedom back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahahaha…freedom?!”
The silver-armored youth was so enraged, he began to laugh. “If I
give Mu Northson his freedom, who will give me my freedom?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled. Who
would give him his freedom?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve discovered
this forbidden region, which means its secret has been revealed. If I
don’t kill you…how can I escape punishment?” A savage look was
on the silver-armored man’s face. “Both you and your junior
apprentice-brother can die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly
understood. Given that the mysterious power divided up its forces
into ‘Fiendslaves’, ‘Fiendserfs’, ‘Fiendguards’, and
‘Fiendlords’, they undoubtedly held their Fiendlords to very high
standards. Ning had barged into this location…once he exposed its
secrets, the mysterious power would be put on a very bad position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait a moment,”
Ning said hurriedly. “I’m willing to swear an oath to the Dao of
the Heavens that I will not reveal what is happening here within the
Eastwoods mountain range to anyone, and I will also return your
Fiendgod Golem to you. You, in exchange, will release my junior
apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if you swear an
oath to the Dao of the Heavens, I will still be punished. Thus…only
if you die will I be safe.” The silver-armored youth let out a lowl
growl. “Do you think that just because you’ve trained in the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art] that I am unable to do anything to you? Hmph.
Hmph! Many Celestial Immortals have perished before me, much less
you, a mere Void-level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As his words came out,
an azure serpent that was more than ten kilometers long suddenly
appeared in midair. This azure serpent was extremely slender, and it
came coiling towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A rope?” Ning was
startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Eight-Nine Arcane
Art] divine ability feared restrictive magic treasures the most. For
example, if he ended up being bound by this rope, there would be no
way he could use any Dao-seals or enter his Immortal estate. That
would be very bad indeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus…he absolutely
could not let himself be bound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All I’m asking is
that you let my junior apprentice-brother go free.” Immortal swords
clustered around Ning as a sharp golden sword-light began to form in
front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only if I kill you
will I be able to live comfortably,” the silver-armored youth
bellowed back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden sword-light
collided against the enormous azure serpent in midair. The power of
that rope, in the shape of the azure serpent, was truly tremendous. A
single collision with it was enough to completely blast apart the
divine black dragon which Ning’s golden sword-light had transformed
into.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you don’t
agree…then I’ll beat you until you do!” Ning had grown angry
now as well. A black-robed Ning suddenly appeared out of nowhere next
to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two Ji Nings stood
there, shoulder to shoulder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A total of 324
top-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasures appeared in midair. His
true body and his Primaltwin each controlled 162 of these Immortal
swords! It must be understood that the memories and minds of the two
bodies were completely linked and synced, and both of them trained in
the [Darknorth Sutra] as Ki Refiners…and in fact, both were ate the
late Void level!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of the
[Darknorth Sutra] filled every single one of the top-grade
Immortal-ranked flying swords. Although his true body and his
Primaltwin controlled the swords separately, it was as though a
single person was controlling them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And thus, a total of
more than three hundred top-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords were
able to completely join together in formation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ruuuuuuumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A golden Immortal
sword, carrying a terrifying aura of majesty, manifested before
Ning’s true body and Primaltwin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Greater Thousand
Swords Formation] - Stage Four!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was Ning’s true
maximum combat power as a Ki Refiner! Power that was even greater
than his true body’s close combat abilities!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fur-clad Ning and
the black-robed Ning simultaneously let out an enraged roar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“KILL!!!!”

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many
combination-formations, such as the Ba-Serpent Formation or the Bi’an
Formation, relied on different people occupying different parts of
the formation. Upon coming together, their strength would increase
explosively! What Ji Ning was currently using with his Primaltwin was
something similar, something which mimicked a combination-formation.
Although this wasn’t intentional, it was even more meticulate and
intricate than many true combination-formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“ROAAAAR!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden Immortal
sword before them transformed into an incomparably massive divine
black dragon that was coiled. The divine black dragon let out a
draconic roar, and the sound of this roar completely shook the world
around them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a majesty that
came from more than three hundred top-grade Immortal-ranked flying
swords, after their power had been merged together through the
[Greater Thousand Swords Formation]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This power was so
great, it eclipsed that of most divine abilities that Fiendgod Body
Refiners trained in!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” The
silver-armored youth’s face changed slightly as he stared down from
midair. “Block!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hissssss…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure
serpent-formed rope in midair let out a hissing sound. The enormous
azure serpent slithered forth, moving to collide head on against the
divine black dragon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The divine dragon
soared into the skies!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure serpent came
slithering forth!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world itself shook
tremendously…and then a blast of wild power exploded out in an
omnidirectional ripple. When it struck the bodies of those four Bi’an
Godbeasts, a series of crackling sounds could be heard…but of
course, they were able to withstand this level of energy. As for
those weaker black-robed Loose Immortals, they had fled far away long
ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gorge around them,
however, was in for some pain. It rumbled as the ground began to
crack apart, and many nearby boulders were transformed into dust. The
cliffs on each side of the gorge began to break apart on a large
scale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Faced with that blast
of wild power, the surface of the castle began to flicker with a dark
light. It managed to withstand the collisive force.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” The
silver-armored man’s face changed dramatically; the azure serpent
in the air had been completely destroyed, transforming back into its
original form of a rope. The divine black dragon, however, was still
filled with enormous power. It continued to roar with abandon,
wanting to continue to strike against the azure serpent. “This Ji
Ning is actually so powerful! He’s not even a Celestial Immortal
yet, but the power of his Immortal swords is already so great.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want to capture
me? General, you aren’t strong enough yet!” The fur-clad Ning and
the black-robed Ning both let out furious roars.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">ROAAAAR!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The divine black dragon
in the skies let out a draconic roar as well, then continued its
upwards charge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t believe
it. Don’t believe it! I have to capture him.” The silver-armored
youth gritted his teeth. He didn’t want to fail; he wasn’t
willing to accept the repercussions of failure. His hands joined
together to form a seal as he shouted loudly, “ASURA!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A powerful Immortal
power rapidly began to summon the majestic power of the Heavens and
the Earth, forming a tall, skinny, hideous, and completely black
warrior. This hideous warrior hefted a double-edged blade with three
tips and pointed it straight towards Ning, letting out a bellow:
“Little thief, die!” And then, the hideous warrior charged
straight forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“CELESTIAL GUARDIAN
DRAGON!” The silver-armored youth’s hand-seals changed once
again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yet another creature
appeared in midair, a coiling divine dragon which was golden in
color. The divine golden dragon let out a draconic roar of its own,
then charged downwards as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“BIND!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous rope in
midair once more transformed into that queer azure serpent. This
time, the azure serpent’s tail had a snakehead at the end; it now
had a head on each end, and it howled through the air as it charged
towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Controlling two secret
arts and this magic treasure was actually extremely tiring for this
silver-armored general as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break. Break.
Break!” The fur-clad Ning and the black-robed Ning simultaneously
controlled the [Greater Thousand Swords Formation], using the more
than three hundred top-grade Immortal-ranked magic swords to once
more generate that incomparably sharp golden flying sword. The golden
flying sword howled through the air, transforming into that divine
black dragon. Now, there were two of the divine black dragons in the
air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Simultaneously
maintaining two of the fourth-stage [Greater Thousand Swords
Formation] sword-lights was a tremendous burden on Ning as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bind him. I have to
bind him.” A look of savagery was on the face of the silver-armored
youth. “I was only able to escape after enduring for countless
years. I don’t want to be punished again. Absolutely not!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From high up in the
skies, the hideous Asura warrior, the Celestial Guardian Dragon, and
the two-headed azure serpent launched simultaneous attacks downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two divine black
dragons flew upwards, greeting the attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM BOOM BOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A series of explosions
could be heard from within the skies, and the surrounding area was
filled with clashing blasts and ripples of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…General,
this bit of ability isn’t enough,” Ning laughed loudly. The
fourth-stage [Greater Thousand Swords Formation] sword-light, in the
shape of the two divine dragons, was actually able to blast apart the
Asura warrior and the Celestial Guardian Dragon before vanishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Suppression!” The
silver-armored youth suddenly waved his hand, and one giant seal
after another began to appear in the skies. A total of seven grand
seals appeared, each glowing with blurry light. The grand seals were
covered with some characters, and they hovered there in the skies
like giant mountains. Light flowed from one seal to another, merging
them into a single whole.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Crush him!” The
silver-armored youth pointed furiously towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven grand seals
descended in awe-inspiring fashion en masse, rapidly joining together
as they descended. They actually transformed into a true, enormous
mountain as they smashed towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning pointed upwards as
well. The sword-light of the [Greater Thousand Swords Formation], in
the form of two divine black dragons, soared straight into the
heavens like fish that were swimming against the flow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous mountain
came crashing down. Both of the divine black dragons were actually
blasted apart, causing Ning’s pupils to contract. He immediately
executed his divine ability, transforming into a three-headed,
six-armed giant that was three hundred meters tall. Ning
simultaneously struck out with six mighty palms from his true body,
slapping them against the descending mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world itself seemed
to shake. Ning’s true body was actually pushed all the way into the
ground, which completely caved in and shattered in every direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s true body was
pressed chest-deep into the ground, but with a flicker he once more
re-emerged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, General,
what a fine ability!” Ning laughed as he looked at the
silver-armored youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored
youth had a gloomy look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn. Damn!” The
silver-armored youth’s heart was filled with resentment. He now
knew exactly how strong Ning was. He had to admit, this foe’s
sword-formation was incredibly powerful, but in terms of raw
strength…Ji Ning was definitely far inferior to him. He was a
supreme figure even amongst Celestial Immortals, after all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But this wasn’t a
competition to see who was better; it was a fight where he had to
capture his foe using his rope!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If they were simply
competing to see who was better, he could wantonly use his seven
low-grade Pure Yang treasures, those seven mighty seals, to unleash
his most powerful attacks. But what he was trying to do was to trap
his foe; thus, he had to divert some of his attention to controlling
his rope, and also use quite a great deal of his energy to strengthen
the rope. It was no easy feat to capture or trap a Fiendgod who
trained in the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since he had to split
his attention up between his rope and the seals, he was naturally
unable to use the seals to the full extent of their power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You win!” The
silver-armored youth gave Ning a dark look. “I can neither kill you
nor capture you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was clearly
significantly stronger than Ji Ning…but he was simply unable to
capture him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was what made the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art] so formidable. There had to be an utterly
enormous difference in power, allowing him to first break apart
Ning’s defense before capturing him. Clearly, the difference in
power between the general and Ning, while significant, wasn’t
ridiculously huge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire gorge had
been transformed into rubble. In the air above the rubble, the only
figures that could be seen were the silver-armored general, a group
of bronze-armored Fiendguards, as well as Ji Ning and Mu Northson.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored
general had finally bowed his head. He was unable to kill Ji Ning,
and would be unable to avoid punishment. All he could do now was try
his best to lessen the amount of damage caused and lower the amount
of punishment he would receive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Ning smiled
and nodded. “That’s wise.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Northson
immediately had a look of relief appear within his eyes. Right then
and there, Ji Ning, Mu Northson, and the silver-armored general all
swore oaths to the Dao of the Heavens. Ning’s promise…was that if
Mu Northson was given freedom, he absolutely would not reveal the
secret of the castle to others. Northson swore the same, that he
absolutely wouldn’t reveal this secret to anyone else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored
general naturally gave Northson his freedom back after this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“General, please open
your formation and let us leave.” Ning stood there in midair,
Northson by his side with a relieved look on his face. He seemed to
have suddenly become filled with vitality, as well as hope for the
future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not so fast.” The
silver-armored general let out a sigh. “Before you leave, I will
tell you a bit of bad news.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Northson’s
faces instantly changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bad news?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This was a
disastrous defeat for me.” The silver-armored general sighed. “The
forbidden region was under very tight guard, and even the formations
experts which I captured were all forced to swear oaths to the Dao of
the Heavens not to flee. If they do…they die. Thus, I never thought
that someone would be able to sneak in…I suppose I’m just damned
unlucky to encounter someone who trains in the [Eight-Nine Arcane
Art].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough with the
crap. What do you want to say?” Ning barked with a frown.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the
silver-armored general let out another series of sighs, he looked
towards Ning and Northson, then said with a cold laugh, “The person
in charge of matters within the castle, Qu Huan, is already dead. If
my guess is correct…this Mu Northson has already taken his loved
one’s soul back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson barked, “So
what if I did?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have you heard of
soultamer jade?” The silver-armored general chortled as he spoke.
He felt delighted in being able to irritate these two figures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Soultamer jade?”
Northson and Ning’s faces instantly changed. Ning had learned about
quite a few bits of common knowledge regarding the Three Realms while
at Mount Innerheart; naturally, he knew of soultamer jade. As for
Northson, given he had analyzed the Dao of Constructs quite
extensively, he naturally had heard of soultamer jade, one of the
legendary materials for the Dao of Constructs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soultamer jade: Once a
soul was placed into the soultamer jade, it would become one with the
jade. There would be no chance of escape! However, the soul would be
nourished by the soultamer jade; so long as it didn’t suffer any
attacks and wasn’t destroyed, the soul inside could live forever.
Generally speaking, golem experts would place soultamer jade into
their golems, allowing the soul within the soultamer jade to control
the golem, making it sentient.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that you
can’t tell?” The silver-armored general smiled. “That
crystalline globe used to store her soul is soultamer jade!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Northson
was shocked and angry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s finished.”
Ning looked towards his nearby junior apprentice-brother; now that Yu
Xia’s soul had been placed within that soultamer jade globe, she
would never be able to emerge from within it. She would forever have
to live within that tiny little space. This was actually quite a
painful thing…and she would have forever lost her chance to be
reincarnated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But perhaps this is
a good thing,” Ning mused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were two sides to
every coin. Yu Xia’s soul had been merged into the soultamer jade,
and she would never be able to leave or be reborn; this was indeed
quite a painful thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And yet…this meant
that she would still be able to accompany Northson.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mu Northson,” the
distant silver-armored general said with a cold laugh, “Your loved
one’s soul shall accompany you for eternity. You are quite blessed.
But…don’t forget that she’ll be forever trapped within that
tiny space. How agonizing must that be? This sort of agony will
accompany her for countless ages, until the day comes that she is
attacked and her ‘body’ is destroyed. In that moment…her soul
shall shatter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson gritted his
teeth. “Little Xia…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He felt guilt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing this, Ning
couldn’t help but secretly sigh to himself. The distant
silver-armored general, however, just laughed loudly. “See how nice
I am? I even told you this bit of information. Alright…you can
scram now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
gave the distant silver-armored general a cold glare, then took
Northson into his mobile Immortal estate. He then flew into the
skies, the formations not blocking him at all. Ning quickly flew
away, then once more used a spatial teleportation technique. He
disappeared.

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_7___The_Cavemaster"></A>
Chapter 7 - The Cavemaster
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored
youth raised his head, staring at the sky. It was dusk. He let out a
sigh. “My happy days are coming to an end.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“General.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bronze-armored
Fiendguards all nervously stared at the silver-armored youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After sighing, the
silver-armored youth turned and quickly moved through the many layers
of restrictive formations around the forbidden region. Outside were
gathered many of the black-robed figures, as well as the members of
the Eastwoods Sect. The enormous disturbance and the spatial
teleportations had attracted attention from many outsiders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“General.” The
Eastwoods sect leader hurriedly went forward to greet him. “What
has happened? Is there anything you need our Eastwoods Sect to do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What happened?”
The silver-armored general murmured these words, then waved his hand.
Instantly, the illusion of an enormous mountain appeared out of
nowhere. It smashed straight down on the body of the Eastwoods sect
leader. Boom! The Eastwoods sect leader was completely smashed into
pulp, then the remnants were transformed into dust that flew away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The surrounding Loose
Immortals, Earth Immortals, Primal Daoists, Wanxiang Adepts, and
other disciples of the Eastwoods Sect were all in disbelief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of them, however,
revealed looks of joy. “It’s good that he died.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eastwoods sect
leader had been a classic case of a spineless figure who had quickly
capitulated. This caused some of the disciples who had been unhappy
with the current state of affairs to feel disdain for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored
general instructed calmly, “All disciples of the Eastwoods Sect,
hear me: If you are willing to be loyal to me and serve me, if you
are willing to become slaves under my command…go down on your knees
immediately.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice was actually
quite soft…but it echoed within the minds of each member of the
Eastwoods Sect. Everyone in the sect, whether roaming around,
patrolling the mountain, training, or resting in seclusion…was
completely stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have to a count
of ten to decide,” the silver-armored general said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Willing! I’m
willing!” Instantly, some disciples capitulated and knelt down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, quite a few
disciples revealed looks of disbelief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Loyalty? Submission?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was simple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But willingly become
slaves? This was too ridiculous. They were Immortal cultivators, and
many of them had felt unhappy for quite some time now. At first, the
silver-armored general had been fairly amiable towards them, but now
he actually spoke of them being his slaves? Slaves…that meant
giving their lives to him and completely obeying his orders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ten. Nine. Eight.
Seven…” The silver-armored general counted slowly. “Six. Five!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After counting to five,
he suddenly stopped counting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored
general let out a laugh. With a single step, he moved to stand high
up in the air. The world itself began to shudder, and one massive
mountain after another began to lift up and hover in the air. This
was the Divine Venomflame of the Nine Heavens Cauldron which he had
previously used against Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Eastwoods Sect
has more than thirty-nine thousand disciples.” The silver-armored
general’s voice reverberated in the air. “More than twenty
thousand have knelt, including twenty-one Loose Immortals and Earth
Immortals and three hundred and one Primal Daoists. These three
hundred and twenty-two are permitted to remain alive…the rest shall
all perish!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice reverberated
throughout the entire Eastwoods mountain range.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then…flames began
to erupt throughout the area, moving to fill every single part of the
Eastwoods mountain range.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“General, you haven’t
finished counting to ten yet!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“General!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hesitating Loose
Immortals and Earth Immortals, upon seeing this, instantly began to
call out frantically. Some of the Primal Daoists, Earth Immortals,
and Loose Immortals actually fell to their knees right away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too late,” the
silver-armored general laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Streaks of flame were
filling the entire region. Those hidden away in secret rooms, those
roving the mountains, those fleeing…all of them were turned to ash
as soon as they were touched by the flames! The Divine Venomflame of
the Nine Heavens was very dangerous for Celestial Immortals; how
could these ordinary disciples of the Eastwoods Sect possibly
withstand it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No! I submitted! I
SUBMITTED! General, I’m willing to be your slave!” A youth cried
out miserably, right before he was burnt to ash by the flames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A puny Zifu
Disciple…just what am I supposed to do with you?” The
silver-armored general sneered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Despair filled every
part of the Eastwoods mountain range.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only ones to
survive were the Primal Daoists and Void-level Immortals who had
knelt by the count of five. The others disciples…perished to the
man. Some of them chose to self-detonate, but their souls were still
trapped by the grand formation protecting the Eastwoods Mountain
range. Their souls were annihilated; none were spared at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later…things
turned completely silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come in.” The
silver-armored general waved his hand, and an enormous sack suddenly
appeared. The mouth of the sack opened, instantly drawing in the
Primal Daoists, Loose Immortals, and Earth Immortals below him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He made one more trip
to the forbidden region, collecting all of the grandmasters of the
Dao of Constructs, the castle, and the other things within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go.” The
silver-armored general led his bronze-armored Fiendguards to the
entrance to that black, fog-shrouded cave…then stepped straight
into it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later…the
cave entrance itself disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire Eastwoods
mountain range had become completely silent. All living creatures,
including the animals that had lived here, had been completely wiped
out. Even all the formations present, such as the Divine Venomflame
of the Nine Heavens Cauldron, had been broken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eastwoods
Sect…starting from today, it truly no longer existed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an extremely
large world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The commandery city in
the center of this world was an incomparably massive fortress. The
fortress was so large that even Celestial Immortals would be unable
to see it in its entirety.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re back. We’ve
finally returned to the Fifth World.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black foggy cave
entrance appeared in the skies, and the silver-armored youth and his
bronze-armored Fiendguards appeared from within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…an invisible
surge of power swept across this squad.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“General.” The
bronze-armored Fiendguards looked towards the silver-armored youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go to the
headquarters and await further orders,” the silver-armored general
said with a sigh. “This time, I shall most probably be sent into
exile…and you’ll probably have to suffer with me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s not your
fault, General. If we have to blame someone, we have to blame that Ji
Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. That Ji Ning
actually knew the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]. You can’t be blamed at
all, General!” The crowd of bronze-armored Fiendguards hurriedly
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored
general chuckled. “Alright. I need to go see the Cavemaster. Go
ahead and wait for me in the headquarters.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” the
bronze-armored Fiendguards said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored
youth transformed into a streak of light, soaring down from the skies
and into that castle below. A corridor automatically opened, granting
him entrance. As for the bronze-armored Fiendguards, they all had to
land and walk in through the gates to the city. The general was a
Celestial Immortal, after all; his status was much higher than
theirs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a massive
palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A man dressed in fiery
red robes was seated up high on a royal throne, staring downwards.
His terrifying aura was absolutely no weaker than that of the Grand
Xia Emperor’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored
youth moved into the palace, then respectfully bowed from the waist.
“Greetings, Cavemaster.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Buchasi.” The
fire-robed man glanced downwards, then frowned slightly. “Aren’t
you supposed to be in Flamedoor Commandery of the world of the Grand
Xia? Your assignment is to watch over the construction of the
constructs there; you can’t let anything go wrong. Why have you
left the world of the Grand Xia and returned here without being
summoned?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your subordinate’s
base in the Eastwoods mountain range of Flamedoor Commandery was
infiltrated…” The silver-armored youth honestly told the complete
story of what had happened, because he knew exactly how powerful this
organization was. Even if he didn’t tell the truth, within a single
day, the organization would learn of everything which had happened in
the Eastwoods mountain range.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art]? Ji Ning?” The fire-robed man frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored
youth was so nervous, sweat emerged from his forehead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You truly have
disappointed me.” The fire-robed man shook his head and sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cavemaster, I…I…”
the silver-armored youth felt some unwillingness to accept this. He
truly could not be held to blame for what had happened; any base
would have found it difficult to deal with the [Eight-Nine Arcane
Art].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Successes are to be
rewarded. Mistakes are to be punished,” the Cavemaster said coldly.
“Buchasi, because of you, our invasion of the world of the Grand
Xia will become even more difficult. I punish you thusly…take your
subordinates and go to the Mount Stele major world. Establish a new
base there and continue to manufacture constructs. In addition,
within a hundred years, you must slay five Celestial Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored
youth’s heart shook.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Mount Stele major
world?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That world was
completely different from the world of the Grand Xia. The Grand Xia
world was a unified world, whereas the Mount Stele major world was in
a state of tremendous chaos. Thus, battles had swept the world long
ago. To go to the world of the Grand Xia was to enjoy life, but to go
to the world of Mount Stele was to be forced to prepare for battles
at all times…and he also had to kill five Celestial Immortals!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No Celestial Immortal
was easy to deal with. They had all lived for countless ages, and no
one knew exactly what tricks each had up their sleeves. Perhaps one
might have an advantage, but then the enemy’s friends or master
would suddenly arrive. Thus…killing Celestial Immortals was an
extremely dangerous task. Yes, he had killed more than ten Celestial
Immortals, but this was a bodycount that had been accumulated over
countless ages, and after experiencing countless dangers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had finally been
given a chance to enjoy life after being sent to the world of the
Grand Xia to manufacture golems; in that place, he hadn’t had any
dangerous assignments at all. And now…the good life had to come to
an end. A much harder life was to begin…and he might just die
there, within the world of Mount Stele!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And this wasn’t as
bad as it could have been; if Ji Ning hadn’t needed something for
him and had thus sworn an oath to the Dao of the Heavens not to
reveal this secret, his punishment probably would’ve been even
heavier!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” the
silver-armored youth said respectfully..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You head out
immediately. Go.” The Cavemaster waved a hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-armored
youth immediately retreated, departing from the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The palace became
completely quiet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An alluring,
white-robed woman suddenly appeared behind the Cavemaster. She was
utterly ravishing, and her slender waist could just barely be seen
under her semi-translucent white clothes. She laughed softly,
“Master, Buchashi is one of your most formidable warriors…and
hasn’t that Ji Ning sworn an oath to the Dao of the Heavens
already?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you know?”
The Cavemaster said calmly, “Ji Ning has sworn an oath to the Dao
of the Heavens not to reveal the fact that the castle was making
constructs, true…but Ji Ning is very close to the Xia Emperor. He
can absolutely come up with a way to warn him…and once that
happens, our invasion of the world of the Grand Xia shall become even
more difficult.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why are so you
cautious in dealing with this world, a single major world?” The
alluring woman mumbled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The world of the
Grand Xia is different from ordinary major worlds,” the Cavemaster
said. “The Xia Emperor is of the imperial bloodline of Pangu’s
World; how deep a foundation do you think he has? No one knows what
someone like him, a descendent of the Primordial Imperial Clan, has
up his sleeve. In addition, the Xia Emperor and Daofather Raindragon
are extremely good friends. When invading the world of the Grand Xia,
we have to beware Daofather Raindragon as well. How can I possibly
NOT be cautious?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The alluring woman said
with surprise, “Daofather Raindragon? Master, you’ve never spoken
of this before.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There was no need
to. You aren’t even a Celestial Immortal,” the Cavemaster said
with resignation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is the Xia Emperor
really such close friends with Daofather Raindragon?” The alluring
woman was truly curious about this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a ‘secret’
for you, but all the experts of the Three Realms know about this.”
The Cavemaster shook his head. “In fact, the Xia Emperor has done
his best to spread the news far and wide. He even made it so that in
his major world, ‘Raindragon Mountain’ was even taller than his
own ‘Skylight Palace’! Skylight Palace is his imperial palace; it
represents himself, the Xia Emperor. For Raindragon Mountain to be
slightly taller than it…what did you think it represented? It
naturally represented someone even more powerful than him! In the
Three Realms, the only person who has a connection to Raindragon
Mountain is Daofather Raindragon!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The alluring woman now
understood. “I’ve always wondered about that! Master, all of you
are True Immortals or Empyrean Gods, but none of you have ever fought
each other.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t
underestimate the Xia Emperor. Even if Daofather Raindragon doesn’t
intervene, invading the world of the Grand Xia will be no easy task.
The Primordial Imperial Clan? Hmph…that’s not just a meaningless
phrase. Even though he’s merely of one of the side branches of that
lineage, he won’t be easy to deal with,” the Cavemaster said.

Chapter 8 - A Sense of Danger
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The alluring woman
nodded. “Understood. I always thought that the world of the Grand
Xia wasn’t that powerful. The world of Mount Stele, for example,
has three True Immortals or Empyrean Gods.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The world of the
Grand Xia is blessed by tremendous luck; in all of the Three Realms,
it ranks at the very top. Given that such a major world has been
completely unified…how could it be weaker than the likes of the
Mount Stele world?” The Cavemaster shook his head. “You have to
understand that in order to unify a major world, the unifier has to
have either tremendous personal power or an extremely significant
background.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh. Then,
Master…that Ji Ning…what should we do to him?” The alluring
woman asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He trained in the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art], which means that his master is one of the
most supreme of Daofathers.” The Cavemaster laughed. “However…it
doesn’t matter who his master is, because he definitely isn’t on
our side. If Ji Ning is allowed to develop within the world of the
Grand Xia, he’ll just end up being a source of serious trouble to
us. Ideally, we should kill him right away! Even the Daofather behind
him would probably have to seriously consider whether or not it is
worth it for him to get involved for the sake of a single disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How should we kill
him?” The alluring woman asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Myriad Demons
Cave is responsible for manufacturing golems. Fighting and killing
isn’t our field of responsibility. Killing enemies will be
rewarded, if we don’t fight, that’s fine as well.” The
Cavemaster laughed, “Since even Buchasi was unable to do anything
to Ji Ning, he’s definitely going to be a tough nut to crack. Leave
it to the Seamless Gate. Disciple, make a trip on my behalf to speak
with the Gatemaster of the Seamless Gate. Have them kill Ji Ning,
this unexpected variable, as soon as possible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The alluring
woman respectfully assented to the order…and then she left the
palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This commandery city
was enormous, and it was divided into many regions. The insides of
the city were tightly guarded. This alluring woman was a beloved
disciple of the Cavemaster of the Myriad Demons Cave, and her status
was comparable to an ordinary Celestial Immortal’s. Thus, she was
able to quickly arrive at the closest local headquarters of the
Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Xia Dynasty
had been searching for the headquarters of the Seamless Gate this
entire time to no avail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because…the
Seamless Gate’s headquarters was located within this world, the
Fifth World. This Fifth World was so powerful that even Celestial
Immortals who dared to barge in would be instantly slain. If a True
Immortal or Empyrean God entered, then immediately moved to flee,
they might be able to escape…but if they tried to fight head-on,
they would probably perish as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Figures could often be
seen flying about in the air above the commandery city. Anyone who
dared fly within a commandery city of the Fifth World had to be at
least at the Celestial Immortal level. There were so many Celestial
Immortals here that one could usually see at least ten thousand
figures flying about in the skies. The total number of Celestial
Immortals present was truly astonishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, the
Cavemaster of the Myriad Demons Cave and the Gatemaster of the
Seamless Gate were all just a very small part of the full power of
the Fifth World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Silkworm greets you,
Gatemaster,” the alluring woman said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” An
azure-robed woman with long, unbound hair was seated in the lotus
position, her eyes shut. She was the Gatemaster of the Seamless Gate.
By her side were two standing maidservants.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The alluring woman said
respectfully, “This matter involves someone named Ji Ning…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She told the entire
tale from start to finish with great detail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your master’s
assignment is the same as mine; we have been assigned the worlds of
the Grand Xia, Mount Stele, and Dreamsong.” The azure-robed woman
opened her eyes, then said calmly, “The toughest world to invade is
the world of the Grand Xia…but your Myriad Demons Cave has actually
made committed an error like this, making this assignment even harder
to complete. And now, you want my Seamless Gate to wipe your ass for
you and clean this up? Still…since your master has made the
request, I’ll accept. Go back and say this…say…‘Old crow, if
you can’t even accomplish a task like forging golems, I think you
should let someone else take over your job.’”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The alluring woman’s
face changed, but she didn’t dare argue back. She said
respectfully, “Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go,” the
azure-robed woman said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The alluring woman
immediately departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-robed woman
called out, “Violetgrass.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gatemaster.” One
of the two nearby maidens, the one whose face was covered with a
violet flowery tattoo, hurriedly called out with respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You heard it all.
I’m leaving this matter regarding Ji Ning for you to handle. How to
deal with him, what arrangements to make; it is all completely up to
you. You’ve followed me for many years, and you are quite familiar
with our affairs in the Grand Xia. Although this is a somewhat
troublesome assignment, I trust that you will be able to complete it
well.” The azure-robed woman’s voice and tone was much kinder
than before; clearly, she doted on this servant of hers very much.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
Master. I know Ji Ning quite well; I have plenty of ways to deal with
him,” Violetgrass said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good. Go make your
preparations, then head to the major world of the Grand Xia,” the
violet-robed woman instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That very day. The
maiden, dressed in a golden robe that was embroidered with images of
violet grass and flowers, led nine Celestial Immortals to quietly
depart from the Fifth World and go to the world of the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stillwater Commandery.
A desolate area that was hundreds of thousands of kilometers away
from Stillwater City. There was a beautiful lake here, with a wooden
house next to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was already dusk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two figures appeared in
the air here, then landed on the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Xia…we’re
back.” Mu Northson cupped that soultamer jade globe in his hands as
he spoke out softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The grass here had
been completely destroyed, but it’s all grown back now.” A
woman’s voice came out from the jade globe; she was very happy
right now. “Fortunately, that battle didn’t end up damaging our
house.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson looked towards
the wooden house as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had personally
chopped the wood and built that house, using some of his skill in the
Dao of Constructs as he did so. Thus, despite the passage of twenty
years, the wooden house remained in perfect condition. In fact,
weaker individuals wouldn’t even be able to go inside it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It wasn’t damaged,
but that was because we were too weak back them. Thus, we were
captured effortlessly by those black-robed figures,” Northson
laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re finally
free. We’ve finally escaped. Northson, we won’t have to be so
unhappy in the future,” the woman in the jade globe said, her voice
filled with joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just watched
quietly from the side. In his heart, he sighed to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His original plan was
to allow the soul of Yu Xia to go and be reborn into his Ji clan. He
would help Northson take care of the reincarnated Yu Xia and come up
with a way for her to recover her memories! This was something which
he was capable of doing; after all, after the Six Paths of
Reincarnation were destroyed, all the major powers had begun to set
up new paths of reincarnation for their territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single one of
them was like a miniature cycle of reincarnation. The Crescent world,
for example, had a miniature cycle of reincarnation within it as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas…” Ning
mused to himself, “There’s no way to change things now. She’ll
forever be trapped within that soultamer jade sphere. Most likely,
the only thing sustaining her right now is the love between her and
Northson, as well as some things that she still cares for in the
mortal world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother.” Northson came walking over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.” Ning looked at Northson. He could sense that
although his junior apprentice-brother felt some regret and pain in
his heart, he was clearly once more filled with vigor and energy. He
didn’t look as tired and dispirited as he had in the past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If it wasn’t for
you, I probably would’ve died in that place,” Northson said.
“Senior apprentice-brother, no need to worry about me; you can go
back now. In the future, if there’s anything you need, you can find
me here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The current world of
the Grand Xia is filled with dangerous undercurrents, while you are a
grandmaster of the Dao of Constructs. How am I suppose to rest my
mind, knowing you are here?” Ning said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There really is no
need for you to stay. I’m a Void-level Earth Immortal now, after
all; if I’m careful, I’ll be fine,” Northson said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned. Then,
with a wave of his hand, he produced a storage magic treasure. One
enormous construct after another instantly appeared next to them,
such as a Turtle-Snake, a winged bird-man, or an eight-clawed
serpent. In total, there were six golems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are the golems
I acquired after I killed the bronze-armored Fiendguard called Qu
Huan. They feel fairly powerful to me,” Ning said. “Find one that
is suited to you and which will allow you to increase your power the
most.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson glanced at
them, his gaze settling down upon that of the winged golem. He called
out in surprise, “A Winged Immortal golem? How can you have one of
them? Generally speaking, bronze-armored Fiendguards aren’t
qualified to possess golems of the Winged Immortal class.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Winged Immortal
class?” Ning was curious as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the
second-ranked golem within the forbidden region,” Northson said.
“Look at its wings; its wings can unleash the ‘Seven Ruinous
Thunderwinds’, and its speed is extremely fast as well! Even a mere
Loose Immortal or Earth Immortal who is in control of a Winged
Immortal golem will instantly have the combat power of a Celestial
Immortal. However, its main purpose is to unleash the ‘Seven
Ruinous Thunderwinds’, then immediately flee. In battle, it should
be extremely, extremely valuable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson knew how to
make these things, but he didn’t know exactly how much they were
worth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, did.
Upon hearing his junior apprentice-brother say these things, he could
guess that this golem was probably comparable in value to a
middle-grade Pure Yang treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The others are a bit
weaker; perhaps all five them added together would be comparable to a
single Winged Immortal class,” Northson said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning thus immediately
came to the conclusion that the other four were probably comparable
to a low-grade Pure Yang treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They really do spare
no expense, thanks to their wealth. Every single bronze-armored
Fiendguard had at least one such golem…this is probably the same
amount of wealth as most Celestial Immortals possess,” Ning mused
to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But here, Ning was
wrong. He valued them as a low-grade Pure Yang treasure, but that was
the ‘list price’ here in the Three Realms for someone seeking to
purchase them; in truth, to the mysterious power, these items were
nothing more than a collection of precious ingredients, and the value
of those ingredients was perhaps a tenth of the value of the complete
item. For a truly supreme golem…the formation-diagram within it was
actually of the greatest value. Without a detailed formation-diagram,
no matter how good your ingredients were, you wouldn’t be able to
complete the forging.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, take this Winged Immortal class,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson was greatly
shocked. He hurriedly said, ,”Senior apprentice-brother, this
Winged Immortal class will be of great use to you. Ji Ning, you saved
my life; I, Mu Northson, already feel tremendous gratitude to you
fort his. How can I accept this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, junior
apprentice-brother, I was able to enter and leave that forbidden
region as I pleased; not even that ‘general’ was able to do
anything to me. This Winged Immortal golem might be important to
others, but it really isn’t that useful for me. All I would do
would be to sell it off.” Ning shook his head and laughed; this was
nothing more than the truth, after all. The [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]
was much better at protecting him than the golem would be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you don’t
accept it, how could I rest my mind? Enough, stop wasting words; I’m
going to leave now.” Ning waved his arm and collected the other
golems, then disappeared without another world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson held the
soultamer jade in his arms. He murmured softly, “Senior
apprentice-brother…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northson, your
senior apprentice-brother has helped us so much. Never forget it,”
the woman within the jade globe said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Northson
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning secretly watched
as Northson bound the Winged Immortal golem, then took the jade globe
to go and sit down at the entrance to the wooden house, where he
simply stared at the lake. Every so often, he would say a few things
to the jade globe. This sight caused Ning to feel quite heartsick.
After watching a time, he finally, truly left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is time to go to
the imperial capital of the Grand Xia.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This time, I rescued
my junior apprentice-brother, but I offended that mysterious power. I
need to acquire Five Elements essence as soon as possible to train my
[Starseizing Hand] to the Fourth Cycle.” Ning had a premonition of
incoming danger. This sense of danger was compelling him to increase
his own power as soon as he could!
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 9 - A Talk at Night
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was late at night.
Ji Ning used a void blink to arrive within the centermost city of the
entire world of the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Heavenly
Treasures Mountain of the imperial capital of the Grand Xia. Within a
residence. Ning was drinking wine by himself, facing the bright moon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s ears
twitched; he glanced sideways. A white-robed, silver-haired man had
just come walking in through the door.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Skyfox,”
Ning laughed, then rose to his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since you’ve
hurried here so late at night, I’m sure you must have an urgent
matter to deal with.” The silver-haired man smiled as he spoke. “Ji
Ning, if there’s anything you need, just tell me. His Imperial
Majesty has ordered this long ago; I naturally won’t be the
slightest bit negligent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “I need
to buy some precious items.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Precious? How
precious?” The silver-haired man asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need fifteen
thousand kilograms of gold-gems from the Heaven Realm, thirty
thousand kilograms of azurespirit jade bamboo, forty-five thousand
kilograms of arcane elemental Yin-water from the Milky Way, fifteen
hundred kilograms of dragonfish spirit-lava, and six hundred
kilograms of chaos spirit-earth,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hearing this, the face
of the silver-haired man changed. “That much?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At LEAST that much.”
Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were other
alternatives, of course…but the items which Ning had reported were
already the cheapest items with Five Elements essence that could be
used to train in the Fourth Cycle of the [Six Cycles of the
Starseizer]. If he had the chance, he would naturally be willing to
choose the more expensive items; for example, Five Elements peacock
plumes from a peacock Godbeast that was at the Empyrean God level
would be more than enough; in fact, there would be a great deal left
over!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the lineage of
a Godbeast at the Empyrean God level would be incomparably pure. Such
an item would be far too precious, more valuable than even an
ordinary top-grade Pure Yang treasure! And, more importantly, such
things were incredibly rare! Since the founding of the universe by
Pangu, the total number of peacock Godbeast that had reached the
Empyrean God level and which had access to all five of the Five
Elements could be counted on one hand. Only two of them had perished,
and the Five Elements peacock plumes they had left behind had long
ago been acquired by various major powers in order to create even
more valuable items. How could Ning possibly buy them somewhere? And
even if he could find them, how could he afford it?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your request is too
great. These are all precious items of the Three Realms; they
represent the essence of the Five Elements. There are many uses for
such items, from forging artifacts to refining pills. I’ll help you
ask his Imperial Majesty,” the silver-haired man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed, then
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-haired man
sat down, then poured himself some wine. He said with a laugh, “Let’s
drink some wine first. His Imperial Majesty will give his answer
shortly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
knew that this person was the Xia Emperor’s spirit-beast; they
could communicate spiritually to each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, what do you
want these things for? Refining pills? Forging magic treasures?
Creating golems?” The silver-haired man asked. “You’ve trained
for less than a hundred years. Regardless of what you need it for…the
art of refining pills and forging magic treasures is one that takes
an enormous amount of time to study. The experts in these fields
within the Three Realms are all at elast at the Celestial Immortal
level. Because they have limitless lifespans, they can slowly spend
their time in analyzing these fields.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed as well.
Indeed; the spirit of the underwater estate, for example, had used an
utterly terrifying amount of time to upgrade the Thousandbull Sword.
From a certain perspective, it could be said that the spirit of the
underwater estate was actually fairly weak in this field; otherwise,
he wouldn’t have had to spend such an enormous amount of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have my uses for
it,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Starseizing Hand]
was simply too famous, but no one knew exactly how one trained in it!
He didn’t have to worry at all about his [Starseizing Hand] being
revealed thanks to him purchasing Five Elements items.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” The
silver-haired man laughed, not pursuing this line of questioning. A
short while later, his eyes lit up. “Ji Ning, his Imperial Majesty
has informed me that he can provide you with enough gold-gems from
the Heaven Realm and arcane elemental Yin-water from the Milky Way,
but he’s not able to come up with enough of the other three items.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then let me change
them to some different items.” Ning suggested three different
alternatives.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t have it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, these
treasures that you are requesting are all Five Elements treasures
that are on the same level.” The silver-haired man shook his head.
“His Imperial Majesty says that he is not an expert in forging
items or refining pills, and so he hasn’t kept a large amount of
these items in his stockpile. If you wish, he can go and find some of
his friends and trade treasures with them to come up with enough for
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately said
with gratitude, “I would be utterly grateful if he did.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you should
know by now that the more valuable a treasure is, the harder it is to
purchase; generally, you have to trade using items of similar value.”
The silver-haired man looked towards Ning. “If you want these
items, you need to bring out enough treasures to trade for them. Do
you have enough?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What sort of
treasures do I need to bring out for them?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One normal
high-grade Pure Yang Treasure is enough,” the silver-haired man
said with a laugh. “Twenty of those arrows you brought last time is
enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sighed in his
heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five Elements
ingredients and treasures were actually this expensive? But there was
nothing for it. The [Starseizing Hand] required increasingly
extravagant amounts of ingredients for the later stages. Fortunately,
all he had to train was his pair of hands. If he had to train his
entire body, like with the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], then the price
would be even more ridiculous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, he had
reached the sixteenth stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine
Heavens]; he could train his [Starseizing Hand] to the Fourth Cycle
now, and train all the way to the Sixth Cycle of the [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art]. However, the resources needed for the Art was a thousand
times greater than the previous price he had paid…most likely, he
would need at least ten top-grade Pure Yang treasures. This caused
Ning to feel truly resigned!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Top-grade Pure Yang
treasures had power comparable to middle-grade Protocosmic
spirit-treasures. Many Pure Yang True Immortals and Empyrean Gods
used treasures on this level; for even one of them to produce ten
such items would prove a serious burden. This was why even Ning’s
senior apprentice-brother, Empyrean God Silvermoon, had only trained
to the Sixth Cycle of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For now, I can
forget about training further in the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]. That’s
too distant a goal. First, the [Starseizing Hand].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, are you
able to produce enough treasures?” The silver-haired man looked at
Ning, a smile on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please ask his
Imperial Majesty to prepare enough of the Five Elements items,”
Ning said. “Once his Imperial Majesty has prepared them, I’ll
naturally bring out enough treasures to trade for them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The
silver-haired man said, “His Imperial Majesty will personally act
to gather these treasures for you. Once he has, I’ll immediately
notify you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
producing a jade talisman. “This is my message talisman. Once you
shatter it, I’ll sense it and will hurry back here to the imperial
capital.” It was extremely easy to manufacture jade seals of this
nature; Ning had actually prepared a large pile of them, handing them
out to the Ji clan, Autumn Leaf, his master Immortal Diancai, and
others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The
silver-haired man rose to his feet. “Then wait for my news.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Might I ask how long
it will take?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could subconsciously
sense danger coming, forcing him to train in the Fourth Cycle as
quickly as he could. Upon succeeding, his hands would become
comparable to supreme top-grade Pure Yang treasures, equivalent to
middle-grade Protocosmic spirit-treasures. They would be even more
powerful than ordinary top-grade Pure Yang treasures, allowing his
own strength to once more rapidly skyrocket to a new level. In
addition, by relying on his [Three Heads, Six Arms] divine ability,
he would have six mighty palms, each of which was comparable to a
supreme top-grade Pure Yang treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It won’t take too
long; this is just a trade of treasures. A month should suffice.”
The silver-haired man intentionally added a bit of extra padding; in
truth, just two or three days could be enough, or perhaps ten days at
the most.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
immediately rose to his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That very night, Ning
went to King Yan’s Estate. He was going to live there temporarily,
so that he could spend some time with his cousin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within an ancient
tower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five figures were
seated in the lotus position, each occupying a different part.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum
opened his eyes, glancing at the area. The furrow in his brows grew
deeper. Ever since his plan of asking Bloodcloud Hall to assassinate
Ji Ning had failed, the Youngflame clan had grown ever-more convinced
that Ji Ning was a true danger to them! However…no matter how hard
they searched, they couldn’t find an opportunity to act against
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If this continues,
Ji Ning will continue to grow in strength. Once he explodes forth
against us…our Youngflame clan will be in a disastrous situation.”
Patriarch Arcanum was beginning to worry. “And according to what
our intelligence reports have discovered…Ji Ning is someone who
cares deeply about filial piety. There’s no way he’ll forget
about the grudge his mother bore for us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In fact, he was even
able to endure the fact that we attempted to kill him in the imperial
capital of the Grand Xia.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This means he is
very capable of suppressing himself and biding his time!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The reason he has
done so is most likely because he feels he is not strong enough yet.
Once he feels he is strong enough…our Youngflame clan will probably
be in true danger.” Patriarch Arcanum’s heart was filled with
worry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Originally, all he
wanted to do was give vent to his anger. But now…he was beginning
to truly worry for his clan. It must be understood that supreme clans
and major powers rarely got into true, life-and-death fights against
each other! This was because supreme powers generally had Celestial
Immortals protecting them. Celestial Immortals possessed truly
infinite lifespans; even if one annihilated the enemy’s clan, if
the enemy Celestial Immortal was to survive, then what in a million
years or ten million years, the enemy Celestial Immortal was to
launch a sudden sneak attack! After the sneak attack, the Celestial
Immortal could vanish for a long time…then launch another one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If a Celestial Immortal
with an infinite lifespan was to devote that entire life to harm a
clan…that would be a truly terrifying thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more powerful an
organization, the more rare it was for them to fight head-on against
another such organization! Each would generally prefer to find a path
to compromise!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But once they truly
were to fight head-on…then they would use their full power to
annihilate the enemy completely, or at least wipe out all of the
enemy’s top-tier fighters!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To the Youngflame clan,
Ji Ning now posed a major threat. He was a monster who even
Bloodcloud Hall had failed to assassinate successfully…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Suddenly, all
five of the Celestial Immortals present opened their eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all pulled out a
similar bronze talisman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s the Seamless
Gate,” the white-haired, wizened elder said in a low voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate
wishes to meet with our Youngflame clan?” The handsome youth
frowned. “What are they going to do? When they previously tried to
pull us into their orbit, we refused them. We aren’t willing to
become enemies with the Seamless Gate, but even less are we willing
to betray the Xia Emperor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, I’ll
make the trip.” Patriarch Arcanum rose to his feet. “I’m going
to go see what this Seamless Gate wants, exactly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll leave it in
your hands, Arcanum.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just delay for now.
The Seamless Gate is very powerful; we aren’t capable of resisting
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum
exited from othat ancient tower, traveling alone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Late night. A bright
moon was hanging in the skies, bathing the world below with its glow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A maiden was quietly
waiting atop a solitary mountain peak, staring at the bright moon.
Behind her were a total of nine golden-robed Celestial Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Arcanum, the
Exalted Envoy is right there.” A cloud flew towards them, with two
figures atop it. One of them was a tall, skinny, narrow-eyed elder;
this was Patriarch Arcanum. The other was a golden-robed and
seemingly quite amiable elder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum
stared into the distance, then his pupils contracted. That maiden
actually had a total of nine Celestial Immortals with her?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate is
unreasonably powerful. A single envoy is actually leading a squad of
so many Celestial Immortals. I’m afraid that this squad alone is
enough to annihilate most supreme clans.” Patriarch Arcanum
couldn’t help but feel a surge of cold fear. Although he was quite
arrogant and brash in front of others, in front of the Seamless Gate,
he still felt nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum
landed on the mountain peak, then immediately said, “Arcanum greets
you, Envoy.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_10___Lying_in_Wait"></A>
Chapter 10 - Lying in Wait
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Violetgrass
nodded lightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum
secretly inspected her. This young female envoy before him wore
golden clothes that were embroidered with eye-catching violet
flowers; clearly, she was an extraordinary figure. The Celestial
Immortals behind here were all dressed in more ordinary golden
clothes; this clearly reflected their lower status.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Celestial Immortal
Arcanum of the Youngflame clan…do you know why I have come looking
for you?” Violetgrass said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arcanum is unable to
guess at your motives, Envoy.” Patriarch Arcanum’s attitude was
quite humble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Violetgrass laughed.
“Hahaha…in recent years, our Seamless Gate has helped your
Youngflame clan out quite a few times. I trust that by now, you can
sense our sincerity. As for our power…although we’ve only
revealed a hint of it, you should have sensed how powerful we are.
Our Seamless Gate goes where we please and does as we please within
the world of the Grand Xia, and what does the imperial Xiamang clan
do about it? Just stare at us and watch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Indeed,” Patriarch
Arcanum said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given how powerful the
Seamless Gate was, they definitely knew how mighty the imperial
Xiamang clan was, but they still dared to act with such abandon.
Without confidence in themselves, would they dare to act this way?
None of the Celestial Immortals under their command were fools; the
response, or lack thereof, from the imperial Xia clan reflected how
powerful the Seamless Gate truly was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can tell you this.
In the world of the Grand Xia, many powers have already thrown their
support to our Seamless Gate,” Violetgrass said with a sigh. “Their
tribes have only grown more powerful after doing so. I can promise
you that so long as your Youngflame clan is willing to throw your
support to us as well, your power will instantly increase many times
over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum
simply continued to smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What a joke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only ones throwing
their support were lesser powers like the Eastwoods Sect or the Blood
God Church. Most likely, very, very few marquises had turned traitor.
After all, upon doing so, that meant one would become true enemies
with the imperial Xia clan. Behind the imperial Xia clan was
Daofather Raindragon and Daofather Crimsonbright! It wouldn’t be
easy to deal with them! The two Daofathers could probably wipe them
out with a wave of the hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I trust that you can
tell how sincere our Seamless Gate is, given that I’ve come in
person,” Violetgrass said, looking at Arcanum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arcanum is indeed
grateful that you have come in person, Envoy. However, this is a
matter that could involve the annihilation of my clan. Arcanum does
not dare to make this decision without consulting others. Upon my
return, I shall definitely inform my other clansmen, and we shall
discuss this in detail,” Patriarch Arcanum said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Violetgrass shook her
head. “To show our sincerity…I’ll tell you something else.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pray tell.”
Patriarch Arcanum’s eyes lit up; the Seamless Gate had indeed
helped out the Youngflame clan several times recently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard that your
Youngflame clan has a major headache named Ji Ning,” Violetgrass
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Patriarch
Arcanum admitted it right away. His eyes lit up. “Can it be that
you, Envoy, are willing to get rid of Ji Ning for our Youngflame
clan? If you get rid of him, we will be endlessly grateful to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get rid of Ji Ning?
That’s not impossible. If your Youngflame clan is willing to
subordinate yourselves to our Seamless Gate, then within a single
day, the Seamless Gate will take his life, regardless of who his
backer is.” Violetgrass was filled with complete self-confidence.
And then, with a half-smile on her face, she said, “If your
Youngflame clan isn’t willing to support us…then our Seamless
Gate can’t possibly act on your behalf.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum was
laughing coldly in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Support them?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was a disaster,
true.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But supporting the
Seamless Gate would run the risk of true annihilation for the entire
clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ning has
several important friends and family members,” Violetgrass said
calmly. “If you want to act against him, all you need to do is keep
an eye on them; you’ll be able to find him eventually.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But his master,
Immortal Diancai, is already a Celestial Immortal.” Patriarch
Arcanum frowned. “In addition, he’s at Stillwater City. As for
the important clansmen of the Ji clan, they are few in number and are
all in Swallow Mountain. Our Youngflame clan has no chance at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No. He has a junior
apprentice-brother named Mu Northson,” Violetgrass said. “The two
of them are lifelong friends who went through life and death
together.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But Mu Northson has
been missing for twenty-plus year.” Patriarch Arcanum shook his
head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Violetgrass smiled. “Ji
Ning’s already rescued him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum was
startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Youngflame clan had
already investigated Ji Ning in detail. They had even investigated
the likes of Mu Northson and Immortal Diancai in detail. They knew
long ago about Immortal Diancai becoming a Celestial Immortal, but
they hadn’t found any information regarding Northson’s return.
From this, one could see that the Seamless Gate’s intelligence
network was much superior to theirs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition, Mu
Northson isn’t at Swallow Mountain. Nor is he in Stillwater City.”
Violetgrass waved her hand, and a leather scroll appeared. She tossed
it to Patriarch Arcanum, who hurriedly accepted it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mu Northson’s
exact location is here on this map,” Violetgrass said. “As long
as you keep an eye on him, within a short period of time you shall
probably see Ji Ning going to visit him! In fact, if you are in a
hurry…you can even kidnap Mu Northson and force Ji Ning to show
himself. It’s entirely up to you how your Youngflame clan wishes to
proceed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Envoy.”
Patriarch Arcanum was overjoyed as he stared at this leather-bound
scroll.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Seamless Gate
has helped your Youngflame clan once again,” Violetgrass said
calmly. “Although our Seamless Gate is patient…our patience has a
limit. If you continue to refuse to support us…then we will be
forced to view you as loyal to the death to the imperial Xia clan. In
the future, when we act against the imperial Xia clan…we might very
well strike first against your Youngflame clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum’s
face changed. He said hurriedly, “Don’t worry, Envoy. I can sense
how sincere the Seamless Gate is. There is a good deal of debate
within our Youngflame clan about what to do, but of one thing you can
be assured; we are definitely not loyal to the death to the imperial
Xia clan. Definitely now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What wonderful
words.” Violetgrass waved her hand. “Go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did Patriarch
Arcanum depart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the only figures
left on that solitary, icy mountain peak were Violetgrass and the ten
Celestial Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Milord, to have the
Youngflame clan deal with Ji Ning…are they strong enough? He’s
trained in the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art],” a golden-robed Celestial
Immortal whispered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t
underestimate the Youngflame clan.” Violetgrass shook her head.
“The Youngflame clan has existed since the era of Pangu’s World,
eventually migrating here to the world of the Grand Xia. Ancient clan
like this all have extremely formidable tools at their disposal.
Consider this; in the past, the Kindwater clan fought with the
Xiamang clan over the Emperorship of the Grand Xia. The Kindwater
clan is a branch of a major clan of Pangu’s World which had a group
of True Immortals and Empyrean Gods backing them. And yet, although
the Kindwater clan and the Youngflame clan have been struggling
against each other for so many years, the Youngflame clan has never
been wiped out, even though they’ve suffered a bit. In fact, on the
whole, the Youngflame clan has been full of vigor. How can you
underestimate the Youngflame clan?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The many
Celestial Immortals all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Watch and see,”
Violetgrass said calmly. “We’ll let the Youngflame clan use their
resources to fight first, while we’ll keep watch from the shadows,
learning more about Ji Ning’s powers and tools. If the Youngflame
clan truly is unable to wipe out this Ji Ning, then by then we will
still have a high level of information regarding him. Naturally, at
that point, we can lay a trap for him, then wipe him out with a
single lightning-fast strike.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If my belief is
correct…given that the Youngflame clan is willing to fight against
the Kindwater clan to such a degree, they must have an astonishingly
formidable background. So long as the Daofather behind Ji Ning
doesn’t interfere, it shouldn’t be hard for them to kill him,”
Violetgrass said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Youngflame clan
began to deliberate in secret, coming up with numerous scenarios for
killing Ji Ning, in accordance with the intelligence reports they had
received.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This time…let the
four of us join forces. Arcanum, Deadwood, Goldclock, and myself,
Infatuation, shall fight together.” The ancient elder swept the
others with his gaze. “The three of you shall be under my command.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
Patriarch Arcanum nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Infatuation, we
trust you,” the man who held a large clock in his hand agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
white-haired Patriarch Deadwood nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Infatuation
was an ancient man who had a look of hidden grief within his eyes…but
his power was truly enormous. Celestial Immortal Infatuation was
fairly famous within the Three Realms, and was one of the truly
top-tier Celestial Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sunfish, I’ll
leave you to protect this tower,” Patriarch Infatuation instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Patriarch
Sunfish nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,”
Patriarch Infatuation said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, Patriarchs
Arcanum, Deadwood, and Goldclock followed him in departing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was nighttime. These
four Celestial Immortals stealthily made their way to Stillwater
Commandery. All four of them were extremely powerful, with Patriarch
Infatuation being the strongest. Patriarch Deadwood possessed
powerful spells, while Patriarch Goldclock had a powerful magical
item; the two were roughly on par with each other. Patriarch Arcanum
was actually ranked as the weakest, but he was still quite an
excellent Celestial Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Stillwater
Commandery. A wild region. Four figures stealthily appeared in the
air above a lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look. Over there.”
Patriarch Arcanum pointed towards the distance, where a wooden house
could be seen next to a lake. Outside the wooden house, a white-robed
youth with some white hair was seated on the stairs, head raised as
he stared at the bright moon. He was holding a jade globe in his
hands. “Little Xia, today is the sixteenth, right? The moon is
actually even rounder than it was yesterday.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It really is round.
According to the legends, the Fairy of the Moon Palace, Chang’e,
lives upon the Lunar Star which is located outside of the Three
Realms.” The maiden in the jade globe spoke with some envy. 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. In the
future, when I grow powerful, I’ll take you, Little Xia, to pay a
visit to the Lunar Star. We’ll see for ourselves if there really is
a Moon Palace, and if there really is a Chang’e,” the white-robed
youth said, nodding his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four distant
Celestial Immortals had hidden themselves long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It really is Mu
Northson.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate’s
information is accurate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prepare the
formations now. After preparing everything, leave the formations
un-activated; after Ji Ning arrives, we’ll activate them,”
Patriarch Infatuation immediately ordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Actually, why do we
even need formations? Once this greatclock of mine is unleashed, he
will perish,” the man holding the greatclock said confidently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although this golden
clock of yours was transported to this world of the Grand Xia long
ago by our Youngflame clan from Pangu’s World, and although it is
extremely powerful and a top-grade Pure Yang treasure…this Ji Ning
was was able to escape from even Bloodcloud Hall’s assassination
attempt. We absolutely must not be careless. We have to prepare
everything perfectly,” Patriarch Infatuation instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, the four
Celestial Immortals began to prepare their ambush by this lake. Given
their abilities, Northson was completely unable to detect them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortals
possessed infinite lifespans, and so they possessed exceptional
patience.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial capital of
the Grand Xia. King Yan’s Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second day after
Ning took up residence within King Yan’s Estate. He was
accompanying his cousin, Yuchi Xiyue, in strolling about the streets
of the estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leaving? So soon?”
Yuchi Xiyue was rather reluctant to let him go. “Didn’t you say
that Swallow Mountain is protected by layers of formations, and that
it is like an impregnable fortress? Isn’t it very safe?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going to go
see my junior apprentice-brother. I feel uneasy,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you feel
uneasy about?” A voice suddenly rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From around the corner
of the stone path, a tall, muscular figure appeared, dressed in loose
robes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Respectful greetings
to you, King Yan,” Ning said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You came to my
place, but you plan to leave without even coming to see me?” King
Yan said with a laugh. “Come, let’s take a walk and have a talk.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Xiyue both
moved to accompany King Yan on the walk, chatting about various
important current affairs regarding the Grand Xia as they did. Ning
suddenly said, “Senior King Yan, I heard that Daofather
Crimsonbright has set up a miniature cycle of reincarnation for his
major worlds. Do you know of this matter, senior?” Ning had been
wanting to learn more about his parents this entire time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Yan was of the
imperial clan; he naturally should know about the miniature cycle of
reincarnation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course I do.”
King Yan nodded, then suddenly said with a chortle, “Could it be
that you have forgotten my nickname?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nickname?” Ning
was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Yan’s nickname
was ‘Yama-King’. 2
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After the Daofather
rebuilt the cycle of reincarnation, he set it to encompass tens of
major worlds and countless minor worlds,” King Yan said with a
laugh. “His cycle also has ten Yama-Kings, and I am one of them,
the Ten Yama-Kings of Hell.”

Chapter 11 - The Youngflame Clan Strikes
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?!” Ji Ning
revealed a look of joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grandpa, you are one
of the Ten Yama-Kings of Hell?” The nearby Yuchi Xiyue was startled
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Yan laughed
loudly. “Merely one of the ten that are assigned to this minor
cycle of reincarnation; we’re only in charge of this region
controlled by Daofather Crimsonbright. There are currently many
Yama-Kings in the world; there’s nearly a thousand of us. They are
not, however, the ten original ones that governed the Netherworld
Kingdom…those ten were all at the True Immortal or Empyrean God
level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grandpa, how did you
end up as one of the Ten Yama-Kings of Hell?” Yuchi Xiyue asked
curiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When the Daofather
first re-established the cycle of reincarnation, he needed candidates
for the Ten Yama-Kings and for the First Judge of the Dead, and so
the various worlds began to propose people. The Grand Xia had to
propose a person as well. Because I am of the imperial clan and just
became a Celestial Immortal, his Imperial Majesty had me take up the
position of Yama-King,” King Yan explained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood. Given
that he was of the imperial clan and that he had just become a
Celestial Immortal, it made sense that he had been chosen to become
one of the Ten Yama-Kings of Hell.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Positions such as this,
within a minor cycle of reincarnation, actually weren’t that
exalted in status. But of course, back in the Netherworld Kingdom,
the original Ten Yama-Kings of Hell were in control of all living
creatures within the entire Three Realms; their power was truly
enormous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, why are you
asking about the minor cycle of reincarnation? Is there something you
need?” King Yan looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
“Senior King Yan, this junior has a matter that I would beseech
your assistance with.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak,” King Yan
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial clan had
always been quite close-knit. Given that the world of the Grand Xia
now had several powerful organizations hidden within it, the imperial
clan had only become even more close-knit due to the pressure! Since
the Xia Emperor had designated Ning as someone that could ‘only be
befriended, not be made an enemy’, and since he felt very certain
that Ning was most likely the disciple of a Daofather, he had
naturally spread the word to all the Celestial Immortals within the
imperial clan. King Yan’s attitude towards Ning was now much
different compared to the past, prior to the Conclave of Immortal
Destiny. Back then, he treated Ning as he would any other junior, but
now he treated Ning as someone on the same level as him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I trust you know,
senior King Yan, that my father Ji Yichuan and my mother Yuchi Snow
have already passed away many years ago,” Ning said. “I dearly
desire to learn about how my mother and father are currently doing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s the point
of investigating this?” King Yan looked towards Ning. “After
being reborn, they won’t have any memories of their past life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If they are living
good, happy lives after their rebirth, I won’t disturb them,”
Ning said. “I just want to see for myself…to see if they are
doing well and to see if there’s anything I can do for them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” King Yan
nodded. “Fine. Leave this to me. I expect that in a few months,
I’ll have an answer for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A few months?”
Ning was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you feel that is
a long time?” King Yan laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Yan asked him, “Do
you know how many how many living creatures die every day across
these dozens of major worlds and countless minor worlds?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But I heard that in
the Netherworld Kingdom, such investigations are very fast,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s because
that place is the Netherworld Kingdom. It was built by Maiden Nuwa
herself, and it also holds the treasured Book of Life and Death,
which is one with the Dao of the Heavens,” King Yan said. “The
Book of Life and Death can duplicate itself into trillions of copies,
and so it controlled the reincarnation, karmic merit, history, and
life of all living things. But what we have here is merely a minor
cycle of reincarnation established by Daofather Crimsonbright. We
don’t have a Book of Life and Death! Thus, our minor cycle of
reincarnation is actually even busier than the old one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The process of
simply recording the countless deaths and rebirths of the world, as
well as karmic virtues and demerits, requires enormous amounts of
information to be recorded every single day on magic books,” King
Yan said. “And we only have roughly a hundred years of information;
anything beyond that is completely lost.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Completely lost?”
Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. There’s no
way for us to investigate the records that existed before the Six
Paths of Reincarnation were destroyed. Although we can go to the
Netherworld Kingdom to seek out the First Judge of the Dead, Judge
Cui, in order to investigate the history of a soul across a thousand
lifetimes…the amount of information and history regarding every
single person is simply enormous. There’s simply no way for us to
record all the history regarding the countless living creatures that
exist across countless millions of worlds. And so, we don’t even
bother with it,” King Yan explained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In fact, nowadays
the Judges for the various minor cycles of reincarnation don’t even
bother with wasting time on examining the past lives of the souls of
the dead. They just look at karma, then based on positive karma or
negative sin, decide if a person will be reincarnated as an animal or
as a person, and if the person will be reincarnated with wealth or
into poverty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he had met Judge
Cui, Judge Cui had instantly known everything that had happened to
him during his previous life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the judges of this
minor cycle of reincarnation only looked at karma and sin; they
didn’t even look at a person’s life history! Still…this did
speed things up considerably.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll send someone
to help investigate on your behalf. Still…to search through the
sea-like mass of records to find the specific history-tablets
pertaining to your parents will indeed take some time,” King Yan
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, senior,”
Ning said hurriedly with gratitude. Only now did he understand the
magnitude of his request to search for someone who had been
reincarnated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Several months? So be
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, where can
one find the First Judge of the Dead of the Netherworld Kingdom,
Judge Cui?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want to find
Judge Cui? He might be in the Heaven Realm, or he might be in the
Netherworld Kingdom, or he might be somewhere else.” King Yan shook
his head. “Ever since the Six Paths of Reincarnation were
destroyed, Judge Cui no longer had any tasks shackling him to a
specific place. Given that the Book of Life and Death protects him,
he can go wherever he pleases. If you want to investigate his
whereabouts, you’ll need to ask the Immortals of the Heaven Realm
or the Netherworld, I imagine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was a dark, gloomy
day today. Ning departed from the imperial capital of the Grand Xia,
returning to Stillwater Commandery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In a few more
months, I’ll be able to know what happened to Mother and Father
after they were reborn.” Ning’s heart was filled with hope. “I
wonder if they are doing well. Are they Immortal cultivators in this
life as well? Which world are they living in, in this new life? Is it
still the Grand Xia?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The skies were desolate
and bleak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning flew towards a
distant lake. From afar, he could see the wooden house that was
located next to it, the residence of his junior apprentice-brother,
Mu Northson.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas.” Ning sighed
to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His junior
apprentice-brother had no family to begin with…and now, his one and
only Dao-companion had been trapped within that jade globe. Every
day, Northson hugged that jade globe and talked to it. Ning was very
worried for his junior apprentice-brother’s Dao-heart. If this were
to continue long-term…eventually, his Dao-heart might crumble, at
which point he might go crazy and be unable to control his elemental
ki, possibly resulting in self-detonation and death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s coming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the wild grasses
next to the lake, the four Celestial Immortal Patriarchs that were
seated in the lotus position all opened their eyes to stare at that
figure that had appeared in the distant horizons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was a youth who was
riding the winds…Ji Ning, the source of trouble which their
Youngflame clan had come for!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He came so quickly.
It seems this Ji Ning has a very deep relationship with Mu Northson,”
Patriarch Arcanum sneered. “I had thought we’d have to wait for a
year or two. The Heavens truly are helping our Youngflame clan!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Heavens are
supporting us in eradicating this danger,” Patriarch Deadwood
growled as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our chance has
come.” The man holding the greatclock cracked his lips in a grin as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Patriarch
Infatuation, a flash of cold light crossed his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was their
best-case scenario; after all, Immortal cultivators could go into
closed-door meditation sessions and stay in them for extremely long
periods of time. They had no idea how long it would be before Ji Ning
would come to visit Mu Northson again. If they truly did have to wait
for several years or a decade…they would probably end up choosing
to capture Northson instead! They’d use him as a hostage, forcing
Ji Ning to show himself…but in doing so, Ji Ning would be
forewarned and might even bring his friends, such as his fellow
disciples from that mysterious school he was from, or the likes of
Immortal Diancai. That would render it very difficult for them to
kill him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s completely
unprepared right now.” A cold look was in Patriarch Infatuation’s
eyes. “This is our best chance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The other
three Patriarchs nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Act according to our
plans.” Patriarch Arcanum stared towards the distant Ning as he
flew towards the wooden house. “This is the time. Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was in midair.
Through the open wooden door and open windows, he could see Northson
within the wooden house. Northson had placed the jade globe on the
table in front of him, and was chatting with it while drinking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s still
chatting with Yu Xia’s soul?” Seeing this, Ning couldn’t help
but feel even more pain and worry. “If this continues…how can he
possibly prevent his Dao-heart from collapsing?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mortals were allowed to
grow dispirited and depressed…but when Immortal cultivators did so,
it would be extremely dangerous. It was one thing for Fiendgod Body
Refiners; after all, even if their elemental ki exploded, their
bodies would be able to withstand the damage. But his junior
apprentice-brother Northson was merely a Ki Refiner; an explosion of
elemental ki could be more than enough to cause him to perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother!” Ning called out loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson, within the
wooden home, picked up the jade globe. He walked to the doorway,
raised his head, then smiled and called out, “Senior
apprentice-brother!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ruuuuuuuumble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A powerful yet
mysterious ripple instantly spread out from nearby. Like the rays of
the sun, the strange ripple instantly encompassed the entire area,
including Northson, the jade globe, and Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt as though his
soul had suffered a powerful blow, but his Dao-heart was incomparably
resilient. In addition, his Fiendgod body had become completely fused
with his soul, rendering it even more stable; he was naturally able
to withstand this collision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good. My junior
apprentice-brother!” Ning was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had been able to
withstand the blow, yes…but would Northson be able to withstand it?
Northson had only recently reached the Void-level and become an Earth
Immortal; he could only be considered an extremely ordinary Loose
Immortal. Would he be able to hold?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They…” As Ning
turned his gaze towards his junior apprentice-brother, he also saw
that far away, in the desolate plains, four figures had suddenly
appeared. Given that he had read an intelligence report regarding the
Youngflame clan long ago, Ning was shocked. “Celestial Immortals
Infatuation, Arcanum, Goldclock, and Deadwood? Four Celestial
Immortals?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This coresense attack
had been personally executed by Patriarch Infatuation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the face of this
terrifying coresense attack, the female soul within the jade globe
was completely unable to resist. Her soul was, after all, merely the
soul of a Wanxiang Adept; it was far too weak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Like snow melting away
under the rays of the sun…she evaporated away into nothingness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the instant that she
evaporated away, she stared at Mu Northson. Simply stared at him…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Northson suffered
the coresense attack, he almost automatically summoned his own power
to resist…but before his very eyes, the jade-trapped soul that he
loved melted away into nothingness before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“NO!!!!!!”
Northson’s eyes instantly turned red. Blood vessels could be seen
within them, and two bloody tears came falling out. He let out an
utterly agonized and inhuman scream, a howl that was akin to the roar
of aa dying beast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Faced with the
coresense attack of Patriarch Arcanum, Ji Ning was able to withstand
it, Yu Xia’s soul was melted away, and Northson was sent into
madness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson raised his
head, staring at the four incomparably powerful Celestial Immortals
in the distance, his eyes filled with madness. “IT WAS YOU! ALL OF
YOU WILL DIE!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous Winged
Immortal golem suddenly appeared behind him. Northson instantly
merged into the body of the Winged Immortal golem, and its aura
instantly exploded with power. As a grandmaster of constructs and one
who had even personally made this sort of Winged Immortal golem
before…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Under the maddened
control of a grandmaster, the Winged Immortal golem became activated.
Instantly, a series of wild gusts of wind appeared in the surrounding
area. The gale smashed apart everything before it, and within the
gale could be seen multiple spots of black light. Just looking at
those spots was enough to cause a man to sink into oblivion.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise!” The tall,
skinny Patriarch Arcanum let out a cold shout.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, clouds began
to gather from thousands of kilometers around. The world turned dark,
the Five Elements were thrown into a state of chaos, and space became
locked. No matter how violent the battle in the area became, it would
be difficult for any spatial ripples to leak out!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seven Ruinous
Thunderwinds? A puny Void-level Earth Immortal actually has a
precious golem like this? What a waste!” Patriarch Arcanum let out
a cold laugh. Instantly, a series of starlight began to appear, along
with multiple meteors that flew out. A total of 360 meteorites
instantly flew high into the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These 360 meteorites
made up Patriarch Arcanum’s true power. For the sake of killing Ji
Ning, he had brought them out right away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In midair, the illusion
of 360 flowing stars could be seen. For countless ages now, the
movement of stars in the night sky had been fixed and eternal. When
this grand formation appeared…instantly, a layer of thick starlight
appeared, completely blocking the wild electric wind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you, die,
die, DIE!!!!” The Winged Immortal golem was in an absolutely
berserk state as it released the Seven Ruinous Thunderwinds
repeatedly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seven Ruinous
Thunderwinds were exceedingly powerful; even using all of his power,
Patriarch Arcanum was only able to just barely block them. “Seven
Ruinous Thunderwinds of such purity…this golem is allowing a mere
Void-level Earth Immortal to block me. For such a precious golem to
be in the hands of this Northson is truly a waste. If I had it, my
power would increase dramatically.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of a golem
was directly related to the power of its user.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There naturally would
be a difference in power in the Seven Ruinous Winds as activated by
Void-level elemental ki or Celestial Immortal-level elemental ki! By
relying on the Winged Immortal golem, Northson could reach a
Celestial Immortal’s level of power…but in the hands of a true
Celestial Immortal, the power would increase by at least two levels!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Patriarch Arcanum
struck out, one of the other Patriarchs struck out as well. It was
the elderly, white-haired Patriarch Deadwood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The elderly Patriarch’s
hands formed together into a seal, and a series of powerful ripples
seemed to merge with the earth itself, becoming one with the nearby
grass and trees.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Patriarch
Deadwood was an oddity even amongst Celestial Immortals, because the
vast majority of them needed to use magic treasures. Patriarch
Deadwood, in his youth, was looked down upon due to his lack of
talent, and the clan gave him very few resources; in fact, he
couldn’t even procure any decent magic treasures. He was the
stubborn sort, and he decided to focus all of his attention on magic
spells.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No one would have
imagined that he would manage to complete a Dao that was different
from all others, one which only grew stronger as he moved further
along it. All of the various ‘geniuses’ of his era failed and
perished, while he actually overcome his tribulation to become a
Celestial Immortal, and an extraordinary one at that. In the
Youngflame clan, even Patriarch Goldclock, who had acquired their
most precious treasure, was merely on par with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!” A single
word came forth from Patriarch Deadwood’s lips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the colors
of the world seemed to change. The nearby lake shook, and the wild
plains trembled. Enormous, thick, wood-green tendrils erupted forth
from the surface of the lake and from the wild plains. A total of
nine tendrils erupted forth, each of which was covered with flowing
golden light and with ancient runes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine tendrils
soared into the heavens, each of them fathomless in length. They
simultaneously struck towards the Winged Immortal golem and towards
Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This took time to
describe, but in reality, Northson’s unleashing of the Seven
Ruinous Thunderwinds, Patiarch Arcanum’s usage of the Starlight
Revolution formation to block, and Patriarch Deadwood’s unleashing
of his nine tendrils happened almost simultaneously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The Winged
Immortal golem continued to release the Seven Ruinous Thunderwinds
while it flew through the air at high speed, avoiding the striking
tendrils.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single tendril
was like one of the pillars of heaven; they were incomparably thick
and massive, and they also moved at incomparable speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Winged Immortal
golem was dodging at high speed. Just as it had clearly dodged a
blow…the incomparably massive tendril suddenly sprouted many
branches that were much thinner but extremely numerous. The tight
cluster of tendrils erupted forth from the main tendril like a series
of serpents, instantly entangling and catching the Winged Immortal
golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“F*ck off, f*ck off!”
The Winged Immortal struggled to resist, continuously releasing the
Seven Ruinous Thunderwinds, but starlight descended, blocking a good
part of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even though some of the
smaller branches were destroyed by the Seven Ruinous Thunderwinds,
new ones quickly sprouted out. The Winged Immortal golem sank into a
prison of tendrils…and no matter how it struggled, it was unable to
escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A total of nine
tendrils were used to attack. Just a single one of them was used to
trap the Winged Immortal golem; the rest were acting against Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was currently
filled with both guilt and rage!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.” Ning’s heart was filled with the utmost
regret; as soon as he had seen the four mighty Celestial Immortals
appear, he had understood everything. The four of them had been lying
in wait here the entire time, but had only acted after Ning had
appeared. Given that they were all of the Youngflame clan…without
question, they were here for him. His junior apprentice-brother was
simply caught in the crossfire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His junior
apprentice-brother had cared deeply about his Dao-companion’s soul;
Ning knew this very well. Upon seeing tears of blood streak down his
junior apprentice-brother’s face, Ning’s own heart clenched with
pain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next came rage!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Incomparable rage!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“YOUNGFLAME CLAN!!!”
When Ning saw Patriarch Arcanum and Patriarch Deadwood unleash their
abilities, he similarly unleashed his own as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black-robed Ning
appeared by his side. His true body and his Primaltwin now stood
shoulder-to-shoulder in midair. Simultaneously, they manifested more
than three hundred top-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords to appear
around them. The guilt-wracked and infuriated Ning instantly
unleashed his most powerful killing attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Greater Thousand

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A large amount of

appeared, raising its head out and unleashing an angry roar. It was
the golden flying sword in draconic form. The divine black dragon,
carrying a terrifyingly sharp aura, swept forward…and meeting it
was an incomparably thick tendril, which slapped down with power that
seemed great enough to shake the heavens and the earth. Even though
the divine black dragon was incomparably agile as it moved to try and
dodge past so as to help Northson…the tendril was also extremely
agile, and it gave birth to many smaller branches that moved to
impede the divine black dragon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh whoosh whoosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A large amount of
smaller branches were chopped apart, and a scar appeared on the body
of the thick main tendril as well. And then…crack! It completely
snapped apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and his Primaltwin
manifested a second streak of sword-light. A second divine black
dragon flew out! Simultaneously controlling two streaks of
sword-light generated from the fourth stage of the [Greater Thousand
Swords Formation]; this was Ning’s current maximum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">ROAAAAR!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two divine black
dragons moved as fast as lightning, slamming against the many
tendrils. Thanks to the resistance from the tendrils, one of the
divine black dragons was consumed and shattered, but the other one
managed to slaughter a path to the Winged Immortal golem, tearing the
tendrils apart and saving the golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” The four
Celestial Immortals of the Youngflame clan, upon seeing this,
narrowed their eyes. “This Ji Ning is actually as powerful as this?
He would be considered an excellent fighter amongst Celestial
Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fortunately, thanks
to Bloodcloud Hall’s failed assassination attempt, we’ve known
this entire time that he is extremely powerful, and so we came
prepared.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, the four
Celestial Immortals didn’t panic in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forest!” Patriarch
Deadwood’s eyelids twitched slightly, and a golden light began to
flow within his eyes as he once more called out a word.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From the lake and from
the wild plains, a large number of tendrils began to appear. These
tendrils were far thinner than the nine great tendrils that had
appeared earlier; they were roughly just one percent of the originals
in size. However, they were extremely numerous, and each was still at
least a hundred kilometers long. The world had suddenly been
transformed into a forest of tendrils.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless tendrils
began to frantically wrap themselves around the nine main tendrils.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s two divine
black dragons, formed through using the fourth stage of the [Greater
Thousand Swords Formation], were only able to strike around the
margins. They were blocked repeatedly, and they only had enough
strength to fight back, not to advance any further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh. By Ning’s
side, Northson repeatedly unleashed the Seven Ruinous Thunderwinds,
but Patriarch Arcanum’s grand formation of starlight suppressed the
wind time and time again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A single person,
Patriarch Deadwood, was able to suppress both Ning and Northson; this
was the power of a truly formidable Celestial Immortal! The general
who had commanded the Eastwoods mountain range was even more
formidable than Patriarch Deadwood; he was capable of completely
suppressing and even defeating Ning. However, because he was unable
to bind Ning, he was forced to negotiate with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Patriarch
Deadwood was comparatively weaker, he was still able to suppress the
two of them. With Patriarch Arcanum supporting him, the two made it
impossible for Ning to even have a chance to use a Greater
Teleportation Dao-seal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! A talisman
suddenly appeared before Ning. A divine black dragon howled past it,
and a thick streak of sword-light instantly shattered it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stillwater City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was in the
afternoon, but the skies were rather dark and dreary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two figures
simultaneously appeared in the skies above Stillwater City. The first
was a hunchbacked, staff-wielding elder, Celestial Immortal
Hunchmont. The other was the black-haired, black-robed Immortal
Diancai. Both had shocked looks on their faces. It must be understood
that when Immortal Diancai and Ji Ning agreed to ally with the
Northmont clan of Stillwater, they had naturally prepared methods of
helping each other out as needed. Everyone had a talisman for
everyone else; upon shattering it, the others would be able to sense
it right away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning’s power is
formidable; what sort of situation could force him to request help??”
Immortal Diancai was greatly shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s within
Stillwater Commandery, roughly a few hundred thousand kilometers
away,” Celestial Immortal Hunchmont sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s hurry over
there.” Immortal Diancai had a solemn look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The two
didn’t hesitate at all; they immediately used void blink techniques
to hurry over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the most
powerful member of the Northmont clan of Stillwater was actually that
ancient elder, his existence was a tightly-kept secret. Unless
something truly critical happened, he wouldn’t reveal himself. Only
if even Immortal Hunchmont and Immortal Diancai were unable to rescue
Ning would he intervene.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world of the Grand
Xia. Upon an island in the western seas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a seemingly
barren, unpopulated island. In truth…it was surrounded by layers of
formations, causing outsiders to be unable to see the truth of what
was within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a mountain on
the island. Inside a palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A maiden was seated on
a royal throne here. In the center of the palace was an enormous
mirror, a Pure Yang treasure known as the Divine Earthpiercer Mirror.
This enormous mirror was currently displaying the battle that was
happening far away, next to the lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Youngflame clan
has made their move.” The maiden revealed a smile. “And even
Celestial Immortal Infatuation has gone…and they brought a
top-grade Pure Yang divine greatclock…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were more than
ten gold-robed Celestial Immortals within the palace who were also
staring at that giant mirror as they watched the battle within it.
</P>

Chapter 13 - Suppressing the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as Ji Ning
exchanged blows with them, he had a bad feeling. Patriarch Deadwood
and Patriarch Arcanum alone were able to completely suppress him and
his junior apprentice-brother. “Not even the fourth stage of the
[Greater Thousand Swords Formation] is able to overcome them. If I
was also a Celestial Immortal and was able to use Celestial
Immortal-level elemental ki in activating the fourth stage of the
[Greater Thousand Swords Formation]…things would probably be
different. It’s simply too taxing for Void-level Earth Immortals to
battle Celestial Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, not hesitating
at all, Ning shattered the talisman, requesting aid from his master
Immortal Diancai and Celestial Immortal Hunchmont.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A message-talisman.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning is asking
for aid.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All four of the
Celestial Immortals of the Youngflame clan were watching this battle.
They naturally noticed how the divine black dragon of sword-light had
suddenly shattered a talisman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me handle it.”
The man holding the greatclock in his hand let out an angry roar,
then waved the clock-wielding hand. The greatclock instantly soared
high into the skies. The many tendrils that were blocking out the sun
opened a path for it, and so the greatclock transformed into a
rainbow that instantly flew to a location a few kilometers away from
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It hovered there in the
air, its surface radiating a blurry golden light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The man controlling the
golden greatclock instantly used his own power to activate this
top-grade Pure Yang artifact. This was an artifact which the
Youngflame clan had come into possession of back during the era of
Pangu’s World; it had been passed down for countless years, and was
one of the artifacts that was meant to safeguard the entire clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Claaaaang.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden clock
suddenly emitted a ringing sound. The sound of the clock spread out
in a slow manner. The base of the golden greatclock was aimed
straight towards Ning, and as the clock rang out, circles of golden
ripples that were visible to the naked eye appeared around it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The circles radiated
downwards, while the nearby tendrils quickly retreated, beating out a
path for it, with the slower-moving tendrils instantly transformed
into dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden ripples of
light moved at an extremely fast speed. By the time Ning saw them,
they had already nearly reached him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful!” Ning
called out in shock, quickly willing the nearby black-robed Ning to
disappear into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Claaaaaang.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden ripples of
light shattered apart one of the divine black dragons, then struck
towards Ning’s body, at which point it once more let out a slow,
gonging sound. Ning felt as though countless heavy hammers were
smashing against his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Mu Northson,
who was in control of the Winged Immortal golem, was partially hit by
the attack as well. The Winged Immortal golem was instantly knocked
flying, spinning out of his control. Right at this moment, two of the
nine incomparably massive main tendrils came snaking towards the
Winged Immortal golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.” Ning immediately stretched his hand out, his
palm increasing to a size of three hundred meters as he grabbed the
somersaulting Winged Immortal golem. “Don’t resist.” He
immediately brought the Winged Immortal golem back into his own
mobile Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The appearance of the
golden clock forced the Primaltwin to retreat, while the Winged
Immortal golem had already been finding it hard enough to deal with
the ‘Starlight Revolution’; there was no way it could fight back
at all now. Ning’s only choice was to have both his Primaltwin and
his junior apprentice-brother retreat for now, leaving his true body
to stand there by itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” The man
controlling the golden greatclocked roared with laughter. “With my
divine clock having emerged…death is the only outcome for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What terrifying
power.” Ning’s heart was filled with shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Deadwood and
Patriarch Goldclock were polar opposites; Patriarch Deadwood focused
on control, suppression, and binding, whereas Patriarch Goldclock
focused on raw power and straightforward crushing! In truth, as far
as Ji Ning was concerned, Patriarch Deadwood was actually a greater
threat to him! This was because, once he became bound and restricted
by those tendrils, he’d find it very difficult to escape, even
though he trained in the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong! Dong! Dong!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden greatclock
rang out in the skies, and the golden ripples of power struck towards
Ning repeatedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, Ning had
completely withdrawn all of his three hundred-plus Immortal swords.
He had executed his divine ability, [Three Heads, Six Arms], and was
relying on his six mighty palms to block.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden ripple of
light struck out…but Ning was completely unharmed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Patriarch
Arcanum controlled the Starlight Revolution to attack, but Ning
completely ignored it, allowing it to fall against his body as it
pleased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh whoosh whoosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous number of
tendrils came crashing over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did Ning begin
to take things seriously. He executed his divine ability, [Obscuring
Wind of the Nine Heavens], seeming to have transformed into a gust of
wind. He was occasionally drifting and gentle, but occasionally
savage and vicious in his movements. He shuttled through the tendrils
in an unpredictable manner, while his six arms all used the
[Starseizing Hand]. With unearthly power in his hands, comparable to
that of Pure Yang treasures, he chopped with his palms in every
direction!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang! Bang! The
weaker tendrils and vines were blasted apart into dust; only the
thicker tendrils were able to resist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And thanks to his
[Obscuring Wind of the Nine Heavens], Ning remained extremely agile
and dodged about easily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum and
Patriarch Goldclock were both shocked. Their attacks were actually
very weak against Ning?! Patriarch Goldclock was especially shocked;
his power was on the same level as Patriarch Deadwood’s, but Ning
was able to completely resist the power of his attacks head-on…and
was even able to borrow from the momentum of the clock-strikes to
increase his speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This golden
greatclock of mine is a top-grade Pure Yang treasure with
extraordinary power; not even Celestial Immortals would dare to take
it on head-on. Even if a Void-level Fiendgod were to encounter it,
the only outcome would be death.” Patriarch Goldclock couldn’t
believe it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He must have some
protective treasure?” Patriarch Arcanum said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if he did, once
it suffered an attack from my golden clock, it would instantly have
its power used up.” Patriarch Goldclock truly couldn’t believe
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Patriarch
Goldclock struck, the last of the four mighty Celestial Immortals,
Patriarch Infatuation, began to launch a full-strength attack as
well. Cold spheres of light began to manifest in the area around
Patriarch Infatuation. These cold spheres of light numbered in the
thousands as they hung around him, with flowing runes appearing on
their surface. The flowing runes joined together, forming into an
incomparably profound formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The area within three
thousand meters of Patriarch Infatuation had been completely
transformed into a world of frozen ice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was frozen ice
everywhere. Patriarch Infatuation stood at the very peak of a tower
made of frozen ice, like the only sovereign of this miniature world
of ice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chop!” Patriarch
Infatuation looked at the distant Ji Ning, who was fleeing from the
strikes of the golden greatclock and the giant tendrils. He pointed
at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, more than
half of the ice within this miniature frozen world began to gather in
one location, forming into an enormous chopping sword of frozen ice.
This was like the blade of an executioner…but it only had a blade,
without a handle. This enormous executioner’s blade of frozen ice
instantly slashed through the skies, chopping straight towards Ji
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, currently using
the [Obscuring Wind of the Nine Heavens], raised his head and saw the
enormous executioner’s blade of ice crashing down upon him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cold!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He felt a
heart-piercing cold. Even before the executioner’s blade had fallen
upon him, Ning felt a cold pain, misery, and fear fill his heart as
he stared at it. This was a sort of fear and pain that one would
naturally feel upon seeing that executioner’s blade.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a bizarre
blade.” Ning felt that something was off. He immediately let out an
angry roar: “F*CK OFF!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two of Ning’s massive
hands punched straight upwards, looking like Pangu pushing up the
heavens. 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous freezing
executioner’s blade came crashing down!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The executioner’s
blade collided head-on with Ning’s twin hands!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was blasted
downwards by the power of the blow, like a meteor sinking into the
ground. Ning had never before suffered an attack of such terrifying
power. Even back in the Eastwoods mountain range, he had never
received such a disastrously mighty chop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? He didn’t
die?” Patriarch Infatuation could hardly believe it. This technique
of his, which he had used to roam and dominate the Three Realms, had
been unable to kill Ji Ning? This blow was so powerful that even some
Heaven-ranked magic treasures would be instantly blown apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no way a
protective item could last for so long. Could it be that he’s using
his body to block?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art]!!!” Patriarch Infatuation was suddenly shocked as he
thought of this possibility.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later, he
became certain that this was correct; there was a very high chance
that Ning had trained in the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]! This was
because after Ning had suffered the first assassination attempt from
Bloodcloud Hall, Bloodcloud Hall had actually dared to increase the
price to an exponential level; this indicated that Ning probably
wasn’t just relying on a protective treasure. Only the [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art] made sense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So what if he has
the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]? He’s still only at the Void level; he
won’t be able to escape from the combined attacks of us four
Celestial Immortals.” Patriarch Infatuation instantly sent mentally
to the other three, “It is very likely that this Ji Ning has
trained in the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]. Deadwood, focus on binding
him. Goldclock, draw him into your golden greatclock and keep him
suppressed within it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was sent slamming
downwards from the force of that frozen executioner’s blade. Rustle
rustle rustle…instantly, the enormous rattan vines came twirling
towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” The
power of that chop had been simply too great; he was about to be
trapped and entangled by those thick rattan vines. Ning gritted his
teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning landed, his
body suddenly separated into two as it was instantly torn apart,
diving into two separate bodies. The two Nings slammed their palms
into each other, and with a massive boom, borrowed from the momentum
of the blow to send each other flying away at high speed, avoiding
the many tendrils that were coiling towards them from below.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He split his body?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s looking to
die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Deadwood let
out a cold laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although this
instantaneous creation of a clone had seemingly allowed him to dodge
that trap, both of the clone bodies would now be much weaker; after
all, each of the two bodies would only possess half of the soul that
had been infused into every cell of the original body, and so the
power of any sword-arts would also be dramatically lowered. Even the
intricacy and effect of the [Obscuring Wind of the Nine Heavens]
would be lowered! These were all weaknesses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And once one of the
clones was destroyed, the divine power within that particular clone
would be completely used up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! One of the Nings
suddenly blew up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of the other
fleeing Ning instantly skyrocketed. A large amount of divine power
was returning to him, and his divine soul was rapidly healing as
well. Fiendgod Body Refiners…so long as their divine power was not
used up, they could regenerate from as little as a single drop of
blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quite decisive.”
Patriarch Infatuation, standing atop his tower oef frozen ice within
his miniature ice realm, let out a cold laugh. “Let’s see how
many times you can self-detonate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He pointed once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, that
enormous frozen executioner’s blade once more swung over, quickly
arriving in the air above Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gritted his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What was he to do?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Earlier, he had
instantly split his body into two clones, then self-detonated one to
recover part of his divine power…but this still used up a lot of
divine power. That single self-detonation had already consumed twenty
or thirty percent of Ning’s total power. This was a far faster rate
of depletion than when he had been fighting; after three or four more
self-detonations, he would be finished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?”
Ning began to grow nervous. Hide within his mobile Immortal estate
and use a Greater Teleportation Dao-seal to escape?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a seemingly
good solution, but it was dangerous as well. Would his mobile
Immortal estate be able to withstand the attacks of Celestial
Immortal Infatuation and the other three?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although his mobile
Immortal estates was described as an ‘Immortal estates’, it
wasn’t actually an Immortal-ranked magic treasure; if it had been,
Ning wouldn’t have been able to bind it in the past! Treasures of
this sort were mobile but did not possess significant defensive
power. This one was roughly on par with Heaven-ranked magic
treasures. Against Bloodcloud Hall’s Ba-Serpent, Ning had felt that
it should be able to resist for a short period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But in the face of the
far more powerful Celestial Immortal Infatuation, who was being aided
by three more Celestial Immortals…it might instantly be blasted
apart.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A spatial ripple
suddenly appeared in the skies above the desolate plains. Two figures
emerged from the spatial ripple; a staff-wielding Celestial Immortal
Hunchmont, and a black-robed, black-haired Immortal Diancai.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s up ahead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But there’s a
formation covering that area.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Hunchmont and Immortal Diancai immediately released their coresense,
using it to cover an area of tens of thousands of kilometers; they
were naturally able to discover that large formation. The formations
which the four Celestial Immortals of the Youngflame clan had set up
here weren’t meant to be used to guard their headquarters;
naturally, they wouldn’t pay too high of a price for them. These
formations were merely meant for trapping enemies by mystifying them,
barring spatial ripples, and causing enemies to be unable to use void
blink techniques to escape; they were unable to completely block out
the coresense of a determined Celestial Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning!” Both
were shocked by what their coresense found.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They saw Ning, with
three heads and six arms, suffering repeated attacks from four mighty
Celestial Immortals within that grand formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum used
the Starlight Revolution to negatively impact Ning’s movements time
and time again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Goldclock was
using his top-grade Pure Yang greatclock in an attempt to trap and
suppress Ning within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Infatuation
was continuing to unleash the full power of his miniature frozen
world with every blow, beating Ning senseless and giving him no
chance to fight back at all; he was a truly supreme Celestial
Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Deadwood was
controlling countless tendrils and vines in an attempt to bind and
constrict Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he had the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art], Ning was being forced to rely on
body-separation, followed by self-detonation, something which he
wouldn’t be able to sustain for very long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and break
the formation.” Celestial Immortal Hunchmont was shocked and
worried. “Diancai, this great formation is mainly focused inwards
and doesn’t have much resistance to outside attacks. If the two of
us join together, we can break it open through raw force.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Immortal
Diancai was frantic as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai
pointed from far away. Instantly, five Immortal swords appeared out
of nowhere, instantly piercing through the skies, transforming into
five dazzling rainbows of light. Every single sword manifested the
illusion of a giant mountain…and moments later, the five illusory
mountains actually joined together, transforming into a single
enormous mountain with five peaks! These five peaks were like five
fingers of different colors that carried the intent of utter
extermination.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five Elements Sword -
Minor Five Elements Extermination!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mountainshift!”
Celestial Immortal Hunchmont released a low growl as well. A total of
nine massive seals appeared out of nowhere, each of which flew out at
high speed and transformed into a massive mountain. These nine
massive mountains were different in appearance, with some being
towering, some being squat, and some being sharp. They were
completely different from Immortal Diancai’s swords, as they were
not illusory; rather, they were nine true mountain peaks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, around the
nine true mountains, a host of illusory mountains could be seen as
well. A total of eighty-one such illusory mountain peaks appeared..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like an entire
mountain range was crashing down!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why
Celestial Immortal Hunchmont’s nickname was ‘Hunchmont’ was
precisely because he relied on this supreme ability of his, the
[Mountainbringer] technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The illusory
five-peaked mountain of sword-light radiated an aura of
extermination, while the nine true mountain peaks carried eighty-one
illusory mountain peaks with them as they came crashing down with raw
force.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two joined
together…and the formation flags which the Celestial Immortals had
spread throughout the region were instantly shattered apart. Even the
desolate plains themselves had massive, jagged scars blasted into
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both figures were
extraordinary in their power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai had
become a Celestial Immortal after undergoing six nine-sets of thunder
tribulation; his sword-art, the ‘Minor Five Elements
Extermination’, was on a level that was even higher than Ning’s
own sword-arts! In addition, he was using five top-grade
Immortal-ranked flying swords to execute his technique. Ning’s
fourth stage of his [Greater Thousand Swords Formation] was probably
roughly on par with his master’s techniques in terms of sword-arts,
but Immortal Diancai was now a Celestial Immortal…naturally, his
power was much greater, due to the fact that he was using Celestial
Immortal-level power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Celestial
Immortal Hunchmont, he was also on the same level as Patriarch
Deadwood and Patriarch Goldclock; he, too, was more powerful than
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And the two of them had
just joined forces!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Naturally, they were
able to completely smash apart that grand formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our formation’s
been destroyed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The newcomers are
Hunchmont of the Northmont clan and Immortal Diancai of the
Black-White College,” Patriarch Arcanum sent frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Infatuation, what
should we do now?” Patriarch Goldclock sent a frantic mental
message as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn!” Patriarch
Infatuation had an ugly look on his face. He stared at the distant Ji
Ning, who was frantically dodging past the many tendrils in an
attempt to buy as much time as possible. What he saw made him feel
all the more unwilling to give up; although Ji Ning had trained in
the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], his foundation was far too weak.
Patriarch Infatuation was now certain that if the four of them were
given just a bit more time, they would be able to suppress and trap
Ji Ning within the divine greatclock!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once trapped and
suppressed within that top-grade Pure Yang treasure, even True
Immortals or Empyrean Gods would be unable to escape, to say nothing
of Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course…a True
Immortal or Empyrean God wouldn’t be so stupid as to let themselves
be trapped within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five-peaked
mountain of sword-light carried an incomparably fierce aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine true mountains
carried a host of illusory mountains as they came crashing forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was nothing to
stop them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn, damn, DAMN!!!”
Patriarch Infatuation was both frantic and enraged; they were so very
close to victory! However, he knew that the appearance of Celestial
Immortal Hunchmont and Immortal Diancai meant that they were now
unable to suppress Ji Ning. After all, Ji Ning had trained in the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art]; they were unable to kill him, and would only
be able to suppress and trap him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They no longer had the
time necessary to do that.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave!” Patriarch
Infatuation sent with an angry roar. “Let’s leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damnit.” Patriarch
Goldclock and Patriarch Deadwood felt similarly unwilling to just
give up like this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we had just a few
extra moments, Ji Ning would’ve been finished.” Patriarch Arcanum
was unbelievably frustrated as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Celestial Immortal
Infatuation, this is my territory, Stillwater Commandery. By doing
this, your Youngflame clan is truly showing no regard for our
Northmont clan.” A sonorous voice, backed by Celestial
Immortal-level power, instantly shook every single inch of the
surrounding area. The elderly staff-wielding hunch back and the
black-robed, black-haired man had already begun moving towards them,
side-by-side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The four
Celestial Immortals of the Youngflame clan couldn’t even be
bothered to talk to them; they each retreated at high speed,
disappearing into the distant horizons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They made quite a clean
getaway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
Celestial Immortal Hunchmont and Immortal Diancai flew over to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Hunchmont.
Master.” Ning went over to welcome them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What happened? Four
Celestial Immortals of the Youngflame clan joined forces to attack
you?” Immortal Diancai was incomparably worried, while the nearby
Celestial Immortal Hunchmont was secretly shocked as well. All four
of the Celestial Immortals were exceedingly powerful; logically
speaking, a slightly weaker Celestial Immortal should’ve been
instantly killed! Ji Ning, however, had been able to hold on until
their arrival.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They have been
looking to get rid of me for some time now. This time, they set up a
trap here at my junior apprentice-brother Mu Northson’s place,
waiting for me.” Ning’s heart was filled with guilt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Junior
apprentice-brother…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thing most
important to his junior apprentice-brother, the soul of his
Dao-companion, had been destroyed. Ning didn’t know what his junior
apprentice-brother was currently thinking right now; his junior
apprentice-brother had completely been collateral damage in this
attempt to kill Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I had known this
would happen, when he refused, I would’ve forcibly abducted him to
Swallow Mountain.” Ning was filled with endless regret. Because his
junior apprentice-brother was filled with longing and love for this
place, he was unwilling to listen to Ning’s suggestions, no matter
what Ning said. In addition, since Ning felt that nobody would know
that Northson had returned to this place, and given that Northson
also had the Winged Immortal golem, he didn’t force his junior
apprentice-brother to go back with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My junior
apprentice-brother literally just returned. How did the Youngflame
clan find out?” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you spoke
of a junior apprentice-brother?” Immortal Diancai hurriedly asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. Mu Northson.”
Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You found him?”
Immortal Diancai was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I found him. Let’s
go back first; let’s not stay here.” Ning glanced at the
surrounding area; even the wooden house which his junior
apprentice-brother had built had been utterly annihilated by this
battle. That earlier battle had simply been too frenzied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Immortal Diancai,
and Celestial Immortal Hunchmont first returned to Stillwater City.
After discussing a few affairs in detail, even Immortal Diancai
agreed, “Based on what you said, Bloodcloud Hall’s attempted
assassination of you was very likely done at the request of the
Youngflame clan. Now that they have personally attempted to remove
you…they probably won’t let matters rest like this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed. Ji Ning,
given your current level of power, you aren’t able to withstand the
Youngflame clan yet. You have to keep waiting and enduring it. After
you become a Celestial Immortal, your chances will be much greater,”
Celestial Immortal Hunchmont urged as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was filled with
regret and hate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wait and endure?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For how much longer was
he supposed to wait and endure?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, his mother
had carried the burden of knowing who their mortal enemy was by
herself; she had been unwilling to tell him that their enemy was the
Youngflame clan, precisely because in her eyes, her son was more
important than vengeance. In addition, she was afraid; the Youngflame
clan was truly far too powerful. She didn’t even dare imagine her
son fighting against an ancient clan like this, one of the top ten
clans of the entire world of the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the Youngflame
clan had been frantically searching for him, and even trapping the Ji
clan within Swallow Mountain, Ning had been forced to endure and bide
his time!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When they had attempted
to assassinate him within the imperial capital of the Grand Xia, Ning
had still waited and endured!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had never taken any
reprisal actions against them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, even upon his
return from Mount Innerheart, Ning had continued to wait and bide his
time…because he didn’t feel any confidence at all in his ability
to deal with the Youngflame clan. The Northmont clan of Stillwater
was already so incredibly powerful; what then of the Youngflame clan?
The four Celestial Immortals that had appeared today were already
incredibly terrifying…and this was probably not the full power the
Youngflame clan could bring to bear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swallow Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only after returning to
Swallow Mountain did Ning release his junior apprentice-brother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youngflame
clan…Youngflame clan…Youngflame clan…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a house, a
series of agonized, maddened growls could be heard. The nearby
servants and maids who heard the voice felt their hearts shudder. A
grand formation had long ago been set up around this house, causing
Northson to be completely unable to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there on the
hallway, listening to the heart-rending growls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He walked through the
grand formation. He walked to the room. He pushed the door open. He
entered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mu Northson was sitting
on his knees like a madman, his hair tousled and even whiter than
before. He raised his head to look towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother.” Northson’s face was twisted with agony. His
eyes were blood-red, and he said in hoarsely, “I will take revenge.
I will take revenge! I will kill the Youngflame clan. Kill them. Kill
them all. They took everything from me. I’m going to take
everything from them. Annihilate them. Senior apprentice-brother, let
me out!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This was all my
fault.” Ning walked to his junior apprentice-brother’s side, then
knelt down as well, taking his junior apprentice-brother’s hand
into his own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His junior
apprentice-brother’s hand was trembling nonstop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was filled with
tremendous guilt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was all purely
because of the feud between him and the Youngflame clan. His junior
apprentice-brother had ended up being dragged into it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It isn’t your
fault, senior apprentice-brother. It was the Youngflame clan,”
Northson said hoarsely. “I will take revenge. Kill them. The more I
kill, the better. Senior apprentice-brother, why don’t you let me
out? Why?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait. Wait a few
more days,” Ning said in a low voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to keep
waiting?” Northson’s eyes were filled with madness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, do you think I don’t want to wipe out the
Youngflame clan?” Ning’s entire body began to tremble slightly as
well. “I’ve been biding my time for so many years. I want to take
revenge very badly…and not just for myself. This is for my
mother…my uncle…my cousin…this is for all of them. I tell you
this - Wait a few more days. Once my preparations are complete, I
will definitely assault the Youngflame clan’s headquarters.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait how long?”
Northson stared at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Soon. Very soon,”
Ning said consolingly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, Ning rose to
his feet. Turning his head, he stared towards the south. His gaze
seemed to pass through the walls of space and penetrate to the
imperial capital of the Grand Xia. In this moment, within the
imperial palace of the imperial capital, the silver-haired Skyfox had
just shattered the talisman which Ning had given him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson, noticing that
Ning had suddenly risen to his feet, couldn’t help but turn his
head to look at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…Our chance just
arrived,” Ning said softly. “I’ll go on a trip to the imperial
capital of the Grand Xia first. After that…it will be time for the
Youngflame clan to pay their blood debt to us.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_15___Exalted_Immortal_Bl"></A>
Chapter 15 - Exalted Immortal Blackheaven
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pay their blood debt
to us?” Mu Northson was startled, but then he frantically rose to
his feet. “Senior apprentice-brother, this is my personal feud;
even if I die, it doesn’t matter. But you…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to say
another word.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head,
his gaze distant. “I’ve been wanting to fight with the Youngflame
clan for quite some time now, but I’ve been biding my time and just
enduring it for many years…it’s time to resolve this matter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother…” Northson was both frantic and worried.
Although his heart was now filled with boundless hatred, he knew
exactly how powerful the Youngflame clan was; from their battle
against those four Celestial Immortals, Northson learned that there
was still a significant difference in power between his senior
apprentice-brother and the Youngflame clan. Thus, he didn’t wish
for Ning to put himself in mortal danger!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait here for me.”
Turning his head, Ning strode out from the room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s figure quickly
disappeared outside the formation. No matter how frantic Northson
was, there was nothing he could do.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White.” Ning
walked to one of the beaches of Brightheart Island, where he saw a
Whitewater Hound lying on the ground, staring at the lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son.” The
Whitewater Hound rose to its feet. “The treasures have arrived?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” Ning said
softly. “It’s time to go to the imperial capital of the Grand
Xia.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hint of a desire to
kill appeared in the Whitewater Hound’s eyes as well, a killing
intent aimed towards the Youngflame clan. In his heart, he viewed Ji
Ning as his nephew. He knew that the Youngflame clan had tried
repeatedly to kill Ning…how could he not be angered by this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Whitewater
Hound soared into the heavens. Moments later, they used a void blink
to quickly depart from Swallow Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial capital of
the Grand Xia. Heavenly Treasures Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the Whitewater
Hound descended straight downwards from the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning!” A voice
echoed in their eyes. Ning turned to look towards a particular
residence within the main Heavenly Treasures Mountain, where he saw a
silver-haired man. Ning and Uncle White immediately flew towards that
residence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Skyfox.”
Ning walked over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sit,” Skyfox said
with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately sat
down, while the Whitewater Hound lay down next to a flower basin
within the courtyard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you came
quite fast,” Skyfox said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The treasures are
important,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skyfox said with a loud
laugh, “Don’t worry, all of the Five Elements treasures that you
wanted have been assembled. Might I ask if you have prepared a
high-grade Pure Yang treasure or an equivalent amount of other
treasures?” As he spoke, Skyfox waved his hand. Instantly, a large
number of enormous golden rocks appeared out of thin air, each of
which was incomparably slick and glistening and radiated powerful
auras of water. They were also slips of bamboo that were completely
formed from jade, fist-sized drops of water, fiery flows of lava, and
giant black chunks of a mysterious earthen material.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mmm.” Ning was
instantly overjoyed upon seeing these things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Xia Emperor
truly is a trustworthy man.” Ning waved his hand. Instantly,
Immortal swords radiating freezing auras or scorching auras suddenly
appeared; these were the Sole-Ki Frost Swords and the Qiangang
Inferno Swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skyfox’s eyes lit up
when he saw them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are a total of
forty-nine Sole-Ki Frost Swords and forty-nine Qiangang Inferno
Swords,” Ning said. “They should be comparable to one high-grade
Pure Yang treasure, yes?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Skyfox
laughed, then let out a sigh of praise. “Ji Ning, you truly do
engage in business with style. These ninety-eight Immortal swords are
indeed sufficient.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Based on how treasures
were valued, a single top-grade Pure Yang treasure was comparable to
a thousand top-grade Immortal-ranked treasures. This was a rough
equivalency, not an absolute one! After all, there were differences
amongst top-grade Pure Yang treasures as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for high-grade Pure
Yang treasures, they were generally comparable to one or two hundred
top-grade Immortal-ranked treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The forty-nine Sole-Ki
Frost Swords and forty-nine Qiangang Inferno Swords which Ning had
brought out were a set that came from the same source! They were thus
more valuable than a miscellaneous collection of top-grade
Immortal-ranked flying swords, and so a total of ninety-eight of them
was indeed enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As far as Ning was
concerned, he had a thousand of these Immortal swords, while he could
only use 729 of them at most. The other two hundred-plus were extras.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go ahead and inspect
them.” Ning waved his hand, and the flying swords all moved towards
Skyfox.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skyfox immediately used
his Celestial Immortal power to investigate them. “Yes, they are
all excellent top-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords. Ji Ning, these
Five Elements treasures are yours.” The many Five Elements
treasures in midair all flew towards Ning, and Ning accepted with a
wave of his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their trade had been
completed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, if there is
anything else you need, feel free to come find me.” Skyfox was in
an extremely good mood. It must be understood that the Grand Xia’s
control over this world wasn’t very stable right now, while those
Five Elements treasures would need time to be refined into magic
treasures; it was a fine trade for him to immediately acquire such
excellent magic treasures for them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the next two
days, I think I will make some more requests of you, senior Skyfox,”
Ning said. “However…this isn’t the time just yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skyfox was intrigued.
He nodded lightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He then departed from
the residence, but also instructed his attendant to wait here and
obey Ning’s orders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
and a white-robed, white-haired man were seated facing each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s drink some
wine,” the black-robed Ning said with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Uncle
White was puzzled. Why had Ning suddenly released his Primaltwin?
What was his true body doing?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant western
seas, atop the secret island where the Seamless Gate’s forces had
been stationed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How useless.”
Violetgrass was seated atop her royal throne, a hint of anger
gathering in her brows. “The exalted Youngflame clan was unable to
kill a puny Ji Ning, even when he was completely unprepared. They
truly have disappointed me. It seems our Seamless Gate will have to
handle this ourselves.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Milord, let us
attack Ji Ning; he’ll definitely perish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At most, we’ll
have to spend a bit of effort on it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Milord, no need to
be angry.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-robed
Celestial Immortals before the throne were all eating, drinking, and
laughing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The maiden frowned. “It
will indeed require a bit of effort. We’ll have to ask that old
geezer to help out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning had the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art] protecting his body; her subordinates alone
might be able to kill him, but it would still involve an element of
risk! For example, the four mighty Celestial Immortals of the
Youngflame clan hadn’t been able to kill him within an extremely
short amount of time, resulting in his helpers arriving to rescue
him! By this same principle…although her subordinate Celestial
Immortals were definitely strong enough to completely dominate Ji
Ning, they wouldn’t be able to break through the protection of the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Exalted Immortal
Blackheaven is arriving.” Suddenly, a figure appeared within the
palace; it was a black-robed servant, who hurriedly said with
respect, “Exalted Immortal Blackheaven has already left the Mount
Stele major world and has gone to the Fifth World. He’ll arrive
shortly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That old geezer is
arriving?” The maiden frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the ten-plus
golden-robed Celestial Immortals below her, however, all hurriedly
rose to their feet. Celestial Immortal Blackheaven’s fame was
widespread; although they were all Celestial Immortals, in the face
of Celestial Immortal Blackheaven, they still felt a hint of
nervousness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven was an old freak that had power that was almost
comparable to that of a Pure Yang True Immortal! He was one of the
absolute most supreme of Celestial Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha, little baby
girl Violetgrass.” After a spatial ripple, a loud laugh could be
heard that echoed throughout the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old bastard.” The
maiden pursed her lips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A figure walked into
the palace. He looked like a middle-aged man with long, unbound hair.
He walked in barefoot, looking rather unkept and dissolute.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Exalted Immortal
Blackheaven.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lord Blackheaven.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Milord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other golden-robed
Celestial Immortals all hurriedly called out to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Exalted Immortal
Blackheaven was someone which even the Gatemaster of the Seamless
Gate had to give some face to. He was quite famous within the Three
Realms. In terms of raw power in a frontal assault, he wasn’t that
formidable; at most, he was on the level of Celestial Immortal
Infatuation. But he simply was a master of far too many strange,
unorthodox techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fleeing techniques?
Trapping techniques? Poison techniques? He had far too many
techniques at his disposal; even True Immortals or Empyrean Gods
would be miserable facing him! He was considered something of a
legend in the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little baby girl
Violetgrass, I didn’t expect that you would end up begging for my
help.” Exalted Immortal Blackheaven said smugly, “Ahaha, when I
first saw you, you were a little baby girl…and now, you have made
something of yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You owe me, you old
bastard.” The maiden frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, yes…in the
past, I did indeed promise to fulfill three requests of yours. You’ve
used up one of them; this will be the second one.” Celestial
Immortal Blackheaven laughed. “Speak! What do you want me to do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The maiden waved her
hand, and a book appeared within it. She tossed it straight to the
distant Celestial Immortal Blackheaven, who accepted it, read it,
then frowned. “Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Within this book are
all the intelligence reports we have gathered regarding this Ji Ning.
Without question, he is not on our side; if he’s given time to grow
and develop, he’ll probably end up being trouble for us. Thus, it’s
best to get rid of him early on. The Gatemaster has instructed me to
handle it, but I want to ensure that things will go exactly as
planned, which is why I’ve asked you to help,” the maiden said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art]?” After reading through the intelligence reports,
Celestial Immortal Blackheaven’s eyes bulged out a bit. He then
raised his head head and said unhappily, “Little baby girl
Violetgrass, this is a practitioner of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art];
the only powers in the Three Realms who can teach and transmit the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art] are those Daofathers. Those who have this art
can be counted on two hands, and each of them are utterly terrifying.
This Ji Ning’s master is most likely one of them, and could crush
me with a single finger.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What are you afraid
of? You think his master would dare intervene?” Violetgrass was
disdainful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Maybe…”
Celestial Immortal Blackheaven shook his head. “Too dangerous. This
is too dangerous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You old bastard!”
The maiden said angrily. She knew this Celestial Immortal Blackheaven
quite well; after all, she had followed the Gatemaster and Celestial
Immortal Blackheaven when she was very young. Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven was legendary for his cowardice and caution, as well as
being skilled in unorthodox abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Celestial
Immortal Blackheaven said resignedly, “Perhaps the chances of his
master intervening are indeed remote…since it is for you, I’ll
let one of my clones go deal with Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A clone?” The
maiden stared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. I’ll
let my clone carry my ‘Polaris Godlocking Circlet’; once it
emerges, he will definitely be locked in place by it, without any
chance to resist.” Celestial Immortal Blackheaven chortled, “In
the blink of an eye, I’ll have captured him. I’ll take him away
and let you decide how to handle him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The maiden said,
puzzled, “Polaris Godlocking Circlet’? What type of a treasure is
that? Why haven’t I heard of it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have rarely fought
others, from the Primordial Era to the present era. How much do you
think you know? If it wasn’t for the fact that the Three Realms are
about to be swept into a storm, I wouldn’t be willing to use any of
these treasures of mine.” Celestial Immortal Blackheavens said
loudly, “Alright, tell me…where is this Ji Ning? Tell me, and
I’ll go collect him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The maiden, upon
hearing this, laughed. “Our most recent intelligence places him at
the imperial capital of the Grand Xia.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The imperial capital
of the Grand Xia?” Celestial Immortal Blackheaven frowned. “That’s
not a place I can go to. The Xia Emperor isn’t easy to deal with.
After he leaves the imperial capital, I’ll make my move.”

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine. As soon as Ji
Ning leaves the imperial capital of the Grand Xia, I will immediately
notify you.” The maiden nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Blackheavens chortled merrily and nodded. “Then before I deal with
Ji Ning…come! Let’s have a nice chat and catch up with each
other.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial capital of
the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
was seated face to face with Uncle White, while his true body had
entered the underwater estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The underwater estate.
Within the Still Room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s true body was
seated atop the bed of netherwater jade. Surrounding him were a large
amount of Five Elements treasures, ranging from a thousand kilograms
to tens of thousands of kilograms in weight. All of them were
circling around Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the ripples
coming from the Five Elements treasures were growing progressively
weaker as they quickly began to transform from spirit-items to
useless items. One could watch as the pieces of gold-gems from the
Heaven Realm began to visibly decay, becoming worthless rocks that
were a dull white color. The flows of liquid lava, formingly agile
and graceful, swirled in the air, but were quickly being transformed
into acidic water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s twin hands
were glowing with five colors of light. They were skyrocketing in
power as they ravenously consumed the Five Elements essence from
those spirit-treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This continued for
twelve full hours.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The surrounding area
was now littered with floating bits of shatter rocks, rock-like
strips of bamboo, ordinary and rather disgusting acidic water, as
well as a large amount of random dirt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Ning
exhaled, lowering his head to look at his two hands. His hands were
glowing with a dull light, and the power within them was truly
shocking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Fourth Cycle of
my [Starseizing Hand]!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes were
blazing. However…he could sense that his current hands had reached
an absolute limit in power. There would be no way for him to
strengthen them any further for now. If he wanted to…he would have
to get his hands to qualitatively evolve and transform to a
completely new stage, one which required him to first break through
to the Empyrean God level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Fourth Cycle of
the Starseizer. My twin hands are now comparable to supreme Pure Yang
treasures. When using [Three Heads, Six Arms], I’ll have the
equivalent of six supreme Pure Yang treasures at my disposal…”
Ning could sense how powerful his palms had become.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This feeling of
tremendous power really was wonderful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Magic treasures were
extremely important to an Immortal cultivator. Why was it that at the
early Wanxiang stage, one would be able to completely dominate a peak
Zifu Disciple? The Primal level, the Void level, the Celestial
Immortal level…advancing through the major stages caused an
enormous increase in power, partially because one’s own elemental
ki would change, but also because one’s magic treasures would
dramatically improve! Even if one’s insights into the Dao were
comparable to one’s foes, there would still be a huge difference in
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wanxiang Adepts were
able to use Earth-ranked treasures, Primal Daoists were able to use
Heaven-ranked magic treasures, Void-level Earth Immortals were able
to use Immortal-ranked magic treasures, and Celestial Immortals were
able to use Pure Yang treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Magic treasures
advanced in power to a truly staggering degree.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, Ji Ning!
In terms of insights into the Dao, he was actually comparable to
Patriarch Goldclock. And thanks to his [Starseizing Hand] divine
ability, Ning’s foundation was actually superior to Patriarch
Goldclock’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why, then, had he been
beaten silly by Patriarch Goldclock, without having any chance to
fight back at all?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why was it that he was
clearly weaker than Patriarch Goldclock?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Precisely because
Patriarch Goldclock had a top-grade Pure Yang divine greatclock!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For another example,
Patriarch Deadwood and Patriarch Goldclock. In terms of insights into
the Dao, Patriarch Deadwood was considerably superior to Patriarch
Goldclock, but Patriarch Goldclock’s power was comparable to
Patriarch Deadwood’s. This was because his magic treasure made up
for their disparity in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the Three Realms,
there are some experts who primarily rely on their magic treasures to
roam the realms.” Ning had read up on many commonly known facts
while at Mount Innerheart, and had learned that some Celestial
Immortals relied on extremely powerful Protocosmic spirit-treasures
to roam the Three Realms. By relying on some especially unique ones,
they might even be able to fight against True Immortals or Empyrean
Gods!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My two palms have
just skyrocketed in power, from being just barely at the Pure Yang
level to the very pinnacle of the Pure Yang level! They are
comparable to supreme middle-grade Protocosmic spirit-treasures. My
close combat power has most likely increased by an enormous amount as
well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew very well
that with his [Starseizing Hand] having advanced from the Third Cycle
to the Fourth Cycle, the amount of physical strength he would be able
to instantly unleash had just risen dramatically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition…his palms
were now comparable to supreme Pure Yang treasures (supreme
middle-grade Protocosmic spirit-treasures); they were now on par with
the Rahu Bow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With these two factors
combined…Ning’s power had just skyrocketed up several levels!
Patriarch Goldclock? Ning now held him in no regard at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am stronger than
Patriarch Goldclock in every conceivable way now.” Ning walked down
from the netherwater jade bed, allowing all of the rubbish hovering
within the room to be reduced to dust by his sword-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s true body
emerged from the Still Room and went to the main hall of the
underwater estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” The
giant yellow bear had a smile on his face. “Mm…you’ve mastered
the Fourth Cycle of the [Starseizing Hand]. You can now be considered
a decently strong figure of the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the
[Starseizing Hand] ‘merely’ had a total of six cycles, he had to
reach the True God level before he could train in the Sixth Cycle,
while the Fifth Cycle required that he become an Empyrean God. To
become a True God was simply far, far too difficult. True Gods were
comparable to Daofathers in power, and so for the foreseeable future,
Ning would probably only have a chance at mastering the Fifth Cycle
of the [Starseizing Hand].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fifth Cycle would
render Ning’s palms as powerful as a supreme Protocosmic
spirit-treasure. In the Three Realms, this was enough to render many
True Immortals and Empyrean Gods jealous of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, the Fourth
Cycle alone was enough to make Ning’s palms truly precious ‘items’.
If someone were to kill Ning and hack off his palms, they would
probably be used as magic treasures!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All my power is
thanks to the fact that Master Threelives was able to develop such an
incredible divine ability,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since Master left
his legacy behind, you are the first person to reach such a level of
power. Don’t underestimate yourself.” The giant yellow power
laughed. “Alright…your power has now increased dramatically. The
ninth level of the Wargod Hall…you now have a 99% chance of
overcoming it. Wish to give it a try?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was instantly
delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
was modest of speech, and would generally give very conservative
estimates; for even him to use the term ‘99%’ meant that Ning’s
success was virtually assured.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m now comparable
to a supreme Celestial Immortal?” Ning said in surprise and
delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Void-level Fiendgods
can be comparable to Celestial Immortals. Since your [Starseizing
Hand] has reached the Fourth Cycle, you can now compare to the most
supreme of Void-level Fiendgods.” The giant yellow bear laughed,
“This naturally means that you are now comparable to the most
supreme of Celestial Immortals. Will you challenge the Wargod Hall or
not?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, of course.”
Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ninth level of the
Wargod Hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a completely
empty void. Ning suddenly appeared out of nowhere within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is…?” Ning
glanced around himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. From far away,
a drop of golden blood suddenly manifested. This drop of golden blood
quickly transformed into a Fiendgod that was wearing a set of golden
armor. He was tall and muscular, with blood-red hair and a long black
spear in his hands. His eyes were filled with an unearthly killing
intent, one strong enough to cause Ning to feel startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared in
amazement at the figure that had just appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So you are Ji Ning?”
The red-haired Fiendgod actually revealed a smile, a very gentle and
kindly smile, the smile a father would have when looking at his
child.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are…?” Ning
was rather flabbergasted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he had always
felt that the Wargod Hall was quite peculiar, and had discovered more
and more oddities as he had progressed through its ranks, he had
never come to truly understand the secrets behind it. This opponent
which he was now encountering here on the ninth level…he was far
more powerful than any of the previous figures Ning had encountered.
That aura alone…Ning could sense that this person might even be
comparable to his senior apprentice-brother Silvermoon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My name is Redsnow,”
the red-haired Fiendgod said with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are an Empyrean
God?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-haired Fiendgod
laughed. “Good eye. I am indeed an Empyrean God, but this is just
an extremely weak clone of mine, created through a single drop of
blood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood the
profound mysteries behind the art of clones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more divine power
one put into a clone, the more power the clone would have. For
example, a clone that was created from a single hair would naturally
be extremely weak. To a Fiendgod, blood was still quite important. A
clone created from the blood of an Empyrean God would most likely be
at the Celestial Immortal level. As to how powerful it was, exactly?
Hard to say.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Redsnow, how
do you know that I am Ji Ning?” Ning asked. He found this quite
peculiar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was the big bear
who told me,” the red-haired Fiendgod laughed. “The Godking
finally has a successor. All of us have waited far, far too long.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart shook.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Waited far too long?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, Ji Ning. The
Godking chose you as his successor. Let me see exactly how strong you
are…and if you are qualified to have your position.” The
longspear in the red-haired Fiendgod’s hand trembled.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 17 - The Rahu Bow at Full Power
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-haired
Fiendgod’s power caused Ji Ning to feel shock. He was far too
powerful! That longspear…it moved like a ghost or an illusion. No
matter how he used his hands to attack, be it with sword-fingers or
various sword-arts, the longspear was able to easily break through
his techniques. While breaking through, the longspear would also
strike out in pierces, thrusts, or sideways swipes!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In short…Ning was at
a complete disadvantage!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The longspear moved
like a dragon, danced like a spirit through water. It carried
inconceivably profound mysteries with it, causing Ning to feel like
nothing more than a punching bag.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No more, no more!”
The red-haired Fiendgod finally came to a halt. Shaking his head, he
sighed. “I lost.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Redsnow, you
clearly are far more powerful than…” Halfway through his
sentence, Ning suddenly understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was most likely that
his opponent’s divine power was almost exhausted!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Each time your palm
clashed against my longspear, the force of the collision consumed a
large amount of my divine power.” The red-haired Fiendgod looked at
Ning, then said with a sigh, “The [Starseizing Hand] divine ability
truly is formidable. This clone of mine has far too little divine
power…after clashing against your [Starseizing Hand] ten-plus
times, the divine power has almost been used up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If your true body
was here, senior, you’d probably wipe me out in one blow,” Ning
said. Although his body was extremely powerful, the red-haired
Fiendgod’s spear-assaults were even more savage than the strikes of
Celestial Immortal Infatuation of the Youngflame clan. Each time
Ning’s hands clashed against the tip of the spear, he felt as
though his hands were about to be pierced through. In truth…his
skin was already covered with countless white spots! If the
red-haired Fiendgod’s true body was present, he probably would’ve
been able to completely destroy Ning’s physical body! Fortunately,
Ning had just trained in the Fourth Cycle of the [Starseizing Hand];
if it had been pre-breakthrough, he probably would’ve been too weak
and the red-haired Fiendgod’s divine power would have lasted longer
than Ning’s divine power, which would’ve been used up first.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once his divine power
was used up and he was unable to use his divine ability, Ning would
end up losing!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Losing is losing.”
The red-haired Fiendgod smilled merrily as he looked at Ning. “I
hear that you’ve trained for less than a century?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his heart, he was
murmuring to himself. Why did the giant yellow bear tell this
Empyrean God everything?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Less than a
century…your sword-arts are quite excellent,” the red-haired
Fiendgod said in praise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Facing you, all I
could do was rely on [Three Heads, Six Arms] to increase the size of
my palms and use them to block your longspear like miniature
bucklers.” Ning shook his head, quite ashamed. He had been forced
to use his hands like bucklers, and yet they had been broken past
repeatedly; the difference in power was simply too great.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha. Even as far
back as the Primordial Era, I had already mastered multiple Grand
Daos, to say nothing of my current level. If your sword-arts weren’t
so powerful, you probably wouldn’t have been able to deplete my
divine power.” The red-haired Fiendgod let out a sigh. “Your
sword-arts are quite well-suited for defense.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. Of
course! He had the most insights in the element of Water; ever since
he was young, his sword-arts had focused on defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Train hard and
become an Empyrean God soon!” The red-haired Fiendgod laughed.
“Otherwise…you won’t be able to get those fellows to be loyal
and submit to you.” After saying these words, he completely
disappeared, melting away into the void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be loyal and
submit?” Ning murmured these words to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning left, returning to
the main hall of the underwater estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations on
overcoming the ninth floor,” the giant yellow bear said, a merry
smile on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning had a frown on
his own face. “Empyrean God Redsnow. Who is he?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
was momentarily startled. He then said calmly, “He was an Empyrean
God under Master’s command…but that’s nothing you need to ask
about for now. You are still far too weak; even here, in the world of
the Grand Xia, just a single one of the three thousand major worlds,
you still have to tread carefully. You aren’t qualified to get
involved with the major powers that exist within the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All I can tell you
is this…the Three Realms aren’t as simple as you might believe
them to be. Not even Patriarch Subhuti will tell you everything
before you become truly powerful. For the weak, the less you know,
the better. Too much knowledge will be the death of you. The
abilities of the truly major powers of the Three Realms are beyond
what you can imagine. Even Master…in the face of the storm that
swept the Three Realms long ago, he was nothing special. Even
Patriarch Subhuti, who was even more powerful than Master, was afraid
to take part in that war. So…how much of a chance do you think you
have?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said softly, “The
destruction of Pangu’s World…a major secret is concealed within
it? Can it be that everything I learned was wrong?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What you and your
friends know is merely what the Daofathers wish for you to know. Do
not ask anything else; only after you become a True Immortal or an
Empyrean God are you qualified to know. As for Celestial
Immortals…major powers can kill countless Celestial Immortals with
a wave of the hand,” the giant yellow bear said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you wish to go to
the Treasure Hall to choose a treasure? You aren’t an Empyrean God
yet; there’s actually no point for you to choose a Pure Yang
treasure, you know.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will. Of course I
will!” Ning said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rahu Bow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sent out a
spiritual call.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black-robed youth
instantly appeared next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m about to
procure a bowstring for you. Choose what type of bowstring you would
like,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…you are
finally going to get a new bowstring for me?” The black-robed youth
was instantly delighted. He then turned his head to look towards the
giant yellow bear. “Big bear, where’s that scroll I wrote out
earlier?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here.” The giant
yellow bear waved his hand, and a scroll appeared out of nowhere,
hovering in the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, this scroll
includes the three types of bowstrings that are the best suited for
me. Of course…they aren’t cheap. The three of them are of three
different levels; naturally, the higher the level, the better,” the
black-robed youth said excitedly. “Godbows…the body of the bow
and the string of the bow are two separate parts. For a Protocosmic
spirit-treasure like myself, a powerful body is the most important
part, while bowstrings are easier to create and procure. The most
important quality is their tensile strength and ability to store
power, allowing the maximum amount of power from the formations
engraved into the body of the bow to flow through them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning accepted the
scroll. Opening it, he said in surprise, “All are fire-attribute
bowstrings? But your body is water-attribute, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fire and water, body
and bowstring; that’s what is necessary for the power to be
tremendous. Can it be that you have forgotten that when you
discovered me within the Crescent world, I used the power of heaven
and earth to form arrows of flame? In addition, the two arrows that
you discovered; weren’t they also fire-attribute?” The
black-robed youth said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
laughed, then nodded. “Don’t worry; I’ll definitely procure a
superb bowstring for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main headquarters
of the Heavenly Treasures Mountain. High noon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White, have
you prepared the list?” Ning looked towards the white-robed,
white-haired man before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I prepared it long
ago. Since we are going to act against the Youngflame clan, we
naturally need to spare no expense.” Uncle White handed Ning a
leather scroll.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning lowered his head
to read through it, nodding slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To deal with the
Youngflame clan…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning already had a plan
for doing this. But of course, plans rarely survived contact with the
enemy. Since he wasn’t sure about the trump cards which the
Youngflame clan had in their possession, Ning naturally had to make
multiple levels of preparations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” A voice
rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A silver-haired man,
Skyfox, came walking in. Smiling, he said, “Do you have some more
good news for me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I do indeed,” Ning
said with a laugh. “Let me show you a few things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ten globes suddenly
appeared in the air around Ning. One of the globes was a watery
green, while the other nine globes were a fiery red. Every single
globe was emanating incomparably terrifying ripples of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are…”
Skyfox’s eyes turned round and huge. “Can these all be…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sole-Ki Nine Element
Pearls!” Ning nodded as he spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skyfox cleared his
throat, glancing towards Ning in disbelief. These Sole-Ki Nine
Element Pearls…they were a set of Pure Yang treasures that were
quite famous, even back in Pangu’s World. They could transform into
nine entire worlds! When a pearl smashed into a foe, it was as though
an entire world was smashing into that person. But of course, that
was when these Pure Yang treasures were used to their maximum
potential.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need a set of
top-grade Immortal-ranked Fuxi Staff Formation staffs.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need twenty
top-grade Pure Yang spirit-pills, or an equivalent amount of
low-grade Pure Yang spirit-pills.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This list has a
bowstring on it, as well as some cheaper alternatives.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I also need the
objects written on this leather scroll.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning handed over two
different leather scrolls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was unable to use
Pure Yang treasures for now. By the time he was able to use them, his
power would probably be far greater than his current level of power,
and in addition, his palms were already comparable to supreme Pure
Yang treasures. Thus…he naturally chose to sell off this treasure,
so as to increase his power right away!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you really
are…” Upon seeing the leather scrolls, Skyfox’s face turned
ashen. “Your requests are too excessive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If the Xia Emperor
isn’t willing, I won’t force this trade,” Ning said. “I can
go seek out my fellow senior disciples.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_18___Leaving_the_Heavenl"></A>
Chapter 18 - Leaving the Heavenly Treasures Mountain
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The set of Pure Yang
treasures which Ji Ning had just taken out, the Sole-Ki Nine Element
Pearls, had been chosen by him from the Treasure Hall. They were the
most valuable items which Ning could choose from the Pure Yang
treasures available to him. None of the formidable Pure Yang
treasures which Daoist Threelives had left behind in his Treasure
Hall were weak; even the cheapest was at least as valuable as a
high-grade Pure Yang treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…there were
too few Pure Yang treasures, after all. Even Daoist Threelives wasn’t
able to collect too many of them. After overcoming the ninth level of
the Wargod Hall, Ning had only been given a total of eighteen Pure
Yang treasures to choose from.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had chosen the most
valuable item, the Sole-Ki Nine Element Pearls. Nine of these pearls
were high-grade Pure Yang treasures, while the nuclear pearl that
served as the core of the formation was a top-grade Pure Yang
treasure! In addition, this was a treasure-set that belonged to the
exceedingly expensive ‘world-type’ of magic treasures. One could
smash them into foes with the force of a minor world, but could also
use their power to suppress and bind a foe, causing them to feel as
though they were mired in quickstand. They were far more powerful
than the Primordial Nightriver contained within the Thousandbull
Sword. This sort of world-type Pure Yang treasure was exceedingly
rare and precious to begin with; this set alone was most likely
comparable to four or five ordinary top-grade Pure Yang treasures!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Fuxi Staff
Formation, the items on the first list, and the arrows are minor
matters,” Skyfox said helplessly. “Master can also provide you
with the twenty top-grade Pure Yang spirit-pills that you have
requested. But the bow…your request is too extravagant. Such
bowstrings are not so easily procured.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The treasures and
Pure Yang spirit-pills that I have requested can most likely be
procured by any True Immortal or Empyrean God who asks his friends
for them. The most important item on the list is that bowstring. If
it wasn’t for that bowstring, I wouldn’t even be willing to give
up this set of Pure Yang treasures in exchange,” Ning said. “The
Xia Emperor is of the Primordial Imperial Clan; ordinary True
Immortals and Empyrean Gods might not be able to produce such a
bowstring, but I trust the Xia Emperor is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having stayed at
Mount Innerheart for some time, Ning knew exactly how powerful the
Primordial Imperial Clan was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pangu’s World…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Back then, there was no
such thing as the three thousand major worlds or trillion minor
worlds! There was just a single world; Pangu’s World! And back
then, the Primordial Imperial Clan ruled over the entirety of the
human race! They had quite a few major powers who were at the
Daofather level. Although Pangu’s World ended up shattering, and
although the Primordial Imperial Clan was no longer as mighty as it
once was, and although the Xia Emperor and the Xiamang clan were
merely of a branch of that lineage…the Xia Emperor’s roots were
far beyond the likes of an ordinary True Immortal or Empyrean God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a dark void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Xia
Emperor was seated in the lotus position. He opened his eyes.
“Sole-Ki Nine Element Pearls? They actually ended up in Ji Ning’s
hands! A young fellow like him, who hasn’t even overcome his
Celestial Tribulation; how is it that he is able to produce such a
set of Pure Yang treasures? And such precious ones at that! Strange,
truly strange…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Strange things like
this could be explained with a single, simple word. That word
was…luck!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only an extremely lucky
person could have such results!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The storm is about
to descend. Pure Yang treasures like these Sole-Ki Nine Element
Pearls…they will be greatly desired by many True Immortals and
Empyrean Gods.” The black-robed Xia Emperor pondered privately for
a time. “A bow…it seems I’ll have to go see Uncle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor had
long ago left the Primordial Imperial Clan to set off on his own,
establishing his own Xiamang lineage. Thus, he would rarely see the
other members of the Primordial Imperial Clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master has sent
word.” Skyfox looked towards Ning, who immediately listened
carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He has agreed to all
your other requests, save for that bowstring; that will take some
time,” Skyfox explained. “Master is currently thinking of a way
to try and procure one. You should know that the bowstring you have
requested is one of the most supreme bowstrings of the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded lightly.
“I’m not in a rush.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In an ordinary
situation, it was hard to say whether he would be able to trade his
Sole-Ki Nine Element Pearls for the treasures he had requested.
However, since a storm was about to descend, and the pearls were
items that could be used right away, whereas a bowstring…a
bowstring had to be matched with a similarly superb bow! As for the
truly supreme master archers of the Three Realms, they each already
had their own favored bows. Thus, Ning felt comfortable that at a
time like this, the Xia Emperor would be willing to help with this
exchange.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As a member of the
Primordial Imperial Clan and as a disciple of Daofather
Crimsonbright, and as a supposed life-long friend of Daofather
Raindragon…although a bowstring like this is hard to find, the Xia
Emperor should be able to succeed.” Ning chose to wait.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skyfox elected to
temporarily withdraw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Four entire hours
passed. It was now nightfall. Skyfox once more appeared before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From the look on
your face, senior Skyfox, I can guess…that the bowstring has been
found,” Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master spent up
quite a bit of energy, but he finally managed to find a bowstring for
you.” Skyfox smiled as he handed Ning a golden gourd. “All the
items you desire are within this gourd. Take a close look.” They
were within the imperial capital of the Grand Xia; he wasn’t
worried that Ning would take the treasures and instantly flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Forget about Ji Ning;
even the True Immortals and Empyrean Gods of the Seamless Gate and
the Myriad Demons Cave wouldn’t dare to challenge the Xia Emperor
within the imperial capital of the Grand Xia!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such generosity!
This gourd is a top-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasure that holds a
small dimension within it,” Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A gift,” Skyfox
said in a very casual manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning held that golden
gourd in his hands, carefully inspecting its contents. Within the
golden gourd hovered spirit-pills with powerful auras, each of which
contained an astonishing amount of extremely pure elemental ki. They
were all Pure Yang-level spirit-pills. There were also a large number
of precious objects floating within the gourd, the ones which Uncle
White needed to set up his formations. There was also a set of Fuxi
Staff Formation staffs which Uncle White needed! The more powerful a
set of Fuxi Staff Formation staffs, the greater the power of the
formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bowstring…arrows…”
Ning was absolutely satisfied with what he saw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A pitch-black bowstring
hung in the air within the golden globe, and next to it were a total
of a hundred fiery arrows. Naturally, these arrows were merely
high-grade Immortal-ranked treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the underwater
estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha, a bowstring
comes!” The nearby black-robed youth was extremely excited.
“Master, you truly are amazing. You aren’t even a Celestial
Immortal, but were able to procure such a fine bowstring. Although
it’s simply a bowstring…it’s even more precious than an
ordinary top-grade Pure Yang spirit-treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled, personally
affixing the bowstring onto the body of the bow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After connecting the
two together…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black greatblow
instantly flew up to hover in the air. Light cascaded off of its body
like a series of waves of black water. The body of the bow was
clearly glowing with a black, watery light, but when the light
reached the bowstring, it transformed into a fiery light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…with this
bowstring, I’m now as strong as I was back during the Primordial
Era.” The black-robed youth was absolutely excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled and nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Rahu Bow was a
high-grade Protocosmic spirit-treasure; logically speaking, such a
treasure couldn’t possibly be damaged under normal situations!
However, its bowstring had ended up snapping; this was because the
body of the bow and the bowstring…actually had been qualitatively
different in power. The bowstring was comparatively more fragile; in
fact, there were some True Gods who could break apart the bowstring
of a godbow! If they suddenly released their strength and pulled the
bowstring with full power, the bowstring might just snap! After doing
that, they would replace the snapped bowstring with an even better
one! This was why, even when its bowstring was destroyed, the Rahu
Bow had been able to use the power of heaven and earth to attack
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I now have my godbow
and my arrows, while my [Starseizing Hand] has reached the Fourth
Cycle. Although I only have a basic level of skill in [Houyi’s
Archery], it’s enough to unleash tremendous power.” Ning was
filled with eagerness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was only at a basic
level of skill in archery…but that was in comparison to the full
[Houyi’s Archery]. Compared to others in the Three Realms, Ning
could already be considered an expert archer; after all, he was even
able to use heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartforce was
mysterious and unfathomable!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unlike other types of
force, it was extremely difficult to sense and touch…but it truly
was extraordinarily powerful. The ability to use heartforce was a
dividing factor between those who were and were not able to
successfully become divine archers of the Three Realms. Ning had
clearly already passed through that doorway, and he had also learned
some of the knacks of using divine power from [Houyi’s Archery].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, it was matched
with a high-grade Protocosmic godbow…and his own strength with the
[Starseizing Hand]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After I reach a more
profound level in [Houyi’s Archery], I’ll be able to easily kill
any foe within a million kilometers.” Ning was filled with
eagerness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, Ning once more
entered the underwater estate, preparing to train in the [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art]. Previously, when fighting against the Fiendgod Redsnow,
Ning had understood that although his body was seemingly impregnable,
if he were to run into a True Immortal or Empyrean God, he would
probably be destroyed with utter ease. Thus, he had to increase his
power as soon as possible. After all, a storm was coming to shake the
Three Realms; it was always a good idea to increase his strength when
possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since he was about to
truly go all-out against the Youngflame clan…how could he not move
to improve his odds of survival?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Glug.” Ning began
to swallow down one-spirit pill after another, as quickly as if he
were eating peanuts. He began to dissolve them within his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To train in the Third
Cycle of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], Ning had needed to use a total
of a hundred top-grade Immortal-ranked spirit-pills.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To train in the Sixth
Cycle of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], the cost would be a thousand
times as great; a total of a hundred thousand top-grade
Immortal-ranked spirit-pills would be needed! This was roughly
comparable to a hundred top-grade Pure Yang spirit-pills! If he had
to use treasures to trade for them, a single set of Sole-Ki Nine
Element Pearls would be insufficient; this time, Ning had merely
acquired the equivalent of twenty top-grade Pure Yang spirit-pills.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s body began to
rumble without pause. His bones felt as though mountains were
smashing into them, and his flesh felt like they were being ground
away by two colliding continents. His divine body was being
repeatedly enhanced, and it was growing increasingly powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fourth Cycle of the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art] - Success!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fifth Cycle of the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art] - Success!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Ning
finally came to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After using up half
the spirit-pills, I’ve finally mastered the Fifth Cycle of the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art]. The remaining spirit-pills…I should keep
them. In a life-and-death battle, elemental ki is used up far too
fast; these spirit-pills can be used to replenish my energy. Mmm…my
divine body is now comparable to a high-grade Immortal-ranked
treasure.” Ning felt as though his kicks and punches now contained
incomparably terrifying might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His divine body was
truly like a magic treasure! His speed had also been increased to a
truly swift new level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning departed from the
Heavenly Treasures Mountain. Although he had only stayed there for a
total of two days, his power had skyrocketed in an astonishing
manner! He had reached the Fourth Cycle of the [Starseizing Hand] and
the Fifth Cycle of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], as well as fixed his
Rahu Bow…and even Uncle White, a master of formations, had
increased in power dramatically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“King Yan’s
Estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning reached the
outside of King Yan’s Estate. This time, he was planning to deal
with the Youngflame clan; how could he forget the person who hated
the Youngflame clan the most, the one who was willing to sacrifice
everything to destroy them…his cousin, Yuchi Xiyue?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He didn’t need to
make any requests; he went straight into the King’s estate, and he
quickly found Yuchi Xiyue’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cousin.” Ning and
Xiyue were meeting privately within a veranda. With but a though,
Ning completely blocked off the surrounding space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?”
Xiyue, seeing how Ning was acting, couldn’t help but ask this
question.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is time for the
Youngflame clan to pay their debt of blood,” Ning said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiyue was completely
shocked. She instantly jumped to her feet.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_19___The_Sword_Pointed_a"></A>
Chapter 19 - The Sword Pointed at Easthill Commandery
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course Yuchi Xiyue
wanted revenge; for the sake of revenge, she would be able to
sacrifice everything, even her life! This was because her father,
Yuchi Mount, had always dreamed of revenge. She was going to fulfill
her father’s dream. For the sake of the Yuchi clan…she would
ensure that their blood debt would be repaid!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But she also knew
exactly how powerful the Youngflame clan was. Ji Ning had, after all,
trained for less than a century; how could he be a match for the
Youngflame clan?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little brother,
don’t go too crazy,” Xiyue said worriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cousin, don’t
worry; I already have a plan,” Ning said confidently. “Although
I’m not confident in being able to kill the Celestial Immortals of
the Youngflame clan…I’ll teach them a lesson they’ll never
forget.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuchi Xiyue was still
very worried. “Are you truly confident?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He already had the
power of a supreme Celestial Immortal; he no longer held Patriarch
Goldclock and Patriarch Deadwood in any regard. Only Patriarch
Infatuation still posed a bit of a threat to him, but despite that,
he was now capable of simply standing there and letting Patriarch
Infatuation attack as he pleased; his body, now protected by the
Fifth Cycle of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], wouldn’t care about the
blows at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, this time,
he wouldn’t be ambushed; instead, he was going to challenge them,
after having made a plethora of preparations!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little brother…don’t
be in too much of a rush. We really don’t need to rush it,” Xiyue
said hurriedly. “We can wait for a while longer; let’s wait until
you grow more powerful. I’ve already waited for so many years;
there’s no rush. Little brother, I have no other family members
left; I truly do not wish to lose you as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cousin, am I the
rash, impetuous sort?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiyue was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She thought back
through her memories…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning could be
quite berserk at times, he handled every matter in quite a competent
manner. For example, when he elected to participate in the Conclave
of Immortal Destiny, many had believed that given he had only trained
for thirty years, he should not attend. But in the end? He became the
champion of the Conclave!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Last time, he had been
ambushed by four mighty Celestial Immortals. He had been completely
caught off-guard, which was why he had ended up in such a sorry
state! And yet…he still didn’t let the Youngflame clan get what
they wanted!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given that Ning was now
making such meticulous plans and preparations, and given that his
power had just increased dramatically…he naturally had a fairly
high degree of confidence in his plans!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, there was no
such thing as an absolute. Ning wouldn’t dare say that he was 100%
confident in his plans. An ancient clan like the Youngflame clan
might, for example, suddenly reveal a True Immortal or Empyrean God;
at that point, Ning would just stare blankly. Still, based on what
Ning knew…the Youngflame clan shouldn’t have any Pure Yang True
Immortals or Empyrean Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve truly
decided?” Xiyue looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
“I’ve just come to let you know, cousin, before I actually carry
it all out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little brother, I
truly can no longer see through you. Ever since you returned to the
world of the Grand Xia…I’ve been unable to see through you.
However…Grandfather spoke truly; you are now very powerful.”
Xiyue looked at Ning. Gritting her teeth, a hint of fierceness
flashed through her eyes as she said, “When you go deal with the
Youngflame clan, I shall go with you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ll come with
me?” Ning was surprised. She was merely a Primal Daoist!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little brother, you
can go kill the more powerful Immortal cultivators. As for the weaker
ones and the mortals…leave all of them to me. In the past, every
member of my Yuchi clan, men and women, children and elders,
cultivators and mortals…they were all slaughtered. Not a single one
of them escaped the butchery.” Xiyue ground her teeth with hatred.
“What they did to my Yuchi clan in the past…I’ll repay it unto
them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Killing mortals?”
Ning shook his head. “No. You are an Immortal cultivator; killing
mortals will incur enormous amounts of sin. In addition, the
Youngflame clan has simply far too many clansmen. To kill that many
mortals…karmic sinflames would instantly descend from the heavens.
Given your level of power, the karmic sinflames would instantly roast
you to death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those with a low level
of sin would be surrounded by a corrosive sin-aura. Those with a high
level of sin would be surrounded by the bloody light of sin. For
example, eleven of the Twelve Monster-Kings of the Eastern Flows were
all surrounded by the bloody light of sin. If one had an even higher
level of sin…karmic sinflames would descend! Ordinary Loose
Immortals and Earth Immortals would be immediately roasted to death
by the descent of karmic sinflames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only truly terrifying
demons were capable of surviving within karmic sinflames. His cousin
was definitely not strong enough to resist karmic sinflames!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have many
subordinates. I’ll lead them; in fact, I’ll even command a large
group of soldiers to come with me.” His cousin gritted her teeth
and said, “You kill the strong ones, they can kill the mortals.
This was what the Youngflame clan did!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even so…as the
commander, a degree of sin will gather around you as well. The
Youngflame clan has millions of Immortal cultivators. As for
mortals…they number in the hundreds of millions, at least. It’s
hard to say exactly how many of them there are. Countless tiny
strands of sin will accumulate upon you…and you’ll at least have
the bloody light of sin covering your body,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His cousin’s eyes
were completely red. “I’m not afraid. I’ve waited far, far too
long for this day.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no way I
can agree.” Ning rose to his feet. “Wait for news from me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning soared straight
into the air, quickly vanishing from the skies above the imperial
capital of the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiyue was momentarily
startled. She then let out a fierce, frustrated scream. She wanted to
go kill!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swallow Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning led Uncle White
back to Swallow Mountain. He also summoned Little Qing to him, and
together they went to Mu Northson’s room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother.” Northson looked towards Ning, his body
shaking, his eyes bloodshot. “Are we going to the Youngflame clan
now?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course. Master
has waited for this day for a long, long time,” Little Qing said
excitedly. “Master…I wish to go as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned. “I
thought I told you that you are to stay at Swallow Mountain and guard
it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Little Qing’s body
flickered. Instantly, a second white-robed Little Qing appeared next
to her. Both of them emanated the aura of a Void-level Earth
Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know that you have
a Primaltwin…eh? Your Primaltwin has become a Void-level Earth
Immortal as well?” Ning said with some surprise. He had many
treasures; naturally, he wouldn’t be stingy with them with Little
Qing and Uncle White. Uncle White hadn’t created a Primaltwin,
because the creation of a Primaltwin required the splitting of one’s
soul, causing the power of both souls to start off much lower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Uncle White knew that
Ning was going to deal with the Youngflame clan, and so he wasn’t
willing to lower his power. Little Qing, however, was adept at
survival to begin with; naturally, she had prepared a Primaltwin long
ago. By now, her Primaltwin had also become a Void-level Earth
Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Primaltwin can
stay here at Swallow Mountain; it’s enough to control the grand
formations,” Little Qing said hurriedly. “Master, I’m your
spirit-beast. You are going out to do battle; how can I not accompany
you? In addition, you don’t need to worry about my safety at all;
I’m far faster than you when I use a Greater Spatial Teleportation.
You have to use Dao-seals, whereas I can use the technique directly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “Fine!
However, you must obey my orders.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course. You are
my master,” Little Qing said with a chortle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning nodded,
then looked towards Northson. “Junior apprentice-brother, I need to
rest a bit. Tomorrow morning, we’ll head to one of the three
commanderies the Youngflame clan controls; Easthill Commandery.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Youngflame clan was
even more powerful than the Northmont clan; it had three full
commanderies. Thus, their headquarters were divided into three parts
as well; or at least, that was what the intelligence reports were
able to discover. Every single one of the headquarters took up an
enormous amount of land, and the number of clansmen numbered in the
hundreds of millions! There were more than a million Immortal
cultivators in total; this was definitely equivalent to some of the
largest clans. Each of the headquarters was comparable in power to
the Northmont clan’s headquarters in Stillwater Commandery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three great
headquarters; Ning was only able to choose one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” A savage
light flashed through Northson’s eyes. “Tomorrow. Fine. Tomorrow,
then.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He looked with a bit of
worry towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, if you aren’t confident in carrying it out,
don’t go. Don’t go too crazy just because I want to take
revenge.” Northson was worried that Ning was being rash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My differences with
the Youngflame clan are as irreconcilable as water and fire. I was
willing to bide my time and endure it, but the Youngflame clan
refused to give me time,” Ning said. “In the eyes of the
Youngflame clan, I’m a potential threat; they won’t permit me to
continue to grow.” The longer Ning lived, the more the Youngflame
clan would worry. After all, Ning’s rate of improvement was simply
too fast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Northson
nodded lightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take a rest.” Ning
laughed, then gently patted Northson on the shoulder. “Get some
rest tonight and recover some of your energy. Tomorrow, we’ll truly
begin our war against the Youngflame clan. We’ll be facing an
ancient clan that has existed for countless years, and all the tricks
they have to muster. The number of Immortal cultivators alone is at
least more than a million!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson, upon
imagining a million cultivators, couldn’t help but feel his heart
tremble. Although most likely the vast majority of these cultivators
were merely Zifu Disciples…quantity was a quality of its own as
well. In addition, this was the headquarters of an entire tribe; it
would be surrounded by layers of formations, and even Celestial
Immortals who barged in would probably perish. Only Ning, by relying
on the Fifth Cycle of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], would dare to
charge straight in!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, you have to be careful.” Northson looked at
Ning, filled with worry. Although he was going to fight as well…he
had already prepared himself mentally for death! In addition, there
was an enormous difference in power between himself and those four
Celestial Immortals; thus, the high-level fights would primarily
depend on Ning’s power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” Ning
laughed. “Don’t underestimate me, your senior
apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Night. It was as cool
as water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was seated by
himself atop the roof, staring dowards the bright moon in the sky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tomorrow, I shall
battle against the Youngflame clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father. Mother. Just
watch and see. One of the ten most powerful clans of the Grand Xia
Dynasty, the Youngflame clan…I’ll rock them from top to bottom,”
Ning said softly. He then took a big gulp out of the gourd of wine he
was holding in his hands, letting the wine spill out and dribble
across his chest. Alas…his father and his mother wouldn’t be able
to see any of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, his father
and his mother hadn’t even wanted for him to go deal with
Snowdragon Mountain! Snowdragon Mountain had been destroyed years
ago. Nowadays, in Ning’s eyes…it was nothing more than a small
local sect. Annihilation of such a sect was simplicity itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Youngflame clan…now
that was a truly tough nut to crack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, it was nothing
more than a tough nut.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Four Celestial
Immortals of the Youngflame clan had acted against him, but hadn’t
been able to successfully do anything to him back then…to say
nothing of now!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The next day. Dawn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Mu Northson,
Uncle White, and Little Qing all soared into the skies of Swallow
Mountain together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two youths, a large
snowy-white hound, an azure serpent…this was a gathering that
looked quite odd, and it was a gathering that was going to venture
forth to deal with the ancient Youngflame clan! They were going to
charge straight into the headquarters of the Youngflame clan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
unleashed his elemental ki, covering everyone with it before
performing a void blink.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Easthill Commandery.
This was an extremely distant commandery that had many mountains and
rivers within it. In terms of raw size, it was significantly larger
than Stillwater Commandery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Oldjade mountain
range was the most important mountain range in Easthill Commandery,
because this massive mountain range that stretched nearly a million
kilometers was one of the three headquarters of the Youngflame clan.
There were an unfathomable number of Youngflame clansmen who lived
here, with the number of Immortal cultivators numbering over a
million. As for the number of formations and restrictions laid down
here over the course of countless eons, that was even more
unfathomable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Four figures suddenly
appeared in midair. Two youths, a large snowy-white hound, and an
azure serpent.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_20___Old_Demon_Windraise"></A>
Chapter 20 - Old Demon Windraiser
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the others
stared far away at the distant mountain range, which stretched off as
far as the eye could see. Although they had yet to enter, they each
sensed the waves of power and might emanating from within the
mountain range. This was the might of a grand formation that was
continuously active, protecting the mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, how do we get in?” Mu Northson sent
frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Little Qing looked
forward, then mumbled to herself, “Countless mortals, over a
million Immortal cultivators…who knows how many formations have
been set up to protect an ancient headquarters like this one, that
has existed for countless eons. The successive generations of
Celestial Immortals of the Youngflame clan have definitely strove to
set down many formations. A place like this is like a steel wall. How
are we supposed to get inside? What should we do?” Little Qing
glanced at the nearby Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother…” Northson looked towards Ning as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the face of a place
like this, they didn’t have any ideas on how to enter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was too tightly
guarded!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a far more
tightly guarded place than the Eastwoods mountain range; although
this was just one of three bases for the Youngflame clan, it still
surpassed the headquarters of the Northmont clan of Stillwater! The
Youngflame clan had definitely given birth to a good number of
Celestial Immortals, over the passage of countless years from the
Fiendgod Era to the present day. The headquarters of such an ancient
clan…entering it probably was as dangerous as entering Swallow
Mountain, which was guarded by the grand formations of the Mount
Innerheart League!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course we can’t
force our way in.” Ning shook his head. “It is layered with
formations; once we force our way in, we’ll instantly become
trapped within the formations.” When Bloodcloud Hall had attempted
to assassinate him, Ning had been trapped within the formations of
the Eastwoods mountain range; in the end, he had to use a Greater
Teleportation Dao-seal in order to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then what should we
do?” Northson asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have you forgotten
how I entered the forbidden region?” Ning glanced at Northson.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll use the same
method to infiltrate the Oldjade mountain range,” Ning said with a
smile. The practitioners of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] were the most
mysterious and secretive figures of the entire Three Realms; they
were able to use the art to easily slip into Immortal residences or
even the Celestial Court.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just two hours later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Ning’s mobile
Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spare me, senior.
Spare me, senior! If I, Youngflame Blackburn, have offended you in
some way, senior, please let me know!” A tall, thin, middle-aged
man was staring in terror at the masked, black-robed man before him.
He didn’t even think about fighting back…because this person was
simply far too powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had clearly been
within a commandery city earlier, but this person had suddenly
appeared, completely paralyzing him through just a simple Dao Domain,
then drawing him into a mobile Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For his Dao Domain to
be so powerful…this person could probably kill him, Youngflame
Blackburn, with a single thought.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I wanted to kill
you, you’d already be dead,” the masked, black-robed man said in
a gravelly voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackburn let out a
secret sigh of relief. If this mysterious figure truly had killed him
right away, that really would’ve been a miserable way to die. He
hurriedly said, “Senior, if there’s anything you need, please let
me know; this junior shall definitely do everything in my power to
accomplish it for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The masked,
black-robed figure seemed to chuckle. “I wish to know a few things,
so…I wish to examine your memories.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Examine my
memories?” Blackburn was surprised. He said uneasily, “Senior…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will soulscour
you. If you don’t resist, the side effects probably won’t be that
bad. If you do, however…I’ll have to use force,” the masked,
black-robed man said. “Will you accept it willingly or not?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackburn felt both
miserable and helpless. Hesitating for just a fraction of a moment,
he gritted his teeth then said, “This junior is willing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The masked,
black-robed man immediately reached out, pressing his hand against
Blackburn’s head, then using the Thousandstar soulscouring
technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In midair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was standing atop
a cloud. He nodded slightly. “The first was a Primal Daoist. Primal
Daoists have fairly high statuses within the Youngflame clan and know
a decent amount of things. From what I saw…in Easthill Commandery,
there is a clear stratification amongst its denizens, as well as many
layers of formations. Even a Primal Daoist like Youngflame Blackburn
was only permitted to go to some of the regions in the commandery,
and he only knew the methods to bypass a few of the formations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This soulscouring had
only resulted in him learning about part of the grand formations set
up in this particular area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems I need to
find more Primal Daoists and do a close investigation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Ning
immediately used a void blink and disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning began to act
against a number of Primal Daoists of the Youngflame clan within the
Easthill Commandery. Different Primal Daoists had different statuses;
some knew many things about the formations protecting their
headquarters, while some only knew a little bit! Slowly, Ning began
to build a general picture of the formations within the Oldjade
mountain range of Easthill Commandery. He conveyed what information
he had to Uncle White.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Uncle White was a
grandmaster of formations; he would definitely be able to come up
with a superior method for breaking in!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha! You want to
soulscour me?” An azure-robed man let out a wild laugh. “As I
thought…you are the one the Patriarchs spoke of, yes? Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” The
masked, black-robed Primaltwin Ning instantly felt that something was
wrong. He immediately willed it…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sword-light appeared
out of nowhere, piercing straight through the body of the azure-robed
man, chopping it in half. The azure-robed man’s Primal Turtle-Snake
instantly flew out, but as the sword-light chopped towards it, the
Primal Turtle-Snake was shattered as well. The human-shaped soul
within began to attempt to leave for reincarnation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you think that
just because you tried to self-detonate, that you would avoid my
soulscouring?” Ning held a black jewel in his hand. The black jewel
produced a powerful attractive power, drawing the man’s soul
inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When killing a Primal
Daoist and destroying his Primal Turtle-Snake, one would generally
destroy the soul as well. However, Ning’s power vastly surpassed
his foe’s; he was able to destroy the Primal Turtle-Snake but keep
the soul intact. His plan was to collect it then soulscour it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Soulscour? Hahaha…”
The human-shaped soul of the azure-robed man let out an incomparably
wild laugh. His soul began to crack apart…and then it completely
shattered and dissipated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” A moment
later, Ning let out a sigh to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Experts with
sufficiently powerful souls were capable of splitting their souls.
For example, long ago Ning himself had split his soul to create his
Primaltwin…but what this person had just done was to split his soul
into multiple pieces, causing it to shatter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually
shattered his own soul.” Ning sighed to himself. “It seems the
Youngflame clan does have some extremely loyal clansmen.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was able to guess
that I am Ji Ning? He was quite smart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t actually
feel surprised; this was because he had already soulscoured quite a
few Primal Daoists, through which he discovered that the Celestial
Immortals of the Youngflame clan had already sent out an order for
all members of the Youngflame clan to be extremely careful. They had
to keep an eye out for Ji Ning secretly infiltrating their clan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Last time, four
Celestial Immortals worked together to attack me. Although they
failed, they were able to learn that I most likely train in the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art],” Ning mused to himself. “Practitioners
of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] are highly skilled in transformations
and subterfuge; it would be strange if the Youngflame clan didn’t
take precautions.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But so what if they
do take precautions? In the Three Realms…practitioners of the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art] can enter and depart from even places as
tightly guarded as the Celestial Court as they so please.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the Dao of a
King!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even though they knew
that Ning trained in the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], there was no way
they could prevent him from entering the Oldjade mountain range.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But despite that…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given that the enemy
was prepared, it would be harder for him to reach his target.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Youngflame is
probably already aware of this Primal Daoist’s death. However…he’s
just a single person. It shouldn’t be too bad,” Ning mused to
himself. The Youngflame clan was an enormous organization; given that
this was an era of dangerous undercurrents, the death of a single
Primal Daoist shouldn’t be viewed as a major matter. But if two
died in a row…this would probably draw attention.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll leave it at
this for now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle white.” The
black-robed Ning walked to a hall within his mobile Immortal estate.
Within the hall were Uncle White, Mu Northson, and Little Qing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How’d it go?”
Uncle White looked over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although I carefully
compared every person I seized to figures I saw in the intelligence
reports of the Heavenly Treasures Mountain…unexpectedly, in the
end, I still ran into one that wasn’t afraid of death.” The
black-robed Ning shook his head. “That Youngflame Xun committed
suicide; I wasn’t even able to forcibly soulscour him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In any large clan,
there will always be some who are willing to sacrifice themselves for
their clan.” Uncle White nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In total, I
soulscoured eight Primal Daoists. I’ve already acquired quite a bit
of information regarding the Easthill Commandery headquarters of the
Youngflame clan.” The black-robed Ning said, “As to how we should
deal with those formations…that’ll be up to you, Uncle White.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me think it
over.” Uncle White nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The memories of each of
the eight Primal Daoists included parts of the formations protecting
their clan’s headquarters. Ning recorded everything down onto a
jade strip, then handed it to Uncle White.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Uncle White, ruminating
through these findings, was able to come to a rough conclusion
regarding the formations around the Oldjade mountain range.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Oldjade
mountain range of the Easthill Commandery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This mountain range of
more than a million kilometers was simply too vast; the mountain
range even had some plains, lakes, and a large number of commandery
cities within them. There were very, very many commandery cities that
took up a hundred or a thousand kilometers, and a large number of
ordinary mortals resided within them. Every single city was able to
support over ten million people.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lakes, plains, rivers,
mountains…the commandery cities were located everywhere. The
Oldjade mountain range was definitely the undisputed terrain of the
Youngflame clan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch!
Patriarch!” A youth came running towards a palace at high speed.
This palace was completely composed of white jade, and it was
surrounded by a large number of beautiful maidservants. Each of these
maidservants could be described as peerless beauties. Some were so
scantily clad, they might as well be naked; one could see their bare
bodies through their gauze-like clothes. Some, however, looked like
rich noblewomen, while others looked like young maidens…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The youth cleared his
throat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These maids were
beauties which the Patriarch had found from throughout the world,
then gathered here to serve him and him alone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This Patriarch…he was
a Loose Immortal with a very special status, here in the Oldjade
mountain range. He was a Loose Immortal who had lived for more than a
million years; Immortal Windraiser. However, outsiders rarely
referred to him as ‘Immortal’; most referred to him as that ‘old
demon, Windraiser’. He truly was an evil figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” A
black-haired, black-bearded old man was currently cuddling with two
beautiful woman, seeming quite pleased and relaxed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch, Third
Uncle-Master, Third Uncle-Master, he…he…” The youth hurriedly
fell to his knees. He cried out, “Third Uncle-Master died!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Demon Windraiser’s
face instantly changed tremendously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amongst the Primal
Daoists who currently resided within the Youngflame clan’s Easthill
Commandery, the apprentice-nephew which Windraiser favored the most
was Youngflame Xun. Although Xun wasn’t his disciple, he still
viewed him with great favor! In fact, he felt that Youngflame Xun was
like a carbon copy of himself when he was young; he stooped to all
sorts of vile deeds, but was absolutely and ardently loyal to the
Youngflame clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, he was
also very talented. Thus, Old Demon Windraiser often arranged for
Youngflame Xun to handle tasks for him in the outside world; only by
experiencing dangers and trials in the outside world could one truly
grow, after all. But he didn’t expect that Xun would actually die!
As one of the important younger disciples of the clan, he had
naturally been given protective treasures…but he had still died…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn. Damn!” Old
Demon Windraiser was so angry, he gnashed his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Investigate.
Investigate!” Old Demon Windraiser bellowed with rage, “Investigate
and find out exactly how Youngflame Xun died!”

Chapter 21 - Kill!
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the mobile
Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Mu Northson,
Uncle White, and Little Qing were gathered together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That should more or
less be it.” Uncle White nodded lightly after looking once more
through at the enormous map placed before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And?” Ning,
Northson, and Little Qing were all staring at the enormous map before
them, but weren’t able to understand it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Their defenses are
airtight. There’s no flaws at all.” Uncle White sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No flaws at all?”
Ning was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Based on what you
found when you did the soulscouring…the Youngflame clan has a total
of three headquarters, each of which has more than a hundred Loose
Immortals or Earth Immortals.” Uncle White nodded. “This Easthill
Commandery alone has more than a hundred Loose Immortals or Earth
Immortals scattered around the Oldjade mountain range. They
definitely aren’t gathered in one place, where you can destroy them
with one blow. They are scattered far apart in different locations,
where they protect the countless formations that are present.
Thus…it’s extremely difficult to completely destroy the entire
Oldjade mountain range!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned. “There’s
nothing we can do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, but…the
Easthill mountain range is too big. So, there is something of a weak
point,” Uncle White said confidently. “But in truth, it isn’t
really much of a weak point.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Little Qing said
impatiently, “Uncle White, what’s the weakness? What have you
discovered?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Oldjade mountain
range is nearly a million kilometers long. For a giant formation to
cover a million kilometers…there’s no way for Loose Immortals or
Earth Immortals to activate and sustain a formation of such size,”
Uncle White said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes instantly
lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you saying…”
Ning revealed a pleased look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s a limit to
the reach of an Immortal’s elemental ki. If they are too far away
from the formation-base, they will be completely unable to control
it. For example, when we are a million kilometers away from our magic
treasures, we are similarly unable to control them,” Uncle White
said. “Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals, when controlling
formations, generally have to be within a hundred thousand kilometers
or so; that’s their limit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Oldjade
mountains are so enormous…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no way
Celestial Immortals can be constantly maintaining a formation;
naturally, they would have Loose Immortals or Earth Immortals do it
for them! From this, it is very easy to guess that they must have
divided the entire Oldjade mountain range into ten or so regions,
each of which has around ten or so Immortals that are maintaining the
formations,” Uncle White said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Oldjade mountains
were nearly a million kilometers long, but merely around a hundred
thousand kilometers in width.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are over a
hundred Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals in the Oldjade mountain
range, but only a few of them are controlling the formations,”
Uncle White said. “What we need to do is find out who is
controlling the formations. Once we kill one…for a short period of
time, the hundred thousand kilometer region under his control will be
temporarily unprotected.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…we’ll
need to be fast.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s because the
Celestial Immortals will quickly arrive. I am certain that there are
even more powerful formations within the Oldjade mountain range which
are controlled by the Celestial Immortals,” Uncle White said.
“Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals are only able to cover a
fairly small amount of territory, but Celestial Immortals are able to
control and protect the entire mountain range!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Northson, and
Little Qing all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to our
intelligence report, the Celestial Immortals of the Youngflame clan
generally don’t reside within the headquarters; they are hidden
within an unknown area. Once the clan encounters danger, they’ll
definitely hurry out to meet it,” Uncle White said. “Thus…as I
see it…we should do this…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Uncle White explained
his plain in detail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning originally had a
rough plan in mind, but now, based on what they actually faced, it
had to change.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their new plan took
form!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’ll definitely
succeed.” The nearby Little Qing was incomparably excited upon
hearing it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s make the
Youngflame clan feel regret.” Northson’s eyes were filled with
savagery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he laughed
and said softly, “Our first target will be the number one figure
amongst the Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals stationed here in the
Oldjade mountain range…that old bastard who has lived for more than
a million years…Old Demon Windraiser!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dusk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning executed the
Seventy-Two Transformations, transforming into a short, pudgy
cultivator. This short, pudgy cultivator flew atop a cloud towards
the Oldjade mountain range. He carried a talisman on him, causing the
formations around the Oldjade mountain range to leave him completely
unharmed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unfortunately, I’m
not going to be able to stealthily and silently kill Loose Immortals
or Earth Immortals within the Oldjade mountain range,” Ning mused
to himself. “Otherwise…I could ambush them one by one, wiping
them all out. Without any Loose Immortals, the entire Oldjade
mountain range would be completely defenseless for a period of time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Voidgrace.”
As the short, pudgy cultivator flew forward on his cloud, a voice
suddenly called to him from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The short, pudgy
cultivator turned to look towards the distant. A white-haired elder
was flying towards him aboard an Immortal crane. The white-haired
elder laughed and said, “Brother voidgrace, long time no see! This
old man has wanted to see you quite dearly!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You actually want to
see my treasure, right?” The short, pudgy cultivator laughed oddly.
“Don’t be impatient. This time, I came back on important
business. Next time, I’ll definitely bring the treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t forget it.”
The white-haired elder laughed merrily, then flew away atop his
Immortal crane.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The short, pudgy
cultivator watched as the white-haired elder departed, then pursed
his lips. “Old bastard. I’ll let you live a bit longer…but next
time, I’ll wipe you out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The short, pudgy
cultivator Ning had just transformed into was known as Daoist
Voidgrace. He had a belly full of bad designs, and was a sinister,
vicious man. Because he was often stationed in the outside world, he
was able to procure things that were completely forbidden to be
traded in here, such as beautiful women and children, for the
cultivators here that wanted them. Daoist Voidgrace would often
deliver beauties to his master, Old Demon Windraiser. It was
precisely because he was Windraiser’s disciple that Ning chose him
to transform into.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because he was Old
Demon Windraiser’s apprentice, Adept Voidgrace naturally found his
path unencumbered and unchallenged as he flew forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He soon arrived at that
towering palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept Voidgrace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Milord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The palace was filled
with all sorts of peerless beauties. Human beauties, Diremonster
beauties…all sorts of beauties. There were barbarian maidens, and
there were even noblewomen from the imperial clan…in short, this
was an absolute paradise of women! Old Demon Windraiser’s number
one vice was lust…and he was extremely long-lived! He had an
exceptional status in the entire clan; even the Celestial Immortal
Patriarchs viewed him as being extremely important.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heh
heh…nice…niiiiiice…” While walking over, Daoist Voidgrace
chortled merrily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where’s Master?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master is in the
Palace of the Spring Sun.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the women all
called out to him as he walked past them, after Daoist Voidgrace
left, they all revealed looks of disgust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all hated this
Daoist Voidgrace!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Demon Windraiser,
at least, could be said to be a towering, dominating figure. This
Daoist Voidgrace was nothing more than a petty man! However…Old
Demon Windraiser liked this disciple very much.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Palace of the
Spring Sun.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a palace that
was decorated in an exceedingly lavish manner. Its ceiling was
covered with pearls that had been found in the depths of the northern
seas. Its corners were decorated with violet bamboo from the southern
seas. Well water from the major world of Icesnow flowed throughout
the palace, and all sorts of precious treasures could be seen. It was
like spring had come, causing all things to bloom. The grass was
growing here, next to gurgling creeks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master,” Daoist
Voidgrace called out from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Voidgrace?” At the
front of the hall, there was a throne that was so large, it could in
truth be described as a giant bed. Old Demon Windraiser was seated
atop this bed, with two maids next to him feeding him fruit. When he
grew excited, he would pull one of them straight onto the bed and
make love to them. He glanced at Daoist Voidgrace, who walked in from
afar, then laughed and said, “My dear disciple, why have you come
to see your master today?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Demon Windraiser
liked this disciple very much. He knew, of course, that Daoist
Voidgrace was a petty man…but petty men were easily manipulated and
used.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple has a
major matter to report to you, Master,” Daoist Voidgrace said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A major matter?”
Old Demon Windraiser laughed. “What major matter?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Voidgrace was
standing before the throne. His hands suddenly swelled to more than
thirty meters long. A pair of giant palms that were large enough to
block out the sun, covered with golden light, slammed straight
towards Old Demon Windraiser.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…” Old Demon
Windraiser was shocked. His body instantly retreated backwards at
high speed. At the same time, a series of needles appeared around
him. Hundreds of needles appeared, transforming into an enormous
circular shield that moved to block. As he retreated backwards…his
billowing elemental ki caused both of the beautiful, terrified women
to be transformed into meat past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two giant golden
palms, carrying an aura of unstoppable might, moved as fast as
lightning. One of them blasted apart the shield of needles and even
shattering many of the actual needles themselves. As for the other
giant golden palm, it instantly reached the body of the fleeing
Windraiser.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“NO!” Old Demon
Windraiser didn’t even have enough time to finish using his Greater
Teleportation Dao-seal. A black light had appeared before him, but
the golden palm had already reached him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everything
disintegrated. Even Old Demon Windraiser’s body was instantly
reduced to dust. He was deader than dead!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Demon
Windraiser…had perished!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee, quick!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good heavens!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other maids in the
palace were all completely stunned and terrified. They had never
imagined that this Daoist Voidgrace, whom they had always viewed with
disdain, would suddenly strike and easily defeat the awe-inspiringly
famous legend, Old Demon Windraiser, and slay him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise!” After
instantly killing Old Demon Windraiser, Ning immediately soared into
the skies. BOOM! His powerful body was as mighty as a magic treasure;
he smashed straight through the ceiling of the Palace of the Spring
Sun, reaching the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“DESTROY!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly pulled
out an Immortal sword. It was the Thousandbull Sword. “NIGHTRIVER,
EMERGE!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A river that was ten
thousand kilometers long instantly covered this wide region, carrying
infinite power as it wildly surged forth. It must be understood that
under Ning’s control…this Nightriver had even been able to
somewhat bind and restrict the Ba-Serpent which Bloodcloud Hall had
used to try to assassinate Ning. From this, one could see how
powerful it was. Even the slightest bit of power from it could kill
an ordinary Loose Immortal or Earth Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And right now…Ning
was activating it and unleashing its full power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most importantly of
all! The formations around this area had previously been under the
control of Old Demon Windraiser; no one had ever dared to cause
trouble here, as the area within thousands of kilometers was all part
of his territory. Even beyond that range, only Primal Daoists lived
in the area. No commoners were qualified to live in this region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“SWEEP IT ALL AWAY!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nightriver was like
a watery dragon, rolling over and over, smashing apart all of the
giant mountains and breaking apart the local palaces. In fact, even
some of the formation-bases that were hidden deep within the
mountains were destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“BURROW!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The massive Nightriver
dug deep into the ground, causing the earth itself to shudder and
tremble. In almost the blink of an eye, the Nightriver had completely
overturned the earth within tens of thousands of kilometers around
them. All mountains were destroyed, while all plains were rent apart.
Every single formation-base here was annihilated…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to do as much
damage as I can, in as little time as possible. The Youngflame clan’s
counter-attack will arrive soon.” Ning understood this very well.
He immediately controlled the massive Nightriver to do more damage.
The Nightriver was simply too enormous; it was able to instantly
destroy and sweep through a region of ten thousand kilometers, and so
it was extremely suited for large-scale destruction.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Oldjade mountain
range was extremely vast, nearly a million kilometers in length; this
was comparable to an entire series of minor worlds. For example, the
minor world of ‘Earth’ merely had a circumference of around forty
thousand kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within a mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were three young
individuals walking together. One held a longstaff, the second held
an greataxe, while the third was carrying a bow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“During this trial,
we definitely must make it into the top ten of Greatape City.” The
greataxe-wielding muscular youth was filled with vigor and energy.
“Only if we make it into the top ten will we be able to participate
in the main competition that spans the entire clan. If we perform
well within the main competition, we’ll be able to receive tutelage
and assistance from the clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we miss a chance
like this, we’d have to wait another ten years. We can’t afford
to wait.” The skinny youth who was carrying the bow on his back
agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although we are at
the Xiantian level, we are still mortals…only by establishing our
Zifu can we be considered true Immortal cultivators.” The
black-robed maiden nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Youngflame clan was
far too powerful. Its population was simply enormous, and so the
internal struggles within the clan were extremely fierce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look, what’s
that?” The burly greataxe-wielding youth suddenly raised his head
and stared towards the distance with utter astonishment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A huge wave…”
The skinny youth and the black-robed maiden both stared in
astonishment as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous wave that
seemed to stretch off to infinity was crashing forward. This wave was
ten thousand kilometers long; Xiantian lifeforms naturally wouldn’t
be able to see its end. Upon seeing this massive wave that was even
higher than the entire mountain come crashing towards them, they were
completely stupefied!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the face of such
world-breaking power, these three young Xiantian individuals weren’t
able to fight back at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom boom boom boom…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The towering mountain
peaks were completely shattered and blown apart by the giant wave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t accept
this. I haven’t even become famous yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I haven’t avenged
my mother yet. I haven’t killed the governor of Greatape City!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three of them all
had their own dreams and desires.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had never even
left the Oldjade mountain range. For Xiantian lifeforms like them…the
furthest they could travel was within a few tens of thousands of
kilometers of Greatape City. Naturally…this meant that the ones
they had grudges against were also members of the Youngflame clan!
Although the top-level Youngflame clansmen, such as the Loose
Immortals and Earth Immortals, were all quite unified, at the
low-level there were many internal feuds and grudges.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was just like
China, back during Ning’s previous life on Earth. China was clearly
one country, but within that one country, there were countless
grudges and debts, loves and hatreds. Thus, once a clan expanded to a
certain level, the number of feuds within it would become tremendous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If a peerless genius
was truly produced…then when the peerless genius went to kill his
own clansmen for the sake of revenge, the high-level Earth Immortals
and Loose Immortals of the clan, and perhaps even the Celestial
Immortal Patriarchs, would help that peerless genius become famous!
This would ensure the genius’ loyalty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Youngflame clan had
quite a few evildoers within their ranks, but on the surface, at
least, the rules of the entire Youngflame clan were that the members
of their clan had to be treated kindly. Every single clansmen,
including even the most impoverished of them, would receive at least
some basic assistance to help them survive. This was to ensure that
the clansmen would understand that the clan was good to them; it was
only a few enemy clansmen within the clan who treated them poorly!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No….”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three youngsters
were unwilling to accept this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The infinitely mighty
torrent of water from the Primordial Nightriver swept forward,
roaring past them…but a strand of river water actually snaked out
in front of it, completely surrounding the three youngsters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We…” The three
youngsters were completely amazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They stared blankly at
their surroundings. They were now completely surrounded by that
strand of river water; it was as though they were in a little bubble!
This bubble of water was protecting the three of them, but outside of
it…the infinite Nightriver was wildly smashing and destroying
everything, causing mountains to crumble and the earth to shake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What sort of power
is this? This is our Youngflame clan’s territory. Who? Who is
acting against our Youngflame clan?” The three of them knew very
well that the headquarters of their clan was an extremely safe place;
there was no way a disaster like this could happen. This sort of
disaster…perhaps only the terrifying figures spoken of in legends
could cause something like this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s…” The
three of them suddenly saw a short, pudgy man who was standing high
up in midair. The figure was standing at the very center of the
infinite waves, with the aura of a Fiendgod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three of them had
the feeling that it was this short, pudgy man who was controlling
this infinite river.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I had this sort
of power…” The three of them stared at the surrounding area,
where the mountains were crumbling and the earth was breaking apart.
This terrifying scene of utter annihilation…although they felt
terror in their hearts, they also felt desire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Greatape City. One of
the many cities within the Oldjade mountain range.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a place where
mortals lived. The Youngflame clan was a tightly stratified place;
some places were meant for mortals to live in, while other places
only Immortal cultivators could venture to. The entire Greatape City
had a population of over ten million, including many Xiantian
lifeforms, as well as a few dozen Zifu Disciples and a Wanxiang Adept
who managed the city.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good heavens…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is doing this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who dares do this to
our Youngflame clan?” On the streets and in the residences of
Greatape City, the numerous denizens were staring in utter terror at
the enormous wave that was sweeping towards them from the outside.
The wave seemed to be as high as the heavens themselves. All of the
mountain ranges outside the city were instantly breaking apart, and
the earth itself was shuddering and shaking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wave instantly
swept over this city.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…a strand of the
water of the Nightriver moved to completely cover it, causing the
entire city to be protected with a ‘water globe’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one viewed things
from Ning’s standpoint, a city like Greatape City was as
unimportant as a toy. Protected by the bubble, it began to sink down
into the Nightriver.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since he was
young, Ji Ning had been trained by his father to go and kill others.
In his youth, he had adventured in the world and engaged in many
battles. He naturally wouldn’t show any mercy or soft-heartedness
to his enemies in the Youngflame clan. However…those people before
him were merely ordinary mortals. When Immortal cultivators killed
mortals, they would incur an enormous amount of sin. His Celestial
Tribulation would most likely be quite difficult; if he was to kill
so many mortals at a time like this, the amount of sin that would
swirl around him would most likely reach and utterly terrifying
level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition…no matter
how much hatred Ning felt, he had his limits.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, when he
took revenge for Spring Grass all those years ago, Ning had
slaughtered River He, but had spared his son.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was the same
principle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s pride forbade
him slaughtering the countless ordinary mortals of the Youngflame
clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Will these mortals
eventually become Immortal cultivators? Would they become powerful
experts, one day?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Let them come! They can
come as they please!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If they are able to
kill me, Ji Ning, then I have no one to blame but myself!
However…once they act against me, I definitely will show no mercy!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Fiendgod.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An Immortal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good heavens.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless ordinary
mortals of the Youngflame clan had escaped this disaster unscathed.
They kept their heads raised, watching everything unfold. Upon seeing
the short, pudgy man who was commanding the waters of the river, they
were filled with the utmost of terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After killing Old Demon
Windraiser, Ning had immediately begun to destroy the surrounding
area, shattering all of the foundation-bases. When he made his move,
he had Uncle White, Little Qing, and Mu Northson go to Old Demon
Windraiser’s palace. Although the palace had been badly damaged,
Uncle White immediately began to lay down formations here. The first
thing he did was instantly set up a trapping formation that was ten
thousand kilometers in length…and next, he began to add layers of
even more formidable formations!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had spared no
expense on this trip. He had bought quite a few unique treasures from
the Heavenly Treasures Mountain, and the expense was no less than the
amount he had spent to set up formations for Swallow Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, because Uncle
White wouldn’t have enough time to set up the formation…Uncle
White had chosen formations that could be established in a very short
period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although these
formations were inferior to those three supremely savage formations
of Swallow Mountain, Uncle White’s scheme still involved setting up
ninety-two mighty formations, all of which were within the ten
thousand kilometer area. If one didn’t include the three supremely
savage formations, not even the formations layout of Swallow Mountain
was this insane!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, flee.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t kill the
mortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…Ning showed
no mercy to the Immortal cultivators. After destroying many of the
formation-bases, their side was now able to use void blinks to engage
in spatial teleportations! Some Immortal cultivators were fleeing in
panic, but most were swept up by the Nightriver. Ning certainly
didn’t have the inclination to go and protect those Immortal
cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill, kill, KILL!”
Mu Northson was the most savage of all. He was actually the first to
charge out of Uncle White’s formations. Commanding the Winged
Immortal golem, he unleashed the Seven Ruinous Thunderwinds to wildly
kill all before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Primal Daoists?
Wanxiang Adepts? Zifu Disciples?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All members of the
Youngflame clan were to die!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing this, Ning
couldn’t help but secretly sigh to himself…but he didn’t move
to stop him. “If Cousin was here, she would also probably act in
such a crazed manner. Still…I can’t let junior apprentice-brother
kill too many. Sin is already beginning to accumulate around him.”
Ning’s divine sense had previously seen that the amount of karmic
sin and karmic virtue around Northson was ordinary, but now…a
corrosive aura of sin was slowly beginning to manifest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that very, very little sin would accrue from the killing of Immortal
cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Northson was
simply far too powerful. What he was engaging in was sheer butchery,
and so there would still be the accrual of some sin. In addition,
given that he was killing so many…the amount of sin surrounding him
had increased by quite a bit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother is weak. If he accrues too much sin…” Ning
willed it, and the waters of the Nightriver became even more
ferocious. In fact, they began to intentionally sweep towards the
groups of fleeing Immortal cultivators, causing many of them to
perish. Ning had always been surrounded by the golden light of karmic
virtue, albeit just a little bit. Still, he clearly had reached that
level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that Ning was
controlling the Nightriver to attack, however…the aura of golden
karmic virtue around Ning began to slowly weaken…before eventually
transforming into a mere fresh aura of virtue!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The density and range
of that fresh aura of virtue was beginning to drop as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill, kill, kill…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hatred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The baleful auras of
the slain Immortal cultivators began to swirl around Ning, causing
the three Darknorth swords in Ning’s body to absorb them and
transform them. When Ning had slaughtered many Earth Immortals and
Loose Immortals during his battle at the Eastwoods mountain range,
the Darknorth swords had reached a level of power that was comparable
to that of top-grade Immortal-ranked flying swords. This time, he
killed even more Immortal cultivators! However, they were all very
weak, and so the amount of baleful aura Ning absorbed from them was
even less than the amount he had absorbed from the bronze-armored
Fiendguards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…there was a
significant drop in Ning’s karmic virtue as he continued to butcher
so many Immortal cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where are they?
Where’d they go?!” Northson suddenly discovered that there were
no more targets near him. Suddenly…he saw a commandery city in the
distance, a city which Ning had protected and spared with the
Nightriver. A city with many ordinary mortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson’s eyes were
completely bloodshot. He was in a completely berserk mode; he
couldn’t even differentiate between mortals and Immortal
cultivators right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He immediately flew
out, planning to continue the slaughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, those are mortals! Mortals!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So what if they
are?! Every member of the Youngflame clan deserves to die!”
Northson was utterly berserk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning roared back
angrily, “If you kill them, karmic sinflames will descend and you
will die as well!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning killed Old
Demon Windraiser and destroyed the local formation-bases, the many
Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals in the surrounding areas of the
Oldjade mountains had noticed it. They had all activated their own
formations, at least ensuring that they could protect their parts of
the Oldjade mountain range. The hundred thousand kilometer region
that had been controlled by Old Demon Windraiser, however, was
completely unprotected. They didn’t have a chance to do anything;
the formation-bases had all been destroyed, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Loose Immortals and
Earth Immortals were all hovering in midair within the range of their
formations, staring at the distant short, pudgy man who was
controlling the Nightriver to destroy the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To act with such
madness…it must be Ji Ning. As for that person who is releasing the
Seven Ruinous Thunderwinds, it must be that ‘Mu Northson’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack. Let’s
attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are we just going to
sit here and wait?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the Loose
Immortals were enraged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Patriarchs have
already instructed that if Ji Ning comes, we are forbidden from
engaging him. We need to protect the clan as best as we can, while
everything else will be left to them. I’ve already shattered the
talisman; I trust that the Celestial Immortal Patriarchs will soon
arrive,” a green-haired Immortal said in a low voice.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The western sea. The
Seamless Gate’s gathering spot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the grand
palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The barefoot,
loose-haired Celestial Immortal Blackheaven and Celestial Immortal
Violetgrass were seated shoulder-to-shoulder at the front of the
palace. Many other Celestial Immortals were also seated before them.
They were all staring at an enormous mirror within the palace; this
mirror was currently reflecting the scenes from the Oldjade mountain
range of Easthill Commandery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve been
searching for a chance to capture this Ji Ning, but who would’ve
imagined that he’d go gallivanting off into the Youngflame clan’s
base?” Celestial Immortal Blackheaven sat there, scratching his
foot as he chortled, “It seems as though I won’t be forced to
personally handle this puny little Ji Ning after all; the Youngflame
clan will be more than enough to deal with him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Will the Youngflame
clan be able to get it done? Last time, they were intent on handling
him but ended up failing,” the nearby Violetgrass said with a
frown.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The top ten clans of
the Grand Xia Dynasty are all extremely powerful.” Blackheaven
nodded. “If the Youngflame clan truly was willing to use their full
power, going so far as to spare no expenses and even take out their
trump card that is meant to only be used when the entire clan is at a
critical juncture between life and death…they would definitely be
able to suppress a young fellow like him, who isn’t even a
Celestial Immortal, despite the fact that he has trained in the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Violetgrass
was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just watch and see.”
Blackheaven was extremely confident.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within an ancient
tower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortals
Arcanum, Goldclock, Deadwood, Sunfish, and Infatuation were all
gathered here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s something
happening at the Easthill Commandery. They’ve asked us for help.”
The five Celestial Immortals all sensed it right away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At a time like this,
the Kindwater clan and the other clans wouldn’t be so foolish as to
start a war against us. In addition, the foundation of any clan is
their force of Celestial Immortals; killing Immortal cultivators and
mortals of our clan makes no difference at all in that regard. Only
Ji Ning, who has suffered our assaults and pursuit, would explode
forth to take vengeance in this manner.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It must be Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no
question about it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum and
the others guessed it right away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because they had gone
to act against Ji Ning, with the intention of not letting him
continue to live…Ji Ning himself would definitely reveal his own
fangs and launch his own counter-attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve been waiting
for him to make his move. For him to attack our territory is
equivalent to throwing himself into our hands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Flamefish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Flamefish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Goldclock and Celestial Immortal Infatuation both called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their voices
transmitted to a completely different space. Moments later, a black
foggy door appeared next to them, from which flew out a man. It was a
man with unkempt red hair and who had some fish scales on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Flamefish,”
Celestial Immortal Infatuation said with a smile, “This time, we’ll
have to ask you to maintain control over the grand formation to take
care of Ji Ning. The rest of us will coordinate with you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three Realms are
currently in a state of turmoil, and so Master is busy with important
matters,” Celestial Immortal Flamefish said in a low voice. “A
puny little Ji Ning has already set back our Youngflame clan multiple
times; this is an insult to our Youngflame clan! This time, we must
succeed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are all aware.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each of the others
hastened to assent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Flamefish nodded. “Fine. Per our previous discussions…myself,
Infatuation, Deadwood, Goldclock, and Sunfish shall join forces. We
shall activate and execute the ‘Lesser-Yin Fiendtamer Formation’
to trap Ji Ning. Then, we shall capture him into the divine
greatclock and keep him suppressed within it.” 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With you taking
charge, Brother Flamefish, we shall naturally succeed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arcanum, you stand
guard here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, Celestial
Immortals Flamefish, Infatuation, Deadwood, Goldclock, and Sunfish
all departed via a void blink as they headed towards Easthill
Commandery’s Oldjade mountain range.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the air above the
eastern seas, a spatial rift appeared, followed by the emergence of a
white-haired, white-bearded elder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t expect
that my true body would be destroyed in a single exchange.” The
white-haired, white-bearded elder thought back to what he had seen,
to that terrifying palm that had slammed him to death with one blow.
“It seems he transformed into Daoist Voidgrace’s appearance to
deceive me…it must be that Ji Ning which the Celestial Immortal
Patriarchs spoke of.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This person was Old
Demon Windraiser’s Primaltwin!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Demon Windraiser
was extremely powerful; his true body stood guard over his part of
the Oldjade mountain range, enjoying luxury, while his Primaltwin
roamed the Three Realms, causing his power to grow even greater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had lived for over a
million years, yet was still alive. In fact, the Three Calamities and
Nine Tribulations which he had faced didn’t pose too much of a
threat to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, eh?” A
fierce light flashed through Old Demon Windraiser’s eyes. “You
destroyed my true body…do you think I’ll just let you off?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Old Demon
Windraiser immediately used a void teleport to once more go to the
Oldjade mountain range. He was naturally very familiar with the area,
and he quickly passed through the layers of formations, arriving at a
place where the other Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals were
congregating.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Windraiser.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Windraiser.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other Immortals all
addressed him with great courtesy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Demon Windraiser
said hurriedly, “I’m ashamed. Ashamed! Ji Ning suddenly attacked,
causing my true body to be destroyed in a single clash.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It isn’t your
fault, brother Windraiser. Ji Ning is extremely powerful; even the
Celestial Immortal Patriarchs gave us strict orders against engaging
him. For him to be able to kill even someone as strong as you in a
single clash…most likely, even if all of us joined forces against
him, we would still end up dying. I really wonder what the hell this
Ji Ning’s training method is,” a green-haired Immortal said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let him be smug for
now. When the Patriarchs arrive…that will be the moment of his
demise.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Patriarchs just
appeared!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Loose Immortals and
Earth Immortals could all sense the spatial ripples. Raising their
heads to look, they saw five figures appear in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five Celestial
Immortal Patriarchs?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Youngflame clan
actually has five Celestial Immortal Patriarchs?” These Loose
Immortals and Earth Immortals were incomparably excited. The exact
number of Celestial Immortals a clan had was a tightly guarded
secret! Prior to this, even the current Godplume Duke, the leader of
their clan, only knew of three of them…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A full five
Celestial Immortal Patriarchs are making their move. This Ji Ning is
dead for sure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them waited
eagerly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Loose Immortals and
Earth Immortals only dared to remain in hiding behind the formations.
As far as Ning was concerned, they were nothing more than dancing,
prancing clowns; he wasn’t worried about them at all. Controlling
his massive Nightriver, he continued to cause destruction everywhere.
If he was using a magic treasure, he would most likely only be able
to destroy around a hundred kilometers or so of land at once, but
with the ten thousand kilometer Nightriver at his disposal, he was
able to cause devastation on a much wider scale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thankfully, I have
the Thousandbull Sword…otherwise, this plan wouldn’t be
feasible.” Ning was causing havoc at an extremely fast speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mountains continued to
shatter, and the earth continued to break apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, some
lesser mountain peaks that had been fashioned into formation-bases
were pushed away by the Nightriver but did not break apart. The
Nightriver was able to discover many formation-bases, all of which
Ning retrieved and collected. A grand formation could be destroyed
for the lack of a single formation-base. Ning didn’t even know how
many formation-bases he collected; most likely, it would be extremely
hard for the grand formations to be set up within this hundred
thousand kilometer region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“BOOM!” After a
stone disc that was more than three hundred meters long was pulled
up…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? This is…”
Ning’s face changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, his divine
sense had only been able to discover some ordinary rocks and dirt
underground. Everything seemed normal. But after that stone disc was
pulled away…the scene below the ground completely changed! Clearly,
there was a permanent formation stationed underground that could
deceive both divine sense and coresense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s divine sense
could clearly see…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That there was an
enormous, fiery red copper pillar buried deep within the earth,
nearly three hundred meters thick and much more than a thousand
kilometers in length. Because this fiery copper pillar was buried far
too deep, Ning’s divine sense was only able to discover a portion
of this pillar. The portion that he was able to discover, however,
was already more than a thousand kilometers in length!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fiery copper pillar
was covered with an enormous number of runes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now…what’s
this?” Ning could sense that this was definitely an extraordinary
object. When his divine sense touched it, he couldn’t help but feel
his heart clench.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning suddenly
raised his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five figures suddenly
appeared in the air far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could no longer
spare any time on analyzing the fiery copper pillar. “This fiery
copper pillar has been buried underground this entire time, without
being taken away. There’s most likely no way to actually take it
away! It’s been buried here for who knows how long. There’s no
rush for me to investigate it…after I kill these bastards of the
Youngflame clan, I’ll come back and secretly investigate the
secrets of this fiery copper pillar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the five Celestial
Immortals appeared, Ning immediately ceased causing havoc. He
immediately used a void blink to instantly teleport to the location
where Old Demon Windraiser’s Palace of the Spring Sun was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson returned to
that location as well. The Immortal cultivators were all dead by now.
As for the mortals? With Ning blocking him, he finally relented. Next
to him was Uncle White and Little Qing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White, how is
it?” Ning lowered his head, looking at Uncle White, who was in the
shape of a large, snowy-white dog.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already
finished setting up seventy-one formations,” Uncle White sent
spiritually. “Although I haven’t managed to finish setting up all
the formations, these seventy-one…should be more than enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Ning sent
mentally, “Wait for the five Celestial Immortals to enter the
formation, then activate it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had already
transformed into his usual appearance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The appearance of the
Winged Immortal golem guaranteed that there would be no way for him
to hide himself this time. In addition, he had already accomplished
his goal; he had completely wiped out the entire ‘safe region’
within a hundred thousand kilometers. There was no need at all for
him to hide himself anymore.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the shattered
rubble, Ning stood alone. Behind him was the Winged Immortal golem, a
large snowy-white hound, and an Azure Skysnake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dogshit Celestial
Immortals of the Youngflame clan!” Ning raised his head, laughing
loudly. “Don’t you want to kill me? First you invited Bloodcloud
Hall to assassinate me, and then you had four of your Celestial
Immortals ambush me. Alas…you are completely useless!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Four mighty
Celestial Immortals ambushed Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Loose Immortals and
Earth Immortals who were hidden within the distant formations were
all extremely shocked. In their hearts, they viewed their Celestial
Immortal Patriarchs as lofty, exalted figures; four of them had
ambushed Ji Ning, but had been unable to kill him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Standing amidst the
other Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals, Old Demon Windraiser just
narrowed his eyes, watching silently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since you desire to
kill me so badly…I thought I’d satisfy your desire. I’ve come
here, to the territory of your Youngflame clan.” Ning’s voice
boomed out, filled with elemental ki as it spread in every direction.
Even the countless mortals in the area could hear his voice. “I, Ji
Ning, am right now. Dogshit Celestial Immortals of the Youngflame
clan, come and kill me if you can! Ahaha, but you’d best be
careful. You want to kill me, but I want to kill you too. Be wary,
lest I end up slaughtering all five of you. Ahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s laughter rang
out, booming in every direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Did he just say,
‘dogshit Celestial Immortals of the Youngflame clan’?”
Countless mortals were completely stunned by what they had just
heard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who would dare speak
of Celestial Immortals in such a way?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To mortals, Celestial
Immortals were truly unfathomably exalted figures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was rare for the
entire Grand Xia Dynasty to see the birth of even just a single new
Celestial Immortals over the course of a million years. How exalted
they were! But this person actually held Celestial Immortals in
complete disregard…and even dared to challenge five Celestial
Immortals by himself?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">‘Be wary, lest I end
up slaughtering all five of you!’ These words were far too
dominating!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless ordinary
mortals who heard this felt stunned…and they also felt awe and
admiration.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Will there ever be
the day when I, too, would dare speak to Celestial Immortals in such
a manner?” The many young men and women of the Youngflame clan knew
that this ‘Ji Ning’ was their enemy, their foe…but they still
couldn’t help but feel envy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there atop
the rubble, calling out and cursing with abandon. He was waiting.
Waiting for his foes to attack! Ordinary attacks using magic
treasures couldn’t possibly be launched from so many thousands of
kilometers away. If they wanted to kill him, they’d have to move
closer to him! And once they moved into attack range…they would
definitely be within the formation region which Uncle White had set
up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The formation region
spanned ten thousand kilometers; once it was activated, the entire
area within ten thousand kilometers would fall under his control!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although this was the
Youngflame clan’s headquarters…it would also be as if this was
Ning’s own fiefdom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come! Come! Attack,
you dogshit Celestial Immortals! What, are you afraid of death?”
Ning laughed wildly with abandon. And indeed…Fiendgods had
extremely loud voices.
</P>

Chapter 24 - The Shaoyin Fiendtamer Formation
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">High in the air were
Celestial Immortals Flamefish, Infatuation, Sunfish, Deadwood, and
Goldclock. They stared downwards at the distant youth atop the
rubble, each of them filled with rage. This was the headquarters of
the Youngflame clan…but now, a region of a hundred thousand
kilometers had been completely reduced to rubble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The kid is quite
brash.” Celestial Immortal Sunfish was so angry, he actually
started to laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning…the
Netherworld’s gates were barred, but you insisted on barging in!”
Celestial Immortal Infatuation’s voice was utterly freezing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five mighty
Celestial Immortals were filled with murderous intent. All of them
wanted to kill Ning right away! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
Swoosh! Their five figures joined together, transforming into a
five-colored mountain peak that left behind a scar in the skies as
they charged straight for Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, seeing this, felt
a surge of joy in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They really had
entered!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, this was
something of an obvious ploy, one they were forced to ‘fall’
for.. Ning was standing there in the middle of the ruins of
Youngflame clan’s headquarters, calling them out. Were the
Celestial Immortals of the Youngflame clan just supposed to stand
there and watch? They would probably becoming the laughingstocks of
the entire Grand Xia Dynasty! In addition…if they wanted to attack
Ning, they had to draw closer to him, into the range of their magical
artifact attacks. That meant they had to go within ten thousand
kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White,
activate the grand formation,” Ning sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Uncle
White had been waiting this entire time. The five Celestial
Immortals, in the form of the five-colored mountain peak, were
already less than a thousand kilometers away from Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the borders of the
region within ten thousand kilometers of Ning, three pillars of light
suddenly soared into the heavens. Many other formation-bases began to
fire off as well, but they were comparatively smaller in terms of the
disturbance caused. In the blink of an eye, the entire region around
Ning became completely trapped within a series of giant blurry
formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t see
anything over there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Loose
Immortals and Earth Immortals hiding within their formations were
startled. Old Demon Windraiser, however, said: “No need to worry.
Given the abilities of the five Patriarchs, how can they possibly be
concerned with these sorts of puny formations?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five Celestial
Immortals weren’t worried at all. They had expected all along that
Ji Ning had most likely set up formations within the area. Despite
that, however…they had still charged in! They didn’t have a
choice; there was no way they could continue to let Ji Ning act so
wantonly within their headquarters. In addition…they felt certain
that any formations he was able to set up within such a short period
of time couldn’t be too frightening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It made sense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even though Uncle White
was a grandmaster in formations, there was no way he would be able to
set up the likes of the three great killing formations of Swallow
Mountain within a very short period of time. He had to rely on the
fact that they had prepared an enormous amount of precious materials
in order to set up many formations that were able to threaten
Celestial Immortals. They would win through quantity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Coresense is unable
to investigate this area.” Celestial Immortal Goldclock swept the
area with his gaze while trying to use his coresense to investigate,
but still was unable to discover anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems that Ji
NIng has an extremely formidable formations expert as his assistant.”
Celestial Immortal Infatuation was quite calm. “However, all
formations have their weak spots. I trust that the formations he was
able to set up within such a short period of time couldn’t possibly
be too profound. No rush; let’s take it slow, step by step. Let’s
just ensure that Ji Ning doesn’t have any chance at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Infatuation speaks
truly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The area around the
five of them had become transformed into an enormous, five-colored
mountain peak. The mountain peak forced the fog away from them,
allowing their field of vision to expand to many hundreds of meters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are within the
formation.” Ning, Northson, Uncle White, and Little Qing were all
standing together. Ning had a smile on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These five Celestial
Immortals are currently using the Five Elements Mountainhold
Formation,” Uncle White said. “This is a protective formation
that is fairly widespread in the Three Realms; five individuals join
together, increasing their defensive power by a tremendous amount. If
we only rely on the power of this formation…it will be very
difficult to do anything to them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “I have
no intentions of relying on the formation to kill them. The formation
is just meant to help support us! Now that they are trapped inside,
they’ll be unable to use their coresense to investigate, while they
can only rely on their eyes to see to a distance of hundreds of
meters! I can attack when I please and retreat when I please;
everything will be under my control. This has already increased my
odds of success by quite a few percentage points.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you need my
help?” Northson couldn’t help but ask. He was unable to disguise
his desire to kill, and the murderous look in his eyes. It had been
Celestial Immortals Infatuation, Goldclock, Arcanum, and Deadwood who
had destroyed the soul of his beloved…and three of those four
mighty Celestial Immortals were currently present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hide inside the
formations; you are not to draw near us. However, you can release the
Seven Ruinous Thunderwinds,” Ning said with a laugh. “No need to
worry about hitting me; the Thunderwinds are completely incapable of
damaging me. They will, however, pose some degree of danger to those
five.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Northson
began to wait eagerly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed, then
looked towards the five distant Celestial Immortals. “Celestial
Immortals, to the Youngflame clan, are their real foundation and
source of power, right? If I were to kill a few…the Youngflame clan
would definitely feel heartache and regret!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning instantly
transformed into a streak of light, charging forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five Celestial
Immortals remained quite calm. They continued to maintain their Five
Elements Mountainhold Formation while carefully investigating the
nearby formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This formation is
quite extraordinary.” Celestial Immortal Infatuation began to frown
after doing a cursory inspection of the surrounding area. “To
defeat it…it isn’t something that we can do in just a day or
two.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then what should we
do?” Celestial Immortal Goldclock asked impatiently, “The more we
delay, the more powers within the Grand Xia Dynasty will know of this
matter. Our Youngflame clan will have truly lost face, then!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No time to worry
about face right now; if we can kill Ji Ning, it will all have been
worth it,” Celestial Immortal Infatuation said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be
impatient.” Celestial Immortal Flamefish chortled, stroking his
long beard. “Ji Ning set down these formations, then acted so
brashly towards us, all because he wanted us to enter this region.
After we do so…he’ll naturally come to attack us. If not, we
could all simply leave by using Greater Teleportation Dao-seals. All
we need to do is wait. Ji Ning will quickly come to attack us. By
then, we can use our Shaoyin Fiendtamer Formation to capture him and
suppress him. That’s all there is to it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That makes sense.”
Celestial Immortal Sunfish laughed coldly. “The moment he attacks
is the moment of his capture. After we capture him, we’ll use
Greater Teleportation Dao-seals to leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five mighty
Celestial Immortals continued to fly forward, investigating the
surrounding area while waiting for Ji Ning’s arrival.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A golden hand, fingers
formed into the shape of a sword, came chopping out through the mist
up ahead. It moved as fast as lightning, instantly arriving before
the five Celestial Immortals. The golden sword-fingers were at least
three hundred meters long, like the fingers of a true divinity. They
carried an unstoppably fierce sword-aura, and with a booming sound
stabbed straight into the five-colored mountain peak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five-colored
mountain peak trembled violently, almost at the point of shattering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s do it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five mighty
Celestial Immortals were all shocked. They didn’t expect that
Ning’s very first attack would nearly collapse their defensive
formation. All of them immediately began to activate their Immortal
energy, quickly stabilizing the five-colored mountain peak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You WILL break for
me!” A youth suddenly appeared, with three heads and six arms. His
six arms chopped through the air, his enormous palms all formed into
sword-fingers and being used like swords! These sword-fingers were so
powerful, they definitely were not any weaker than the Thousandbull
Sword and other Immortal swords of its class.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang! Six powerful sword-fingers struck towards the five
Celestial Immortals in a frenzy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formation!” The
scale-faced Celestial Immortal Flamefish let out a loud roar. A black
set of chains instantly appeared within his hands. The black chains
rapidly grew longer, stretching out to more than three thousand
meters. Moments later, the other Celestial Immortals also manifested
sets of black chains within their hands as well. There were a total
of five black chains, each of which looked absolutely identical…but
in truth, the aura of each was completely different.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“FIENDTAMER!”
Celestial Immortal Flamefish roared angrily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang clang clang…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five enormous black
chains were like five tentacles that stretched out from some
abomination. They covered the skies as they flew forward to entangle
Ning. In fact, the five chains even had circles of water that swirled
around them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s this?”
Ning was startled. He didn’t dare to be rash, and so he immediately
swept out with a palm. The palm rapidly expanded in size to become
more than three hundred meters long as it smashed against the thick
black chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden palm
collided head-on with the black chains. The powerful collision caused
even Ning to be forced three steps back, and each step he took caused
the earth beneath him to break apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Capture him!”
Celestial Immortals Infatuation, Flamefish, Goldclock, Deadwood, and
Sunfish’s eyes were filled with eagerness. The other chains came
sweeping towards Ning as well. The chains themselves were magic
treasures, and when joined together their power would become even
more formidable. In addition, they could twist and turn on
themselves, changing their appearance and form. Once one was captured
by them, it would be extremely difficult to break free.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the Fiendgod
Era, the Youngflame clan would often use this Shaoyin Fiendtamer
Formation to capture some particularly powerful Void-level Fiendgods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Void-level Fiendgods
varied in power; some had very high levels of comprehension and were
completely comparable to the likes of Celestial Immortal Goldclock or
Celestial Immortal Deadwood in power. To capture them, one would have
to use an extremely powerful method…and it was this very method
that the Youngflame clan was now bringing out once more. This time,
to capture Ji Ning! To suppress Ji Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning swung his palms,
hurriedly knocking back the black chains in succession. His face
changed. “What queer chains. When I strike them, they sometimes
actually attempt to slip past my hands to try and entangle me. They
are magic treasures…but they are quite fast when dodging. If I’m
not careful, I’ll end up bound by them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems I’ll
still have to rely on the power of my magic treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Thousandbull Sword
suddenly appeared above Ning’s head. Ning let out a loud shout.
“NIGHTRIVER, COME FORTH!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Under Ning’s control,
the ten thousand kilometer Nightriver shrank to a size of merely ten
kilometers. This ten kilometer Nightriver was like an enormous snake
that swirled around him, entangling all things in the surrounding
area. Those five black chains naturally were completely entangled by
the Nightriver’s waters as well. As the saying goes, when a blade
cuts through water, the water will continue to flow; something like
the Nightriver was extremely troublesome to deal with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Bloodcloud Hall
had used the Ba-Serpent Formation in their assassination attempt,
they had found the Nightriver’s entanglement to be quite
irritating. Although these five chains were somewhat more powerful,
they were still entangled and affected, causing their agility and
speed to lessen dramatically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha!” Ning,
however, was as unencumbered as a fish in water. The five chains,
with their lessened agility, were no match for him at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His palms would strike
out!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His sword-fingers would
blast forth!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five chains were
knocked all over the place, and even the five-colored mountain peak
began to tremble. The faces of all of the Celestial Immortals inside
began to change.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hold.” The five
mighty Celestial Immortals instantly began to release an even-greater
torrent of their Immortal energy. They began to spend more of their
efforts on defense, and a large number of runes began to appear on
the surface of the five-colored mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why is this Ji Ning
so much more powerful than you originally described?” Celestial
Immortal Flamefish said with surprise and anger. “How is it that
he’s able to so easily resist the Shaoyin Fiendtamer Formation?
Infatuation, didn’t you say that he was a bit weaker than Goldclock
and Deadwood?!”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How should I know?!”
Celestial Immortal Infatuation was frantic as well. “The last time
we fought with him was just half a month ago. How could I have
imagined that his power would suddenly rise by so much?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Last time, he wasn’t
even as strong as me.” Celestial Immortal Deadwood nodded. “But
this time, he’s able to completely shut down even the Shaoyin
Fiendtamer Formation. His power has already completely eclipsed that
of myself and Goldclock.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Although
Celestial Immortal Goldclock didn’t wish to admit it, the reality
of the matter was laid bare before them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although their clash
had been brief, the five mighty Celestial Immortals had all
discovered that Ji Ning’s power was much greater than they had
anticipated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Shaoyin Fiendtamer
Formation was indeed very well-suited for capturing foes! Back during
the Fiendgod Era, it had been specially designed for capturing
Fiendgods; it was indeed quite well-suited for dealing with Ji Ning.
But to actually ‘capture’ him…that required the capturing party
be able to completely suppress the target in terms of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Last time, if these
five Celestial Immortals had known that Ji Ning trained in the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art], they would’ve invited Celestial Immortal
Flamefish to come on that attempt as well. They would’ve succeeded
long ago through their usage of the Shaoyin Fiendtamer Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But this time…Ning
had reached the Fifth Cycle of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] and the
Fourth Cycle of the [Starseizing Hand]. His power was clearly on a
significantly higher level! He had vaulted from being weaker than
Celestial Immortals Deadwood and Goldclock to being more powerful
than them! This sudden surge in strength made it so that the Shaoyin
Fiendtamer Formation was completely unable to capture Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break for me!”
Ning was wildly assaulting the five-colored mountain peak. In turn,
the five mighty Celestial Immortals were striving to maintain their
defensive formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re actually
being completely held down and beaten upon by him.” Celestial
Immortal Goldclock ground his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s become even
more powerful, and he has the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] protecting him;
he doesn’t even need to defend. All of us are merely Ki Refiners;
once he strikes us with his body, we’ll transform into dust,”
Celestial Immortal Deadwood said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh.” Celestial
Immortal Sunfish was enraged as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Eight-Nine Arcane
Art] was truly a pain in the neck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
Fiendgods didn’t dare to accept blows from magic treasures head-on.
But those who trained in the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] were absolutely
able to do so!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should we do?”
Celestial Immortal Flamefish looked at the other four. “What should
we do? Just wait here?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How about…let’s
leave for now, using a Greater Teleportation Dao-seal to depart,”
Celestial Immortal Goldclock said. Although they were at a
disadvantage, through working together, the five of them were indeed
able to flee when they pleased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Infatuation snorted coldly, “Ji Ning is currently hiding within
this great formation; if we want to deal with him, we’ll have to
enter it. Since we’ve already entered it…why should we be in a
rush to leave it? This time, Ji Ning has attacked the headquarters of
our Youngflame clan…and so, the Youngflame clan absolutely must
capture Ji Ning. This time, either our Youngflame clan lowers our
heads to admit defeat, or Ji Ning admits defeat! From the moment that
Ji Ning came to our headquarters, both our sides lost all other
options; one side has to admit defeat!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can’t admit
defeat,” Celestial Immortal Sunfish said in a low voice. “There
is no way our Youngflame clan can admit defeat to Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus…I am
preparing to notify the Ancestor. I will let the Ancestor make the
decision,” Celestial Immortal Infatuation sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are notifying
Master?” Celestial Immortal Flamefish was startled…but then he
nodded lightly. “Given the current situation, the only option we
have is to ask Master to decide.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Notify the
Ancestor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I concur.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortals
Goldclock, Sunfish, and Deadwood all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already
instructed my spirit-beast to go find Arcanum. Arcanum will
immediately notify the Ancestor,” Celestial Immortal Infatuation
said. Although they were very far away from each other, since he was
a Celestial Immortal, he was similarly able to communicate
spiritually with his spirit-beast at a tremendous distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
attack wildly, but was unable to break through the defenses of the
five Celestial Immortals. The Seven Ruinous Thunderwinds were wildly
attacking as well, and Uncle White even summoned the power of the
formation to generate rays of magnetic lances of light to attack…but
they were still unable to break the defenses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s like a
turtle-shell.” Ning was forced to temporarily give up, unwilling
though he was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning returned to Uncle
White, Little Qing, and Northson’s sides.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, the defenses
of these five Celestial Immortals are far too powerful. There’s no
way to break through at all. What should we do next?” Little Qing
asked with worry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What can we do?
Wait.” Ning shook his head and sighed. “Celestial Immortals are
Celestial Immortals, after all; last time, when they attacked me en
masse, I was at a disadvantage. This time, I’ve grown stronger and
have the upper hand…but when faced with all five of them, I still
find it extremely hard to actually defeat them. To kill a Celestial
Immortal is no easy task.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning then laughed.
“However, I never believed that I had the power to simply dominate
Celestial Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, you…?” Northson was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.” Ning laughed. “The situation for us,
compared to the situation for the Youngflame clan, is completely
different. We’ve attacked their headquarters, and have even erected
a massive, mighty formation within their headquarters. We’re
resting and relaxing here, completely carefree! Given how widespread
the intelligence networks of the world of the Grand Xia are, the
various major powers will quickly learn of this matter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Every day we spend
here is a day where the Youngflame clan will be losing face.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we can spend half
a year or a year relaxing here, with the Youngflame clan completely
unable to do anything to us, and being forced to just watch us leave
at our leisure eventually…the Youngflame clan will turn into a huge
joke for the rest of the world!” Ning said, “The Youngflame clan
definitely won’t permit this to happen. They’ll definitely come
up with a method to deal with me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If they want to
continue hiding like a turtle in its shell, there’s nothing I can
do about that, of course.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But if they want to
kill me…they’ll have to take some risks. They’ll have to enter
the formation and actively attack me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“By attacking me,
they’ll be taking risks…and if I can seize the right opportunity,
I can kill one of their Celestial Immortals,” Ning said with a
laugh. “Once I kill the first one, I’ll have an even better
chance of killing the second one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This time…I intend
to drag this out with the Youngflame clan as long as I can.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Battles at the
Celestial Immortal level could drag on for many, many years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had that intention
as well; to drag this out as long as possible. If he could drag this
out for a year, he would cause the clansmen of the Youngflame clan to
all feel nervous and restless. So long as the Youngflame clan made a
single misstep, or so long as a single Celestial Immortal
overextended himself…then Ning’s chance would come.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White, every
so often, use the formation to assault them. Keep them nervous and
force them to keep their formations activated,” Ning suddenly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you are…?”
Uncle White was startled. “Are you planning to take a rest?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” Ning shook
his head and smiled. “I just thought of a big rod.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A rod?” They were
all puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going to leave
the formation to take a look. I’ll be back soon,” Ning said with
a laugh. “Uncle White, you must be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry.”
Uncle White nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, what sort of
a rod are you going to go look at?” Little Qing asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A copper one.”
After speaking, Ning quickly departed. He stealthily slipped out of
the grand formation, then used a void blink to go deep underground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew very well
that this battle with the Youngflame clan would most likely be an
extremely long once. Since he wouldn’t be able to kill those five
Celestial Immortals for now…he might as well make a trip to check
out that mysterious underground copper ‘rod’! That enormous
copper pillar…immediately after Ning had discovered it, the five
mighty Celestial Immortals had arrived, preventing him from
investigating it in detail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that the five
Celestial Immortals were trapped, there was no one else who could
disturb him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crackle crackle
crackle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s divine power
agitated the surrounding land, pushing aside the nearby mud and
rocks. He stared at the enormous, fiery copper pillar before him.
This copper pillar had been here for who-knows how long…but it
hadn’t rusted in the slightest. It was covered with runes, and
ripples of power were emanating from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Doesn’t seem to be
a magic treasure.” Ning came to this private conclusion after
investigating it a bit. “Let me try divine sense.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
released his divine sense, attempting to carefully ascertain what the
real face of this fiery copper pillar was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Last time, his divine
sense had been unleashed from midair, and so he had only been able to
scan a small part of the copper pillar. This time, he was right next
to it, deep underground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is…” Ning
took a deep breath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Good heavens!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This fiery copper
pillar was nearly three hundred meters wide, but it stretched
extremely deep down underground…and at the very bottom of it was an
unfathomably massive fire-red stone wall! This fiery stone wall
stretched out over ten thousand kilometers in the deep subterranean.
There was a limit to how far Ning’s divine sense could stretch. He
was only able to scan a portion of this fiery stone wall. As to how
large it was exactly…there was no way Ning could find out as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the giant copper
pillar, it was planted firmly into the fiery stone wall!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than three
thousand kilometers of the giant copper pillar jutted out from above
the stone wall! As for how deep it was beyond the wall…there was no
way to know! This was because Ning’s divine sense was completely
unable to penetrate through the fiery stone wall at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This stone wall…”
Ning immediately used yet another void blink, teleporting three
thousand kilometers downwards. He quickly arrived next to the fiery
stone wall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning used his divine
power to force aside all the nearby mud, creating an empty region
deep underground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Beneath Ning’s feet
was the fiery stone wall. Next to him was the fiery copper pillar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is this thing?
Divine sense is unable to see through this fiery stone wall, and
elemental ki is unable to bind it.” Ning was completely puzzled. He
immediately gave it a hard stomp.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How powerful were
Ning’s feet by now? It must be understood that Ning’s hands were
comparable to supreme Pure Yang treasures. As for the rest of his
body, every other part was comparable to at least a high-grade
Immortal-ranked magic treasure. The power of his kicks would be able
to effortlessly cause mountains to crumble. The enormous, fiery stone
wall beneath him, however, just let out a booming sound…and was
completely undamaged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Weird.” Ning
suddenly struck down with a palm as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of the
activated [Starseizing Hand] was incredibly terrifying…but the only
result was yet another, deeper booming sound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still nothing?”
Ning was truly confused now. “Even Heaven-ranked magic treasures
would be completely shattered by my palm blows, yet this fiery stone
wall is completely undamaged?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning walked to the
enormous copper pillar that was planted firmly into the fiery stone
wall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So the copper pillar
is planted into the stone wall?” Ning carefully made a circle
around the giant copper pillar, inspecting it. He pushed aside all of
the mud surrounding the three hundred meter thick pillar, only to
discover…that this fiery stone wall really did seem to have a three
hundred meter opening here. The copper pillar was stuck into the
opening and tightly locked to it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s divine sense
was unable to find the tiniest of seams to penetrate into!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The copper pillar
was planted here…I wonder if it can be pulled out?” Ning mumbled
to himself for a moment as he pondered. Screw it. The Youngflame clan
hid it here. Ning wasn’t afraid of anything. His body flickered,
and with a whoosh, he instantly transformed into a nine hundred meter
tall giant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a Fiendgod Body
Refiner at the Void level, upon using the Heavenly Transformation
divine ability, Ning’s maximum size was actually three thousand
meters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a nine hundred meter
tall giant, his two hands were able to effortlessly clasp around the
enormous copper pillar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come OUT!” Ning
pulled, hard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How much power did this
pull have, coming from a nine hundred meter tall giant?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas…it didn’t
budge at all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Starseizing Hand]!”
Ning stared for a moment, then the divine tattoos of the [Starseizing
Hand] began to flow across his hands. His power exploded
dramatically, and his pulling strength increased greatly as well. He
now had what felt like limitless strength, capable of uprooting
mountains and rivers…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Accompanied by a
thunderous sound, the enormous copper pillar actually began to rise
slightly. When it did, all sorts of grinding sounds could be heard
from deep below the stone wall, at the points where the stone wall
and the copper pillar were joined together. In fact, a rumbling sound
that sounded like the heavens were breaking apart could be heard as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In a very distant
world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A man-shaped creature
with scales on his face, a single horn on his forehead, and a body
covered by azure flames suddenly opened his eyes. Boundless rage
could be seen in his gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who dares…WHO
DARES TOUCH MY INFINITY FURNACE?!”
</P>

Chapter 26 - The Deep Gorge
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In front of the horned,
human-shaped creature lay a massive aberration that was like a
mountain-island…an armored insect-type aberration.. This bug had a
triangular head which glowed with with a bronze light, making it look
as though it was metallic. Its sharp fangs were clearly visible
within its savage-looking mouth, and it also had sixteen knife-like
legs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This insect aberration
had an aura of tremendous power, and surges of a gray aura were
constantly wafting off of its body. It was simply too enormous; its
body alone was nearly thirty thousand meters in length.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good boy.” The
horned humanoid immediately opened his mouth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The utterly massive,
terrifying insect actually began to shrink at a rapid pace, becoming
a tiny little dot that flew straight into the mouth of the horned
humanoid.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ancestor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two figures instantly
flew over; one a bald, black-robed man, the other a woman with
dazzling golden hair. These two Celestial Immortals were acting
extraordinarily subservient; they knew exactly how terrifyingly
powerful this horned humanoid before them was! This was the true
ancestor and patriarch of the entire Youngflame clan. The reason why
the Youngflame clan had refused to bow their heads towards the
Kindwater clan and instead fought with them for so many years,
despite the fact that the Kindwater clan had an Empyrean God, was
precisely because the Youngflame clan had the Ancestor behind them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come. Accompany me
on a trip to the Oldjade mountain range.” The horned humanoid had
an ugly look on his face. “I want to see who it is that dares touch
my things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” the two
Celestial Immortals said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ji Ning was pulling
up the fiery copper pillar, Patriarch Arcanum was quietly standing
guard within a distant tower. He had been seated in the lotus
position, but his face suddenly changed. He opened his eyes wide in
terror and shock. “The Infinity Furnace…who dares disturb the
Infinity Furnace? Can it be Ji Ning? But, but…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Oldjade
mountain range. Within the massive, ten thousand kilometer formation
which Uncle White had set up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five mighty
Celestial Immortals trapped within were originally quite patient, but
upon Ning beginning to uproot the fiery copper pillar…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Infinity
Furnace!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It must be Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortals
Infatuation, Goldclock, Sunfish, Deadwood, and Flamefish all had
completely different looks on their faces now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The copper Infinity
Furnace was simply far too important to them. If Celestial Immortals
were one of the pillars of the Youngflame clan, the Infinity Furnace
would be one of the other pillars! The secrets of the Infinity
Furnace…not even Loose Immortals or Earth Immortals knew about
them. However, all of the Celestial Immortals within the clan did
know, and all of them had left behind their own seals and runes upon
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So long as anyone began
to open the Infinity Furnace, they would immediately know!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder Ji Ning
stopped attacking us. He discovered the Infinity Furnace! He must
have found it when he was destroying that earlier area.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, let’s go
stop him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can’t let him
open the Infinity Furnace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five mighty
Celestial Immortals didn’t hesitate at all; Celestial Immortal
Infatuation waved his hand, and he instantly collected the other four
Celestial Immortals. And then, he disappeared as well, leaving behind
only a mobile Immortal estate in midair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Uncle White’s
formation-based attacks and Mu Northson’s Seven Ruinous
Thunderwinds were all quite formidable, they weren’t able to
destroy this mobile Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the storm of
attacks passed…the five mighty Celestial Immortals were gone. The
mobile Immortal estate landed on the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Little Qing
blinked forward, appearing before the mobile Immortal estate.
Stretching out her hand, she grabbed it and immediately began to
forcibly bind it to herself. She called out, “Those five Celestial
Immortals slipped away…what should we do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If they slipped
away, they slipped away. We are here in the headquarters of the
Youngflame clan; they won’t just sit and watch as we relax here.
They’ll definitely come again.” Uncle White was quite calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Little Qing and Uncle
White both immediately sent spiritual messages to Ning, alerting him
of this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep underground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous nine
hundred meter tall Ji Ning was standing atop the fiery stone cliff
while tugging out the giant copper pillar at rapid speed. Rumble…with
each pull, the copper tube was lifted up nearly six hundred meters!
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Ning continued to pull upwards rapidly, while
more and more of the copper pillar began to emerge. “I want to see
how damn long this copper pillar is, and what’s behind this fiery
stone wall.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning saw it, once he
pulled out the copper pillar, he would be able to use his divine
sense to investigate the enormous hole that would be left behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning suddenly
frowned. He could sense a spatial ripple, an extremely powerful
spatial ripple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greater
Teleportation.” Ning immediately recognized it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just a few dozen
kilmeters away from Ning, amidst the earth and rubble, Celestial
Immortals Infatuation, Deadwood, Flamefish, and the other two all
simultaneously appeared. They were all utterly enraged. Around them
circled that enormous five-colored mountain peak, and with a boom,
they quickly began to charge towards Ning, the five-colored mountain
peak crushing through all obstacles before them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as they got close
to Ning…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!” Celestial
Immortal Infatuation gave the order. Whoosh whoosh whoosh…instantly,
the five enormous chains shot out like Flood Dragons, tearing through
all obstacles as they swept towards Ji Ning, who was still pulling at
the fiery copper pillar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning just
smirked. “Three Heads, Six Arms! Thousandbull Sword, let the
Nightriver emerge!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, two more
arms grew out from Ning’s body, to join the two arms that were
being used to pull at the copper pillar. The Thousandbull Sword
appeared above his head as well, and the awe-inspiring Nightriver
also emerged. The Nightriver instantly and completely submerged
everything nearby, causing the five dragon-like chains to seem to
have become mired in quicksand. At the same time, Ning’s four arms
demonstrated tremendous power as he completely suppressed the
assaults of the chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five Celestial
Immortals, upon seeing that the Shaoyin Demontamer Formation wasn’t
powerful enough, temporarily gave up that idea for now. After all,
their current goal wasn’t to trap him; it was to prevent him from
pulling out the pillar! Thus, they all used various spells, magic
treasures, and other abilities to that effect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One tendril after
another appeared, slithering towards Ning like giant serpents!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous fiery
phoenix appeared, charging towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A golden greatclock
appeared in midair, ringing out and sending waves of power towards
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that all you
have?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning completely ignored
these attacks; in fact, he actually grew even more excited. “As
soon as I started tugging at this copper pillar, those five Celestial
Immortals immediately teleported over here. They were clearly trapped
within the formation; how did they know that I was here pulling the
pillar? This pillar must be covered with various seals, runes, and
restrictive spells, causing them to immediately know about this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For them to attack
me in such a berserk manner shows that they are truly unwilling for
the copper pillar to be uprooted,” Ning guessed to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more his enemies
feared an action, the more insistent he could be on carrying it out!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many magic spells and
treasures flew towards Ning, but Ning allowed all of the attacks to
land on his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The surrounding earth
and rocks were all blasted apart as a wave of power spread out
towards every direction. Everything within a thousand kilometers was
instantly transformed into ash, while the ground within ten thousand
kilometers began to crack and shatter. In fact, the cracks spread all
the way from the underground area to the surface, forming an
enormously deep gorge that was nearly ten thousand kilometers deep!
The earth and rocks here were quite ordinary, after all; how could
they withstand the frenzied attacks of five mighty Celestial
Immortals?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the power of
Celestial Immortals!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just the collateral
damage from a battle between the five Celestial Immortals and Ji Ning
would generate a gorge that was ten thousand kilometers deep!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, just let
the attacks land; he even allowed those vines to coil around his
body. Ning felt nothing but disdain for it all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His body now had the
power of the Fifth Cycle of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]; these
attacks did nothing but tickle him! If he wasn’t currently holding
onto that copper pillar, then he’d have to spend some of his energy
in dealing with the vines and ripping them apart. Even before Ning
made his breakthrough, he was capable of breaking apart those vines,
to say nothing of now, when his strength had vastly increased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And since he actually
WAS holding onto the copper pillar…if they wanted to pull them
away, they’d have to pull the copper pillar away along with him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get in here!”
Patriarch Goldclock let out an angry roar. The golden greatclock was
giving birth to unearthly ripples of attractive power, attempting to
draw Ning inside it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, just
tightly clutched the copper pillar, continuing to pull ilt upwards!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You want to pull me
away? Then you’ll have to pull out the copper pillar along with me!
The attractive power of the golden clock actually just slightly
hastened the rate at which the copper pillar was being pulled out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t stop him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s completely
ignoring our attacks. He’s even able to ignore the vines! All of
his attention is focused on pulling out the copper pillar.”
Celestial Immortal Goldclock sent frantically, “What should we
do?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
The copper pillar was still being pulled up at a fast, rhythmic pace.
With each pull, another six hundred meters of it was pulled out.
Ning’s pulling speed was incredibly fast; in just this short
exchange of attacks, Ning had already pulled out another thirty
thousand meters. But this pillar was simply too enormously long!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t attack him,”
Celestial Immortal hurriedly ordered mentally. “Let’s bind the
pillar. Let’s attack the pillar and use all our might to prevent it
from going up any further.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, we only need
to stop the copper pillar from being pulled out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Earlier, the Celestial
Immortals had been in a panic; upon seeing Ning rapidly pull out the
copper pillar, they had only thought to attack him. They had
forgotten that preventing the pillar from coming out would serve the
same effect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five Celestial
Immortals now completely ignored Ning as they hurriedly flew towards
the top of the copper pillar. They wanted to use a spatial
teleportation to go there faster, but the surrounding area, within
the range of Ning’s divine sense, had long ago been completely
spacelocked. They had no choice but to fly upwards, but flying didn’t
take significantly more time than using a Greater Teleportation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In that tiny bit of
extra time, however…Ning was able to pull out another thirty
thousand meters of the pillar. This copper pillar was simply too
massive; before he had started to pull, Ning had already seen three
thousand kilometers of it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“STOP!” Celestial
Immortal Deadwood unleashed his many vines, which rapidly began to
wrap around the copper pillar, generating an astonishing repulsive
force.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“STOP!” Celestial
Immortal Goldclock controlled his divine greatclock, sending waves of
power smashing downwards on the very top of the copper pillar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“STOP!” Celestial
Immortals Flamefish, Infatuation, and Sunfish all wildly launched
attacks against the top of the tower, seeking to press it downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…”
Although Ning could sense the waves of pressure slamming down from
above, he began to laugh even more happily. This was because, now
that the five Celestial Immortals were no longer attacking him, all
six of Ning’s arms were temporarily freed up to focus on uprooting
the copper pillar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s physical
strength was simply too enormous. With six arms pulling together at
the same time…not even the combined efforts of the five Celestial
Immortals were able to keep the pillar down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
Ning had pulled out yet another thirty thousand meters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thud! Thud! Thud! The
fiery stone wall beneath Ning’s feet actually began to rumble and
shudder, as though something was slamming against it. At the same
time, the countless runes that were covering the fiery stone wall
began to flicker and flash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good. Ji Ning
has pulled out too much of the copper pillar; the suppressive runes
are beginning to destabilize.” Celestial Immortal Infatuation and
the other four Celestial Immortals began to grow frantic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ning’s
strength is too great; the five of us are actually unable to suppress
him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of raw
strength…once the Fourth Cycle of the [Starseizing Hand] was
completely unleashed, Ning’s raw physical strength vastly
outstretched the strength of the five Celestial Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of comparing
magic treasures…Ning’s six hands were comparable to supreme Pure
Yang treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How could the five of
them possibly suppress the pillar?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should we do?
If this continues, there will be a huge problem.” Celestial
Immortal Goldclock was beginning to panic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, I knew
something was strange here. The more afraid you are, the more I want
to pull this thing out.” Upon seeing the countless runes flashing
and flickering atop the enormous fiery stone wall beneath his feet,
and upon hearing the series of thudding sounds, Ning grew even more
eager to see what would happen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Suddenly, all
five of the Celestial Immortals, as well as the pillar-uprooting Ji
Ning, could sense a spatial ripple come from up above them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was Greater
Teleportation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ancestor has
arrived.” The five Celestial Immortals revealed looks of delight
and joy.

Chapter 27 - The Youngflame Clan’s Founder
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Four figures appeared
in the air above the deep gorge within the Oldjade mountain range.
The leader was a golden-robed man with a single horn, whose gaze was
as cold as icy water. Behind him stood three other figures; a bald,
black-robed man named Celestial Immortal Blackrain, a golden-haired
woman named Celestial Immortal Goldcloud, and Celestial Immortal
Arcanum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three mighty
Celestial Immortals were all obediently following behind this
individual.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is that horned
man?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Isn’t that
Patriarch Arcanum? Why is Patriarch Arcanum following behind that man
so respectfully? The two who are standing next to Patriarch Arcanum
are also acting with great respect, and their auras seem to be very
great as well; they should also be at the Celestial Immortal level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Loose Immortals of
the Youngflame clan, hidden away and watching from within their
distant formations, were all rather dazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had just seen five
Celestial Immortals appear. And now…they saw four more!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They recognized
Patriarch Arcanum; he had an extremely exalted status within the
Youngflame clan, and generally speaking they would be able to
occasionally interact with him in some manner. Right now, however,
Patriarch Arcanum was obediently standing behind the horned man, and
the two other Celestial Immortals with him were doing the same. This
caused all sorts of speculations to run rampant through their minds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that this
horned man is the true, actual supreme power of our Youngflame clan?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There were five
Celestial Immortals earlier; now, four more have appeared. Can it be
that our Youngflame clan actually has nine Celestial Immortals? We’re
actually this powerful!? Or perhaps the horned man isn’t a
Celestial Immortal; is he one of those legendary Empyrean Gods or
True Immortals?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All sorts of thoughts
and speculations flashed through their minds, causing these Loose
Immortals and Earth Immortals of the Youngflame clan who were
watching to feel extremely nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The horned,
golden-robed man and the three Celestial Immortals with him stared
downwards. They were able to see that fiery copper pillar located at
the bottom of the deep gorge. Next to the pillar were five Celestial
Immortals who were assaulting it, trying to slow it down. At the very
bottom of the pillar…there was a nine hundred meter tall Ji Ning
who was using six arms to tug at the pillar, wildly trying to uproot
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn him, he’s
moving my furnace.” The horned, golden-robed man’s face was
sinister. “All of you, attack to suppress and press down the copper
pillar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Celestial
Immortals under his command, Goldcloud, Blackrain, and Arcanum,
simultaneously assented and began to fly downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the horned,
golden-robed man, he opened his mouth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three tiny black dots
flew out, and as they did, they immediately expanded. Instantly, they
transformed into a trio of terrifying aberrations that were more than
thirty thousand meters long. One of them was the armored insect
aberration that had sixteen knife-like legs. A second looked like a
gigantic rhinoceros that had unbelievably thick skin…but on its
back it had a total of twelve pairs of wings. The final creature was
a viper whose body was covered with circles of black tattoos. The
tattoos were extremely beautiful, and at the head of the viper, they
actually came together to form the tattoo of a crown.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The horned,
golden-robed man was seated atop the back of the winged rhinoceros,
and he directed the three massive aberrations to move downwards, as
fast as lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">THUD! THUD! THUD! A
series of massive thudding sounds could be heard from deep within the
fiery stone wall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to focus
all his efforts on pulling up that giant copper pillar. The giant
copper pillar rose up rapidly, and the more of it Ning pulled out,
the more brilliant became the glow of the countless runes that had
appeared on the fiery stone wall beneath Ning’s feet. However, they
were also beginning to flicker…and the thudding sounds began to
speed up as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” As Ning
pulled upwards, Ning suddenly had the feeling as though deep below
this enormous copper pillar, on the other side of the massive fiery
stone wall, a power was beginning to awaken and grow stronger. It was
as though some sort of terrifying behemoth was struggling to push up
the pillar, attempting to shove it higher!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more Ning pulled
out, the more power began to gather in the deepest depths, helping
push the pillar upwards nonstop. This made it easier and easier for
Ning to pull it out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t act against
Ji Ning. It’s useless.” Celestial Immortal Infatuation, upon
seeing Celestial Immortal Arcanum and the other two arrive, instantly
sent a frantic mental message to them. “Ji Ning has the [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art] protecting him; we’re completely unable to wound him.
He also has a deathgrip around the copper pillar; we’re completely
unable to dislodge him. What we need to do right now is to stop that
copper pillar from rising up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The three
Celestial Immortals who had arrived all understood this right away.
They all each began to use their own techniques to push downwards at
the massive copper pillar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The enormous
six-armed Ning, nine hundred meters tall and located more than three
thousand kilometers away from those eight Celestial Immortals, raised
his head to give them a glance. Ning’s twin eyes were blazing with
torch-light, and he was able to see everything with perfect clarity.
He saw Celestial Immortal Arcanum and the other two join the fray as
well, and also saw those three terrifying aberrations fly downwards,
as well as that horned, golden-robed individual seated atop the back
of the flying rhinoceros.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“More and more are
coming.” Ning cracked his lips wide with a grin. “This Youngflame
clan really is quite powerful. An ancient clan that ranks as one of
the top ten of the Grand Xia Dynasty…it really is quite
extraordinary. It seems I’ve really kicked over the hornet’s nest
this time. The Youngflame clan is starting to panic.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed; to the
Youngflame clan, ordinary clansmen would die out and be replaced
every few centuries just through aging! To the clan, ordinary
clansmen and ordinary cultivators weren’t that important; even if
all of the people within the Oldjade mountain range perished, it
would at most represent a loss of face for the clan. It wouldn’t
actually affect their total power much; after all, they had two other
headquarters! They could let the people in those two other
headquarters replenish their losses and once more occupy the entire
Oldjade mountain range.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, aside from
their three main headquarters, the Youngflame clan also was in
command of many minor worlds. Their bloodline and their clan was
spread extremely wide; there was no need for them to worry about
their clan being wiped out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth…the Ancestor
probably wouldn’t even be willing to come here, if it was simply a
matter of the Oldjade mountain range being destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ji Ning had made a
move on the Infinity Furnace! This threatened one of the foundations
of the Youngflame clan, and so even the Ancestor could no longer
ignore it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So what if there are
eight Celestial Immortals here? They still can’t stop me.” Ning
continued to quickly pull out the copper pillar. In truth, the
suppressive power unleashed by the eight Celestial Immortals was
extremely strong, but each time Ning pulled out more of the copper
pillar, the power pushing upwards from below the pillar grew
increasingly strong. In fact, the pushing power was almost comparable
to Ning’s pulling power by now!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, Ning actually
found it even easier now than he had before, despite the fact that
eight Celestial Immortals had just joined forces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first of the three
aberrations to fly downwards was that enormous armored insect. It
completely wrapped its sixteen knife-legs around the fiery copper
pillar! To this massive armored insect that was more than thirty
thousand meters long, the fiery copper pillar, which was merely three
hundred meters thick, was actually quite slender and thin. The
terrifying strength of the armored insect caused Ning to actually
sense the copper pillar sink down slightly!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This aberration has
tremendous power; if I didn’t use [Three Heads, Six Arms], I would
probably actually be weaker than it in terms of strength.” Ning
couldn’t help but feel surprised as he looked at the armored
insect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next came the thirty
thousand meter black serpent. It looped and coiled itself around the
fiery copper pillar. Instantly, a second surge of power that was no
weaker than that of the power of the armored insect came pressing
down, causing Ning to feel that the pillar had grown even heavier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">THUD! THUD! THUD! Ning
could sense the thudding sounds coming from deep below the fiery
stone wall beneath his feet were beginning to increase even more in
pace. The power below the copper pillar was still gaining in
power…and by now, its power had completely eclipised Ji Ning’s.
With the aid of this power…Ning was still able to continue pulling
the copper pillar up!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">ROAAAAR! One of the
massive hooves of the winged rhinoceros slammed down directly against
the very top of the copper pillar, instantly causing the entire
copper pillar to grow even heavier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That flying
rhinoceros aberration…its strength is actually even greater than
that of the black snake and the strange insect?” Ning was shocked.
“Even when I use the [Starseizing Hand] with six arms, my power
would most likely only be on par with that rhinoceros aberration.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning tightly clutched
the copper pillar. He could sense the power below the copper pillar
growing increasingly savage; in fact, it was almost equal to and
achieved a balance with the pressuring force from above that was
seeking to push the pillar down. As for Ning…he was the tiebreaker
that broke the balance between these two powers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come out!” Ning’s
six arms exerted their full power; by himself, he was already
comparable to the eight Celestial Immortals above him in strength,
and was comparable to the flying rhinoceros, the most physically
strong creature on the other side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The face of the horned,
golden-robed man seated on the back of the flying rhinoceros
completely changed. The Celestial Immortals under his command were
all Ki Refiners; in this sort of competition of raw strength, they
were innately at a disadvantage! But the three aberrations he
controlled were far more powerful in raw strength; he had thought
that with their appearance, the pillar would be effortlessly pushed
down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The western sea of the
world of the Grand Xia. The headquarters of the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha, Immortal
Venomfreak is in for some trouble now!” Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven roared with laughter, waving his hands and feet about in
delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this is the
founding father of the Youngflame clan?” The nearby Violetgrass
stared curiously towards the horned, golden-robed man. Although she
had heard of the founder before, she knew very little about him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven laughed, then nodded. “Right. This is the founder of
the Youngflame clan. Back in the era of Pangu’s World…there was
an extremely powerful clan known as the ‘Godfire’ clan. This was
a clan that was protected by a Daofather; this clan was one of the
most supreme clans amongst the many clans of the world. A woman of
this clan was raped by a Fiendgod, and she gave birth to a child that
had the bloodline and lineage of that Fiendgod. This child was born
looking like a hideous freak, more monster than man. Thus, he was
ostracized by his clan. As a result, he never felt as though he was a
member of the Godfire clan. He long ago departed from the clan,
establishing his own Youngflame clan!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This ugly child was
the founder of the Youngflame clan…Youngflame Freak. An eccentric,
cautious, sinister, and truly crafty freak.” Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven said in a low voice, “Although he is ‘only’ a
Celestial Immortal…even I am unwilling to make an enemy of him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Violetgrass nodded
lightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Naturally, she had
heard of some of the legends of Immortal Venomfreak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Three
Realms, there were fairly few Pure Yang True Immortals and Empyrean
Gods, after all; the likes of Patriarch Lu, also known as Lu Dongbin,
and other similarly formidable members of the Three Realms were
people that even Celestial Immortals had to receive with tremendous
respect. True Immortals and Empyrean Gods were simply far, far too
few in number. By comparison, there were many more Celestial
Immortals, and amongst them were some truly monstrous freaks.
Although it was extremely hard for a Celestial Immortal to break
through to the True Immortal level, these Celestial Immortals had
reputations that were not one whit inferior to the reputation of most
True Immortals or Empyrean Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven was one such figure!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Venomfreak was
another!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Venomfreak has
many clones. Although every single clone has fairly average power…”
Celestial Immortal Blackheaven sighed. “Because of how many clones
he has, it is almost completely impossible to kill him. For example,
this ‘Venomfreak’ before us…he’s nothing more than a single
one of the clones.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Venomfreak’s power
in battle is ordinary, but his venomous insects are far too
dangerous. His abilities in raising venomous insects can be
considered amongst the best in the Three Realms. I really wonder
where he found this sort of a legacy.” Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven sighed. “These three insects that we are seeing…each
of them has combat power comparable to a supreme Celestial Immortal.
In addition, these insects have no fear of death, and so they are
even more terrifying than actual Celestial Immortals. Thus…even
back during the era of Pangu’s World, Immortal Venomfreak was
famous for being extremely difficult to deal with. Killing him would
be very difficult, unless a Daofather or comparable power was to seek
out and destroy every single one of his clones. A few of his insects
have died, but with the passage of time, he’s been able to produce
other terrifyingly strong insects as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus…we should
ideally try to split Immortal Venomfreak from the Xia Emperor’s
side and pull him over to ours,” Celestial Immortal Blackheaven
said. “He will prove of tremendous use to us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This eccentric,
cautious, sinister, and truly crafty golden-robed figure stared
downwards. Upon seeing that his three insects were unable to prevent
the copper pillar from being pulled upwards, he began to grow
frantic. He immediately sent a message with his coresense: “Ji
Ning, brat, if you don’t want to die, then stop right now!”

Chapter 28 - Charging Out of the Prison
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die? From what,
those three aberrations of yours?” The nine hundred meter tall
giant, Ji Ning, roared with laughter. He continued to furiously pull
up the copper pillar, and the force coming from down beneath it
continued to strengthen, making Ning’s task easier and easier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The horned,
golden-robed man was filled with utter rage. Because of the caution
that had been bred into him during the era of Pangu’s World, he
never carried all his aberrations on a particular clone! This
particularly clone carried three aberrations, as it was meant to
protect the clan; the other clones were secreted throughout the Three
Realms, and they naturally had insectoid aberrations of their own.
This caused the horned, golden-robed man to feel extremely angry; if
all of his aberrations were here, he would probably be able to
effortlessly press down the copper pillar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…keeping his
insectoid aberrations was an ironclad rule he had set for himself! It
was the main reason why he had been able to survive through so many
countless ages! He would rather pay an enormous price than to violate
this ironclad rule.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. The
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art].” The horned, golden-robed man sent an
angry mental message, roaring, “Although the [Eight-Nine Arcane
Art], you haven’t even overcome your Celestial Tribulation. If I
truly were to act against you…you would definitely die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, then. Show me
everything you have,” Ning snickered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A cold light flashed
through the eyes of the horned, golden-robed man. He sent mentally,
“Fine, then…our Youngflame clan is willing to resolve our
differences with you. If you agree to cease uprooting the copper
pillar and help us push it back down, we definitely won’t act
against you again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You call this
‘resolving our differences’? If you don’t come after me, I’d
go after you! Do you think the annihilation of the entire Yuchi clan
can be forgiven, as easily as that?” Ning was angry now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The annihilation of
the Yuchi clan?” The horned, golden-robed man had an incredibly
exalted status; he wasn’t even aware of such minor matters as the
eradication of the Yuchi clan. He immediately sent mentally, “How
about this? Those who gave the orders to deal with the Yuchi clan and
everyone who acted against the Yucchi clan…I’ll capture them all
and give them to you for you to deal with!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Minor matters such as
the extermination of a small clan were normally decided upon by the
Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals of a clan. To this founder of the
Youngflame clan, who could easily spend a million years in a single
closed-door meditation session…Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals
were nothing more than individuals that would die and be replaced
every so often. Ordinary Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals would
never even be qualified to see the founder a single time in their
lives.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ancestor wouldn’t
even care if all of the Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals of the
clan were wiped out, to say nothing of a small portion of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As easy as that?”
Ning sent a cold laugh. “Celestial Immortal Arcanum sent people to
assassinate me, and even the soul of my lifelong friend’s
Dao-companion was destroyed thanks to the attacks of four Celestial
Immortals of your Youngflame clan. Am I supposed to just write them
off? If you really want to resolve our differences…I can agree.
Aside from sending me everyone who had anything to do with the Yuchi
clan’s eradication, all five of those Celestial Immortals,
including Celestial Immortal Arcanum, must die! If you do that, this
matter will be at an end!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are going too
far!” The Ancestor was enraged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then don’t talk to
me about resolving our differences!” Ning continued to furiously
uproot the copper pillar; by now, even without him pulling at it, the
copper pillar was rising up of its own volition. Even without Ning
helping out, the upwards pushing force already eclipsed the downwards
pushing force of the Celestial Immortals and three aberrations above.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can kill any
Loose Immortals, cultivators, or mortals that you wish. You
absolutely cannot kill my Celestial Immortals; not even one!” The
Ancestor was utterly infuriated by now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every clan had its
rules. For the sake of the clan, sacrificing a few Earth Immortals or
Loose Immortals meant nothing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But sacrificing
Celestial Immortals?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other Celestial
Immortals would probably be terrified and shaken by such an action.
All of the Celestial Immortals of the entire clan would feel nervous
and restless. In addition, Celestial Immortals were the true
foundation of any clan; there was no way the Ancestor would be
willing to sacrifice Celestial Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can use magic
treasures to compensate you,” the Ancestor said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ten top-grade Pure
Yang Treasures. Can you afford it?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ancestor was so
choked with anger, he couldn’t speak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ten?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What did this Ji Ning
kid think Pure Yang treasures were? Despite how powerful the Ancestor
was and how long he had lived, even he didn’t have ten top-grade
Pure Yang treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop. I SAID STOP!”
The Ancestor stared at how far up the copper pillar had risen…and
realized that the situation could no longer be reversed. Earlier, if
Ji Ning had been willing to help out a bit, they could’ve shoved
the copper pillar back down. But now? It had risen so much that even
if Ji Ning helped them out, they still probably wouldn’t be able to
shove it back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” The
sinister eyes of the Ancestor were filled with malice and a savage
desire to kill. “I, Venomfreak, swear that I will definitely kill
you. I will definitely kill you!!! Not only will I kill you, I’ll
also wipe out your clan and all those you care about!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. I’m
planning on killing you too. Hahaha…” Ning raised his head to
stare upwards, his eyes blazing with torch-light. He could clearly
see the horned, golden-robed man above him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…the copper
pillar rose up at an ever-fast pace. The pushing power from below now
completely outstripped the power of the forces of the Youngflame
clan. With Ning helping out as well, the copper pillar was pulled out
faster and faster, with Ning’s six arms turning into blurs as they
moved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn it.” The
Youngflame clan’s Ancestor had an extremely ugly look on his face.
He immediately sent mentally, “Everyone, halt. Hurry up and
establish the Eight Immortals Sea-Subduing Formation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eight Celestial
Immortals Arcanum, Infatuation, Goldclock, Deadwood, Sunfish,
Flamefish, Goldcloud, and Blackrain, upon hearing the orders of their
incomparably venerated founder, all gave up on their attempts and
simultaneously flew high into the sky. Even the three aberrations
gave up as well; everyone flew up into the sky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eight mighty
Celestial Immortals fell into formation, with the horned,
golden-robed man standing at the very center and the three
aberrations circling around them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They’re coming.”
The horned, golden-robed man stared downwards coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clank. The pillar
suddenly stopped moving.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, as well, realized
that the copper pillar could no longer be budged. More than 4200
kilometers of it was stretching beyond the fiery stone wall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous sound, as
though the sky itself was bursting apart or as if the earth itself
was shattering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt the countless
runes covering the fiery stone wall beneath his feet begin to
flicker…and the fiery stone wall itself began to move.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Ning sent out
his divine sense to investigate. He could now see that a crack had
suddenly appeared across the surface of the vast, fiery stone wall.
The crack was rapidly increasing in size, expanding to each side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like a crack
appearing on the lid to a cauldron or a furnace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“WE’RE OUT!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“WE’RE OUT!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“WE’RE FINALLY
OUT!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One figure after
another came soaring out from the crack. The tight, dense waves of
figures came flooding out, and as they did they rapidly began to
increase in size. They started off as tiny dots, but they began to
transform into Fiendgods that were thousands or tens of thousands of
meters tall! They all let out agitated, berserk howls, and the sound
of their roars shook the world around them. Just from listening to
their agitated roars, one could sense the infinite excitement these
Fiendgods were feeling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their roars alone could
shake one’s soul!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! The
earth broke apart. Countless Fiendgods came charging out into the
sky. Some of the Fiendgods had two horns and flames coming out of
their nostrils, some had the appearance of beastmen, and others
appeared just like a mass of black fog…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All sorts of Fiendgods
had appeared. Tall, muscular ones, sinister and bizarre ones, savage
and berserk ones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some were large, some
were small, but all of them came charging out from the stone wall,
and the earth around them was utterly destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…this is…”
Ning was completely stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This many
Fiendgods?! And the auras of these Fiendgods…more than half of them
are actually Void-level Fiendgods.” Ning instantly understood why
the power that had come from below the copper pillar was so
enormously powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were more than
nine hundred Fiendgods before him…and more than sixty percent of
them were Void-level Fiendgods!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were true, real
Fiendgods, the type that generally had divine abilities of their own.
Over the course of countless ages, their comprehension of the Dao had
most likely risen to an incredibly high level as well. Every single
Void-level Fiendgod was comparable to a Celestial Immortal, and some
of them were probably comparable to supreme Celestial Immortals. For
so many Fiendgods to unleash their power at once…what an incredible
sight that must have been!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What in the world
has the Youngflame clan done? They imprisoned this many Fiendgods!?”
Ning was completely stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of the nine
midair Celestial Immortals of the Youngflame clan were all ugly to
behold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” The
Ancestor’s face was ashen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I had known this
would happen…I would’ve killed these Fiendgods long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn this Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually released
the Fiendgods of the Infinity Furnace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Celestial
Immortals were extremely enraged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine hundred-plus
Fiendgods burst out from the ground, all of them enormous in size.
The sky itself seemed to have grown dark as they all turned to stare
at the Celestial Immortals of the Youngflame clan who were hovering
in the air. Their eyes were filled with boundless hatred, so thick
and dense the hatred seemed to have taken physical form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” The
distant Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals within their formations
were completely stunned by what they saw. Everyone could sense the
hatred these Fiendgods felt for the nine Celestial Immortals of the
Youngflame clan…and they could also tell that more than half of the
Fiendgods were Void-level Fiendgods. So many Void-level
Fiendgods…this was utterly terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Demon Windraiser’s
reacted the fastest. He immediately roared furiously, “Can’t you
tell that those Fiendgods have gone mad? Quick! Evacuate all of our
clansmen here within the Oldjade mountain range. QUICK!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and
evacuate them!” The Loose Immortals all began to panic as they
carried this out; they still cared quite deeply about their clansmen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“YOUNGFLAME CLAN!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than nine hundred
Fiendgods were in the air. They stared angrily at the nine great
Celestial Immortals, each of them filled with endless amounts of
hatred. The leader of them, a humanoid Fiendgod who had nine heads,
let out an angry roar. “You have imprisoned us for countless years.
Tortured us for countless years! I, along with all of the Fiendgods
who were imprisoned within your furnace, hereby swear that we will
completely wipe out your entire Youngflame lineage!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We shall swear to
annihilate the Youngflame lineage!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Annihilate the
Youngflame lineage!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Annihilate!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“ANNIHILATE!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their roars shook the
heavens. All of the Youngflame clansmen who were located within the
protective formations all had ashen looks on their faces. Unpleasant
looks were on the faces of the nine Celestial Immortals as well. They
knew very well how much hatred these Fiendgods bore the Youngflame
clan; anyone who had been tormented for so many ages would feel
boundless hatred!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Imprisoned and
tortured you for countless years?” Of the nine Celestial Immortals,
the Ancestor was the calmest. He laughed coldly, “And who is to
blame for that? You can only blame yourselves, you fools, for not
accepting your reality! If you were willing to serve our Youngflame
clan, not only would you have regained your liberty long ago, you
would also be allowed to enjoy countless things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Submit? We Fiendgods
war against the heavens and war against the earth; we are the true
masters of the universe. How could we possibly submit to you?” The
nine-headed Fiendgod roared with anger, and the other Fiendgods let
out similarly enraged roars as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, the masters
of the universe? Haven’t dozens of your fellow Fiendgods ended up
submitting to me, after suffering my torments?” The Ancestor roared
with laughter. “Masters of the universe Hah! I’m dying of
laughter. You are nothing more than a pack of fools who were born
when this major world was created.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ones who
submitted to you were trash; they are an embarrassment to all
Fiendgods. We TRUE Fiendgod warriors would never bow our heads to
you!” The nine-headed Fiendgod roared angrily, “Youngflame Freak,
you’ve caught us one by one and imprisoned all of us for countless
years, but your biggest mistake was not killing us. Now that we are
all gathered here together in one place…and we will definitely
annihilate your entire Youngflame lineage!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, Ning had also
arrived on the surface of the ground. He raised his head up, watching
as all of the Fiendgods in the sky swore their oath. From listening
to the dialogue between the two sides, he was able to guess at quite
a bit..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine-headed
Fiendgod suddenly lowered his head, looking down towards Ning, who
had just emerged on the surface of the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My good brother,
tell me your name!” The nine-headed Fiendgod looked towards Ning;
earlier, when they had charged out, they had all seen that it was
Ning who had been pulling away at the copper pillar. “You gave us
our freedom back. The kindness you have shown us is vaster than the
heavens and weightier than the earth. We shall never forget it!”

Chapter 29 - The Tenth Stance of the [Three-Foot Sword]
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My name is Ji Ning.
Pulling out the copper pillar was nothing more than a minor thing,”
Ji Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew very well
that this was no longer the Fiendgod Era; this was the era of the
Grand Xia Dynasty, which had unified the world! Struggles between
human clans were minor affairs, but any Fiendgod that refused to
submit to humans would be pursued and assaulted by all parties! The
free Fiendgods would have no choice but to flee in pitiful fashion to
the ends of the earth. This was what had happened to that ancient
Fiendgod who had been in the wild marshes of the Gaol Mountains; he
was clearly more powerful than Loose Immortals, and would be able to
effortless crush them with his hands…but he didn’t dare to fight
back at all. He had always been fleeing in a pathetic fashion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for submitting?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These nine hundred-plus
Fiendgods had been captured and tormented for countless years without
being willing to submit to the Youngflame clan; it would most likely
be very hard for them to be made to submit to any other human clans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We Fiendgods repay
benevolence with benevolence, and repay malice with malice,” the
nine-headed Fiendgod sent mentally, then turned his head to look at
the nine Celestial Immortals of the Youngflame clan. He let out a
heaven-shaking roar and said, “Youngflame clan, you’ve imprisoned
and tormented us for countless years. Today, the day of vengeance is
at hand! Let us wipe all of them out before the Godslayer Guards of
the Xia Emperor arrive!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“KILL!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“KILL THEM ALL!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Murderous roars filled
the skies, the roars themselves filled with boundless hatred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine hundred-plus
Fiendgods actually formed into a war-formation. Their divine power
flowed through them, merging to become a single whole as the blurry
illusion of an ancient Fiendgod suddenly appeared in the skies, its
entire body wreathed in flames. Its aura was so powerful that even
Ning was rather stunned. “So this is a Fiendgod war-formation?”
He had only heard of Fiendgod war-formations; this was the first time
he had seen one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fiendgods were born to
be powerful fighters and combatants. They truly did war against the
heavens and the earth, preferring to die than to submit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Threelives was a
classic example; after an enemy ripped out off one of his arms, he
actually decided to forever have just a single arm! As many humans
saw it, this was utter idiocy…but this was exactly what Daoist
Threelives did. This was due to his own pride!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the ancient
tribulation had come, he could’ve hidden away and retreated; given
his level of power, he would’ve been able to keep himself alive.
But…he didn’t do this. He knew that things would be extremely
dangerous, but he still went forward to welcome the danger. Even in
death, he had felt no regrets!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised his head to
look at the awe-inspiring horde of Fiendgods in the skies. They all
held weapons at the ready as they charged towards the nine Celestial
Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On one side, a Fiendgod
war-formation; on the otherside, the Eight Immortals Sea-Subduing
Formation of Immortal cultivators!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A powerful collision
could be heard, as though the heavens had broken apart and the earth
had collapsed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A series of massive
waves swept past the region surrounding the eight Celestial
Immortals, causing the power of the enemy collision to be completely
negated. This Eight Immortals Sea-Subduing Formation was one of the
most supreme defensive formations of the Three Realms; it focused
completely on being flawlessly protective! They knew very well how
difficult it would be to kill these Fiendgods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, is that all
you have?” The Ancestor of the Youngflame clan laughed coldly, “I
urge you to hurry up and leave; I’ve already notified the Xia
Emperor, and I trust that he will soon dispatch the Godslayer Guards
to come. If you don’t leave now…none of you will be leaving at
all!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“KILL!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fiendgods didn’t
care at all; they continued to charge forward and attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The massive, fiery
illusion of a Fiendgod that had been formed by their war-formation
once more slammed against the Eight Immortals Sea-Subduing Formation.
The faces of the Celestial Immortals sustaining the formation all
turned ashen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ancestor, what
should we do? What are our options?” Celestial Immortal Arcanum
sent frantically, “We won’t be able to hold for too long; their
Fiendgod war-formation is too powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What can we do?”
The horned, golden-robed man gave Celestial Immortal Arcanum a cold
look. “There are more than nine hundred Fiendgods here, and more
than six hundred of them are Void-level Fiendgods. When they work
together, they are capable of shaking the world itself; you won’t
even be able to use a Greater Teleportation Dao-seal to escape. As
for hiding into a mobile Immortal estate, then using the Greater
Teleportation Dao-seal? The combined strike from so many Fiendgods
will reduce any estate to dust in an instant. You want to run?
There’s no way to run! There is only one option; buy time! Buy a
little bit of time…because once the Godslayer Guards of the Xia
Emperor arrive, we’ll be rescued!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Using a Greater
Teleportation Dao-seal required time…and one couldn’t be
disrupted in the process!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Will the Godslayer
Guards of the Xia Emperor make it in time?” Celestial Immortal
Goldclock asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already
notified the Xia Emperor,” the horned, golden-robed man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What if the
Godslayer Guard intentionally delays? What then?” Celestial
Immortal Arcanum asked worriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The pupils of the
horned, golden-robed man shrank, but he said in a low voice, “That
won’t happen. The Xia Emperor, that old bastard, knows very well
that I have a treasure that can protect you and take you all away
with me. However, that treasure will shatter after a single use.
Unless things become critical, I absolutely won’t use it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A treasure capable of
blocking the combined strikes of over nine hundred Fiendgods was
equivalent to a second life for a Celestial Immortal; the Youngflame
clan’s Ancestor wasn’t willing to use it if he didn’t have to!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You Fiendgods, you
are wasting time. The more time you waste, the more of you shall die
later.” The horned, golden-robed man sent a mental message through
his elemental ki, and his voice echoed throughout the nearby area.
“Once the Godslayer Guards arrive…you know exactly how powerful
they are. You will be dead!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if we die,
we’ll annihilate your Youngflame clan as well!” A Fiendgod
covered with scales roared this back at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s to fear
about death? Youngflame clan, all of your Celestial Immortals shall
die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youngflame Freak, I
know that you yourself have countless clones, but those eight
Celestial Immortals under your command shall all die today!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fiendgods were all
roaring as they once more joined their power to charge against the
Eight Immortals Sea-Subduing Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You really are quite
bold and daring; you don’t even want to live any longer! But such a
pity; you’ve managed to endure for so many years, managed to endure
all sorts of torments, refusing to bow your heads for the sake of one
day gaining your freedom…but now that you are free, for the sake of
taking your so-called ‘revenge’, you are all going to be caught
and slaughtered by the Godslayer Guards. What a true pity! If I were
you, I would’ve fled to the ends of the world by now…in fact, I
would’ve fled from the entire world of the Grand Xia!” The
horned, golden-robed man roared with laughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed, a portion of
the nine hundred-plus Fiendgods hesitated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was true.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Freedom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To no longer be
imprisoned; to no longer be tortured! It was hard to understand how
precious freedom was to them. They had waited for this day for far
too long. Were they going to give it all up for the sake of
vengeance?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we don’t kill
the Youngflame clan, even if we live, we’ll live with regret.
Today, we shall kill the Celestial Immortals of the Youngflame clan.
After we slaughter them all, we’ll joyfully flee!” The
nine-headed Fiendgod roared angrily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s what we
want! To live joyfully!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, Ninehead, I
feel as though I’ve returned back to the old days when we warred
against the humans. Right! What we want is to live joyfully! What’s
so scary about death?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wonderful,
wonderful!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them let out
heroic roars.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more powerful a
Fiendgod was, the more fearless they would become; the desire to do
battle that they were born with caused them to become extraordinarly
berserk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, watching from
below, was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fiendgods…?”
Ning murmured to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he, too,
trained as a Fiendgod Body Refiner, he didn’t have the heart of a
true Fiendgod. He was a human, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he had been
imprisoned and tortured for countless eons…upon escaping and seeing
a tremendous threat approaching, he probably would’ve chosen to
flee. Only later would he prepare for revenge! But Fiendgods were
different; they weren’t willing to wait at all. In their rage, they
would take vengeance right away, with no fear of death at all. This
sort of desire to do battle stemmed from their very bones; they were
born for war. It all completely stunned Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Explosions rang
out unabated within the skies. The eight Celestial Immortals would
occasionally eat a spirit-pill to replenish their elemental ki,
striving to defend for as long as they could. The power of the
collisions caused even the golden pellet Jindan in their bodies to be
damaged. They were only just barely able to hold on, while the
Fiendgods were growing increasingly berserk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time continued to pass,
one second after the other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of the Fiendgods,
however, departed; they all continued to attack in a berserk manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To be joyful and act
as one pleases.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For a desire for
battle to be so powerful as to fill the skies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To wipe out all
foes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was mumbling to
himself. Suddenly, streaks of sword-ki began to appear around him.
Covered by countless streaks of sword-ki, Ning looked like a spirit
composed of swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning closed his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Threads of
enlightenment continuously flowed towards him…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since Ning had
truly decided to start his war against the Youngflame clan, his heart
had started to become even more clear, and his desire to do battle
had grown.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, upon seeing
the Fiendgods who had been imprisoned and tormented for countless
years choose to ignore their freedom in favor of a joyful battle
against those they hated, the desire to do battle in Ning’s heart
began to grow even stronger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stronger and stronger,
it grew…and his heart became clearer and clearer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the insights he had
gained in the past began to gather in his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the skies above,
those nine hundred-plus Fiendgods continued to frantically assault
the nine Celestial Immortals. The nine Celestial Immortals were only
trying to buy time. As for the Ancestor, he was gnashing his teeth.
He truly didn’t wish to use his supreme protective treasure; in his
heart, it was far more important than the lives of one or two of his
Celestial Immortals. But if eight Celestial Immortals under his
command died…then he truly would become the lone survivor of the
clan. He didn’t wish for this to happen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait a little
longer. A little longer.” The Youngflame clan’s Ancestor was
frantically encouraging them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other eight
Celestial Immortals were doing their best to hold on as well. They
couldn’t break; they had to stay strong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a ripple of
power appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was the ripple of a
Greater Teleportation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm?” The nine
Celestial Immortals of the Youngflame clan simultaneously raised
their heads.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine hundred-plus
Fiendgods raised their heads as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">High in the sky, an
ancient-looking warship that appeared to be formed from waves of
blood. This bloodwave warship was manned by warriors who were dressed
in blood-red armor, each of whom had utterly astonishing auras of
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“THE GODSLAYER
GUARDS!” The nine Celestial Immortals of the Youngflame clan were
overjoyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s leave now!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Scatter!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine hundred
Fiendgods could no longer afford to wait around. With a series of
booms, they tore through space, using spatial teleports to rapidly
flee in every direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chase after them!”
A tall, muscular general who stood upon the deck of the bloodwave
warship gave the nine Celestial Immortals of the Youngflame clan a
cold look, then immediately gave the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, with many
bloody flashes of light, the Godslayer Guards tore holes through
space as well as they engaged in pursuit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world became
peaceful once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fiendgods had
disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godslayer Guards
had disappeared as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” The nine
mighty Celestial Immortals all let out sighs of relief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank goodness.
Thank goodness!” The horned, golden-robed man nodded to himself.
“Thank goodness I wasn’t in a rush to use my treasure. Otherwise,
it would’ve been wasted.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…that Ji Ning
actually hasn’t fled!” Celestial Immortal Arcanum pointed
downwards, laughing coldly, “Although we are heavily injured, with
the three insect aberrations present…we are completely capable of
suppressing him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the other Celestial
Immortals looked downwards as well, the Ancestor included.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was standing in
the midst of some rubble. His eyes were closed, and he even had a
hint of a smile on his face. This was the feeling of joy he had when
he was gaining insights into the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where the Dao is…”
Ning opened his eyes, then said softly, “Though ten million
soldiers bar my path, I shall relentlessly advance!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rubble around Ning,
including the countless pieces of shattered rocks, broken bits of
grass, and even drops of water all began to levitate into the air…and
as they did, sword-light began to gather around them. It was as
though all things had become a sword! Even the many Immortal swords
and Darknorth swords that floated in the empty space within Ning’s
Zifu region began to emit sword-hums.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although I am very
talented, and although my insights into the Dao have long ago
surpassed that of senior Northwalker…in terms of my sword-heart,
perhaps only today have I just barely reached his level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could feel a surge
of sword-intent that wished to burst forth from within his heart.
This sword-intent was so powerful, so resonant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where the Dao is…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where the Dao is…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning murmured softly to
himself, “This new sword-art that I just developed…let it be
named the ‘Relentless Advance’, then.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tenth stance of the
[Three-Foot Sword] - Relentless Advance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised his head to
look towards the sky. The sky was now devoid of Fiendgods…only the
nine Celestial Immortals and the three aberrations were still
present.

Chapter 30 - The Sword Eradicates Celestial Immortals
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were some Loose
Immortals who were gathering within the protective formations far
away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Windraiser, I’ve
already moved all of the mortals and Immortal cultivators in the area
under my control into this Qiankun pearl.” A green-haired Immortal
lifted up a black pearl that glowed with soft light. He then waved
his hand and put it away. Looking towards the outside, he said with a
chortle, “But from the looks of it, I didn’t need to evacuate
them at all; the Fiendgods have all left, leaving behind just Ji
Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Indeed.”
Windraiser smiled and nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had been
evacuating many of their clansmen because they had been afraid of
those nine hundred-plus Fiendgods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that the Fiendgods
were being pursued by the Godslayer Guards of the Xia Emperor…the
only enemy left was Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, Master!
Aren’t you going to flee?” Little Qing, within the ten thousand
kilometer formation region, was absolutely frantic. “Not even nine
hundred-plus Fiendgods were able to break through the defenses of
those eight Celestial Immortals. What’s the point of staying there
by yourself? Quick, flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother!” Northson was very worried as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t panic. My
boy Ning isn’t the rash sort.” Uncle White stared off into the
distance. In the heart, he murmured, “Ning, son, be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine Celestial
Immortals in the air now felt far more confidence than they had
earlier. The Ancestor of the Youngflame clan said, “Earlier, you
all suffered attacks from those Fiendgods; your wounds are all
significant. It’s best if you join into a formation to provide
assistance to me…and leave Ji Ning to me. Just assist me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although we are
injured, we’re still able to use thirty to forty percent of our
power. The power of the eight of us, joined forces, is still
significant. Against Ji Ning, there’s no need to use the ‘Eight
Immortals Sea-Subduing Formation’. It’s better if we use the
‘Eight Trigrams Roving Dragon Formation’,” Celestial Immortal
Goldclock said with great confidence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Eight Trigrams
Roving Dragon Formation is more than enough to block Ji Ning’s
attacks.” Even the most careful of them all, Celestial Infatuation,
nodded in agreement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Different formations
naturally had different levels of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eight Immortals
Sea-Subduing Formation was completely focused on defense; it didn’t
have any offensive techniques at all, naturally resulting in an
extremely powerful defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eight Trigrams
Roving Dragon Formation was fairly balanced; its attacks and defenses
were even. After all, the Celestial Immortals now knew how strong
Ning was; they didn’t need to waste too much of their energy on
unnecessary defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, they had
faced nine hundred-plus Fiendgods, with roughly six hundred being
Void-level Fiendgods. In truth, Void-level Fiendgods were generally
on par with the likes of Immortal Northwalker in power; that
Void-level Fiendgod which Ning had encountered in the wild marshes of
the Gaol Mountains had once suffered Immortal Northwalker’s wrath.
Although Void-level Fiendgods had divine abilities to add to their
power, allowing them to become comparable to Celestial
Immortals…their ability to comprehend of the Dao was simply too
low. Once they reached a bottleneck, they might spend a trillion
years at that bottleneck without advancing at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even Mount Innerheart
had quite a few Fiendgods who remained unable to beat the ninth
golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their inferiority in
comprehending the Dao were their greatest weakness!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, while there
were six hundred Void-level Fiendgods…even Patriarch Arcanum who
was the weakest of the eight Celestial Immortals of the Youngflame
clan was far more powerful than the likes of Immortal Northwalker, a
Loose Immortal who lived for a million years! As for Celestial
Immortals Goldclock, Deadwood, and Flamefish, they were even more
powerful. Celestial Immortal Infatuation, in turn, belonged to the
supreme tier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus…it took roughly
ten or so of the Void-level Fiendgods to match a single one of the
Celestial Immortals of the Youngflame clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That great gathering of
Fiendgods, in turn, was just comparable to thirty or fifty Celestial
Immortals of the Youngflame clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When eight Celestial
Immortals completely focused on defense, they would generally be able
to hold off against a group of thirty to fifty Celestial Immortals
for a short period of time. However, those Fiendgods had been too
berserk; although the battle had been very brief, they had still
managed to heavily injure all eight of the Celestial Immortals,
causing even their golden pellet Jindans to be seriously damaged.
They would all require many spirit-pills, medicines, and time to
slowly repair the damage done. Now that they were going to deal with
Ji Ning while heavily injured…the weakest of them, Celestial
Immortal Arcanum, was only able to use perhaps ten to twenty percent
of his full power, while the mighty Celestial Immortal Infatuation
was still able to use fifty to sixty percent. As a whole, the eight
Celestial Immortals were at roughly thirty to forty percent of their
full power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eight Trigrams
Roving Dragon Formation took form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, an enormous
golden set of eight trigram symbols appeared. The eight mighty
Celestial Immortals were the ‘points’ at which the eight trigrams
were located. Around them coiled a golden, roving dragon that hovered
in midair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eight Celestial
Immortals all stared downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Goldclock, once we
trap Ji Ning, you’ll absorb him into your golden greatclock,” the
horned, golden-robed man sent through his divine power. A smile was
on his face, and he was extraordinarily confident right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Ancestor!”
Celestial Immortal Goldclock was extremely excited; they had been
under tremendous pressure when facing so many Fiendgods, but against
this single person, Ji Ning…in addition, given that they had
already battled against Ning within the trapping formation earlier,
they knew how strong he was. This just made them even more confident
of their chances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the ground below.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-intent
surging forth from Ning’s heart was continuously growing in
strength. Ning raised his head to look towards the sky. There were
nine mighty Celestial Immortals in the sky. The ugly, horned,
golden-robed figure produced a horsetail whisk, and before him stood
three enormous insect aberrations. As for the other eight Celestial
Immortals, they were in some sort of Eight Trigrams formation next to
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The eight Celestial
Immortals came under a wild assault from those nine hundred-plus
Fiendgods just now…clearly, they were only just barely able to hold
on. They are probably all heavily injured, but they actually aren’t
retreating and are facing me. They probably don’t hold my strength
in any regard.” After pondering for a moment, Ning immediately knew
what his foes were thinking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…Ning wasn’t
like those Void-level Fiendgods!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His special divine
ability was something more powerful than the likes of the other
divine abilities which most Empyrean Gods or True Gods of Primal
Chaos could come up with. It was the [Starseizing Hand], the supreme
divine ability which Daoist Threelives had once used to roam and
dominate the Primordial Era. The escaped Void-level Fiendgods had all
been born during the creation of this major world of the Grand Xia;
by comparison, their divine abilities were much weaker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s palms, in turn
were akin to supreme Pure Yang treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for his insights
into the Dao…he used to be on par with Patriarch Goldclock, but he
had now completely surpassed him, reaching a new, higher level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, be
careful. This Ji Ning is no ordinary Fiendgod; he is a supremely
talented monster with a very high level of sword-arts. He was
previously able to crush the five of us, and now, although we eight
have joined forces, we are only able to use a portion of our
strength. We must be careful. Let the Ancestor serve as our main
attacker, while we shall serve merely as support,” Celestial
Immortal Infatuation warned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
Infatuation. When the five of us previously used the Five Elements
Mountainhold Formation, we were able to easily block his attacks. Now
that the eight of us have joined into the Eight Trigrams Roving
Dragon Formation…even though we are only at thirty or forty percent
power, our strength is quite close to the level of power which a full
strength Five Elements Mountainhold Formation has. We’ll absolutely
be able to block him,” Celestial Immortal Goldclock said
confidently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” The horned,
golden-robed man immediately gave the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the three
enormous aberrations all charged downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Ning, who had
originally been standing on the ground, suddenly charged into the
skies, moving like a streak of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By comparison, Ning was
like a tiny little dot that was rising, while the three enormous
insectoid aberrations came charging down from above.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Obscuring Wind of
the Nine Heavens]!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! A gust of wind
blew past. Ning, moving at a speed that rendered the Youngflame clan
completely speechless, was actually able to move past all three of
the aberrations. This was an evasive divine ability which Patriarch
Subhuti had specially designed for Ji Ning. Although it could only be
considered a top-class divine ability of the Three Realms, and
couldn’t compare to supreme evasive techniques like the [Wings of
the Garuda], Ning actually wouldn’t have been as fast when using
the [Wings of Garurda]. After all…Ning himself wasn’t a
golden-winged Roc; he was a human. It would be impressive for humans
to be able to use even thirty to fifty percent of a divine ability
designed for birds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too fast.” The
horned, golden-robed man was surprised by this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, be
careful.” The eight Celestial Immortals saw that as Ning used his
evasive divine ability, he was making his way towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tie him down while I
use my insectoid aberrations to attack him,” the horned,
golden-robed man said hurriedly. He had to tie down Ning. Otherwise,
given Ning’s speed…there was no way those insects could catch up
to him at all. Once they actually got into battle, his insectoid
aberrations were more than powerful enough to keep Ning completely
occupied, making it impossible for him to dodge. They would they draw
him into the divine greatclock!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that of the three insectoid aberrations, the winged rhinoceros
creature alone was, in terms of strength, comparable to Ning at full
power. It was precisely due to creatures like this that Immortal
Venomfreak was able to become so famous within the Three Realms;
these aberrations definitely couldn’t be underestimated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Obscuring Wind of
the Nine Heavens] blew forth, and Ning arrived in front of the eight
Celestial Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” The eight
Celestial Immortals stared towards Ning from afar. The giant golden
dragon that had been coiled around them let out an earth-shattering
draconic roar and charged straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s gaze was as
deep and fathomless as the depths of the sea. His six arms instantly
appeared, and the fingers of those six enormous hands, glowing with
golden light, simultaneously formed into a set of sword-fingers,
unleashing techniques that represented the most powerful sword-arts
which Ning had created thus far. Although in terms of profoundness,
some of the other sword-arts Ning had learned in the past were
comparable to this stance he had created…his own stance was the
stance that was most appropriate for him. Only the creator of a
technique would be able to truly unleash its full, maximum power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword-fingers
all became three hundred meters long!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Enormous
sword-fingers…like the fingers of a divinity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time, in
front of the sword-fingers appeared divine black swords that was
fully three thousand meters in length!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As far as the eye could
see…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were six entire
divine black swords that were over three thousand meters long,
gathering the power of heaven and earth within them. One of the
divine black swords chopped directly against the body of the golden
dragon, causing it to shudder and turn dim. The golden dragon roared
as well, furiously striving to resist the sword…but the five of the
other enormous swords stabbed straight towards the Eight Trigrams
Roving Dragon Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The golden Eight
Trigrams symbols trembled, and then with a booming sound completely
blew apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eight Celestial
Immortals were all stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” The
horned, golden-robed man wasn’t too far from them. Shocked, he
hurriedly stretched out the horsetail whisk in his hand…but alas,
distant water is unable to quench thirst.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s attack
speed was extremely fast!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning’s five
sword-fingers, in the form of five divine black swords, stabbed
through the Eight Trigrams Roving Dragon Formation, two of the swords
turned to pierce towards the closest Celestial Immortal, Goldclock.
Goldclock was utterly terrified; he wasn’t able to flee at all, and
so all he could do was immediately unleash his most powerful
treasure, the top-grade Pure Yang divine greatclock. Ignoring the
wounds which his golden pellet Jindan had suffered, he immediately
and frantically began to squeeze every last drop out of it,
struggling to increase his power as much as he could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The divine
greatclock was sent flying from the strike of the first divine black
sword. As for the second divine black sword, it slashed across
Celestial Immortal Goldclock’s body…which was promptly reduced to
ash by what seemed like an endless torrent of sword-ki.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden palm that
had launched the divine black sword that had sent the golden
greatclock flying away swung out, grabbing the now-ownerless
greatclock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Two other streaks
of black sword-light were flying towards the other nearby Celestial
Immortal, Flamefish. Although Celestial Immortal Flamefish also
frantically sought to squeeze as much power from his Jindan as he
could…Ning, even back when he had first trained in the [Starseizing
Hand], was already comparable to Celestial Immortal Infatuation. Now
that he had developed an even more powerful sword technique, he was
clearly much more powerful than before. In addition, his
sword-fingers were akin to a supreme Pure Yang treasure; how could
the likes of Celestial Immortal Flamefish possibly withstand him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two streaks of
sword-light flashed past, and Celestial Immortal Flamefish was
reduced to dust as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other six Celestial
Immortals went absolutely all out, finally managing to block the last
streak of sword-light Ning had sent out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This initial strike by
Ning had claimed the lives of two out of eight Celestial immortals!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“DAMN HIM!” The
distant Ancestor of the Youngflame clan’s eyes turned so wide, his
eyelids threatened to split apart. His eyes were now completely
bloodshot.

be? How could he have broken through a formation of eight Celestial
Immortals?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Didn’t five of our
Celestial Immortals battle Ji Ning within that formation of his? Now
that they know exactly how powerful he is…how could they have made
a mistake on this level?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good heavens!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Loose Immortals and
Earth Immortals were completely dazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortals had
incomparably exalted statuses…and two had just died now, all of a
sudden. And they were Celestial Immortals who had belonged to the
Youngflame clan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, hurry up and
re-launch the evacuation process,” Old Demon Windraiser sent
mentally with a furious roar. “This Ji Ning has a body as tough as
a magic treasure; he doesn’t fear the attacks of Celestial
Immortals. If the Celestial Immortals of our Youngflame clan are
unable to do anything to him…he might start massacring us soon!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, right,
right!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Keep evacuation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quickly!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Loose Immortals and
Earth Immortals who had yet to completely evacuate the mortals and
cultivators in their regions once more began to quickly do so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Woooooooow!”
Little Qing’s eyes bulged out. She looked as though she had seen a
ghost. “Two Celestial Immortals…Celestial Immortals! Those were
Celestial Immortals who had escaped the confines of the Three Realms
after overcoming their Celestial Tribulations! They were far, far
more precious and venerable than Void-level Fiendgods. Celestial
Immortals are so powerful and mighty, but…but two of them just
died?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mu Northson was
speechless as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Uncle White
was even more stunned. A Celestial Immortal! Each served as the
foundations for a truly supreme clan. It was rare for a single one to
be produced in the Grand Xia Dynasty in a million years…and two of
them had just died like that?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at a
distant flying shuttle. The flying shuttle was completely black, and
was roughly three hundred meters long. Just now, all six of the
surviving Celestial Immortals had flown over and hidden themselves
within the flying shuttle; only the horned, golden-robed man remained
outside the shuttle, standing atop it and staring towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They ran pretty
fast,” Ning mumbled to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had suddenly killed
two Celestial Immortals earlier, causing the remaining six Celestial
Immortals to immediately flee into that shuttle. In fact, after they
did so, they had completely sealed off all openings to the flying
shuttle, giving him no chance to attack them at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?!”
The enraged Ancestor glared coldly at Ning from his position atop the
shuttle. He sent an angry mental howl, “Infatuation, didn’t you
say earlier that the eight of you combined were more than enough to
stop him? Didn’t you say that even though his power suddenly
increased significantly after your last ambush, that he’s still
just roughly on par with you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We didn’t know
either!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When we were hiding
at Mu Northson’s place and ambushed him…he truly was quite weak,
even weaker than Goldclock and Deadwood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, right! That
really was the case. And just a short while ago…the five of us
fought against him within his formations. We were quite surprised at
how much his power had increased in merely half a month; he was now
close to Infatuation in power. But now, in the blink of an eye, his
power has increased even more?! He’s even stronger than Infatuation
now!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The amount of time
that passed since our battle was roughly as much as needed to boil a
kettle of tea. How could he have grown so much stronger?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s not that we
were overconfident; it’s that all of this is simply inconceivable!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortals
Infatuation, Deadwood, and Sunfish all felt quite miserable as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They clearly had fought
Ning just a short while ago…but after he had released those nine
hundred-plus Fiendgods, he had grown even more powerful. This rate of
increase in strength was simply too fast! Generally speaking, the
higher one’s level was, the slower one would increase in strength.
It was one thing for Ning to increase so rapidly in power after being
ambushed, but for him to suddenly increase in strength yet again in
the blink of an eye?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn, damn!” The
horned, golden-robed ground his teeth. Any cultivator who was able to
train to the Celestial Immortal level would be extremely cautious; if
they couldn’t win a fight, they would flee. But this time, they
truly had been overconfident, primarily because they had already
fought against Ning and knew exactly how strong he was! This single
instance of overconfidence had cost them two lives.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had gone all out
to fight against the nine hundred-plus Fiendgods. They had survived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Against Ji Ning, they
had been overconfident…and ended up losing two of their ranks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you are
wounded; you are not to interfere in this fight against Ji Ning.
Leave it all to me,” the horned, golden-robed man sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Patriarch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all acknowledged
the command.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The horned,
golden-robed man stared towards the distant Ning, then roared
angrily, “Ji Ning, you’ve slain two Celestial Immortals of my
Youngflame clan. I shall not live under the same skies with you! I
shall kill you. KILL YOU!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…Earlier, when I
was pulling out the copper pillar, didn’t you already swear an oath
that you were going to wipe me out, along with my clan and my
friends? You know, you only need to say nasty words like these a
single time. I’ve already memorized them quite firmly. Don’t
worry…killing two of your Celestial Immortals was just the start.
I’m going to wipe out all of the Celestial Immortals of your
Youngflame clan, as well as all of your Loose Immortals and Earth
Immortals. As for your other cultivators and mortals…I trust I
won’t even need to act against them. There will be plenty of other
major clans that will come to annihilate you,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the saying goes, a
wall falls when many hands push on it. There were many others who had
feuds with the Youngflame clan, such as the Kindwater clan, which was
even stronger than the Youngflame clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And even for those who
didn’t have a feud with the Youngflame clan…given that the
Youngflame clan took up three major commanderies, each of which was
far larger than Stillwater Commandery…there were naturally many
others who were envious of their territory. Once all their Celestial
Immortals died, the cultivators and commoners of the Youngflame clan
would be doomed! They would be effortlessly sweeped aside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All by yourself? I,
Youngflame Freak, have roamed the universe since the Primordial Era,
but no one has ever dared to claim they can kill me.” A savage
light flashed through the eyes of the horned, golden-robed man. “Have
a taste of what my children can do, first!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three enormous
insectoid aberrations flew towards Ning, blotting out the sun with
their size. Their auras were extraordinary in power as they came
rushing towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there in
midair, a tiny little dot by comparison, but one with three heads and
six arms. His arms swept through the air as his golden fingers formed
into sword-fingers, transforming into divine black swords that were
more than three thousand meters in length…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His terrifying
sword-intent radiated outwards. Anyone could sense the resolve
contained within it, and just by looking at it, one could feel as
though no one could possibly withstand his sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! A large wound
appeared on the body of the black viper aberration, but the wound
quickly began to recover, completely healing in the blink of an eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crunch! The winged
rhinoceros-aberration had incomparably tough skin, but Ning was still
able to punch a hole through it. Still, the winged rhinoceros kicked
Ning’s palm aside, and the hole in its flank quickly regenerated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The armored insectoid
aberration had even more powerful defense, and Ning was just barely
able to leave a wound behind on its body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a nasty little
pest.” Ning was secretly startled by this first exchange of blows.
“All three of these aberrations are this powerful?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of their
comprehension of the Dao, the three insectoid aberrations were vastly
inferior to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But their physical
strength and close combat power was simply too great.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each of them had
extremely durable physical forms; even their thick skin and armored
carapaces were comparable to Heaven-ranked magic treasures. The flesh
within their body was extremely sturdy as well, and for every inch of
flesh Ning penetrated, he felt an extremely powerful force resisting
him. And even if he did manage to injure them…they would be able to
heal in a very short period of time! They were also enormously
strong; the black viper and the armored insect were nearly half as
strong as Ning when Ning used the Fourth Cycle of the [Starseizing
Hand] and [Three Heads, Six Arms], while the winged rhinoceros was
comparable to Ning’s full power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Activate!” The
distant horned, golden-robed man watched coldly, then let out a soft
bark. Instantly, the back of the armored insect began to release
large numbers of divine tattoos. These divine tattoos flickered and
flashed, causing the armored insect to rapidly shrink in size, while
beginning to split apart. By the time it shrank to three thousand
meters, it completely split apart to become a pair of the armored
insects. By the time it shrank down to three hundred meters, it had
split apart to become four armored insects. And by the time it shrank
down to thirty meters…there were eight of those armored insects.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“ROAAAAR!” The
winged rhinoceros let out a furious roar, its four powerful
leg-trunks beginning to merge with its main body. From the center of
its body, a single leg-trunk that was even thicker and longer began
to rapidly grow out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four-legged winged
rhinoceros had actually transformed into a single-legged rhinoceros.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hissssss.” The
black viper’s serpentine head suddenly bit down upon its tail.
Instantly, its entire body began to glow with divine tattoos. Its
scales were rapidly changing, becoming even finer and longer while
also beginning to glow with a golden light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” The horned,
golden-robed man had just revealed one of his favorite, consummate
tricks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly
transformed into the [Obscuring Wind of the Nine Heavens], surging
straight towards the winged rhinoceros.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“KILL!” Ning was
charging forward like a brutish Fiendgod, his six massive arms wildly
assaulting the winged rhinoceros in close combat!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang clang clang…the
eight armored insects all struck towards Ning, but Ning completely
ignored them. The only result was a series of clanging sounds that
could be heard from Ning’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! The black
viper, now in circular form, swirled towards Ning, seeking to
entangle him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning swept out with two
of his palms, which struck out like two streaks of sword-light. In
terms of the Dao, how could the viper possibly compare to Ning? He
was struck head-on and knocked flying away by Ning’s sword-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This brat…” The
horned, golden-robed man’s eyes flashed with cold light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His armored insect had
been completely nullified by Ning. He had been hoping that Ning would
be too arrogant and allow the viper to coil around him. Once it
did…no matter how strong he was, he would find it difficult to
escape. But Ning didn’t give the viper any chance at all to draw
near him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die for me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the winged
rhinoceros were battling wildly against each other. Ning was
completely unwounded, while large amounts of flesh and blood were
being sheared off from the winged rhinoceros, under the repeated
blows of Ning’s knife-sharp palms. Finally, with a furious roar
from Ning, the head of the winged rhinoceros was chopped off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?
What should I do? What the hell should I do?” The horned,
golden-robed man felt a sense of powerlessness in his heart, as well
as…hesitation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Should I have other
clones come over here as well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had other insectoid
aberrations!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If all of the insectoid
aberrations he commanded were all to gather here, he would be able to
completely overwhelm and crush Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No. I can’t let
all of my clones appear in one place; that will cause me to risk true
death.” The horned, golden-robed man knew very well that due to his
insidiousness and viciousness, he had many enemies spread throughout
the Three Realms. For example, the Empyrean God of the Kindwater clan
had a very powerful desire to kill him. However, because his many
clones were all scattered throughout the realms, the Empyrean God was
hesitant to make a move, and so had not truly acted to launch a war
to wipe out the Youngflame clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, by relying on the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art], was even more berserk in his attacks than
the three insectoid aberrations. After he forcibly ripped off the
head of the winged rhinoceros, the skeleton of the winged rhinoceros
flew back towards the horned, golden-robed man. It transformed back
into a winged rhinoceros, but one which was only three thousand
meters in length, then flew back into the mouth of the horned,
golden-robed man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“TEAR APART!”
Ning’s six arms now began to wildly assault the black viper. Two of
his arms moved to chop a wound in the body of the black viper, while
the other four arms grabbed onto it and gave a vicious tug in two
opposite directions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Riiiiiiiip.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black viper was
forcibly torn apart, its black, foul-smelling bloody spraying
everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was fighting even
more savagely than he usually did. The three insectoid aberrations,
in the face of his fury, were at a complete disadvantage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should we do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that our
Youngflame clan cannot resist this Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ning is too
terrifying!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Loose Immortals and
Earth Immortals who were hiding behind their formations were filled
with terror at what they were seeing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Windraiser, all of
the mortals within the protective formations have been evacuated.
Even if Ji Ning breaks the formations, he can forget about harming
our clansmen.” The Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals viewed Old
Demon Windraiser as their leader; in the Oldjade mountain range, Old
Demon Windraiser had an extremely high status.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Demon Windraiser
nodded. “Give me your Qiankun pearls.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The
Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals all handed over their Qiankun
pearls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qiankun pearls were
residence-type magic treasures! Generally speaking, Celestial
Immortals who had a very solid grasp of the Dao of Qiankun would be
able to establish a small dimension within a Qiankun pearl. In truth,
these were very common treasures, similar to sacks and bags that had
private dimensions within them, except these were used to collect and
hold people! The space within a Qiankun pearl wasn’t that small,
being over ten thousand kilometers, but there were no resources
within them; there was no way life could be supported within them
long-term. They could only be used to temporarily hold living
creatures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, they were
perfectly suited for moving or evacuating populations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Old Demon
Windraiser accepted all of the Qiankun pearls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” The horned,
golden-robed man was utterly enraged by what he saw, but he was
unable to do anything to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wildly assaulted
the black viper, but even after ripping it apart, the black viper
merely transformed into two smaller vipers. Still…its aura had
noticeably weakened, and Ning continued his assault against it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…a spatial
ripple appeared. It was Greater Teleportation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?!” Ning turned,
only to see that Old Demon Windraiser had appeared in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old Demon Windraiser
didn’t die?” Ning was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Windraiser, don’t
go crazy!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Windraiser, go
back!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortals
Arcanum, Infatuation, and the others were using their coresense to
watch the battle. Upon seeing Old Demon Windraiser appear, they all
hurriedly sent mental messages, calling out to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He killed my
disciple and destroyed my true body. I cannot live under the same
heavens as him!” Old Demon Windraiser suddenly waved his hand,
causing a dense cluster of hundreds of spots of starlight to appear.
The air above him was also filled with the enormous illusion of the
Solar Star, and all these things flew straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was cold and
uncaring. “You, Old Demon, had a Primaltwin? I didn’t go kill
you, but you came to throw your life away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How could Ning possibly
hold Old Demon Windraiser in any regard? He immediately swept out
with his own palm to attack. His golden palm smashed apart everything
that came before him. Bang! Bang! Bang! The hundreds of miniature
stars were instantly knocked flying away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A very peculiar sound
rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like…an egg
cracking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But those hundreds of
star-grains were a set of Immortal-ranked magic treasures; how could
Ning have shattered Immortal-ranked magic treasures with a single
palm?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AHHHHHH!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“NOOO!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“NOOOOO!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless miserable
screams rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a special
region. Countless mortals and cultivators were all squeezed together.
These were the evacuated cultivators and mortals…but this region
was beginning to crumble and break apart. Although this was merely a
small pocket dimension…with the dimensional walls crumbling, how
could mortals possibly survive? All of them were ground apart and
killed. Only some of the more powerful cultivators were able to
survive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A few people suddenly
appeared in the region before Ning’s giant golden palm. These were
the Immortal cultivators who had survived the collapse of that pocket
dimension…but the power of Ning’s earlier blow was simply too
great. Even the mere aftershock from his blow was enough to cause
these newly emerged Immortal cultivators to be instantly blown into
dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Infinite
despair…despair that filled the skies…it all swept towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Infinite resentment!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Infinite hate!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…I don’t want
to die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh gods…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who…who…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who killed us?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless voices rang
out in Ning’s mind, assailing his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahahaha!” The
distant Old Demon Windraiser was absolutely berserk in his laughter.
“You’ve killed ten billion mortals…what a sinner…what a
tremendous sinner!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The skies instantly
turned blood red, so red that it was utterly terrifying to behold, so
densely red that it caused everyone’s heart to tremble. The
terrifying redness appeared out of nowhere, and it appeared
simultaneously in the skies above Ji Ning and Old Demon Windraiser.
These were the legendary…karmic sinflames!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two clouds of
bloody red karmic sinflames reflected and resonated with each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The karmic
sinflames…descended!

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red karmic
sinflames were terrifying to behold…but they also had a strange,
holy aura about them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They existed purely for
the sake of burning away all sin!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AHHHH!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In midair, Ji Ning’s
eyes turned completely red. He frantically clutched at his head as he
fell down from the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Still Room
of the underwater estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed
Primaltwin Ning had originally been seated in the lotus position atop
the netherwater jade bed, but his body was now blazing with red
karmic sinflames as well. The black-robed Primaltwin Ning was now
kneeling on the netherwater jade bed, letting out howls of utter
agony and misery. He crawled forward in utter pain, falling down from
the bed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…no…” The
black-robed Primaltwin Ning let out an agonized howl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the outside world,
Ning fell down from the skies. As he fell, he clutched at his head,
letting out terrifying, frenzied, throat-tearing howls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He didn’t die?”
The Ancestor of the Youngflame clan was extremely shocked. The other
six Celestial Immortals had joined him outside, atop the flying
shuttle. They, too, looked with shock and delight upon this scene.
They said in amazement, “He actually didn’t instantly die from
burning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Old Demon
Windraiser continued to hover in midair. Surrounded by karmic
sinflames, he actually let out laughter that caused one’s heart to
shudder. His face was utterly contorted, and his eyes were blood-red.
Pain wracked every single cell of his body, but he continued to laugh
wildly. “It really is…really is…even more fun…than the
million-year Three Calamities, Nine
Tribulations…ahahaha…ahahahaha!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Demon Windraiser
was filled with the agony of being burned by karmic sinflames as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Windraiser’s
Dao-heart is no weaker than my own,” Celestial Immortal Infatuation
said. “For even him to be in such agony…it’s utterly
inconceivable for this Ji Ning, who has trained for less than a
century, to actually stay alive and not perish instantly from the
descent of karmic sinflames.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. He’s
trained for less than a century, but his Dao-heart is actually this
strong…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When karmic
sinflames descend, they shall unleash multiple layers of punishment.
This is but the start.” The Ancestor of the Youngflame clan said in
a low voice, “I refuse to believe Ji Ning will be able to survive
it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Karmic sinflames…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were the holy
flames that burned away sin. They represented the umost limits of
sin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These flames were the
flames of the void, flames that burned away at the soul, at the
heart!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They actually weren’t
that harmful to the physical body; after all, the heavens always gave
one at least a slight chance for survival. If karmic sinflames were
to burn away at the body as well, then Fiendgod sinners would have
too much of an unfair advantage compared to Ki Refiner sinners.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But although it didn’t
harm the body that much…it was utterly terrifying in turns of the
damage it did when burning the soul! Even someone like Ning, who had
trained in the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], had no advantages whatsoever
in facing these karmic sinflames…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When facing karmic
sinflames, all cultivators were treated absolutely equally. The only
test right now was of one’s Dao-heart. Would one’s Dao-heart be
able to survive while being incinerated by karmic sinflames?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once one’s Dao-heart
crumbled, the soul would be unprotected and would be instantly burnt
to ashes and dissipated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Luckily enough, Ning
had just come up with the tenth stance of the [Three-Foot Sword]. His
Dao-heart now contained the resolve that was embodied in the lines,
‘Where the Dao is, though ten million soldiers bar my path, I shall
relentlessly advance!’ This allowed Ning’s Dao-heart to survive
the first round of punishment unleashed by the karmic sinflames;
‘Agony’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He
actually…hasn’t…hasn’t died…what a monster!” Old Demon
Windraiser’s entire body was wracked by pain as he stared downwards
at the fallen Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Demon Windraiser’s
Dao-heart was extremely strong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had already lived
for a million years. Three Calamities, Nine Tribulations…every
three hundred years, a calamity; every nine hundred years, a
tribulation. He had endured countless cycles of the Three Calamities,
Nine Tribulations over the past million years. Under this sort of
constant pressure, his Dao-heart had actually transformed and grown
incredibly powerful, with the result being that he had found even the
Three Calamities, Nine Tribulations at the million-year mark to be
quite easy to overcome.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clearly, his Dao-heart
was far more powerful than Immortal Northwalker’s had been. It was
comparable to that of many Celestial Immortals…and even amongst
Celestial Immortals, he would probably be ranked at the very top.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the first
round of punishment brought by karmic sinflames, ‘Agony’, was
extremely painful…he was still able to maintain consciousness. He
was even able to open his mouth and speak, albeit haltingly; clearly,
he was far more powerful than Ning in this regard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within their ten
thousand kilometer formation, the Whitewater Hound, Little Qing, and
Mu Northson were completely stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They stared at the
blood-red skies, as well as the blood-red karmic sinflames that had
appeared around Ning’s body. Upon seeing the karmic sinflames
appear…they all immediately were able to guess at what had
happened. They watched as Ning had let out an agonized, frenzied
scream, then collapse from the skies…and their hearts became filled
with despair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Karmic sinflames…how
could Master have caused karmic sinflames to descend?!” Little Qing
was utterly horrified.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could…senior
apprentice-brother…senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning…” Northson
was so frantic, he was shaking. “It’s all because of me…because
of me…no…don’t…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
stared at Ning, who had fallen down from the skies. Watching the
karmic sinflames roast Ning, Uncle White’s tears instantly began to
streak down his face. “Ning, son…son…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Despair!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were all Immortal
cultivators; they knew how terrifying karmic sinflames were, as well
as the fact that when they descended, nobody could help out at all.
To survive the descent of karmic sinflames was simply far, far too
difficult; only truly powerful figures with incomparably mighty
Dao-hearts would be able to survive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning had only
trained for less than a century! Although he was publicly acclaimed
for having a firm Dao-heart, having a strong sword-heart, and being a
born Sword Immortal…he simply hadn’t trained for long enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The punishment brought
by karmic sinflames would come in repeated waves that only increased
in power and terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son, you have
to endure it…you have to.” The Whitewater Hound stared towards
Ning. “I promised Big Brother to take care of you, to always
protect you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the flying
shuttle. The Ancestor of the Youngflame clan and his six mighty
Celestial Immortals were also watching the fallen Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually didn’t
die right away from the descent of karmic sinflames.” Patriarch
Arcanum said hurriedly, “Ancestor, the punishment brought by karmic
sinflames will grow increasingly powerful…but to prevent a miracle
from happening which results in this punk surviving, let’s suppress
him right away. He’s completely unable to fight back right now;
this is the perfect time to trap and suppress him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Celestial
Immortal Infatuation nodded as well. “Although I don’t believe Ji
Ning will survive, if by some miracle he does survive…it’s best
to suppress him now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Supress him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s a shame that
Goldclock died, and his divine greatclock was stolen by Ji Ning as
well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I naturally have
other suppressive treasures. Although they aren’t comparable to the
divine greatclock, one is still a middle-grade Pure Yang treasure;
there’s no way he can escape.” The Youngflame Ancestor suddenly
waved his hands, producing a pair of copper cymbals. He threw them
out, and the pair instantly expanded in size, transforming into
copper cymbals that were more than three hundred meters long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The copper cymbals
split apart, one flying to be above Ji Ning while the other flew
underneath him. Once the pair of copper cymbals came together once
more…there would be no way for him to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes were
completely red, and his face was completely distorted with agony. He
couldn’t help but let out roars of agony…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…but his Dao-heart
hadn’t dissipated yet!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He still maintained a
single thread of consciousness. He could see what was going on in the
outside world, but everything he saw was twisted and blurry. This was
because his eyes were too bloodshot right now; if they were just a
bit more bloodshot, he would probably be completely blind! When these
two giant copper cymbals came to surround him, Ning immediately
struck out with his two arms. Bang! Bang! He instantly knocked the
two copper cymbals flying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s actually
still able to pay attention to the outside world?” The Ancestor of
the Youngflame clan was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if he is…the
amount of intellect he’s able to use right now must be very, very
low,” Celestial Immortal Infatuation said. “He’s like a beast,
right now; all he knows to do is to knock away anything dangerous. He
doesn’t even know to flee! He could’ve just used his evasive
techniques to dodge, but he didn’t move at all; from this, one can
tell that his intellect has dropped to a very, very low level right
now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s all act
together. Perhaps we can trap him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s give it a
shot.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six Celestial
Immortals all moved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Black chains flew out.
Thousands of tendrils and vines whipped out. The strands of an
enormous horsetail flywhisk that was thirty thousand meters long flew
forth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everything in front of
Ning was blurry, but he did see many vines swinging towards him. He
struggled to wave his arms about, using the [Starseizing Hand] to
knock all the magic treasures flying and away from his body. The
tendrils all completely snapped apart, unable to even draw near him.
After all, these Celestial Immortals were all heavily wounded; when
controlling magic treasures from afar, how could their power possibly
compare to the power of Ning’s twin arms?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if the six
Celestial Immortals were to use a formation, given how badly injured
they were, they still wouldn’t be able to withstand Ning’s
[Starseizing Hand].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mmm…he really does
seem like a wild beast. Anything that gets close to him, he’ll
wildly lash out at and knock away.” The Youngflame Ancestor nodded
lightly. “I have an idea…one that will ensure his death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” They all
looked towards the Ancestor, save for Celestial Immortal Infatuation,
who suddenly said, “Can it be…the Worldhold Pagoda?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Infatuation read my
mind.” The Youngflame Ancestor nodded lightly. “Fortunately, when
I came out of seclusion this time, Arcanum and the others came over
as well. There was no one left to guard the pagoda, and so I brought
it over here as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A small pagoda suddenly
appeared within the Youngflame Ancestor’s hands. This was the
ancient pagoda which Celestial Immortal Arcanum and the others had
been guarding previously. This pagoda…it was truly the most
important of all treasures which the Youngflame clan had. To the
Youngflame clan, the most important person was naturally the
Youngflame Ancestor, Immortal Venomfreak, who had countless clones
spread everywhere. Only second to him in importance was this
Worldhold Pagoda.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a Protocosmic
spirit-treasure, the greatest treasure which Immortal Venomfreak had
acquired over the course of countless ages.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The small
pagoda within the Youngflame Ancestor’s hand flew out, transforming
into a pagoda that was thirty thousand meters tall. The pagoda hung
high in the air, hovering roughly three thousand meters above him.
The Youngflame Ancestor and the others had noticed earlier than three
thousand meters seemed to be a limit; once one went beyond that range
and moved closer to Ji Ning, Ji Ning would instantly begn to strike
and knock things flying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning…I’ll
send you on your way,” the Youngflame Patriarch said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The entire
surface of the pagoda suddenly lit up, especially at the base where a
giant black vortex suddenly formed. The vortex began to quickly
spread outwards, soon covering a region of a hundred kilometers.
Naturally, this completely covered the area where Ning was located as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everything within the
area was completely drawn in by the whirlpool.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Normally, the
quick-witted Ning would’ve immediately noticed that something was
wrong. He would’ve immediately departed from this region…but Ning
was currently clutching his head in utter agony, the karmic sinflames
blazing around his body gradually increasing in power. In fact…the
second round of punishments was about to descend. The single thought
in his mind was to prevent any magic treasures or spells from drawing
near his body; how could he possibly have the presence of mind to
notice anything else that was amiss?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The pagoda began to
glow brighter and brighter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then….whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The very tip of the
pagoda suddenly grew blindingly bright. Swish! A streak of light shot
from it into the skies, as though piercing through the walls of
reality itself…then vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the vortex
region of a hundred kilometers…it had become completely empty. Ji
Ning had completely vanished. He had vanished from the world of the
Grand Xia…and in fact, he had even vanished from the Three Realms
themselves. He was now outside the Three Realms…
