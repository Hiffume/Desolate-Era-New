Chapter 1 - The Emperor’s Decree
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My imperial Xiamang
clan is the successor to and has the bloodline of the imperial ‘Xia
clan’ of the Primordial World of Pangu. We long ago unified this
major world and have cultivated it for countless years. I then
apprenticed myself to Master, who once said…in terms of strength of
karmic luck, the major world of the Grand Xia Dynasty ranks as number
one amongst the tens of major worlds under his control. With so much
karmic luck present here, the upcoming tremors that are going to give
birth to some peerless heroes will very likely give birth to them
right here, in the world of the Grand Xia!” The black-robed Emperor
was pondering this matter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master is someone
who mastered a Heavenly Dao. Even in the Three Realms, he is one of
the most absolutely supreme of major powers…but even he is worried
about the major storm that is going to sweep the Three Realms…if I
am careless, the imperial clan of the Grand Xia might be wiped out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew very well that
his master was one of the truly supreme powers of the Three Realms,
with tens of major worlds that completely obeyed his orders. The
Grand Xia’s world was just one of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Celestial
Emperor?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Emperor
was nothing more than a person who was in charge of administrating
and managing some of the rules of the Three Realms. In terms of power
and authority, the Celestial Emperor wasn’t that much higher than
the Grand Xia Emperor, much less his master. Only individuals on the
level of his master were hegemons who truly governed the destiny of
the Three Realms. In the past, when there had been some disturbances
in the Three Realms, quite a few Celestial Emperors had been
appointed. Who would be the Celestial Emperor? This was something
that would be decided by the supreme experts on his master’s level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If even someone like
Master is worried, then his disciples, such as myself, have a very
high chance of falling. I must be absolutely cautious, as careful as
I can.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Emperor
had lived from the era of the Primordial World until this era; in the
past, he had led his tribe from the Primordial World and relocated to
this world, later known as the world of the ‘Grand Xia Dynasty’.
He had battled against the local Fiendgods and the other tribes
before finally unifying the world. He wasn’t an easy person to deal
with!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew exactly what
needed to do in order to survive a major cataclysm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to befriend
even more experts of the Three Realms. It would be ideal if some of
them were willing to put themselves under my command. My luck would
improve significantly if they did.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“During this Conclave
of Immortal Destiny, I imagine that future experts of the Three
Realms will be born.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed
Emperor’s eyes were hooded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…from afar, a
figure appeared atop the clouds. This man was dressed in long yellow
robes that were embroidered with the image of a Raindragon. His face
was round, with soft lines, but his eyes were like the stars
themselves. He…was King Qi! A Celestial Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I bow before you,
your Imperial Majesty,” King Qi said, bowing respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“King Qi, have any
major matters occurred during this period of time when I was gone?”
The black-robed Emperor asked. Normally, it was the Emperor’s
clansmen and senior officials who managed the major affairs of the
empire; only the truly major matters would be reported to the
Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Imperial
Majesty, you already know that King Yan has become a Celestial
Immortal. As for other matters…nothing major has occurred.
Everything in the Grand Xia Dynasty is rather peaceful,” King Qi
said respectfully. The death of Youngflame Nong? Forget about the
next Godplume Duke; even if the current Godplume Duke died, it would
be a petty, minor matter that was not worth mentioning to the
Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, if a
Celestial Immortal like Patriarch Arcanum perished, it would be worth
reporting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The
black-robed Emperor nodded. “There are a few months left before the
Conclave of Immortal Destiny. Have you heard any unusual news
regarding this Conclave?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Conclave?”
King Qi was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Conclave of
Immortal Destiny was carried out every three centuries. For
short-lived Immortal cultivators, this was something that happened
only once in a lifetime, but for someone as exalted as the Grand Xia
Emperor…the Emperor had lived for so incomparably long that for
him, the tricentennial Conclave was quite a ordinary, regular event.
He might spend ten thousand years in a single closed-door meditation
session; he normally wouldn’t pay any attention to the Conclave. It
would be his subordinates, the Celestial Immortals, who would spend a
bit of time on it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For Celestial Immortals
to officiate over it was already putting it on a very high pedestal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I must point out
something unusual regarding this Conclave of Immortal Destiny…”
King Qi pondered for a moment as he thought about an intelligence
report that had been delivered to him by the Heavenly Treasures
Mountain, then said, “I suppose there is something. In past
Conclaves, some of the truly proud and peerless geniuses would
disdain from attending…but all of the extremely famous peerless
geniuses are attending this time. In terms of quality, the
competitors in this Conclave should be exceptionally high.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Peerless geniuses
wouldn’t necessarily take part in the Conclave of Immortal Destiny.
Because of their own personality, characters, and training
techniques, quite a few would not attend. For example, the Sloppy
Daoist had originally not been planning to attend at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The
black-robed Emperor nodded lightly. Indeed; the signs were all there.
Luck, the invisible intrinsic, was beginning to gather.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This Conclave of
Immortal Destiny was going to be one of the places where karmic luck
would gather. Those peerless geniuses would innately be drawn to
attend, because the most outstanding of them would gain the blessing
of even more luck, allowing their future potential to be limitless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I shall personally
host this Conclave of Immortal Destiny,” the black-robed Emperor
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Persona-” King Qi
said, astonished, “The Conclave happens every three centuries; it
isn’t that important. Your Imperial Majesty, you are going to
personally host it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Emperor
nodded. “Yes. I shall personally host it, and I am going to
increase the rewards for this Conclave a hundredfold as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A hundredfold?”
King Qi’s heart shook. In the past, only the top three competitors
of the Conclave would be bestowed an Immortal-ranked magic treasure.
Then this time…?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spread my command to
the various marquisates and the major schools and sects of the
world,” the black-robed Emperor said calmly. “Tell them that I am
paying close attention to this Conclave, and that I will personally
officiate over it. Have the various marquisates, schools, and sects
all arrange for their most supremely talented disciples to attend
this Conclave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Command?” King Qi
was even more speechless. The question of participation was generally
a matter of personal choice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“King Qi, you should
know about the major upheavals that occurred in the Netherworld
Kingdom a few decades ago, yes?” The black-robed Emperor looked at
King Qi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I do. Of course I
know about the collapse of the Six Paths of Reincarnation. But what
does this have to do with the Conclave of Immortal Destiny…?”
King Qi had some vague premonitions, but because his vision was
limited to this major world, he didn’t truly understand. In his
heart, however, he understood that most likely it was the prior
upheavals in the Netherworld Kingdom which caused the Emperor to pay
such attention to this Conclave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If that was the case,
then he definitely could not be negligent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll send your
commands right away,” King Qi immediately said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good. Arrange for
the opening ceremony of the Conclave to be on the sixteenth of the
first lunar month,” the black-robed Emperor ordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” King Qi
acknowledged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the news that his
Imperial Majesty the Grand Xia Emperor was going to personally host
this Conclave of Immortal Destiny and was ordering the various
marquisates, schools, and sects to arrange for their most elite of
disciples to participate quickly spread from the imperial capital to
the entirety of this major world. The countless marquises of this
vast world, as well as the major powers located in the boundless
seas, all received the Emperor’s commands!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Emperor is going
to personally officiate?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The last time the
Emperor officiated a Conclave of Immortal Destiny was back when the
revolting Dong’e clan and the other clans were annihilated. That
was already countless years ago…and the only time that he
officiated before that was the during the very first Conclave. Why is
the Emperor going to host the Conclave of Immortal Destiny this
time?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the marquises,
major schools, and major sects were all uneasy. They weren’t
worried about the deaths of their Wanxiang Disciples; even if all of
them perished, that would simply mean that there would be a gap at a
certain level of experts for a few centuries, after which new
geniuses would have arisen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What they were worried
about was what the Emperor was planning. This was the Emperor who
controlled the destiny of this entire major world! He was going to
personally officiate, and had send commands to them…the hidden
meaning behind this was extraordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch, it was
the Emperor who officiated over the very first Conclave of Immortal
Destiny; he also officiated the Conclave that occurred after the
revolting Dong’e clan was wiped out. This will be only the third
time the Emperor is personally hosting the Conclave…there must be a
reason behind it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough. Don’t
trouble yourself about it. How can someone like you possibly
comprehend the thoughts of someone as exalted as his Imperial
Majesty? Even if he ordered all of the younger geniuses in our clan
to go die, we would still obey. Arrange for the top three Wanxiang
Disciples of the younger generation in our clan to go attend this
Conclave of Immortal Destiny. As for the others…let them do as they
please.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Summon the three
Sacred Childs. They are to prepare to join the Conclave of Immortal
Destiny.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Sacred Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The five highest
ranked disciples of our school, Heaven’s Equal, are all required to
participate in the Conclave of Immortal Destiny. As for the others,
they can do as they please.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Supreme One.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not a single one of the
many powerful forces of the world of the Grand Xia dared to disobey.
Those who received the orders were all at least on the level of the
Northmont clan of Stillwater. As for the likes of the Black-White
College? They weren’t even qualified to receive these orders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another winter had
arrived. The sun shone down on the accumulated snow, making it gleam
brightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Yuchi Xiyue,
Yu Wei, Mu Northson, Adept Vastriver, and the Sloppy Daoist were all
together, drinking Immortal nectar, eating seafood, and chatting
casually.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The order has
already come down from within the imperial citadel,” Xiyue said
with a laugh. “The date of this Conclave has been set down as the
sixteenth of the first lunar month. A little more than a month
remains now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single Conclave
was hosted during the first lunar month.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was wandering the
imperial capital the other day, and when I was eating, I heard people
next to me chatting. They said that three of the nine top-ranked
disciples of their school had arrived, and that various other figures
from other schools had arrived as well. It seems as though very many
geniuses are participating this time.” Northson, holding a
beasthead goblet of wine, spoke quite excitedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From the
intelligence reports I purchased from the Heavenly Treasures
Mountain, I can see that one batch after another of geniuses are
gathering here at the imperial capital,” Yu Wei said solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiyue said with a
laugh, “It seems as though you don’t know enough of the inner
details; in reality, it will be his Imperial Majesty, the Emperor
himself, who will personally officiate over this Conclave of Immortal
Destiny. The various schools, sects, and marquisates are all
naturally sending their most talented geniuses over, in the hopes of
ingratiating themselves with his Imperial Majesty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His Imperial Majesty
is personally officiating?” Ning, Yu Wei, and the Sloppy Daoist
were all surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Actually, all of the
marquisates know about this matter, and I imagine some of the
peerless geniuses of the various schools know as well. However, they
don’t dare to casually discuss this with others,” Xiyue said.
“I’m letting you know now, but don’t let others know.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were still in a state of shock. The Grand Xia Emperor? The person who
unified this entire major world? Someone who stood at the true peak
of this land?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
couldn’t help but feel even more eager now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As time flowed out,
more and more geniuses arrived at the imperial capital of the Grand
Xia. In fact, there were some people who originally hadn’t planned
to come, but decided to hurry over specifically because they heard
that a truly staggering number of geniuses was attending this
Conclave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed in the
blink of an eye…and it was now the sixteenth day of the first lunar
month.

Chapter 2 - The World-Guarding Formation
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The day was just
beginning. The Wanxiang Adepts who were scattered in residences
throughout the imperial capital, as well as the 3600 marquises and
their entourages, were all floating towards the imperial citadel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many people.”
Ji Ning, Yu Wei, and the Sloppy Daoist were currently flying together
shoulder-to-shoulder on a cloud towards the imperial capital.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, where are the others?” The Sloppy Daoist seemed
to have just woken up. He asked, puzzled, “Why haven’t junior
apprentice-brother Vastriver and the others shown up?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed, “Junior
apprentice-brother Northson and senior apprentice-brother Vastriver
have gone to go join with the main delegation from Stillwater
Commandery. His Imperial Majesty is personally officiating over this
Conclave, and delegations have come from all 3600 commanderies to pay
their respects to his Imperial Majesty. They have to be alongside the
Stillwater delegation; otherwise, they won’t even be able to enter
the imperial citadel.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” The Sloppy
Daoist nodded, now understanding. “I thought anyone who wanted to
go watch could just go in and watch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, all you ever do is train. You should at least
read some of the intelligence reports,” Yu Wei said helplessly.
“How can just anyone come and watch the Conclave of Immortal
Destiny? Do you think the imperial citadel is just a place anyone can
enter?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well, I’m always
in closed-door training, so…” the Sloppy Daoist scratched his
head, grinning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning explained, “There
are three types of people who are entering the imperial citadel
today. The first type consists of Wanxiang Adepts like us; because we
are going to risk our lives in battle, we can just go in directly.
The second type consists of the delegations that are led by the
various marquises who are going to go pay their respects to his
Imperial Majesty. The third type consists of the likes of Celestial
Immortals, such as King Yan, who can take Princess Xiyue directly
into the citadel. As for others? There might be some exceptional,
powerful figures who can enter the citadel, but I wouldn’t know
anything about that.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist
nodded in understanding.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment,
as they were speaking, Ning’s group had flown through the clouds
and arrived at a large street. In the distance, they could see those
four massive Fiendgods that were thirty thousand meters tall who were
guarding the gates to the imperial citadel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooosh. One squad
after another of Immortal cultivators flew past, either in groups of
two or three, or in giant delegations. All of them were flying
towards the imperial citadel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the gates to
the imperial citadel remained shut.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, Ning’s group
arrived as well, and they landed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many people.”
The Sloppy Daoist looked around at his surroundings. A vast, tightly
packed cluster of more than a hundred thousand individuals had
already gathered outside the imperial citadel. Some were here to
participate in the Conclave, but most were here to spectate. A
steady, unbroken stream of Immortal cultivators continued to descend
from the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We might as well
wait patiently. When the nine gongs ring out, the citadel gates will
open,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They waited for nearly
two hours. The Golden Crow had already risen high into the sky, and
the light of the sun shone down upon the entire imperial capital.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!
CLANG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nine consecutive gongs
rang out. The sound was melodious, seeming to come down from the Nine
Heavens, causing the million-plus individuals who had gathered
outside the imperial citadel to all quiet down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">RUUUMBLE!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tall gates of the
imperial citadel suddenly swung open. The four massive Fiendgods
stared down at the million-plus humans. One of them, a fire-spewing,
fire-skinned Fiendgod, spoke out: “Wanxiang Adepts who wish to
participate in the Conclave of Immortal Destiny, you can now enter
the imperial capital. If you enter, then you must participate in the
Conclave; there will be no chance to change your mind. You may now
enter!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, with a
series of whooshes, a vast locust swarm of figures all began to fly
towards the imperial citadel’s gates, blocking out the skies as
they did so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How many people is
this?!” The Sloppy Daoist’s eyes were completely round.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Normally, each
Conclave of Immortal Destiny will generally have twenty or thirty
thousand competitors,” Ning said with a laugh. “In this
Conclave…since his Imperial Majesty is personally hosting it, this
Conclave is extraordinarily special, and I estimate that there should
be roughly a hundred thousand or so.” Much of this information had
come to Ning via his cousin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“On average, each
commandery has sent thirty individuals?” The Sloppy Daoist pondered
on this. “It seems as though 99% of the formidable elites of the
world have all come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Conclave of
Immortal Destiny is different from normal ones,” Yu Wei said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As they flew into the
imperial capital, they saw a wide, spacious thoroughfare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those who shall
participate in the Conclave of Immortal Destiny, follow me!” A
deep, booming voice shook the heavens. Up ahead, a squad of Imperial
Guards had appeared in midair, and they were guiding the way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They followed the wide
thoroughfare and quickly arrived at an incomparably vast plaza. This
plaza was so large that one couldn’t see to the end of it with the
naked eye alone. It was paved with pitch-black stones, and the
pavestones were all covered with incomparably complicated runes. The
runes covered the entire plaza, causing it to emanate a terrifying,
heart-freezing aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those who shall
participate in the Conclave are all to wait in this region,” the
Imperial Guards up ahead instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Almost none of these
geniuses and talents from around the world had ever been in the
imperial capital. They were all rather awestruck, and they behaved
obediently, all moving towards the designated region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Imperial Guards
quickly split apart, forming a perimeter that completely surrounded
the region. They stood there with blank faces, not moving at all.
These Imperial Guards also knew that today, his Imperial Majesty, the
Emperor, was going to be personally hosting the Conclave of Immortal
Destiny. It was rare for Imperial Guards like them to encounter his
Imperial Majesty; how could they not be extremely earnest and serious
today?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine that this
plaza is at least ten thousand kilometers wide.” The chubby Sloppy
Daoist lowered his heads, inspecting the runes. “And it contains an
extremely terrifying formation, one that vastly surpasses any I have
ever sensed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Yu Wei had
a solemn look on her face as well as she carefully inspected the
plaza.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The voice of the giant
yellow bear rang out in Ning’s mind. “It seems as though the
roots of this Grand Xia Dynasty of yours are actually quite deep.
Based on what I can tell from the runic formations covering this
plaza…it should be a single formation-diagram! This
formation-diagram was formed from the linkage of more than three Pure
Yang magic treasures, and more than a thousand Immortal-ranked magic
treasures. With but a thought, the Grand Xia Emperor could probably
activate this titanic formation, formed from all those treasures. A
formation formed from so many treasures…it should be a vast
formation designed to safeguard his headquarters, and also to
safeguard this entire major world of yours. Formidable, formidable.
Incredible! I imagine that even most Pure Yang True Immortals are
unable to lay such a grand formation; the person who laid out this
world-guarding formation is absolutely one of the truly top powers of
the Three Realms, most likely on par with Master himself!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning was
shocked. Comparable with Daoist Threelives? A formation which even
most Pure Yang True Immortals would not be able to establish? A
world-guarding formation? Meant to protect this entire major world?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What Ning didn’t
know…was that the guess of the spirit of the underwater estate was
absolutely correct. Although this ancient world-guarding formation
hadn’t been established by the master of the Grand Xia Emperor, and
had instead been set up by another major power who was equivalent to
him in power…it was indeed meant to protect this entire major
world, and the headquarters of the Grand Xia Dynasty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If the Emperor of
your Grand Xia is a Pure Yang True Immortal…with a formation like
this at his back, there are extremely few figures in the entirety of
the Three Realms who can do anything to him at all. The major powers
who are capable of acting against him, upon seeing the world-guarding
formation, would probably give face to the major power who set up the
formation and stay their hands.” The giant yellow bear said.
“Formidable, formidable! The background of your Grand Xia Emperor
is truly exceptional. He lives up to his reputation as someone
capable of controlling an entire major world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The spirit of the
underwater estate was tremendously experienced; at a single glance,
he could tell how extraordinary the Grand Xia Emperor’s background
was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then would his
Imperial Majesty be able to discover your presence?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry at
all. Even the supreme major power who set up this formation would at
most notice something unique about the underwater estate, but they
can forget about trying to spy inside it. This is, after all, the
treasure which Master poured all of his efforts into as his legacy.”
The giant yellow bear was extremely confident.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble! Rumble! Rumble!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and all of the
other Wanxiang Adept participants of the Conclave all turned to look.
One delegation after another, in absolute perfect formation, came
flying over. They came over methodically, clearly understanding quite
a bit about the rules of propriety. By contrast, Ning and the other
geniuses had all flown in like a horde of locusts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“3600 commanderies,
and the four seas…” Ning could immediately tell that all of these
delegations were split up by commanderies. The delegations all flew
in, then settled down onto the plaza.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stillwater
Commandery.” Yu Wei pointed towards the distance. Ning and the
Sloppy Daoist both looked over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Stillwater
delegation was led by a tall, skinny, black-robed man. His aura was
heroic and majestic, and his bearing was extraordinary as well. It
was the Marquis of Stillwater. Behind him was a group of Northmont
clansmen. Amongst them, Ning noticed Northmont Baiwei, who was
obediently following within the crowd. Behind them were ten-plus
individuals from the Black-White College, as well as representatives
from the Dragonhunter clan, the Bluewood clan, and the other major
clans of Stillwater Commandery. The entire Stillwater delegation
consisted of at least hundreds of individuals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The delegations from
the 3600 commanderies and the four seas all landed in perfect unison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One figure after
another now began to soar in through the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cousin.” Ning
could see that the figures who were flying through the skies included
King Yan, who had led Xiyue directly into the skies and through the
clouds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that junior
apprentice-sister Ninelotus?!” The Sloppy Daoist called out in
surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning saw her as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus was currently
flying through the skies alongside a blue-robed man. Ning had heard
his cousin speak of this as well…only Celestial Immortals were
allowed to fly directly into the main hall of the Skylight Palace and
go see the Grand Xia Emperor. The others actually wouldn’t even
have a chance to see him at all. Celestial Immortals were permitted
to bring two followers with them, and so the blue-robed man should be
a Celestial Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning lifted his
head, Ninelotus looked downwards with a searching gaze as well.
Suddenly, their gazes intersected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A familiar yet strange
feeling resonated between their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of them couldn’t
help but look away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The highest point of
the main hall of the Skylight Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Xia Emperor,
dressed in black robes, was seated on high atop his throne. The
individuals below him were divided into two columns, all standing.
Those standing closest to the Grand Xia Emperor were naturally the
Celestial Immortals and Kings of the Xiamang clan, while those
towards the rear consisted of the Celestial Immortals from other
parts of the Grand Xia Empire. Although technically speaking, there
had been no order for the Celestial Immortals to all attend as well,
many of them were quite keen and sharp; they, too, sensed that there
was something strange with the fact that the Grand Xia Emperor was
going to personally officiate over this Conclave, and so quite a few
of them had hurried over as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At a glance, one could
see nearly a thousand Celestial Immortals who stood there before the
Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We bow in respect to
you, your Imperial Majesty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Qi led the first
respectful salute. Instantly, all the other Celestial Immortals bowed
as well. As for the followers who had accompanied the Celestial
Immortals, they all fell to their knees.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single individual
present on the vast plaza located far below the Skylight Palace, be
it the hundred thousand-plus geniuses who were participating in the
Conclave or the million-plus members of the delegations from the 3600
commanderies and four seas…they all knelt down in unison, kowtowing
and pressing their foreheads against the ground. In unison, they
called out:
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“WE BOW IN RESPECT TO
YOU, YOUR IMPERIAL MAJESTY!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sound echoed like
thunder, shaking the entire world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“ARISE!” The voice
of the Grand Xia Emperor shook the world as well.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed
Emperor, seated at the highest point of the main hall of the Skylight
Palace, spoke out. “King Qi.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Imperial
Majesty,” King Qi immediately acknowledged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Announce the rules
for this Conclave,” the black-robed Emperor instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Qi immediately
flew out of the main hall. He stood atop a cloud, staring downwards
as his voice echoed out within the heavens. “This Conclave of
Immortal Destiny has a total of 109,362 participants!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice rang out
clearly, echoing in skies. More than nine thousand kilometers below
him, the Wanxiang Adepts of the Grand Xia Empire as well as other
major worlds all listened carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“More than 109,000?”
Ning’s eyebrows twitched. Although he could clearly calculate the
number of people present through a simple sweep of his divine
sense…this was the imperial citadel, and the Grand Xia Empire was
seated directly above them. No one dared to wildly spread out their
divine sense to investigate the place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The voice above them
continued to speak. “Wanxiang Adepts, each of you shall receive a
talisman. All of you shall enter the magic treasure which his
Imperial Majesty shall use; the Brightmoon Diagram of the Mountains
and Rivers! This painting is capable of holding the cosmos, of
holding qian and kun; it forms an independent world of its own.
Within the Brightmoon Diagram of the Mountains and Rivers, you can
battle each other and seize each other’s talismans without any
restrictions. If you feel that you are not strong enough, you can
discard your talisman, which will cause you to immediately be
teleported out from the Diagram. Although this will represent defeat,
you will at least be able to stay alive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those who choose to
give up…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those who are
killed…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your talismans will
be taken away by the victor of your battle. The length of time you
are to remain within the Diagram is at most one year; after a year,
the eighty competitors with the most talismans will have passed the
trial of the Diagram. If, however, before the year is up…if, for
example, after three months, only eighty of you are still alive…then
the trial of the Diagram will be stopped early, and the eighty lucky
survivors will have passed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If after a year has
passed and eighty victors are selected, but other Wanxiang Adepts
remain alive within the Brightmoon Diagram of the Mountains and
Rivers, then the remaining survivors will be put together in one
place and engage in a final battle. You shall fight until only
sixteen of you remain. Those sixteen will receive chances as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In other words, the
trial of the Brightmoon Diagram of the Mountain and Seas will have at
least eighty victors, and at most ninety six.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember - within
the Diagram, you are forbidden from using any Dao-seals, golems, or
strange treasures! This trial is meant to test your personal ability.
All of your actions within the Diagram shall be under the gaze of his
Imperial Majesty, as well as the gazes of the Celestial Immortals
present. You absolutely cannot act improperly; those who disobey
shall be slain without exception!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slain without
exception!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These final three words
caused the hearts of all of the competitors to quiver.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At least eighty? At
most ninety six?” Ning, Yu Wei, and the Sloppy Daoist exchanged
glances. They all could sense how bloody the upcoming battles would
be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was absolutely
insane.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of these hundred
thousand-plus individuals were peerless geniuses who were at least at
Holyfire’s level! A hundred thousand-plus peerless geniuses, many
of whom would most likely have a high chance of becoming Earth
Immortals or Loose Immortals…but because of the Conclave of
Immortal Destiny, they had to engage in a bloody battle against each
other. Although it was said that one could give up, in the heat of a
battle, it was very likely that many would end up perishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At most ninety
six…and the world has 3600 commanderies, as well as four vast seas.
On average, there will only be a single victor for every few dozen
commanderies.” The Sloppy Daoist let out a sigh. “This is crazy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder if the
three of us will be able to overcome this trial.” Yu Wei’s gaze
was much more solemn now as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, too, felt the
pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, the
Conclave had generally not been this bloody; in the past, there were
usually only twenty or thirty thousand Wanxiang Adepts, all of whom
would go through several rounds of selection, resulting in the top
hundred, then top fifty, then slowly a top ten and top three.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But this time, more
than a hundred thousand of them were going to be sent directly into
the Brightmoon Diagram of the Mountains and Rivers, with this
competition intended to produce between eighty to ninety six victors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main hall of the
Skylight Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Qi walked back,
bowing respectfully. “Reporting to your Imperial Majesty: The
proclamation has been made.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The
black-robed Emperor nodded lightly. His gaze pierced past the
blocking hall and clouds, landing upon the bodies of the hundred
thousand-plus youths. He wanted to watch…watch and see which of
them would rise up to become truly powerful figures within this
upcoming storm for the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are more than
a hundred who are surrounded by the golden light of karmic virtue.”
The black-robed Emperor reflected silently on this. “The more
karmic merits one has rendered, the better one’s luck shall be. But
it is also possible for those who have ordinary karmic merits to be
tremendously lucky as well, and sometimes even astonishingly so.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Karmic luck and karmic
virtue weren’t identical. If one had a high level of karmic virtue,
then one would naturally be blessed with additional luck. But, for
example, if one apprenticed one’s self to a major power of the
Three Realms, one would also be blessed by karmic luck. If one’s
parents were major powers of the Three Realm, one would similarly be
blessed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Or perhaps, because of
a tremendous stroke of fortune, one would suddenly have the blessing
of luck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One could tell at a
glance if a person had high or low karmic virtue, but luck…this was
unfathomable and invisible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The black-robed
Emperor suddenly produced a wrapped diagram in his hand. He unfurled
the diagram, and atop it, one could vaguely make out a painting of a
bright moon, hanging over a mountain and a river.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eyes of the
Celestial Immortals all lit up. The Brightmoon Diagram of the
Mountains and Rivers…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a Pure Yang
magic treasure. It was a tremendously intriguing artifact for
them…but at the same time, these Celestial Immortals were all
pondering nonstop. Today, the Grand Xia Emperor had barely said
anything to these Celestial Immortals before immediately beginning
the initial selection tournament for the Conclave of Immortal
Destiny. From this, they could tell how much importance this Conclave
held for the Grand Xia Emperor. In fact, the very fact of him taking
out the Diagram and using it as the place for the competition was
proof of how seriously he took this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
raised their heads, looking towards the skies. The delegations from
the 3600 commanderies and the four seas all raised their heads to
stare as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the air above them,
an utterly enormous painting, at least ten thousand kilometers long,
had suddenly appeared. It blocked out the skies, and one could even
vaguely make out the world within the diagram.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Swish! Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Yu Wei, the
Sloppy Daoist, and the rest of the 109,362 individuals, who had all
been just standing there, were suddenly and involuntarily pulled into
the skies. All of them were sucked inwards as the surface of the vast
painting began to undulate. When each of them touched the painting,
their bodies also began to undulate; it was as though they were drops
of rainwater that had landed on a lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In just the blink of an
eye, all of them had completely disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main hall of the
Skylight Palace. The black-robed Emperor finally revealed a smile as
he said calmly, “This trial within the Brightmoon Diagram of the
Mountains and Rivers shall most likely go on for a year. Everyone,
watch at your leisure. Prepare the banquet!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a large
number of maids immediately moved over. They placed down long tables,
then delivere pitchers of Immortal nectar and platters of Immortal
fruit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Celestial
Immortals sat down in the lotus position. As for the followers that
had come alongside them, they sat down in the lotus position to the
side of and slightly behind the Celestial Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can watch
everything which is going on within the Diagram.” The black-robed
Emperor pointed towards the clouds outside the main hall. The vast,
ten thousand kilometer long diagram hung there amidst the clouds. The
world within the diagram was clearly visible; within it, there were
mountains, rivers, a bright moon, and more than a hundred thousand
Wanxiang Adepts who were scattered in different areas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dongyan, tell me,
why do you think his Imperial Majesty cares so much about this
Conclave of Immortal Destiny?” A scabby-looking old man seated next
to the Dongyan Forefather spoke out. “He’s personally hosting it,
and even commanded people to participate. Although so many of us
Celestial Immortals have arrived, he is still mostly paying attention
to the Conclave. Can it be that this Conclave is very special? Does
it involve the reincarnation of someone exceptionally powerful? As I
recall, a few decades back, the Netherworld Kingdom suffered a sudden
attack, and the Six Paths of Reincarnation collapsed, right? Can this
have something to do with it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How am I supposed to
know? However, the collapse of the Six Paths of Reincarnation is an
absolutely world-changing event. The mysteries behind its collapse
must definitely be quite shocking. We should just stay in our own
major world and not go running around wildly; otherwise, something
might happen and we might even fall. In addition, although the Six
Paths of Reincarnation collapsed, the venerable Daofather has
re-established the cycle of reincarnation for us and several dozen
other major worlds. We have the protection of the venerable
Daofather; there’s no need for us to panic,” the Dongyan
Forefather sent back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The scabby-looking old
man nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While the Dongyan
Forefather and Patriarch Riverbridge were discussing their worries
regarding the impending storm, Ninelotus, seated behind the Dongyan
Forefather, was carefully watching the ten thousand kilometer long
painting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The painting was truly
enormous, so much so that the individual figures within it could be
seen clearly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is Ji Ning?”
Ninelotus couldn’t help but search for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is Ji Ning?”
Yuchi Xiyue was seated behind King Yan in the lotus position. She,
too, was carefully staring at the enormous painting. “Little
brother, you have to be careful. Be careful!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is Master?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the plaza below the
painting, amidst the delegation led by the Marquis of Stillwater, Mu
Northson was standing next to a large, snowy white hound and an
azure-robed maiden. Ning had gone out to battle, but spirit-beasts
were forbidden from participating. Thus, Uncle White and Little Qing
had to stay with Northson for now as they watched the battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry.
Senior apprentice-brother is a truly monstrous genius; back in the
Witchriver Immortal Estate, he was in such dire straits, but in the
end he was still able to kill Youngflame Nong and that Fiendgod. He
absolutely will not easily die or easily give up.” Northson’s
eyes were shining as he stared at the skies above him, and at the
massive, illusory world that had appeared there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This illusory world was
an image of the situation within the Brightmoon Diagram of the
Mountains and Rivers. One could clearly see every single figure
located within the mountains, the rivers, the grasslands, and the
forests of the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound,
Little Qing, and Northson quickly scanned the massive painting with
their gaze, flashing past one figure after another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look.” Uncle White
suddenly spoke out as he stared at one location. Northson and Little
Qing followed Uncle White’s gaze, looking over as well. Indeed;
within one particular corner of that world, there was a fur-clad
youth within a mountain gorge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother.” Northson’s eyes lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Little
Qing watched with excitement as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Immortal
Fivecraze quickly discovered Ning as well. His eyes were also filled
with excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The people of this
plaza, filled with delegations from the 3600 commanderies and four
seas, were all staring upwards, trying to find the people they cared
about within the painting. They quickly were able to find them, and
they began to watch eagerly, quietly praying for the people they
cared about to end up as one of the final 96 survivors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the world of the
Diagram.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had suddenly felt
the world change as soon as he touched the diagram. He had suddenly
appeared within a mountain gorge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A gorge?” The
Darknorth swords instantly appeared in Ning’s hands. He carefully
scanned his surroundings, so cautious that he didn’t even use
divine sense. This was because, upon using divine sense, the enemy
would locate him as soon as he found them. A solid majority of the
participants of this Conclave all possessed divine sense, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Suddenly, a
light flashed past Ning’s eyes, and a green talisman appeared
before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Each of you shall
have a talisman. If you no longer wish to fight and wish to give up,
you only need to throw the talisman away, and I will immediately
throw you out of the Brightmoon Diagram of the Mountains and Rivers.”
The voice of the Grand Xia Emperor rang out in the minds of the
hundred thousand-plus individuals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
reached out to grasp the talisman.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_4___True_Immortals__Bodh"></A>
Chapter 4 - True Immortals, Bodhisattvas
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After taking the
talisman, Ning turned to stare at the gorge before him. He was the
only person present within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So I was separated
from senior apprentice-sister Yu Wei and eldest apprentice-brother
Sloppy, just like that. It makes sense. The Grand Xia Emperor won’t
let us so easily join forces. In addition, per the rules, the more
talismans you acquire, the better a chance you would have of passing
this trial. If I don’t kill others, others will still try to kill
me. In this trial…I will have to kill!” Ning made up his mind on
what to do, but suddenly, his ears twitched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A faint ripple of power
swept out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a swoosh, Ning
immediately flew to the very top of the nearby mountain, stealthily
looking towards the source of the ripples. In the distant wilderness,
eight men and women were separately using magic treasures and
techniques against each other. It was an utter clash of attacks,
causing the color of the sky to change. These were all peerless
geniuses from various places of the Grand Xia Empire, all of whom had
the pride innate to all geniuses. How could they easily admit defeat?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, one of the
young women quickly began to weaken slightly, and the other seven
immediately began to focus their attacks on her. That woman, dressed
in violet, immediately sent out her divine sense to scan the nearby
300 kilometers, then hurriedly sent mentally, “Everyone, let’s
stop fighting. There are a total of 103 Wanxiang Adepts who are
hidden in the surrounding area. If we keep fighting like this, we are
going to get ambushed by others.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! 103?!” The
other seven were badly frightened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of them knew
exactly how large this world within the Brightmoon Diagram of the
Mountains and Rivers was; they thought that a short battle wouldn’t
attract too much attention. Who would have imagined that 103
individuals would come? Although they were very self-confident, they
knew that all the participants in this Conclave were formidable and
could not be underestimated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the violet-robed
maiden sent out her divine sense, the other Wanxiang Adepts all sent
out their own divine senses to investigate in succession. Some of
them were reincarnated Immortals, while others had been at the
Wanxiang level for far too long, and so their soul had also reached
the divine sense level. A few also has supreme visualization
techniques. In short, they did a scan, and they were all shocked by
what they found.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A fur-clad youth?
That’s Ji Ning! Ji Ning, up there on the mountain! He’s the one
who killed a Loose Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning is atop that
mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning is ranked in
the top hundred for this Conclave. Let’s join forces to wipe him
out first.” The divine senses joined together as they began to
converse through it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since they had decided
to attend this Conclave, they had naturally purchased intelligence
reports from the Heavenly Treasures Mountain. Ever since Ning’s
Primaltwin had killed Immortal Floatcloud, his fame had skyrocketed.
Even the Heavenly Treasures Mountain had come to believe that Ning’s
Primaltwin, despite being only at the peak Primal level, was capable
of killing supreme Loose Immortals. This meant that Ning was superior
to Loose Immortal Floatcloud in terms of the Dao and in terms of
techniques; naturally, this caused Ning to become quite famous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s join forces
and wipe him out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These Wanxiang Adepts
quickly came to the same conclusion. They howled through the air,
flying towards the mountain top where Ning was standing. More than a
hundred figures suddenly flew out, moving at astonishing speeds like
thunderbolts or swift gales.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was badly
startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These individuals
are all heroic talents in their own locales, but they don’t seem to
care about their bearing at all.” Ning was helpless; he had watched
those eight fight, and none of them were easy to deal with. He was
confident in being able to deal with eight, but more than a hundred?
That was suicide!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go.” Ning
waved his arm, and a ship-type treasure appeared before him. Ning
immediately jumped into it. Swoosh! The ship instantly transformed
into a streak of black light, disappearing without a trace into the
distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning ran quite
quickly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He killed Youngflame
Nong, then a Loose Immortal. It is said that he is valued by King Yan
as well. He really has quite a few treasures, and he really was able
to run quite fast.” The hundred-plus men and women in the air felt
helpless as well. Unless they had already completely encircled him,
if someone like Ning who was clearly more powerful than them wished
to flee, it would be hard for them to stop him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They quickly began to
stare vigilantly against each other, stealthily pulling apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nobody wanted to
suddenly start a giant, chaotic battle of over a hundred people. They
were confident in their ability to handle a wild battle with seven or
eight people, but a wild battle with over a hundred…once a person
was trapped, there would be no way to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is going to be
troublesome. More than a hundred thousand people, all of whom are
crafty and cautious. To be able to survive to the very end and become
one of the final 96…that is going to be very difficult.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Power alone won’t
be enough. Even the most powerful competitor, when surrounded and
attacked by a hundred in a formation, will have no option but death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The people all quickly
departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning…only
after his ship had fled more than several thousand kilometers and
entered a large mountain did Ning reappear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To overcome the
trial of the Diagram…power is just one aspect of it. This is also a
trial of the mind, a trial of intelligence.” Ning quickly
understood this. Everyone was a Wanxiang Adept, after all, and
everyone was a supreme talent. They had all essentially reached the
limit of what was possible for a Wanxiang Adept to accomplish; to be
able to improve any further would be incredibly difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The average person here
was at least comparable to an ordinary peak Primal Daoist! If a
hundred people joined together in a formation, then they would
definitely be comparable to a supreme Loose Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to be careful
and cautious…and also ruthless. I need to seize any opportunities
and to kill at high speed. I can’t let myself be surrounded.”
Ning nodded to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the plaza below, the
delegates from the 3600 commanderies and the four seas all raised
their heads and watched, extremely nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, they had
all felt that their own disciples were quite formidable, but as they
watched…they realized that every single person was crafty and
capable. There were more than ten thousand who had reached the
twelfth level of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]!
There were even more who had cultivated earthfire or dire-ice to the
first grade. None of them were easy to deal with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why is it that I
suddenly feel as though senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning, senior
apprentice-sister Yu Wei, and eldest apprentice-brother are all in a
lot of danger?” Northson blinked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Adept
Vastriver shook his head. “As I see it…I imagine that most
likely, more than half of these individuals are reincarnated
Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
and Little Qing just stared fixedly at the skies, paying attention to
Ning the entire time. Wherever Ning ran to, their gazes would turn
to.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The atmosphere within
the main hall of the Skylight Palace, by contrast, was much more
relaxed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Emperor
sat there. He took a sip from the wineglass he was holding, then said
with a smile, “This Conclave shall initially proceed within the
Brightmoon Diagram of the Mountains and Rivers for a year. This is
just the beginning; the most exciting parts will come later.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Immortals
seated below him were all chatting and laughing as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That little fellow
isn’t bad. He actually killed someone, then scared someone into
throwing their talisman away. Who is that little fellow?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t recognize
him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Never seen him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Immortals
chatted and laughed, but as they watched, they saw that likes of the
long-famous ‘Xiamang Zishan’, ‘Cangwu Jiu’, ‘Adept
Woodpass’, and others had yet to truly put on an awe-inspiring
display. Instead, they suffered repeated attacks by groups of others
and were often put in quite sorry positions. To the contrary, it was
the figures that they had never heard about and who were heretofore
unknown who were suddenly revealing their terrifying power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A cataclysm of the
Three Realms truly does cause heroes to gather.” The black-robed
Emperor was quite satisfied. “I imagine that many formidable
figures who no one had ever known about in the past are going to
display their truly shocking power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a clear voice
rang out. “Fellow Daoist Xiamang, I come uninvited; are you willing
to welcome me, fellow Daoist?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed
Emperor’s face changed slightly, and the thousand Celestial
Immortals seated below him all quieted down as well. From the mists
and clouds outside, eight figures suddenly appeared, each of whom had
different appearances. There was a dissolute, handsome man who was
dressed in an azure Daoist robe; there was a middle-aged Buddhist who
was dressed in yellow robes; there was an old man who was riding an
old bull; there was a muscular, golden-eyed man who was dressed in
dragon robes…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All eight of them had
marvelous, unfathomable, profound auras about them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eight caused the
thousand Celestial Immortals to secretly feel as though their hearts
were trembling. As for the Grand Xia Emperor, he immediately arose
from his throne and walked down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoists, why
is it that you’ve decided to come to my Grand Xia?” The
black-robed Emperor laughed, “Come, come, come, come and sit!” He
waved a hand, and on the two sides next to his throne, eight more
seats and tables appeared. Immortal fruit and nectar appeared atop
the tables as well, and they were far better than the fare provided
to the Celestial Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why we came to your
Grand Xia? Fellow Daoist Xiamang, can it be that you don’t know?”
The leader of the group, an azure-robed man who carried an Immortal
sword on his back, laughed in a hearty manner. “The Three Realms
are currently filled with dangerous hidden undercurrents. Most
likely, a great cataclysm is coming. This is precisely the point in
time when heroic figures will emerge into the world. Your Grand Xia
is one of the most highly ranked of the three thousand major worlds
in terms of karmic luck; perhaps one of the peerless figures of the
future will be born here. That is why I, Lu Dongbin, have shamelessly
come here. You won’t mind, will you, fellow Daoist Xiamang?” 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although his voice
echoed loudly, none of the nearby Celestial Immortals could hear
anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Xiamang, my own major world just concluded a
Conclave of Immortal Destiny, and so Eastflower paid a visit to my
place, then insisted on pulling me here as well.” The muscular,
golden-eyed man who was dressed in dragon robes spoke in a resigned
manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sovereign Hao, since
you knew how shameless this Lu Dongbin is, you truly should have
stopped him.” The Xia Emperor spoke with resignation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for myself, this
old man is just here to watch the fun. Don’t worry, don’t worry;
I’m not here to try and snatch some of the geniuses from your major
world,” the old man riding the old bull laughed merrily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m just here to
watch the fun as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m just wandering
about.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This caused the Xia
Emperor to feel exceptionally resigned; the individuals in front of
him were all awe-inspiringly famous and influential figures of the
Three Realms. For example, there was Lu Dongbin, the leader of the
Eight Immortals of the High Caves. Lu Dongbing was the reincarnation
of Emperor Eastflower, and back when he had been Emperor Eastflower,
he had apprenticed himself to a major power. After reincarnating and
becoming Lu Dongbin, he had apprenticed himself to a second major
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Behind him, a single
person, stood two major powers. What’s more, Lu Dongbin had merged
the strong points from both schools, infusing them into his Dao of
the Sword. He was known in the Three Realms to be frighteningly
powerful…and he was a famous, awe-inspiring Sword Immortal! Even
amongst Pure Yang True Immortals, he was ranked towards the very
front.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Lu Dongbin was
utterly shameless, had a weird temper, liked to play tricks on
people, and cursed or giggled as he pleased…and he often liked to
wander about the mortal realms, leaving behind quite a few legacies
in many of the worlds he passed through.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And you,
Mahasthamaprapta? Why have you, a member of the Buddhist way, come
here?” The Xia Emperor’s gaze fell upon the yellow-robed
Buddhist. Followers of the Daoist path felt a certain degree of
disliking towards followers of the Buddhist path. 2
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The male Buddhist had a
smile on his face that made others feel calm. Clasping his palms
together in a prayer, he said, “I’m just here to take a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor was
helpless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bodhisattva
Mahasthamaprapta, the Bodhisattva of Great Strength, was someone who
had an extremely high status amongst those of the Buddhist path. He
was someone who had followed Lord Buddha for a long period of time,
and was also someone comparable to a Pure Yang True Immortal. In
addition, he had an extremely good temperament, always having a smile
on his face whenever he met anyone. In the face of such a truly kind,
amiable individual…there was no way the Xia Emperor could shoo him
off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, take your
seats. Why are you all standing? Others will think that the Xia clan
doesn’t understand how to treat guests.” The Xia Emperor said,
rather impolitely, “But everyone, please understand this; I’m not
the only person paying attention to this Conclave of Immortal Destiny
of the Grand Xia. Even my venerable Master is paying close attention
to it as well. Thus, the only one who can choose a disciple must be
my venerable Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We naturally won’t
fight over with the Daofather over a disciple. Xiamang, stop
worrying. After you have made your picks, if I take a fancy to one of
the remaining individuals, there won’t be any problems if I choose
him, right?” Lu Dongbin had been the first to plop his butt down on
the seat, then had picked up a bottle of Immortal nectar and started
to drink. His eyes instantly lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hey, this is good
wine. Not bad! Your Xiamang clan truly lives up to its reputation as
being of the lineage of the imperial Xia clan of the Primordial Era.
You have so much fine wine, and it’s even better than the Celestial
Court’s. What’s the name of this wine?” As he spoke, Lu
Dongbin’s eyes began to spin as he turned to stare at the massive
Brightmoon Diagram of the Mountains and Rivers, carefully inspecting
each of the young men and women within it.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 5 - Life in the Diagram
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other Pure Yang
True Immortals all turned their gazes towards the Brightmoon Diagram
of the Mountains and Rivers as well. The Xia Emperor felt resigned.
He mused to himself, “It seems it truly is the time for a cataclysm
to befall the Three Realms. All the major powers are beginning to
make their preparations. My Master, Daofather Crimsonbright, has
previously provided some tutelage to Lu Dongbin in the past as well.
In his past life, Lu Dongbin had a very close relationship with me.
He’s not an issue, nor are the others…but that bodhisattva,
Mahasthamaprapta!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor knew
very well that the supreme powers of the Three Realms were divided
into many different organizations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, all of the
eight Pure Yang True Immortals who had arrived today had major powers
backing them who were on good terms with his own master, Daofather
Crimsonbright. The only exception was Mahasthamaprapta, who was of
the Buddhist path. It couldn’t be said that he was on good terms
with Daofather Crimsonbright…but they weren’t enemies either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to be
careful. If he takes a fancy to one of the individuals in this
Conclave, Mahasthamaprapta might actually plot to abduct the person
in secret,” the Xia Emperor pondered to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Diagram.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was atop a dwarf
mountan, his body covered by trees and shrubs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Before killing
Immortal Floatcloud, I was a very ordinary, unremarkable figure in
the intelligence reports of the Heavenly Treasures Mountain who was
casually mentioned in them. After killing him, however, my name
became widespread throughout the Grand Xia Empire. Even the
intelligence reports praise me tremendously, claiming that I have the
power to rank in the top hundred.” Ning felt helpless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heavenly Treasures
Mountain had to have some margin for error, and so in truth, they had
only ranked thirty-two individuals as having the power to rank in the
top hundred! The thirty-two the Heavenly Treasures Mountain ranked as
being in the top hundred were all but guaranteed to truly have that
power…and Ning was one of those thirty-two!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From this, one could
imagine how within the Diagram, the top thirty-two such as Xiamang
Zishan, Cangwu Jiu, Ji Ning would instantly be attacked by groups
upon them being discovered! The other Immortal cultivators all
believed that the likes of Ji Ning had a very high chance of winning,
and so they needed to eliminate them as soon as possible. Only then
would they themselves have a chance to pass this trial.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to change
myself slightly.” Ning had just suffered an attack from more than a
hundred individuals. Fortunately, his treasured ship had been able to
flee fast enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s magic robes
transformed into ordinary black robes, no longer appearing like furs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There should be
quite a few black-robed youths,” Ning mused to himself. “I won’t
be recognized on sight, at least.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time go to.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From a fur-clad youth
to a black-robed youth. Ning quietly began to wander the world of the
Diagram. Every so often, he would spread out his divine sense to scan
the ten surrounding kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within this short
distance, Ning could instantly move to a location…and that way, he
wouldn’t startle too many with his divine sense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
He spread out his divine sense repeatedly. On the eighteenth time,
Ning immediately discovered a white-robed maiden who suddenly turned
her head towards him, having noticed him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Ning seemed to
have transformed into a giant Roc, howling through the air as he
moved at lightning speed and charged down from his mountain peak. In
a flash, he appeared in front of the white-robed maiden.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you want to die?”
The white-robed maiden’s face turned cold, and a pair of short
sticks appeared in her hands, flashing with electric light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning attacked, the
first thing he did was will an enormous Waterflame Lotus to appear.
After developing the Lotusflower Swordland, he had gained insights
into both this technique and his Waterflame Lotus due to their
commonalities. During the past year at the imperial capital of the
Grand Xia, Ning had carefully worked to further refine his technique,
making the Waterflame Lotus technique even more perfect!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, after a
full year of cultivation, the earthfire and dire-ice in Ning’s body
had already risen to the first grade as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The earthfire and
dire-ice of the first grade served as the foundation, and the True
Lunar Tattoo and the True Solar Tattoo within his divine body
activated fire and water of the natural world in support. The Dao of
the Sword, the Dao of Rainwater, the Dao of the Inferno, the Dao of
the Gale, and the Dao of Space were all joined together as well…to
finally form into this Waterflame Lotus, which now had reached a
ridiculous level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The
white-robed maiden was completely shocked. This enormous Waterflame
Lotus was at least three thousand meters, completely surrounding her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A technique?” The
white-robed maiden laughed coldly. Her body suddenly expanded
dramatically in size as she transformed into a thirty-six meter tall
giant. The giant white-robed maiden also activated the [Three Heads,
Six Arms] divine ability. In her hands, she now wielded six of the
short sticks, each of which flashed with electric light. The sticks
in her hand howled through the air as she smashed downwards towards
the layers of Waterflame Lotus petals binding her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was as though two
mountains had collided. The six short sticks carried the majestic,
divine power of lightning. Given the power of this woman, a Fiendgod
Body Refiner, when she smashed down upon the flower, a layer of
leaves cracked…but new leaves were then born from the Waterflame
Lotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” The
white-robed maiden was shocked. Per her predictions, she should’ve
been able to smash through this technique like rotting wood, but in
reality, the breaking process was very slow. The enemy’s technique
could continue to be maintained indefinitely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a fellow. This
white-robed maiden is probably even a bit more powerful than Daoist
Snowplume was.” Ning was shocked as well. “Fortunately, my
earthfire and dire-ice have both reached the first grade, and I’ve
further perfected this technique. If this was a year ago…she
probably would’ve broken through it. However…since you can’t
break through my Waterflame Lotus, then you have lost.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than seven hundred
flying swords immediately appeared in the air around Ning, with the
Nethercold swords serving as the core. All of them were Earth-ranked
flying swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!” Ning pointed,
and instantly, a golden flying sword that had formed in front of his
chest howled forth as it flew out, striking towards the white-robed
maiden. The golden flying sword carried a terrifying sword-intent
that struck directly at the opponent’s soul. This was the
terrifying sword-intent which only Sword Immortals possessed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are Adept
Darknorth…Ji Ning!” The white-robed maiden called out in shock.
Lotus-type techniques were fairly common, but upon seeing those seven
hundred-plus flying swords? If she wasn’t able to put two and two
together and recognize Ning from this, it would have been bizarre.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! In the face of
the attack of the sword light from Ning’s [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation], the white-robed maiden hurriedly used all six short
sticks to block.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of Ning’s
[Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] was far greater than the
Waterflame Lotus; the Waterflame Lotus was primarily meant to bind
and grind an opponent, whereas the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]
was a purely offensive technique. Ning was using nearly ninety
percent of his spiritual energy on maintaining the [Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation]. The white-robed maiden was knocked flying
backwards, and two of the short sticks flew out of her hands. She
was, however, blocked from behind by the Waterflame Lotus once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The killing, grinding
power of the Waterflame Lotus was constantly pressing down on the
white-robed maiden’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn you.” The
white-robed maiden gritted her teeth, staring viciously at Ning. “Ji
Ning, you are a piece of work.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She tossed out her
talisman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble! An invisible
power instantly covered her body, and then she was teleported away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How powerful.”
Ning waved his hand, collecting the talisman. “A random person I
encountered was already this powerful…fortunately, I was able to
use the Waterflame Lotus to bind her. Otherwise, she would’ve fled
upon realizing she couldn’t beat me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The intelligence
reports of the Heavenly Treasures Mountain stated quite clearly that
Ji Ning’s true body was skilled in close combat. Next was his
flying swords formation, which was significantly weaker than Ji
Ning’s close combat ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed woman
had realized that Ning was capable of using just his sword formation
to completely suppress her, and would most likely be able to kill her
in just ten exchanges or so! If he closed to engage in close quarters
combat…he might be able to kill her in just one or two exchanges.
With the Waterflame Lotus binding her and preventing her from
fleeing, she had no choice but to admit defeat. That way, she would
at least stay alive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning carefully
advanced, continuing to be very cautious for fear of suffering
another group attack. There was a reason why his power was such that
the Heavenly Treasures Mountain ranked him as being within the top
hundred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all, Ning’s
true body relied on his divine abilities to do battle, and had been
able to stay alive against the assault of a Whitebone Immortal
Slaying Needle! This was enough to ensure that the Heavenly Treasures
Mountain viewed Ning’s true body as definitely being extremely
formidable in close combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One against one…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was true that within
the Diagram, Ning was indeed one of the supreme fighters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Against ordinary foes,
the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] and the Waterflame Lotus was
already enough to suppress them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Against powerful foes,
he would have to use both the Waterflame Lotus and close quarters
combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course…that
was in one-on-one fights.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of the fairly
famous individuals are beginning to slowly display their might.”
The Xia Emperor accompanied the eight Pure Yang True Immortals in
drinking as he watched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, Xiamang
Zishan, Cangwu Jiu, and the others had all suffered quite a bit.
However, they quickly hid their tracks and began to act with great
caution. Whether through killing their foes or forcing them to
voluntarily give up, they began to slowly accumulate more and more
talismans. Still…things were quite early. Thus, with each kill,
they only acquired one or two talismans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That dirty-looking
maiden, she’s quite formidable.” The Xia Emperor’s eyes lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor
suddenly looked towards the nearby Lu Dongbin. Lu Dongbin had left
behind many legacies throughout the Three Realms, and liked to take
on new disciples. Amongst Pure Yang True Immortals, he was one of the
most powerful; naturally, he had quite an astute gaze. The Xia
Emperor couldn’t help but laugh and say, “Lu Dongbin, which of
these youths do you view as having the most luck surrounding them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The most luck?” Lu
Dongbin half-lay there, sipping his wine. He glanced out of the
corner of his eyes at the Diagram, then shook his head and said, “How
can you tell just by looking? Luck is unfathomable and ever-changing
to begin with…even someone with tremendous luck can still be
killed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor felt
resigned. Of course he knew that lucky individuals could be killed as
well. Those blessed by luck would just have more lucky encounters and
have the assistance of the heavens. They could still, however, be
killed! In fact, the person who killed them might even be able to
steal their luck…but it was also possible that their own luck would
lessen as a result.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, let’s
say an individual was the only child of a major power. Killing this
person would cause the major power to feel great hatred, and perhaps
even personally intervene; in this case, one’s luck would naturally
lessen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For another example, if
one person had a tremendous stroke of fortune and acquired a huge
treasure repository, this person could be said to have had great
luck. But if he were to killed by another and his treasure repository
stolen, then his luck would now be the killer’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Luck was something
which could neither be seen or felt; it could only be hypothesized
based on numerous factors. This required astute judgment. Clearly, Lu
Dongbin was a person with incredibly astute judgment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You alcoholic! I
asked you to tell me, but you refused to.” The Xia Emperor felt
resigned. “Of course I know that lucky individuals can be killed,
but lucky individuals will still have a higher chance of becoming
powerful figures of the Three Realms, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But what if I told
you, then you picked that person?” Lu Dongbin glanced sideways at
him. “Pick your own. I told you that I’ll definitely let you and
your Daofather pick first. I’ll pick from whoever is left.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor felt
resigned. What could he do against such a shameless person?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Diagram.
More than five days had passed. Ning was currently resting within a
cavern estate. There was a cold pool of water here. When washing his
face in it, Ning felt incomparably refreshed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five days. I’ve
acquired a total of fifty talismans,” Ning mused to himself.
“However…at the beginning, there will be many Wanxiang Adepts
within the Diagram, and I would often encounter them. Later on,
however, the number will begin to drop and it will be more rare to
run into someone. In addition, those who survive until the end will
be extremely powerful and hard to deal with.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still, there’s a
benefit to that as well; those who survive for longer will also have
more talismans on them.” Ning’s eyes suddenly flickered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A vague, trembling
ripple was sweeping towards him from far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A battle? And it
seems it’s quite a big one.” Ning immediately transformed into a
streak of light, leaving the cavern and carefully moving closer.

Chapter 6 - Junior Apprentice-Brother Ji Ning
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Brightmoon Diagram
of the Mountains and Rivers was perpetually cast in the glow of
moonlight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning passed through
a mountain forest, silently and soundlessly arriving at the
mountain’s peak. He hid there within the grass, staring into the
distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Off in the distance,
within a gorge, there was a mirror-like lake. A massive battle was
underway at the lake; three individuals were attacking a single
woman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three individuals
included a black-robed man who hovered in midair, an enormous black
Flood Dragon coming into being in front of him. The black Flood
Dragon appeared to be real, and its aura was powerful. It was
savagely attacking the woman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second of the three
attackers was a silver-haired woman. The silver-haired woman, every
so often, would open her mouth, and with a whooooosh, an incomparably
terrifying gust of balewind would be unleashed. It was as though
countless sharp swords were flying out, slicing away at even the
ground itself. The balewind, carrying a glowing azure light, was
savagely attacking the woman as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The last attacker was a
silver-robed youth with a cold, arrogant face. He pointed from far
away into the air, and as he did, an enormous greatsword that was
three hundred meters long would appear, chopping down repeatedly as
its tip pierced towards the woman!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The person the three
were attacking…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Was an absolutely
peerless black-robed beauty. Around her, there was a pair of enormous
phoenixes, one of fire and one of ice, which swirled around her,
struggling to defend. However, under the triple attack, the woman was
clearly finding it quite hard to endure. In addition, the coiling
black dragon continually attacked her as well, giving her no way to
flee or escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister Yu Wei!” Ning stared. The woman being attacked
was, amazingly, Yu Wei. The black-robed man’s eyes had grown
bloodshot, and it seemed as though the black Flood Dragon was about
to change…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“HOLD!” A sudden,
explosive roar exploded from Ning’s lips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
utilized the [Windwing Evasion], seeming to have transformed into a
giant Roc as he howled through the air towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei had felt that
she had become trapped in a dire situation. The three in front of her
were all extraordinarily strong, especially the one with the giant
black dragon. The black Flood Dragon was the personification of a
magic treasure formation that was absolutely massive. Its coiling
body completely surrounded her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the
silver-haired woman, her balewind technique was extremely amazing as
well. When the gust of balewind blew out, when one tried to dodge, it
felt as though one was moving against the wind. The technique lowered
her speed ridiculously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s only the
sixth day, but I’m already in grave danger.” Yu Wei gritted her
teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thirty-six Rahu
Godneedles formed into an enormous phoenix of ice, whose entire body
seemed to be produced from arcane ice that was incomparably hard. It
blocked the balewind repeatedly, as well as the strikes from the
Flood Dragon and the massive sword. This was the absolute best
defensive technique Yu Wei had available to her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the other
thirty-six Rahu Godneedles, they were formed into the enormous
phoenix of fire. Its flames blazed ferociously, and it clashed
repeatedly against the balewind, causing even the balewind to
crumble, while at other times forcing the Flood Dragon or the massive
sword back. But it could only knock back one thing at a time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, senior apprentice-sister, this woman’s power is
formidable; she certainly must have many talismans on her. She might
have over a hundred! I’ll tie her down; you two, kill her at one
blow.” The black-haired man sent a mental message to the other two.
They were from the same school, and although he seemed old, he was
actually the junior disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’ll be up to
you, junior apprentice-brother.” The silver-haired woman and the
silver-robed youth both responded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed man
immediately gritted his teeth as his eyes began to turn bloodshot.
His elemental ki wildly exploded forth, and the enormous black Flood
Dragon let out a furious howl as its head actually split into two
enormous heads. The two-headed black Flood Dragon’s aura instantly
expanded greatly, and it threw itself towards the phoenix of ice. So
long as it was able to break through the phoenix of ice, Yu Wei
wouldn’t have anything to rely on and would be finished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” Yu Wei
gritted her white teeth, revealing a look of savagery as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But right at this
moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“HOLD!” A furious
roar, filled without elemental ki, instantly exploded forth into the
area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-haired
woman, the silver-robed man, and the black-robed man all turned to
look. They saw a black-robed youth who was howling through the air as
he flew towards them like a giant Roc.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei turned her head
and saw the black-robed youth flying towards them from afar. Upon
seeing his face…her heart suddenly shook.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning!” Yu Wei
couldn’t believe it. In the moment that she had been trapped in a
dire situation, her junior apprentice-brother had actually arrived as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can this be fate?”
Yu Wei’s heart instantly was thrown into a rather chaotic state.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, a long time
ago, shortly after Ning had joined the Black-White College, Yu Wei
had investigated Ning’s background and learned of his past…she,
too, had a tragic past, and her parents had both passed away as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was why Yu Wei
had, from the very beginning, felt well-disposed towards Ning. When
Ning had instantly shocked everyone in such a splendid manner during
the Dao Debates, she liked him even more. In the end, after she
personally intervened and defeated Ning, she even teased him a little
bit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given her normal, icy
disposition, why would she so casually tease one of her junior
apprentice-brothers like that?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She had always been
quietly watching Ning…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning ended up
being together with Ninelotus. This tied Yu Wei’s heart up in
knots, but all she could do we silently bless them and hide
everything she felt in her heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Afterwards, when she
learned that Ning had defeated Daoist Snowplume, she had an excuse to
go seek him out alongside Mu Northson and Adept Vastriver. In fact,
she had even been preparing to stay for the next two or three years
at Serpentwing Lake, but who would’ve thought that Youngflame Nong
would invite them to the Witchriver Immortal Estate?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That journey to the
Witchriver Immortal Estate! In the end, it caused Ninelotus and Ning
to part ways for good.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus had chosen to
leave. As she had, in that moment, Yu Wei had a sudden impulse…she
wanted to say to Ning, ‘I will go with you!’ But she wasn’t in
a position to say such a thing; she was not Ning’s Dao-companion.
In addition, her power was truly not enough to help Ning at all in
facing the disaster that was unfolding for him. The only thing she
could do was wrack her brains to come up with strategies for him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After she and Ning
separated, she watched as he wandered by himself. She could only
repress all her feelings once more, and once more silently bless him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Who would have
imagined…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was even more
brilliant than she had thought he would be. His Primaltwin had
actually slain Immortal Floatcloud, causing the Youngflame clan to be
unable to do anything to him. In addition, Ning was participating in
the Conclave of Immortal Destiny as well! This caused a surge of
delight in Yu Wei’s heart. Only…after entering the world of the
Brightmoon Diagram of the Mountains and Rivers, they had all been
separated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The world of the
Diagram is enormous, and there are more than a hundred thousand
people present. On just the sixth day, and coincidentally just as I
found myself in a dire situation, Ji Ning arrived? Can this be fate?
Are the hands of fate at work here?” Yu Wei was shocked, delighted,
and stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Ning howled
through the air like a streak of lightning. The silver-robed youth,
the silver-haired woman, and the black-robed man were all enraged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-sister, stop him,” the silver-robed youth sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-haired
maiden immediately stared at the distant Ning. Suddenly, she opened
her mouth. Whooooooosh. The balewind came out, filling the skies with
its azure light. If one looked carefully, one would be able to see
that in reality, this was a tempest formed from countless azure
needles, and thus had even more penetrative power than ordinary wind
attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A beautiful Waterflame
Lotus appeared, swiveling around Ning. The enormous Waterflame Lotus
was incomparably resilient, and the layers of leaves actually
completely blocked the balewind. After all, Ning was using earthfire
and dire-ice of the first grade to serve as his foundation of this
technique, then activating the fire and water of the natural world to
condense around it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of technique
quality, Ning was a hair above his opponent; this was a self-created
technique, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, he had
both earthfire and dire-ice, whereas this woman only had balewind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the power of
her balewind was truly astonishing, it was still blocked by the
Waterflame Lotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“F*ck off!” The
approaching Ning’s body suddenly expanded as he transformed into a
54 meter tall black-robed giant. The surface of his body flowed with
electricity, and Ning’s forehead suddenly split open as well,
revealing a vertical eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Divine ability -
[Divine Thunderbolt Eye]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">CRACK! A bolt of
lightning thundered out from Ning’s third eye, that vertical slit
in his forehead. It was astonishingly fast, and it struck directly
against the round umbrella which had suddenly appeared in the hands
of that distant, silver-haired woman. [Pentabolt Vajra] and [Divine
Thunderbolt Eye]; these two divine abilities synergized, causing the
power of his thunder to vastly surpass that of ordinary divine
abilities. This caused the silver-haired woman to be knocked flying
back by the thunderbolt, and she threw up a mouthful of blood. In
addition, this [Divine Thunderbolt Eye] attack also contained a
divine will attack as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Argh!!!” The
silver-haired woman let out a miserable cry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Protect senior
apprentice-sister!” The black-haired man and the silver-robed youth
were both greatly shocked. They had thought that the balewind would
be enough to block the youth for a period of time, but who would’ve
imagined that the enemy would not only easily block it, but also
injure their senior apprentice-sister with a bolt of lightning?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” The
silver-robed youth couldn’t be bothered to deal with Yu Wei; the
aura of this approaching black-robed youth who was protected by the
Waterflame Lotus was simply too ferocious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With but a thought, the
silver-robed youth willed the surface of his massive, three hundred
meter long greatsword to suddenly be covered with flowing runes. The
power of his sword continuously rose and focused on the tip of the
sword. This enormous sword pierced towards Ning, lightning-fast!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want to block
me?” Ning surged forward like a rainbow streak of light, neither
dodging nor moving away. The vertical eye in his forehead sent out
two bolts of lightning in a row.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">CRACK! CRACK!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One bolt of lightning
struck towards the silver-robed youth, while the other struck towards
the black-robed man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thunderbolts
couldn’t be casually blocked; both of them knew this very well.
Thus, they all immediately used powerful techniques to block against
it. Around the silver-robed youth, a chain link suddenly appeared.
CRACK! The thunderbolt was blocked by the chain link, which was
knocked flying back by the collision. However, the divine will attack
within the thunderbolt was transmitted into the silver-robed youth’s
body, causing his face to change. However, he was able to withstand
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the black-robed
youth, he was protected by the black Flood Dragon, which withstood
the lightning bolt. However, the divine will attack also penetrated
invisibly into his body. His body suddenly swayed, and even the black
Flood Dragon turned blurry for a moment. However, it quickly
re-stabilized.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful, his divine
ability includes a divine will attack.” Only now did the
silver-haired woman, who had been knocked to the ground by the
earlier attack, manage to send a frantic mental message to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main reason was
that the two were battling far too fast. Ning had immediately sent
out three lightning bolts upon arriving, causing the heart of all
three to be filled with amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Soldiers of the
Mind]!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immediately after
having used a divine ability, Ning then revealed a true divine will
attack; the [Soldiers of the Mind] he had acquired from the
Witchriver Immortal Estate. This was an even more powerful technique
than the Black-White College’s [Soulslayer Art]! Although Ning had
also spent some time on other divine will techniques, most of his
time had been spent on this, [Soldiers of the Mind]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Ning’s sea of
consciousness, his soul was seated in the lotus position, and a
soldier’s seal was hovering in his hand. When his divine will was
summoned forth from this soldier’s seal…it instantly transformed
into invisible and untraceable sharp swords, warblades, and
longspears. These spiritual weapons howled forth, striking towards
the silver-robed youth, the black-robed man, and the silver-haired
woman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Imagine how fast divine
will attacks were!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sharp swords formed
from divine will…they were incomparably sharp and stabbed right
towards the soul!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Warblades formed from
divine will…they carried an unstoppable might, hacking against the
enemy soul with overwhelming brute force!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Longspears formed from
divine will…they combined both of the advantages of the two other
weapons, and were also savage in focusing their power at one point as
they pierced straight towards the enemy!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Invisible, formless
weapons that were created from divine will. The sharp swords, giant
sabers, and longspears were savagely attacking the three!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Chop! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The souls of the three
were immediately, violently assaulted by Ning’s divine will
technique.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_7___It_Must_Be_Love"></A>
Chapter 7 - It Must Be Love
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s soul was
comparable to many Earth Immortals and Loose Immortals, and [Soldiers
of the Mind] was even more formidable than the [Soulslayer Art]
technique. The power of his assault…it was so great that both the
black-robed man and the silver-haired woman felt their souls rumble
as they were sent into a dazed state. Only the silver-robed youth was
dazed momentarily before immediately regaining consciousness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” The
silver-robed youth was shocked. “Even I passed out for a moment;
how can junior apprentice-brother and junior apprentice-sister
withstand that?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, at this
moment, he could not do anything for the two of them, because Ning
was pouncing towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who on earth is this
person? He is so powerful that just by using a divine will attack, he
was able to set me back?” The silver-robed youth’s heart
clenched, and he didn’t dare to be the least bit overconfident. He
hadn’t been able to recognize Ning, who had only used a single
lotus technique so far.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your divine will
attacks are formidable, but I refuse to believe that you are that
formidable in actual combat as well.” A cold look flashed through
the eyes of the silver-robed youth. “Die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BAM! The power of the
enormous, three hundred meter long greatsword was now completely
focused on the tip, where black and white light had joined together
to form a strand of golden sword-light. The silver-robed youth had
already poured all of his power into this attack. A powerful soul
might be stem from a person’s birth; although the black-haired
youth that was pouncing towards him had a powerful soul, he didn’t
necessarily have a high level of insight into the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” The charging
Ning showed no mercy at all. The layers of the Waterflame Lotus
swiveling around him blocked the massive sword, which repeatedly
hacked against it but was firmly stopped.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A cold light flashed
through Ning’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Divine ability -
[Starseizing Hand]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">CLANK! The Darknorth
sword in Ning’s hand instantly lit out a brilliant flash of
sword-light, and with a massive boom, it collided against and
actually knocked that enormous enemy sword flying. As for Ning, after
the sword in his left hand knocked the massive sword flying, he
immediately used the [Windwing Evasion] technique to arrive in front
of the silver-robed youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-robed youth
was tremendously shocked. He couldn’t believe that his most
powerful technique had been knocked away by a single sword blow. He
was one of the most elite of geniuses within his school! He no longer
had the courage to fight against Ning, and he immediately produced
dozens of talismans and threw them all away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had given up his
talismans and was planning to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that the Brightmoon Diagram of the Mountains and Rivers was a Pure
Yang magic treasure; naturally, it had a soul as well. There was no
way that Ning and the others could deceive the spirit of the Diagram
as to how many talismans they had. They had to throw out all of their
talismans in order to be teleported away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword-light
had already arrived in front of the silver-robed youth. Clang! The
silver-robed youth used both his earthfire and his chains, striving
to buy himself just a single moment of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword-light
was like an attack unleashed by one of those ancient, primordial
Fiendgods. It possessed an utterly shocking power that shattered the
earthfire and sent the chains flying. The body of the silver-robed
youth, when struck, was instantly turned into pulp. Blood sprayed
everywhere, along with chunks of flesh and bits of bone, but even as
it sprayed everywhere, it was completely vaporized in midair by the
terrifying sword-ki.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was all too fast!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the
silver-robed youth had already thrown away the talismans…there was
an extremely short window of time between the talismans being thrown
away and himself being teleported away. In a true, close quarters
battle, that window of time was enough for Ning to attack ten more
times with his sword!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt hatred for
these three for daring to act against his senior apprentice-sister,
and so he showed no mercy at all. In addition, the silver-robed youth
truly was quite powerful; without using the [Starseizing Hand], Ning
would only at most be able to seize an advantage; he wouldn’t be
able to cause the foe to completely collapse at all. He had to use
his [Starseizing Hand], and use overwhelming raw power to deal with
this foe!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two enormous
phoenixes of fire and ice struck against the bodies of the other two
temporarily stunned Adepts. Although the stunning effect was only for
a short moment, Yu Wei was a true expert as well; she naturally
seized the chance to immediately change from defending to attacking
as she sent her phoenix of fire and her phoenix of ice to separately
attack the black-robed man and the silver-haired woman, instantly
killing the two!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei then turned her
head, looking at the black-robed youth who was 54 meters tall,
crackling with lightning, and who had a vertical eye-slit in his
forehead. She was both excited and nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister.” Ning’s third eye closed. The lightning around
his body vanished. He returned to the size of a normal person.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.” Yu Wei spoke out as well, and her eyes
glistened like jewels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main hall of the
Skylight Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those three are
disciples of my Heavenly Silkworm Sect. That black-robed woman is
almost finished; yet another is going to be a slain and vanquished
corpse of my Heavenly Silkworm Sect.” An extremely skinny and
shriveled Celestial Immortal was laughing smugly right now. Normally,
when in front of their own disciples, these individuals would
maintain the majestic decorum expected of a Celestial Immortal. Here,
however, in front of all of these other Celestial Immortals, they
would revealed his true personality, acting with abandon. When it was
time to be smug, they would be smug; when it was time to mock, they
would mock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That black-robed
maiden is quite formidable as well. Look at those two techniques of
hers; one is a phoenix of fire, the other a phoenix of ice. As I see
it, she has absolutely mastered two complete Dao-Paths.” Next to
the first Celestial Immortal was a laughing fat man whose robe was
open, revealing his chest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. She has
mastered two complete Dao-Paths. That’s the only reason why she was
able to hold off the attacks of three of my sect’s disciples for a
period of time,” the skinny, shriveled Celestial Immortal said
confidently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you know which
school the black-robed maiden comes from?” The bare-chested fat
Immortal asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No idea.” The
wizened Celestial Immortal shook his head. “Who knows what minor
sect she’s from? Major sects naturally sent quite a few disciples,
who would usually travel in pairs or trios.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fat Immortal’s
eyes suddenly lit up. “Help has arrived.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The shriveled Celestial
Immortal’s eyes narrowed. He, too, saw that within the enormous
Diagram, a black-robed youth had suddenly appeared to assist the
black-robed maiden being attacked by those three Adepts of his.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed youth
was ridiculously powerful. He instantly defeated the three, as easily
though he were bursting through rotting wood, and in the end all
three died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
shriveled Celestial Immortal couldn’t help but frown. He slammed
his wineglass against the table, appearing to be quite vexed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bahaha, didn’t you
say the black-robed maiden was going to die?” The chubby Celestial
Immortal began to laugh loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Celestial
Immortals like them didn’t care too much about the deaths of these
geniuses; after all, geniuses came every three centuries. Their
deaths were minor matters. However, when so many Celestial Immortals
were gathered together, they naturally hoped that the disciples of
their school would be outstanding and earn some face for them from
their peers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course…that
was just a matter of face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thousand Celestial
Immortals down below were chatting amongst themselves. Up high, the
Xia Emperor and the other eight Pure Yang True Immortals were
chatting as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look there!” Lu
Dongbin’s eyes suddenly lit up as he pointed towards a corner of
the Diagram. “Look at the black-robed girl being attacked by those
three. A black-robed youth appeared next to them. Look, quick! See
that look in the black-robed girl’s eyes? That look in her eyes
that instantly appeared when she looked at the black-robed
youth…bahaha, a gaze that is extremely complicated, as though
long-suppressed emotions were instantly unleashed! Although it was
only for an instant, I daresay that this black-robed woman must have
fallen in love!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fallen in love?”
The Xia Emperor, the Bodhisattva of Great Strength, Sovereign Hao,
the Immortal Elder of the Northlands…they all were completely
speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had followed Lu
Dongbin’s pointing finger to watch, and they had been paying
attention to Ning who had exploded with power. Who would’ve thought
that Lu Dongbin, however, was paying attention to the look in Yu
Wei’s eyes?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That gaze…ahaha…it
was really…not only has this woman fallen in love, I daresay that
she’s never confessed it to this black-robed youth before.” Lu
Dongbin swept his gaze across the other True Immortals, then laughed
smugly, “Any of you want to bet with me on this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor and the
others exchanged glances, all feeling quite resigned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Xiamang, that black-robed youth of yours is rather
formidable,” Emperor Hao congratulated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor
laughed. “The black-robed youth is named Ji Ning. He numbers
amongst the few dozen most famous figures participating in this
Conclave of Immortal Destiny. His Primaltwin has even killed a Loose
Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The True
Immortals present all nodded, but to them, killing a Loose Immortal
was an extremely minor matter. They naturally wouldn’t pay too much
attention to it. What they cared more about was if any of the many
geniuses present at this Conclave would become one of the powerful
experts of the Three Realms in the future. And if so…who would it
be?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One of the few dozen
most famous? He lives up to the reputation.” The Bodhisattva of
Great Strength smiled and praised him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They actually didn’t
feel that Ning was particularly outstanding; after all, in the past
five days of the Conclave, quite a few members of the hundred
thousand-plus competitors had revealed astonishing levels of power.
They were all Wanxiang Adepts, but had been capable of exploding
forth with power comparable to an ordinary Loose Immortal’s…and
in fact, there were two Wanxiang Adept monsters who had comprehended
five complete Dao-Paths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Comprehended five
Dao-Paths? Even this wasn’t enough to shock the Pure Yang True
Immortals present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because they
felt that it wasn’t too shocking for some peerless geniuses to have
mastered five complete Dao-Paths after having spent three hundred
years at the Wanxiang level, all for the purpose of surprising
everyone at this Conclave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pure Yang True
Immortals like them…they were major figures of the Three Realms,
and so naturally their vision was quite broad. If one looked at the
Three Realms as a whole, it was indeed not rare for competitors with
five mastered Dao-Paths to appear at the Conclave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That little lass is
quite interesting, quite interesting.” Lu Dongbin was rather
intrigued now, and he laughed in a self-congratulating manner,
“Yep…that black-robed maiden’s been hiding her feelings all
along. I wonder when she will voice them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Xia Emperor
and the others just pretended not to hear anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone knew that what
Lu Dongbin loved to do was play matchmaker. This was one of his
favorite hobbies, and in fact, stories about him playing matchmaker
were extremely common throughout the Three Realms. They could tell
that Lu Dongbin was feeling the impulse to do so once more. He might
add a bit of ‘spice’ into the relationship between the
black-robed maiden and the black-robed youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus sat in the
lotus position behind the Dongyan Forefather. Her head had been
raised this entire time as she stared at the Diagram. She was mainly
paying attention to the six disciples sent by the Dongyan clan and
the three from the Black-White College…but of course, she paid the
most attention to Ji Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good. Senior
apprentice-sister Yu Wei is in danger.” A look of worry appeared on
Ninelotus’ face as her hands clenched around her robes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning. Ji Ning is
nearby.. Ji Ning, hurry up and notice it, hurry!” Ninelotus hoped
it would happen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And indeed, just as she
had hoped, Ning had sensed the ripples from the battle. He had
immediately moved in that direction, and had even displayed an
astonishing amount of power. All three died, and Ning and Yu Wei were
reunited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew. The danger is
past. Senior apprentice-sister Yu Wei is safe.” Ninelotus let out a
sigh. “Now, senior apprentice-sister Yu Wei and Ji Ning can move
together and support each other. It will be much safer for them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, Ninelotus’
heart trembled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was only natural and
normal for Ji Ning and Yu Wei to travel together; they were fellow
disciples, after all. It was normal for them to support each other.
But Ninelotus suddenly realized…Ji Ning and Yu Wei, a single man
and an unmarried woman, would be together for most likely an entire
year.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A single man and an
unmarried woman…experiencing life and death together…for nearly a
year…” Ninelotus suddenly shook her head gently. “But I no
longer have any right to think about such matters.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Love was a strange
thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had clearly
already separated, but upon seeing Ji Ning with Yu Wei, she felt as
though a stone had just hammered against her heart, causing ripples
that would be difficult to calm down.

Chapter 8 - The Grand Black Tortoise Divine Ability
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Brightmoon
Diagram of the Mountains and Rivers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.” Yu Wei’s emotions and her excitement were
all difficult to control right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister, your earlier battle caused quite a stir, and you
fought for a long while. Others are definitely lying in wait in this
area, and even more are probably on the way.” Ning had no time to
talk; with a wave of his hand, he collected the magic treasures and
storage treasures of the silver-haired woman and the black-robed man.
The talismans were located in the storage treasures; how could he not
take them away?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A ship appeared in
front of Ning and Yu Wei. “Senior apprentice-sister, let’s go.”
Ning pulled Yu Wei by the hand as he leaped into the ship. The two
immediately entered it, and the ship transformed into a streak of
light, quickly fleeing. As it fled, Ning spread out his divine sense
to sweep the area…and, just as he had expected, quite a few people
were present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who was that
black-robed youth? How could he be so powerful?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given his power, he
should be one of those who was ranked as one of the top hundred prior
to the Conclave beginning. He seems rather similar to that Ji Ning,
mentioned in the reports of the Heavenly Treasures Mountain. He uses
twin swords, is very powerful in close combat, and is skilled in
lotus techniques. Given the level of his power…it should probably
be Ji Ning. However, Ji Ning is usually dressed in furs, whereas that
youth was dressed in black robes. It seems that even Ji Ning doesn’t
dare to be too bold and brash.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Anyone would
recognize him in furs. In black robes…one would have to carefully
inspect him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The top hundred
experts of the Conclave truly are formidable. In single combat in
close quarters against this Ji Ning, when he activates all his divine
abilities…he can probably kill me in just one exchange of blows.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gotta be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them quickly and
secretly departed. Ning had fled quite fast. In addition, without
enough people joining forces, they didn’t dare to try and
antagonize Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ship flew thousands
of kilometers, then hide within a large mountain. Ning put away the
flying treasure, then let out a sigh of relief alongside Yu Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said with a laugh,
“Senior apprentice-sister, earlier when we were fighting, there
were eight figures within ten kilometers who were watching us, and
nearly two hundred people within a thousand kilometers were pressing
near. In this Diagram, even if you get into a fight, you can’t
continue to fight for too long. Otherwise, the disturbance will
definitely attract attention from others. You have to resolve any
fights quickly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course I know
that, but I was trapped by them and wasn’t able to even flee,” Yu
Wei said helplessly. “I was just about to throw out my talismans
and prepare to escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His senior
apprentice-sister definitely was a supremely beautiful woman in terms
of appearances. This look of helplessness on her face couldn’t help
but cause Ning’s heart to tremble slightly, but then he quickly
calmed himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister, earlier you used phoenixes of ice and fire,”
Ning said with a sighing laugh. “I have yet to congratulate you on
mastering yet another complete Dao-Path.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three years ago, she
had already mastered the Dao of the Freeze, but that was but a single
Dao-Path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You all call me the
Rainbowflame Fairy, right?” Yu Wei laughed softly. “I was more
talented in fire to begin with. Thanks to a stroke of luck, I first
mastered the Dao of the Freeze. My Dao of the Inferno was just a
small step behind that.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He, too,
felt as though he was about to make a breakthrough in the Dao of the
Inferno…but he continued to be just a hair away from actually
accomplishing it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Later on, I’ll
need to ask you to help guide me on the Dao of the Inferno, senior
apprentice-sister,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A minor matter.”
Yu Wei naturally was happy to help teach him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, senior
apprentice-sister. This is the storage treasure of the silver-haired
woman. Help me bind it. I’ll bind the other one’s storage
treasure. The talismans are all inside.” Ning handed a bracelet to
Yu Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You go ahead and
slowly bind it yourself,” Yu Wei said, looking at Ning. “If I
bound it, you definitely wouldn’t accept the talismans inside.
Don’t try to trick me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was flabbergasted.
Yu Wei was truly quite meticiulous and intelligent. Ning felt that he
was a smart man, but compared to her, he was still a bit inferior.
For example, just now; all he had done was ask her to help bind the
storage-type bracelet, and she had immediately been able to infer
that in reality, he was giving the talismans within to her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You killed both of
those two. The talismans belong to you. How about we split them?”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You saved my life,
and when I killed them, they were in a dazed state because of you.”
Yu Wei shook her head. “Enough. In the future, we are going to
continue to adventure in this Diagram. In the future, whoever makes
the kill will get the items, but this time, since you saved my life,
the talismans should be yours.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had no choice but
to nod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing how Ning was
behaving, Yu Wei felt quite happy, and the corner of her lips
couldn’t help but curve upwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go. Senior
apprentice-sister, you battled for a long time earlier; you need to
first restore your elemental ki and also calm your mind.” Ning
immediately led Yu Wei to quickly find a cave to hide in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on. The
days passed, one by one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Together, Ji Ning and
Yu Wei truly were much more formidable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei had mastered two
complete Dao-Paths, and was able to combine fire and water together.
Her phoenixes of ice and fire were indeed incredibly powerful, and in
terms of defense alone, the ice phoenix was comparable to Ning’s
Waterflame Lotus! This was the reason why Yu Wei had been able to
hold on for so long against the attacks of those three. In terms of
offense, the fire phoenix was quite astonishing as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With each other’s
support, even if ten or so people attacked them at once, they would
still have a chance at winning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yu Wei truly is
extraordinary; she has comprehended two entire Dao-Paths.” Immortal
Fivecraze was quite delighted with the performance of these two
disciples of the Black-White College. He often bragged about them to
the nearby members of other major powers of Stillwater Commandery.
“Ji Ning is even more formidable! One of the 96 positions will
definitely go to our Black-White College. And the eldest disciple of
the third generation; little Sloppy has yet to show his power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning is
formidable, but I really don’t see anything remarkable about that
the Sloppy Daoist of your Black-White College.” A white-haired
Loose Immortal of the Skysplitter Sword Sect shook his head and
sneered, clearly unhappy at how smug Immortal Fivecraze was acting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are just
jealous!” Immortal Fivecraze stared at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Conclave had been
going on for more than a month. The Sloppy Daoist was reclining
lazily within a cave. Next to him was a pool of water that was both
clear and refreshing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first three
months will be the craziest. I’ll relax for three months. Those who
survive to the end will all be formidable, and will definitely have
many talismans on them. Fighting will only be fun by that point.”
The Sloppy Daoist just lay there, producing a large cooked rib and
beginning to gnaw on it, covering his mouth in oil.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A wind blew past, and
eight figures suddenly appeared at the entrance to the cave. One of
the eight, a muscular man, said with a laugh, “Eldest
apprentice-brother, let’s take a break at this cave and bind the
storage treasures we just acquired. I hope there are talismans
inside—” But suddenly, the muscular man stared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other seven also
stared, flabbergasted, at the sloppy, chubby man lying down in the
cave and gnawing on a roast rib.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world of the
Diagram was clearly quite large; the chances of encountering someone
in a cave they randomly selected was very low. For the Sloppy Daoist,
despite having often hidden in this cave during the past month, this
was his first time encountering someone at the entrance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you always walk
by the side of the river, eventually your shoes will get wet.” The
Sloppy Daoist resignedly stood up and muttered to himself, then said
with a chortle, “Everyone, I’m resting here. Why don’t you
leave? Or perhaps I shall leave?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little sloppy kid,
are you playing dumb or actually dumb?” A youth with triangle
pupils said coldly, “Be good and hand your talisman over and we can
spare your life. Otherwise, don’t blame me for showing no mercy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nope.” The Sloppy
Daoist shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t waste words
with him. Attack!” the leader, a youth holding a feather fan, let
out a cold laugh and then immediately waved his hand. Feathers
instantly began to shoot out from the feather fan in his hands, and
hundreds of feathers instantly formed into an enormous Immortal
crane. The Immortal crane screeched as it sent its claws tearing
towards the Sloppy Daoist, and the surrounding rocky walls of the
cave were beginning to shatter from the force of the attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” The muscular
man let out an angry roar, then immediately expanded in size to
thirty-six meters. Because they were in a cave, he had to squat down
and lower his head. He also suddenly activated the [Three Heads, Six
Arms] divine ability, and in each hand he wielded an enormous
greataxe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He transformed into a
streak of lightning, charging forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each of the eight
released their own techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three were Fiendgod
Body Refiners, while the others were Ki Refiners. Each had secret
arts of their own, and the ‘Immortal Crane of the Nine Heavens’
technique of their leader, the fan-wielding youth, wasn’t that much
weaker than even the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]. However,
although the technique was fine, the power a technique could actually
unleash depended on the user. For example, when Ning used the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation], it was even more powerful and dazzling
than when the Thousand Swords Immortal had used it back when he
himself had been at the peak Wanxiang level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These eight all came
from an extremely large clan from the Eastern Seas known as the
‘Myriad Beasts School’. This was ranked as one of the most
supreme of schools in the entire Grand Xia Dynasty, and it was ranked
several tiers higher than the Black-White College. It had hundreds of
Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals! Naturally, all eight were
extremely powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battle began. Rocks
began to fly everywhere, and the mountain peak itself began to
crumble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the crumbling
mountain peak, the illusion of an enormous Turtle-Snake suddenly
appeared. A powerful aura that filled the heavens swept out from it.
A chubby youth with the eyes of a snake and whose skin was covered
with tattoos that looked like the shell of a turtle was there…and
with his bare hands, he smashed aside a giant, blood-red seal, then
slapped a terrified white-robed youth into dust with a single palm
blow. Next, his hand formed into a claw, striking forward like the
beak of a crow and piercing directly through the head of one of the
Fiendgod Refiner men. Then, with a swiping movement, he completely
tore the Fiendgod Refiner’s body apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooosh. The
enormous illusion of the Turtle-Snake quickly ground apart the body
of the Fiendgod Refiner, quickly transforming it into ash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, run!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My lord…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can he be this
powerful?! The records of the Heavenly Treasures Mountain regarding
the most powerful participants made no mention at all of this
sloppy-looking fatty!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The geniuses of the
Myriad Beasts School had completely collapsed. They all threw our
their talismans, but in total six of them still ended up being killed
by the sloppy-looking fatty. Only two of them just barely managed to
escape with their lives.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” The Sloppy
Daoist stood there atop the destroyed mountain. Waving his hand, he
collected up all the talismans and storage treasures. He was
completely back to normal, and no longer seemed as terrifying as he
had before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t want to
fight in the first three months, but they actually forced me to
unleash my grand divine ability.” The Sloppy Daoist shook his head.
“The participants of the Conclave of Immortal Destiny truly are
extraordinary. The attacks of just eight of them were enough to force
me to use my grand divine ability. I imagine that many others are
going to quickly arrived. I’d best leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a single step, the
Sloppy Daoist transformed into a gust of wind and disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main hall of the
Skylight Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of the Xia
Emperor, Lu Dongbin, the Immortal Elder of the Northlands, and the
rest of the nine had all changed. Although it didn’t appear as
though they were paying much attention to the Diagram, since they
were Pure Yang True Immortals, they actually saw everything which was
going on within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Grand Black
Tortoise divine ability.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grand Emperor
Xuanwu!” 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s actually a
successor for Grand Emperor Xuanwu. I wonder if he is a personal
apprentice or just an honorary apprentice.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all had solemn
looks on their faces now. Grand Emperor Xuanwu…he was one of the
major powers of the Three Realms, and an extremely terrifying figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Grand Black
Tortoise divine ability…it is definitely ranked as one of the top
hundred divine ability of the countless divine abilities created
since the universe was established.” Lu Dongbing spoke with a
serious look on his face. “I didn’t imagine that here, at the
Conclave of Immortal Destiny of your Grand Xia Empire, I’d be able
to see one of the most supreme divine abilities of the Three Realms!”

Chapter 9 - Repeated Breakthroughs
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor,
Sovereign Hao, and the rest of the nine Pure Yang True Immortals were
all staring at the distant, massive Diagram which hung in the skies.
They stared at that sloppy-looking, chubby youth. Without question,
this divine technique, the Grand Black Tortoise divine ability,
absolutely was not something that could be recorded down in a book.
It had to be transmitted through very special methods, and it had to
be Grand Emperor Xuanwu himself who did the transmitting!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone who was
approved of by Grand Emperor Xuanwu…he cannot be a simple figure.”
The Immortal Elder of the Northlands chortled. “Xiamang, who is
this youth? Where is he from?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The others all looked
towards the Xia Emperor as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor knew
the details of every single one of the hundred thousand-plus
attendees to this Conclave. Not trying to hide anything, he said,
“This youth is a disciple of the Black-White College, which hails
from the Stillwater Commandery of my Grand Xia Dynasty. His name is
Zhang Qi, and his Daoist title is ‘Threefat’, but because he’s
always dressed so sloppily, there are very few people in the outside
world who refer to him as Adept Threefat. The majority refer to him
as the Sloppy Daoist.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Sloppy Daoist?
His Daoist title is ‘Threefat’? This young fellow is quite
amusing.” Lu Dongbin laughed. “He actually picked such a casual
Daoist title. It seems as though this youth who Grand Emperor Xuanwu
took a liking to really does have unusual points about him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grand Emperor Xuanwu
is so majestic, and yet he actually chose such a sloppy young fellow
as his disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Sloppy Daoist?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all memorized this
name.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if this fat youth
was currently nothing more than an honorary disciple of Grand Emperor
Xuanwu, after he became a Celestial Immortal, he would most likely
become a personal disciple! For him to have been taught the Grand
Black Tortoise divine ability, even when he was so young and weak,
was testament to how much Grand Emperor Xuanwu liked him. For a major
power to care about him so much…his future would definitely be
extraordinary.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pure Yang True
Immortals had incredibly good high standards. The number of Celestial
Immortals that would arise from these hundred thousand-plus geniuses
could be counted on one hand, and they actually didn’t care about
them too much. However, the Sloppy Daoist’s status as the disciple
of Grand Emperor Xuanwu was definitely enough to make them pay
serious attention to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Grand Black
Tortoise divine ability?” The Dongyan Forefather revealed a look of
astonishment. “This, this Conclave actually has a disciple of Grand
Emperor Xuanwu?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Grand Black
Tortoise divine ability!” A stunned look was on Patriarch Arcanum’s
face as well. “This sloppily-dressed youth…who is he?! Our Grand
Xia world actually has someone capable of becoming a disciple of
Grand Emperor Xuanwu?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thousand Celestial
Immortals had often journeyed to other worlds as well, and some had
even gone to the Heaven Realm. Thus, they were fairly experienced. In
addition, the Grand Black Tortoise divine ability was an extremely
recognizable one; upon seeing the massive illusion of the
Turtle-Snake, and upon seeing the turtle shell-like tattoos that had
suddenly emerged on the Sloppy Daoist’s skin, there was no question
in their minds at all that this was the Grand Black Tortoise divine
ability. More than 80% of the nearly one thousand Celestial Immortals
present all recognized it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And they were all
amazed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Black
Tortoise divine ability…it meant that this person was the disciple
of Grand Emperor Xuanwu! Grand Emperor Xuanwu was one of the hegemons
of the entire Three Realms. He had been a hegemon ever since the
Primordial Era, and was absolutely one of the most major of powers!
Celestial Immortals like them dreamed about being able to become a
personal disciple of such a major power…but alas, the vast majority
of them would only be permitted to become honorary disciples at best.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a huge
difference between honorary disciples and personal disciples.
Personal disciples…to be one meant that the major power would use
all of his effort in training you.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Honorary disciples, by
contrast, were just honorary; you’d be qualified to go listen to
the major power expound on the Dao, but it would be hard to even
speak a single word to that major power in private!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortals
were carefree Immortals who had escaped the restrictions of the Three
Realms, and were able to dominate a local region. Major powers needed
servants to take care of matters for them, which was why they give
appropriate Celestial Immortals a status of being ‘honorary
disciples’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the Sloppy Daoist
was different. He had been taught the Grand Black Tortoise divine
ability when he was merely a Wanxiang Adept. His treatment was
absolutely on par with a personal disciple’s treatment! Even though
he was currently just an honorary disciple, that was merely because
he was currently too weak; after becoming a Celestial Immortal, he
would be immediately promoted to personal disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The plaza below.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Patriarch has
ordered us to immediately investigate who that sloppy-looking fatty
is.” An azure Flood Dragon that had shrunken in size and was
coiling in midair stretched out a claw, pointing towards a spot in
the sky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll investigate
right away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Supreme One has
ordered us to investigate that sloppy-looking fatty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortals
were on too high of a level, and so they knew very little about the
geniuses in this Conclave of Immortal Destiny. The Sloppy Daoist, at
least, was someone which almost none of them recognized. They didn’t
dare to spread out their coresense; after all, the Xia Emperor and
eight other Pure Yang True Immortals were right next to him. All they
could do was just to send orders to their subordinates.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than half of the
major powers of the 3600 commanderies and four seas immediately began
to investigate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, they
discovered…that this person was named Zhang Qi, his Daoist title
was Threefat, and that most referred to him as the Sloppy Daoist. He
was a disciple of the Black-White College of Stillwater Commandery!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stillwater
Commandery…the Black-White College?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Black-White
College?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A small school like
that actually produced a disciple that Grand Emperor Xuanwu cares
about?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Immortals
located in the main hall of the Skylight Palace all quickly received
this information. They were all completely puzzled…but in their
hearts, they already viewed the Sloppy Daoist as someone with status
equal to theirs. The mere fact that he was someone whom Grand Emperor
Xuanwu cared about was more than enough for him to be treated as an
equal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The leader of the
Black-White College delegation, Immortal Fivecrazed, couldn’t help
but laugh delightedly as he saw all this. “I always did say that
little Sloppy is extremely formidable. I understood his Dao-heart
long ago…and I’ve always said that not even the Earth Immortals
or Loose Immortals of the Black-White College are comparable to him
in terms of his Dao-heart. He truly is formidable! But what divine
ability is that? Not even I have ever seen it. It seems fairly
powerful though; little Sloppy must’ve had a very lucky encounter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heh heh heh…given
how formidable little Sloppy is, perhaps in this Conclave…he’ll
be accepted by one of the powerful Celestial Immortals or Pure Yang
True Immortals of the Three Realms as a disciple.” Immortal
Fivecraze was daydreaming beautifully right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on. More
than a month had already passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battles raging
within the Brightmoon Diagram of the Mountains and Rivers were
exceptionally agonizing, because everyone understood that they were
all fighting over their Immortal destiny.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, in the eyes of
the exalted Xia Emperor and the other eight True Immortals, aside
from the Sloppy Daoist, who had caused them to sigh in
amazement…these other geniuses could at most cause their eyes to
briefly light up. In addition, it was already quite rare for a
disciple of a major power to appear in the Conclave of Immortal
Destiny of a major world; they didn’t believe a second would
emerge!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the world of the
Diagram. A waterfall cascaded down like a white torrent, smashing
against a pool and spraying water everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next to the pool, there
was a violet-robed, thick-browed, large-eyed, massively built youth.
He was seated in the lotus position. Not too far away from him
another youth, also in the lotus position; this youth had a head of
tousled, unruly hair, and looked almost like a barbarian. His gaze
was like that of one of the eagles in the sky, filled with a savagery
that could cause the heart to quiver.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang Zishan, are
you done rest? It’s time for us to go. We don’t have enough
talismans yet!” 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hey, I’m talking
to you!” The wild-haired barbarian youth began to get angry. But
right at this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arcane ripples of power
suddenly began to descend around the massively built violet-robed
youth. These were the ripples of the Dao. Water and mist began to
swirl around him, and in the midst of the water and mist could be
seen flashes of lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…the hell? You
made a breakthrough, just like that?” The barbarian youth was
speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The violet-robed youth
slowly opened his eyes. If the barbarian youth could be described as
an eagle of the heavens, then this violet-robed youth was like a
primordial behemoth of the group, filled with an absolutely
dominating aura. In terms of dominating auras, even the father of
Northmont Baiwei, ‘Northmont Blacktiger’, was a level inferior to
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cangwu Jiu.” 2 The
azure-robed youth cracked a smile, revealing his white teeth. “I’ve
mastered a fourth Dao-Path as well! I’ve caught up to you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Before this, you and
I were on par…and now, you punk, you are even more powerful than
me?” Cangwu Jiu was amazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them had run
into each other shortly after entering this Diagram world. They had
fought together, then realized neither could achieve victory of the
other. Given that they had also grown up together in the imperial
capital, and felt friendly towards each other to begin with…and
that as soon as they had entered the Diagram world, they had both
suffered repeated group attacks…they decided to join forces!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You run too fast. If
you focus on avoiding taking on my attacks head-on, there’s nothing
I can do to you either.” A look of confidence was in Xiamang
Zishan’s eyes. “But if you actually fight against me head-on…you
naturally are no longer my match. With four Dao-Paths which have been
infused into my Grand Dao of Lightning…I imagine that in this
entire Diagram world, if I said that I was number two, no one would
dare claim themselves to be number one!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t go too
crazy,” Cangwu Jiu sneered. “And don’t be smug. There are
countless geniuses in the Diagram, and given how many times they are
battling every day…these battles are tempering them and allowing
them to improve at an astonishing rate. Quite a few people are most
likely making breakthroughs!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. That’s
something I do need to be careful about.” Xiamang Zishan nodded. “I
can’t be too overconfident. My goal in this Conclave is to come out
number one!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cangwu Jiu shook his
head. “Let’s hurry up and go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiamang Zishan and
Cangwu Jiu both flew off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist was
standing by the side of a lake. Underneath the light of the moon, it
appeared illusory and dreamy. His eyes were closed. He had no idea
that in the outside world, nine True Immortals and many Celestial
Immortals were all focusing on him, and that he was the largest focal
point for the entire Diagram right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“whew.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist’s
body suddenly trembled slightly, and then a swirl of fire erupted in
the surrounding area, billowing outwards. One circle of fire after
another spread out, with the Sloppy Daoist at the center. The ripples
of the Dao descended.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist
opened his eyes. “After training for all these years, and after
fighting tens of times every day in the Diagram world…I’ve
finally made a break through in the fourth month and mastered my
third complete Dao-Path. What I need to do now is to fuse all three
of these complete Daos into my Grand Dao of Taiji.” 3
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist had
also gained insight into a Grand Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning had gained
insight into the Grand Dao of the Sword, while the Sloppy Daoist had
embarked on the path of the Grand Dao of the Taiji.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After a few months,
many of those who had been present in the Diagram had given up…and
many of them had perished within it! But for the surviving geniuses?
It was normally incredibly rare for them to be able to encounter
geniuses on their same general level and fight with them…and now
that they were doing so for tens of times or a even hundred times
each day, many of them began to make sudden breakthroughs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many of them had been
trapped at bottlenecks, and now, they were all making their
breakthroughs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixth month of the
trials within the Brightmoon Diagram of the Mountains and Rivers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a wilderness
region. A black-robed youth and a black-robed woman were within the
wild grass of this area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat there in the
lotus position, and not too far away was Yu Wei. Yu Wei was also
seated in the lotus position, quietly looking at Ning. Earlier, Ning
had said to her: “Senior apprentice-sister, I gained some insights
in that previous battle. Help stand guard for me.” And then, he had
set down a simple vision-obscuring formation, then closed his eyes
and entered a meditative state.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei looked at Ning,
whose eyes were still closed. She carefully looked at his eyes, his
nose, his lips…she looked at him very carefully and very earnestly.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei rested her hands
on her chin, just looking at Ji Ning. In fact, an unconscious smile
even crept onto her face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was very quiet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were underneath
the light of the moon. The only people present were herself and her
junior apprentice-brother. She just gazed at her junior
apprentice-brother…and everything seemed so perfect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The plaza of the
imperial citadel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whaaaaaat?” Mu
Northson stared at the image of Ji Ning and Yu Wei within the Diagram
in the skies. Yu Wei sat there, resting her hands on her chin and
staring intently at Ning. “Can it be that senior apprentice-sister
Yu Wei has fallen for senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning? Good
heavens!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Little Qing, wrapped
around Northson’s arm, was staring intently as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just from the look on
Yu Wei’s face, anyone with the slightest bit of intelligence would
be able to guess that Yu Wei harbored feelings for Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That little girl Yu
Wei and Ji Ning…?” Immortal Fivecraze revealed a grin. As he saw
it, since both Yu Wei and Ji Ning were peerless geniuses of the
Black-White College, they were quite a match for each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look look, look look
look, that expression on that little girl’s face! I told you, I
told you all! I told you that this little girl must be in love with
that Ji Ning fellow.” Lu Dongbin urgently pointed at a corner of
the massive Diagram while saying to the nearby Xia Emperor, Sovereign
Hao, and others, “I wanted to bet with you earlier, but none of you
were willing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are the Sage of
Love, a legendary matchmaker, the Moon Elder…who would dare bet
against you in such a matter?” A Pure Yang True Immortal dressed in
black Daoist robes that had a blood-colored Taiji diagram embroidered
onto them laughed. 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Truelord, I’m no
sage of love; I don’t even have a Dao-companion. I’m definitely
not the Moon Elder either; the Celestial Court already has a
designated Moon Elder,” Lu Dongbin said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Buffoonery and jests;
shamelessness and thick-skinnedness; a master of pretense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In short, any place
with Lu Dongbin in it would be a place of laughter. This was why Lu
Dongbin had so many friends in the Three Realms. He was an incredibly
good-natured fellow, had powerful backers supporting him, and was
very strong in his own right. How could he not have countless
friends?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus, seated
behind the Dongyan Forefather, tightly grasped at her robes as she
stared at the massive Diagram. She chewed on her lips, a complicated
look in her eyes. “Senior apprentice-sister Yu Wei…towards Ji
Ning, you…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, she had
only been a bit worried. Although over the past few months, Ji Ning
and Yu Wei had grown fairly close as they had adventured together,
Ninelotus had chalked that up to being because they were fellow
disciples of the same school. But upon seeing that look…she had no
more doubts at all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve made my
choice.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No regrets.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus bit her lips,
lecturing herself mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei just gazed at
Ning, completely absorbed in her own little world. She completely
forgot that there even was an outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After an indeterminable
period of time, tendrils of flame began to emerge around Ning, which
grew and expanded into an lotus flower that began to continuously
expand, from a fist-sized lotus flower to an enormous flaming lotus
that was many tens of meters long. Ning sat there in the very center
of the lotus amidst the pistils as the ripples of the Dao descended.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Yu Wei
suddenly came to her senses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good!” She
suddenly felt shocked. “Those in the outside world can see
everything that’s going on within this Brightmoon Diagram of the
Mountains and Rivers! Someone might’ve noticed me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She had only revealed
her emotions and ceased disguising them when she had seen that Ning
had been completely absorbed in meditating on the Dao. She had
forgotten that others outside could see her! This caused Yu Wei to
feel incredibly awkward and embarrassed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister.” Ning opened his eyes, then said with a laugh,
“I’ve broken through the bottleneck. I’ve finally mastered the
Dao of the Inferno.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei hurriedly came
back to her senses, then said happily, “That’s wonderful. Junior
apprentice-brother, you’ve already mastered the Dao of Rainwater.
Now that you’ve mastered the Dao of the Inferno as well…with fire
and water joining together and then infusing your Dao of the Sword,
your power must have grown significantly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded,
filled with anticipation as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two complete Dao-Paths.
He had also reached the Grand Dao Domain in the Dao of the Sword. He
now felt even more confident in his chances. Although some of the
most supreme geniuses amongst these hundred thousand-plus competitors
in the Conclave might have already started training in their own
Grand Daos, some had just a basic grasp while others had just gotten
to understand their own hearts. Only a very few would have reached
the Grand Dao Domain like Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, you need to seize the chance to train in your
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens],” Yu Wei immediately
said. “You are only at the eleventh stage. There are many
practitioners of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] in
this Conclave, and most of them have reached the twelfth stage.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
nodded. This was his weakness. In Swallow Mountain, countless years
would pass before there would a genius capable of training in the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], but in Stillwater
Commandery, the Black-White College alone had quite a few. As for the
participants in this Conclave, many of them trained in the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. To be at the eleventh
stage of it was indeed a bit weak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, he had a
powerful soul and was a Sword Immortal, and also had the [Starseizing
Hand]. He didn’t fear fighting against any of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just half a month after
Ning had mastered the Dao of the Inferno.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A massively built
violet-robed youth and a barbarian youth were walking
shoulder-to-shoulder amidst the mountain forests, sweeping out with
their divine sense to a distance of ten kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cangwu Jiu, how many
talismans do you have?” Xiamang Zishan asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just barely over a
thousand. You?” Cangwu Jiu asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have more than a
thousand already? I’ve killed even more people than you, but I only
have 989!” Xiaman Zishan stared at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s because you
are stupid. Will you necessarily acquire a lot of talismans just by
killing a lot of people? Some people had many on them; some had less.
It comes down to being a matter of judgment…and clearly, your
judgment is vastly inferior to mine,” Cangwu Jiu said disdainfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiamang Zishan shook
his head. “You don’t have THAT many more than me. Look at how
smug you are acting! We’ve spent more than six months in the
Diagram; more than half a year has passed. We need to speed it up and
acquire at least 1300 each.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Brightmoon Diagram
of the Mountains and Rivers had a total of 109,362 competitors within
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After a year, the
eighty contestants with the most talismans would have passed the
trials. Thus, so long as they acquired at least 1370 talismans, it
was guaranteed that you would have passed. And given that some would
have more and others less, while some of the losers would also have
talismans…1300 was probably going to be enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have to aim for
1400! Only then can I be at ease,” Cangwu Jiu said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While chatting, the two
continued to sweep their divine sense forward. Whoosh! They continued
to advance rapidly forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Cangwu Jiu
and Xiamang Zishan’s eyes suddenly flickered. Swoosh! Swoosh! The
two transformed into streaks of light, instantly charging forward by
many kilometers. Many kilometers away, halfway up a tall mountain
peak, there stood a black-robed man and a woman. It was Ning and Yu
Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Yu Wei both
had powerful souls as well; when the enemy swept them with their
divine sense, they both immediately noticed it. A moment later, two
figures appeared in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Them?” Ning and Yu
Wei were both shocked. They immediately recognized the two, because
these two were simply far too famous. And, more importantly, the two
hadn’t changed their clothes at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang Zishan?
Cangwu Jiu?” Ning’s heart clenched. According to the reports from
the Heavenly Treasures Mountain regarding the peerless geniuses
participating in this Conclave, the number one ranked figure was
Xiamang Zishan, while the number two was Cangwu Jiu!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiamang Zishan trained
in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], and also trained
in my divine abilities that were used only by the imperial Xiamang
clan and were not taught to outsiders! His talent was absolutely
top-notch as well, and the Grand Xia Emperor was quite pleased with
him. Supposedly, he had long ago been guided by the Grand Xia Emperor
into the tutelage of one of the experts of the Three Realms, and his
power was immeasurable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cangu Jiu was one of
the rare, peerless geniuses of the Cangwu clan. His age was
comparable to Xiamang Zishan’s, and ever since they had been young,
they had been famous geniuses of the imperial capital. They had grown
up together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because Xiamang Zishan
was of the imperial clan, he was ranked as number one while Cangwu
Jiu was forced to be ranked as number two. But no matter what…without
question, these two were the two most famous participants in this
Conclave!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given how famous
they are, they assuredly have the power to back it up. Why have the
two most famous figures joined forces?” Ning felt nervousness in
his heart. If he encountered one of them, he would dare to fight…but
he had Yu Wei with him as well, and she was a Ki Refiner. Although
she had mastered two complete Daos, her power was still quite a bit
lower than figures like Xiamang Zishan and Cangwu Jiu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lu Dongbin, weren’t
you paying a great deal of attention to that little girl? This time,
that little girl and Ji Ning have really run into trouble,” the
Immortal Elder of the Northlands called out with a chortle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin was
watching. He said vexedly, “This really does seem to be trouble.
Those two are named Xiamang Zishan and Cangwu Jiu, right? Their power
can be considered to be in the absolute top tier of these hundred
thousand-plus competitors. Even compared to the Sloppy Daoist, they
would still probably be on par. You can’t say for certain who is
stronger until they actually fight, but…Ji Ning and the little girl
are a bit too weak.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Zishan is the most
outstanding member in the junior generation of my Xiamang clan, and
has a chance to rank in the top three this time.” The Xia Emperor
laughed as he spoke. It was rare for him to care about someone from
the younger generation, but Xiamang Zishan was the one he liked the
most.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister, Ji Ning.” Ninelotus watched nervously. She knew
how frightening Xiamang Zishan and Cangwu Jiu were. Earlier, when she
had watched as Xiamang Zishan and Cangwu Jiu had been headed in the
direction of Ning and Yu Wei, she had begun to feel nervous. And in
the end…they really did encounter each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope nothing bad
happens.” Ninelotus was extremely nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the world of the
Diagram.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The friends and family
outside were worried, but there was nothing they could do. Ning and
Yu Wei were now both very cautious as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are…Ji Ning?”
Cangwu Jiu’s hawk-like eyes stared at Ning, immediately recognizing
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s Ji Ning?
Doesn’t Ji Ning dress in furs?” The nearby Xiamang Zishan said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I told you that you
are an idiot, but you wouldn’t listen. Can’t you just change your
damn robes?” Cangwu Jiu shook his head. “I acquired quite a few
paintings of Ji Ning. I collected many paintings of all the geniuses.
Just by looking at a single one, it can be hard to recognize the real
person, which is why I had to view many of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have more than a
hundred paintings of Ji Ning, so I recognized him at one glance,”
Cangwu Jiu said confidently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Yu Wei
exchanged a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From the way the two
were chatting to each other and from how calm they were, it was clear
that they were very confident.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister, don’t fight them head on. Use your phoenixes to
attack them, while I’ll tie them up for a while. You flee first,
then I’ll come afterwards,” Ning sent. Yu Wei nodded as well. She
knew that if it weren’t for her, it would be much easier for Ning
to flee, but with her here…although their attack power was greater,
fleeing became trickier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning and Yu Wei were
chatting mentally…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hand over your
talismans, and I’ll spare your lives!” Cangwu Jiu’s voice
suddenly turned sharp, and his mental message echoed in Ning and Yu
Wei’s minds. Cangwu Jiu charged forward, and suddenly in midair a
massive black vulture that was was three hundred meters long suddenly
appeared. The plumes of the black vulture glowed with an oily light,
and its eyes seemed almost alive as it dove forward with a screech.

Chapter 11 - Ji Ning Battles Xiamang Zishan
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s the
Venomous Nethervulture secret art!” Ning immediately recognized the
technique. Cangwu Jiu had become famous long ago, and this Venomous
Nethervulture art was his signature technique. It was an enormous
Venomous Nethervulture that was formed from many magic treasures in a
formation. As for Cangwu Jiu himself, he was hidden within the grand
Venomous Nethervulture. Once it failed, Cangwu Jiu would emerge from
within the body of the Nethervulture and enter close combat!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei pointed towards
the distant. Whoosh! All 72 Rahu Godneedles instantly appeared in
midair. Filled with elemental ki, they activated the natural energy
of the world to form a pair of enormous phoenixes of fire and ice.
The two phoenixes simultaneously howled through the air as they
charged towards the giant black vulture.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shkreee!” The
black vulture let out a venomous screech, then slashed downwards
viciously with his claws.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The phoenix of ice and
the phoenix of ice charged upwards, but after exchanging just two
blows many cracks had already appeared on their bodies. Upon their
third collision against the vulture, both phoenixes completely
shattered, and the 72 Rahu Godneedles were immediately knocked flying
back as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise.” Ning stood
there, and around him manifested the Waterflame Lotus. The Waterflame
Lotus surrounded him, the lotus leaves swaying gently as they
continuously swiveled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The charging black
vulture smashed directly against the Waterflame Lotus. There was an
enormous collision sound, but although some of the leaves of the
Waterflame Lotus shattered, new ones quickly emerged. Clearly, this
technique was incomparably resilient. This caused the relaxing,
spectating Xiamang Zishan to feel startled; this was rather beyond
his expectations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After six months of
tempering and especially after having thoroughly mastered both the
Dao of Rainwater and the Dao of the Inferno, Ning had further
perfected his Waterflame Lotus, as his powers were now in perfect
equilibrium, allowing the technique to clearly grow more formidable.
In addition, this was a technique which used earthfire and dire-ice
of the first grade as its base; how could it be so easily defeated?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, leave.”
Ning sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Yu Wei
transformed into a streak of light, immediately planning to fly away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shkreee!” The
venomous black vulture suddenly opened its mouth, and a person
emerged from within it. It was Cangwu Jiu. Cangwu Jiu was wielding a
scimitar in his hand, and as he flew out, his body suddenly exploded
in size to become sixty meters tall. His right arm transformed into a
golden color, and with a single flash, he caught up to the location
in front of Yu Wei, frightening her into hurriedly retreating.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!” Ning suddenly
manifested more than seven hundred flying swords around him. A golden
flying sword appeared in front of him, then shot out with a bang.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The power of the
[Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] caused even Cangwu Jiu’s body to
tremble for a moment, but in the next moment, the golden right arm of
Cangwu Jiu brandished that scimitar and chopped apart the flying
sword of golden light. By this time, Yu Wei had fled back to the
Waterflame Lotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He is too fast. I’m
not able to escape,” Yu Wei sent frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood as
well. Forget about Yu Wei; even he himself wasn’t confident in
being able to escape from the attacks of Cangwu Jiu. Cangwu Jiu’s
strongest point was his speed to begin with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then I’ll trap
him!” Ning sent. “Senior apprentice-sister, you and I shall first
block him off together!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
One golden flying sword after another, formed from the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation], flew out and attacked. As for Yu Wei, the
72 Rahu Godneedles in front of her flew out once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation], the phoenix of ice, and the phoenix of fire
simultaneously attacked. Cangwu Jiu, seeing everything headed his way
as well as that enormous Waterflame Lotus, couldn’t help but frown.
He mentally barked, “Xiamang Zishan, why aren’t you helping out
yet?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no way Cangwu
Jiu could dominate Ning and Yu Wei by himself, after they joined
forces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s just two
people. I thought you could handle it by yourself.” Xiamang Zishan
laughed loudly in response. “Cangwu Jiu, remember, don’t let
these two escape. You are most skilled in pursuing and trapping
enemies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry about
that!” Cangwu Jiu stood there in midair, pointing towards the
distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a fierce
gale arose in the surrounding area, howling as it spun into a
tornado. The spinning tornado covered the surrounding area,
stretching several kilometers and completely trapping Ning and Yu Wei
within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll use the
Qian-Heaven Soulwind to trap them, the Venomous Nethervulture to
support it, and I’ll personally be prepared to attack at any time,”
Cangwu Jiu sent mentally. “Under these three techniques…there’s
no way they’ll escape. As for fighting them head on? I’ll leave
that to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiamang Zishan laughed
loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His footsteps suddenly
began to cause the mountains to tremble as he immediately transformed
into a sixty meter tall giant, and his entire body began to radiate
with a violet-colored lightning. The violet-colored lightning even
began to appear in the surrounding area, and an enormous black metal
staff appeared in his hands. Wielding the black metal staff, he
charged into the heart of the giant tornado towards the Waterflame
Lotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!!! He unleashed a
single sweeping smash from the black metal staff, but the power of it
was so great it seemed capable of reversing the course of rivers.
Many of the leaves of the Waterflame Lotus were completely smashed
apart into two pieces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such power.” Ning
was shocked. Why was the man even more powerful than he had
predicted? In the Heavenly Treasures Mountains’ reports, it didn’t
seem as though Xiamang Zishan was quite this terrifying. Ning’s
Waterflame Lotus wasn’t even able to withstand a single blow from
this man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, right?
Come!” Xiamang Zishan laughed loudly, possessing the aura of a
dominating mountain that would crush and destroy anything before it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning suddenly took a
step forward as well. Boom! He transformed into a 54 meter tall
giant, and lightning crackled around his body as well. In his hands,
two Darknorth swords appeared. He charged forward, and as he did a
third eye appeared in the middle of his forehead. A succession of
lightning bolts slammed out towards the distant Xiamang Zishan…who
actually didn’t dodge at all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The violet lightning
crackling around his body was enough to easily deflect Ning’s
thunderbolt strikes. As for the divine will component to the attack?
He paid even less attention to that.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Soldiers of the
Mind].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An invisible, formless
surge of divine will shot out, forming into sharp swords, warblades,
and longspears. The weapons howled as they flew towards Xiamang
Zishan’s sea of consciousness, frantically chopping and stabbing at
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiamang Zishan paused
momentarily, but he then quickly regained control over himself. The
savagery in his eyes only grew stronger. “So you have some ability
after all!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You live up to your
reputation as the number one expert in the Heavenly Treasures
Mountain’s intelligence report.” The enormous Ning charged
forward, twin swords in his hands and absolute confidence in his
eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” Xiamang
Zishan twirled his black metal staff, his aura of power filling the
heavens. Even before his breakthrough, he had been ranked by the
Heavenly Treasures Mountain as the number one figure in this crowded.
Now that he had made a breakthrough, Xiamang Zishan personally
believed that he had no equals left. His goal in this Conclave was to
become the number one champion!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two instantly
collided against each other!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A dazzling sword-light
filled the skies!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A massive staff
shattered apart the Waterflame Lotus with the force of a flood!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning took three steps
back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiamang Zishan took
three steps back as well. The surrounding mountain had begun to
crumble, and even the mountain peak was trembling, on the verge of
collapse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Cangwu
Jiu, in midair, was astonished. “He blocked that madman Xiamang
Zishan? This Ji Ning has incredibly terrifying close combat power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a fellow. You
actually managed to receive the third stance of my self-created
Qiankun Staff of Force! Have a test of the fourth stance I just
created! This is a stance which I created by fusing four complete
Dao-Paths into my Grand Dao of Lightning!” Xiamang Zishan was
clearly growing even more berserk as he charged towards Ning once
more, and the staff in his hands verily surged with flows of violet
lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As his staff smashed
down, it seemed to tear apart the world itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stepped forward to
receive the blow, the Darknorth swords in his hands transforming into
dazzling streaks of sword-light as they blocked the terrifying staff.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A heavy collision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiamang Zishan didn’t
even take a single step back, but Ning was actually forced backwards
until his back slammed into the mountain wall behind him. The
mountain peak, already trembling and unstable, suddenly began to
collapse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?!”
Ning’s face was completely ashen. In his very first clash against
Xiamang Zishan, he had already executed the [Starseizing Hand]. In
the first exchange, he had barely managed to fight the man to a
standstill, but now that this man had used an even more powerful
technique, Ning was now in a position of absolute inferiority.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His staff techniques
are more powerful than my sword techniques.” Ning understood the
issue. The difference between the two in terms of the Dao was too
great. In addition, the enemy had reached the twelfth level of the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], which was more than
Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This opponent was of
the imperial Xiamang clan. Although the divine abilities he trained
in couldn’t compare to Ning’s [Starseizing Hand], they were still
some of the better divine abilities of the Three Realms, and the
difference wasn’t too staggeringly great.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The mountain peak
collapsed, sending rocks flying everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Xiamang
Zishan stared at each other, completely ignoring the flying rubble.
The flying rubble couldn’t even strike them; as soon as they came
near, the divine power covering their bodies would instantly smash
them apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Three Heads, Six
Arms!]” Ning’s body suddenly swayed as two new heads and four new
arms emerged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, me too!”
Xiamang Zishan’s body swayed as well, and he too used the [Three
Heads, Six Arms] technique. He was now wielding a total of three
giant black metal staffs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come.” Ning
charged forward, displaying his Windwing Evasion, moving as
unpredictably as a ghost as he moved to engage Xiamang Zishan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hahaha….” Xiamang
Zishan continued to fight him head-on, charging straight for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of them were using
[Three Heads, Six Arms]! Six swords, fighting against three black
metal staffs!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light flowed
through the air like streams of running water, incomparably
beautiful. A flood of staff-blows filled the skies like bolts of
thunder. Ning no longer fought head on; in the past, when he relied
on the [Starseizing Hand], he was able to brute-force everything, but
upon meeting Xiamang Zishan…he began to instead turn to using the
nimbleness inherent to swords, as well as the Windwing Evasion
technique. Although with each exchange of blows, Ning was knocked
backwards, he wasn’t sent completely flying like earlier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going to hit!
Hit! Hit hit hit you!!!” Xiamang Zishan was incomparably berserk as
his three black metal staffs wildly smashed everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s six swords
were like an unbroken, everflowing stream of water, blocking and
shunting the power of the enemy attacks to the side each time. Every
so often, he would even be able to deliver a counterblow with his
sword as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning could
taste the blood in his mouth. “I can’t continue like this. I have
to rescue senior apprentice-sister.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation]!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a golden
sword coalesced before him, then howled through the air and shot
towards Cangwu Jiu. Ning sent frantically, “Senior
apprentice-sister, hurry up and leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG! With a powerful
staff blow, Xiamang Zishan smashed Ning down into the shattered
stones. He roared angrily, “Punk, don’t get distracted. If you
get distracted, you’ll die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fight between
Xiamang Zishan and Ji Ning had long ago attracted the attention of
almost everyone, from the Pure Yang True Immortals and Celestial
Immortals to the people on the plaza below the Skylight Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang Zishan and
Cangwu Jiu. The Heavenly Treasures Mountain reported these two as
number one and number two.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning is so
formidable; he was actually able to tie down Cangwu Jiu.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s now fighting
against Xiamang Zishan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang Zishan is so
powerful. Ji Ning has actually been able to exchange more than a
hundred rounds of attacks with him?” The various delegates from the
3600 and 4 great seas all felt their hearts clench. Many of them were
Loose Immortals or Earth Immortals; naturally, they could tell how
formidable and fierce Xiamang Zishan’s staff technique was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a staff
technique that surpassed the techniques of many Loose Immortals! In
addition, Xiamang Zishan’s divine body and divine abilities were
clearly incredibly powerful as well. He was an absolutely dominating
and irresistible force.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ji Ning, a young
fellow who had only trained for thirty or so years, was actually able
to withstand the attacks. Although he was in a position of
inferiority, he was able to rely on the nimbleness of his sword arts
to deflect the attacks, and tie down his opponent!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But upon seeing Ji Ning
be distracted as he controlled the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]
to tie down Cangwu Jiu, resulting in Xiamang Zishan heavily injuring
him and sending him flying into the rubble, many people instantly
felt their hearts clench for Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning is actually
allowing himself to be distracted in a life-and-death battle? His
opponent is Xiamang Zishan!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope he doesn’t
end up losing his own life for the sake of saving his female
companion.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many of the people in
the plaza of the imperial citadel were discussing the situation
amongst themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mu Northson, Little
Qing, the Whitewater Hound, Immortal Fivecraze, Northmont Baiwei, and
Ninelotus had begun to feel nervous and worried long ago. But there
was nothing they could do; they couldn’t go inside. No one could
help Ji Ning. They could just watch as the scene played out before
them.

Chapter 12 - The Sound of the Flute in the Mountain Cave
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei, hidden within
the Waterflame Lotus while controlling her phoenixes of fire and ice,
watched as the three-headed, six-armed Ji Ning battled with full
force against Xiamang Zishan, then diverted part of his attention to
use his sword formation against Cangwu Jiu. This caused the eyes of
Yu Wei, who was only controlling her phoenixes to protect herself, to
instantly turn red.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How long had it been?
It had already been six months. During the past six months, she and
Ning had adventured together through the world of the Brightmoon
Diagram of the Mountains and Rivers. They had fought nearly a hundred
times on every single day; sometimes, others fled, while other times,
it was her and Ning who fled!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was more powerful
than her, and was a Fiendgod Body Refiner as well; each time they
were in danger, it had always been Ning who had charged forward to
block the enemy from pursuing. Although this time there were only two
enemies fighting them, compared to the previous dangers they had
undergone, this was the most dangerous one of them all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister, hurry up and leave!” Ning’s voice echoed out
in Yu Wei’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s telling me to
leave again. To leave again. Why am I always a burden to him?” Yu
Wei ground her teeth, tears flashing through her eyes. She sent back,
“Junior apprentice-brother, don’t worry about me. I’m not
strong enough to continue. I’ll give up. I’m going to leave this
Diagram. In the future, you’ll have to rely on yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With her slowing him
down, Ji Ning would definitely find things easier. Given his power,
there was no need at all for him to go fight anyone head-on if he
didn’t have to.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In front of Yu Wei,
many talismans suddenly appeared, and they scattered out in the area
around her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She truly didn’t want
to accept this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had only been six
months.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She truly wanted to
accompany Ji Ning in continuing to journey through the world of the
Diagram until the year was over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Give up the
talismans and I’ll spare your life.” Cangwu Jiu, in midair,
revealed a smile. But suddenly…his smile froze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because Yu
Wei, who had just thrown out all her talismans…actually grabbed a
handful back. Then, with a wave of her hand, she actually collected
all of them once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you looking to
die?!” Cangwu Jiu, who felt as though he had just been played for a
fool, was instantly enraged. He no longer waited there in midair; he
immediately transformed into a streak of light and charged downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei, who had just
taken back her talismans, now had a deep, dark, dangerous look in her
eyes. She stared at the charging Cangwu Jiu, then gently pointed a
single finger towards him. Instantly, the 72 Rahu Godneedles
separated into two groups which undulated in the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">36 of the Rahu
Godneedles, summoning the power of the natural world, formed into a
single, enormous black phoenix. This phoenix was completely black,
and the tail-feathers of the phoenix blazed with black flames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the other 36
Rahu Godneedles, they transformed into an enormous white phoenix
which was completely pristine and pure, emanating an almost holy
gaze. Lines of glowing white light could be seen emanating from the
tail-feathers of the white phoenix as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Cangwu Jiu
instantly felt his heart tremble as an inexplicable, nameless
sensation of danger caused him to instantly explode forth with full
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! The 60 meter
tall Cangwu Jiu struck out with his golden right arm, and his saber
was absolutely dazzling to behold, leaving behind a beautiful,
solitary, perfect arc in the skies as it chopped downwards towards
that black phoenix. The black phoenix let out a bird’s call;
although it was knocked backwards, it wasn’t damaged in the
slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Screech!” The
white phoenix began to battle against Cangwu Jiu’s black
vulture…and the black vulture actually began to tremble and crack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?
She, she…” Cangwu Jiu was incomparably shocked and angered. This
woman was clearly much weaker than him! Ji Ning was one thing; he had
been famous before this, and was even capable of battling with
Xiamang Zishang for so long. Most likely, Cangwu Jiu himself was only
on par with Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But how was it that
this woman, who had no reputation whatsoever, was able to completely
block him now?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not happening. Don’t
believe it.” Cangwu Jiu exploded with power, also manifesting two
more heads and four more arms. He now wielded three scimitars in his
hands, and he transformed into a tempest as he shot forward, his
scimitar-light seeming capable of splitting the skies and carrying a
terrifying majesty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the black phoenix
and the white phoenix supported each other…and were actually able
to block the berserk Cangwu Jiu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, Mu
Northson, the Whitewater Hound, Little Qing, Immortal Fivecraze,
Adept Vastriver, Northmont Baiwei, and Ninelotus were all extremely
nervous. Now, they were all stunned. How had Yu Wei suddenly exploded
forth with such power? Her defense was completely airtight, causing
even Cangwu Jiu to be unable to do anything to her at all. This was
simply inconceivable!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was Cangwu Jiu she
was facing!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can, can it be that
senior apprentice-sister had been hiding her power all along?”
Northson was puzzled. “But she hasn’t been training for much
longer than senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning has.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main hall of the
Skylight Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor,
watching, couldn’t help but smile. “The situation has just
reversed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just like in the
poem; ‘the same mountains and the same rivers, with seemingly no
path forward; then the shady willow tree, the brilliant flowers, and
a mountain village’1. Something pleasant and unexpected has just
occurred.” Lu Dongbin sighed in surprised. “Who would’ve
imagined that at this critical moment, the little girl managed to
reawaken her memories from her past life? Judging from what I saw…her
reawakening of memories caused her to master at least four complete
Dao-Paths. Her level of insight in the Grand Dao of Taiji is quite
high as well; in her past life, she must’ve been a fairly
formidable Loose Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Dao of Taiji
and four complete Dao-Paths; this would make someone a supreme expert
amongst Loose Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She had already
mastered two Daos before this.” The Immortal Elder of the
Northlands, nursing a cup of wine, rolled his head. “When one is at
a high enough level of comprehension, it does indeed become possible
for the memories from a previous life to reawaken. However, it is
quite hard for the memories of a past life as a Loose Immortal to
completely awaken; it seems in that instant, she suffered a severe
mental blow which stimulated her, causing her soul to instantly
explode and activate the hidden memories.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Pure Yang True
Immortals present all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Conclave of
Immortal Destiny had more than a hundred thousand participants, and
there were many reincarnated Immortals amongst them. It was indeed
theoretically possible for them to reawaken their past memories…but
it was extremely, extremely rare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s the name of
this little lass?” Lu Dongbin looked towards the Xia Emperor. “I
don’t know her name yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Her name is Yu Wei.
Her Daoist title is Rainbowflame; because she is a reincarnated
Immortal, she is referred to by others as the Rainbowflame Fairy,”
the Xia Emperor said. “She, too, hails from the Black-White College
of Stillwater Commandery. You already know about Ji Ning, who is next
to her. This time, the Black-White College has produced three
attendees, and each of them truly are formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Sloppy Daoist is
the disciple of Grand Emperor Xuanwu, and his power is on par with
Cangwu Jiu, Xiamang Zishan, and Ji Ning. This Yu Wei was originally
weaker, but now that she’s regained her former memories, she’s on
the same level as well,” Sovereign Hao said with a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As I see it, the
Sloppy Daoist has trained for more than a century, while Yu Wei had
memories from a past life that she reawakened. But Ji Ning has only
trained for thirty years, yet already has such incredible power…this
is rather inconceivable.” Lu Dongbin stroked his jaw, murmuring to
himself, “As I see it, Ji Ning has tremendous potential.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor
laughed. “Lu Dongbin, can it be that you want to take on a
disciple?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, no, no…I
actually have more of a liking for that little lass named Yu Wei.”
Lu Dongbin’s eyes lit up. “She was actually stimulated to the
point of having her former memories awaken; this little lass is
quite, quite amusing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The others all
immediately shook their heads. Reincarnated Immortals generally
didn’t have much potential; if they weren’t able to overcome the
tribulation and become a Celestial Immortal in their past life, then
the chances they would succeed in this one would be very, very low.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning does have
some potential.” The Xia Emperor murmured quietly to himself. He
had already taken notice of twenty one youths in this Conclave, each
of which had tremendous potential; Ji Ning was one of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the world of the
Diagram.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was suppressed
by Xiamang Zishan’s might; although he used his agility to counter
the other’s raw power, he was still wounded by their colliding
blows. Still, this sort of injury was minor; Ning was still paying
full attention to his senior apprentice-sister, only to discover that
under Cangwu Jiu’s attack, Yu Wei had suddenly exploded with power.
She was actually able to fight him to a standstill! This caused Ning
to feel both astonished and delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, come over here. Hurry up and collect your sword
array,” Yu Wei sent frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister!” Ning stopped wasting time with Xiamang Zishan.
With a whoosh, he swept through the air to move towards Yu Wei, while
at the same time mentally commanding the [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation] swords to return to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Yu
Wei grabbed Ning by the arm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black phoenix and
the white phoenix suddenly began to revolve around each other,
forming into a black and white vortex. Yu Wei grabbed Ning, then
charged into the vortex.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A brilliant, dazzling
streak of black-and-white light appeared in the skies. They had
instantly moved more than a thousand kilometers away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What, what technique
is this?!” Xiamang Zishan walked over, saying in astonishment, “How
could they have escaped so quickly? Cangwu Jiu, even you were unable
to catch them? Didn’t you say that you are the fastest person in
the world at the Wanxiang level?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t catch
them.” Cangwu Jiu shook his head. “I can tell that this is
evasive technique which uses a magic treasure…a technique that was
specifically designed for escape, formed from the Grand Dao of Taiji.
This woman has an extremely high level of comprehension in the Grand
Dao of Taiji!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a mountain cave.
After setting up a simple formation, Ning plopped his rear down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang Zishan
really was an absolute madman.” Ning felt utterly exhausted; the
earlier battle had been simply too frenetic. Suddenly, from the
corner of his eye he saw a pool of water located deep in the cave. He
immediately ran over, then used his hands to cup some water and wash
his face. “That feels great.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She was going to be
able to continue to stay with her junior apprentice-brother in the
Brightmoon Diagram of the Mountains and Rivers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She walked towards the
side of the pool, then sat down. With a wave of her hand, she
produced a jade flute, then began to gently blow it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sound of the flute
was melodious and leisurely, seeming to reach deep into a person’s
heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, stunned, put down
the water in his hands and sat down to listen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sound of the flute
was drifting and soft…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…it spoke of a vast
grassland, a peaceful, gentle tribe, and a female child who was the
member of that small tribe…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…the peace was
destroyed, and disaster descended…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…the female child
embarked upon the path of slaughter, becoming a terrifying female
Asura…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One scene after
another, starting from childhood in the past life, to death and
reincarnation…they all entered Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sound of the flute
seemed to possess an indescribable magic power, causing Ning to feel
joy, rage, sorry, and pleasure. It was a flute song that bored
straight through to the heart. Ning was completely drawn into it. He
looked at the black-robed woman playing the flute. This memory was
deeply engraved into Ning’s heart. Even after a tremendous period
of time passed, he would still be unable to forget it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Drip.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A single tear fell down
onto the ground, staining the dirt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled
awakened from the reverie the flute song had brought him into. Only
now did he realize that Yu Wei had two tearstains on her face. He
couldn’t help but call out, “Senior apprentice-sister!” Yu Wei
trembled…then gently put down her flute.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister, you…” Ning was a bit worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m fine.” Yu
Wei shook her head, looking at Ning. She even smiled. “I just
thought of some things in my past life. Although everything has
already happened…now that the memories have truly returned, they
really do make it hard to control one’s emotions. Still, those are
all in the past now; let the past be in the past. I’ve already
reincarnated into a different world. In truth…I would rather not
know about what happened in my past life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can you talk to me
about it?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t want to.”
Yu Wei shook her head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then…did you have
a Dao-companion in your past life?” Ning suddenly asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei was startled.
She gave Ning a close look, as though wanting to see something in
Ning’s expression. She then gently shook her head. “I did not!”

Chapter 13 - Immortals and Gods
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Ning said
hurriedly, “I…used up a lot of divine power in the previous
battle. I need to take a rest.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he spoke, Ning
hurriedly walked deeper into the cave. Waving his arm, he chopped out
a neat, flat region onto the ground and then lay down. Using his arms
as a pillow, he immediately closed his eyes and began to snore.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He seemed calm, but in
his heart Ning felt a bit confused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why the hell did I
ask senior apprentice-sister if she had a Dao-companion or not?”
Ning’s mind was restless. He was a smart person, and an Immortal
cultivator who had understood his own heart long ago. He quickly
understood the issue. “Can it be that I’m…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forget it…how can
Dao-companions be so casually joined?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Am I mentally
ready?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not yet! I’m not
yet ready…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned in his
sleep, suppressing everything in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He thought back to the
experiences he had in the past half year. He thought back to the
first time he had met her, and all the times he had met her up till
today. Ning had to admit…from the very beginning, he had felt very
friendly towards her, because she was unlike Ninelotus, who had many
beliefs that were different from Ning’s. He and Ninelotus were from
different worlds. As for Yu Wei…many of her beliefs were the same
as his, and her personality was similar as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her birth…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her experiences…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her talent…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He and Yu Wei were very
similar. She was even more intelligent than him! The past half year
he had spent with her was very relaxed and comfortable. She had
silently, tracelessly slipped deep into his heart with her warmth.
Just now in particular, when she had played the flute, the song of
the flute had thoroughly penetrated his heart. Ning could even feel
the joy, the pain, and the sadness she felt in her heart…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This feeling, as though
he had touched her soul, made Ning feel a certain softness towards
her. He even wanted to go over and hug her. This was why his
subconscious had moved him to ask her about Dao-companions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dao-companions…this
sort of promise cannot be casually made.” Ning sighed quietly to
himself in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei watched Ning lie
there deep in the cave. She rose, then walked to the entrance of the
cave, where she sat down. She stared at the vast, seemingly endless
mountain forest. The cave was protected by a bewildering formation,
and so the outside world couldn’t see inside it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moonlight shone down
into the cave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei picked up her
flute, holding it as she sat there quietly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can feel junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning’s heart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Previously, I held
back, wanting to let it all pass.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But on the sixth day
I was in the Diagram, I was in dire straits…despite how vast the
Diagram was, junior apprentice-brother ran into me. Can it be that
fate is telling me that I should be together with him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…can I even
have a Dao-companion? Can I dare hope for a Dao-companion?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei stared at the
moon hanging high in the skies. She quietly asked…“Heavens
above…what should I do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei understood that
she had reached a fork in the path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If she chose to be with
Ning, then the two might have a chance. But if she didn’t want to
be with him, then after leaving the Diagram, she would have to
separate from him and make a clean break.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One month after another
passed. The number of Wanxiang Adepts within the Diagram dropped
continuously. Now, virtually all the remaining competitors within the
Diagram were monsters capable of exploding forth with power that
rivaled ordinary Loose Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the imperial
citadel’s plaza.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, only a
thousand remain within the world of the Brightmoon Diagram of the
Mountains and Rivers, but the Black-White College has taken up three
of those slots!” Immortal Fivecraze was utterly delighted. There
was no way any of the other powers of Stillwater Commandery,
including the Northmont clan of Stillwater, could compare to the
Black-White College in this regard. The three experts the Black-White
College had sent out this time were simply too dazzling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even the Marquis of
Stillwater came over to chat with me for quite a long period of time.
Even other marquises came over, as well as leaders of supreme clans
and sects.” Immortal Fivecraze then frowned. “But it’s weird…Ji
Ning is clearly very powerful as well, but why is it that those who
came to chat with me discussed little Sloppy even more?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could sense the
goodwill these major clans and sects were displaying towards the
Black-White College was primarily aimed towards befriending the
Sloppy Daoist. It seemed as though Ji Ning and Yu Wei were far from
being comparable with the Sloppy daoist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Weird, weird. Ji
Ning is very formidable as well, and he’s trained for an even
shorter period of time.” Immortal Fivecraze was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How bizarre.” Lu
Dongbin, who had spent a period of time napping in the main hall of
the Skylight Palace, stared at the Diagram. “I took a three month
nap…why is that this little girl named Yu Wei still hasn’t become
Dao-companions with Ji Ning yet?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dao-companions
represent a promise that cannot be so easily uttered!” The Pure
Yang True Immortal who was dressed in black robes decorated with a
blood-colored taiji diagram shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can’t dawdle
when it comes to matters of love!” Lu Dongbin shook his head.
“Based on my experiences roaming the Three Realms and countless
minor worlds, matters of love must be immediately seized and settled
down upon at the critical moments in time! If you hesitate, the more
you dawdle, the more difficult it will become to form Dao-companions.
I am willing to bet on it! If this Yu Wei and Ji Ning are to become
Dao-companions, they’ll become Dao-companions within the Diagram.
If they don’t, then after they leave it…without these shared
daily life-and-death experiences, the chances will drop even more!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do any of you dare
to bet against me?” Lu Dongbin stared at them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lu Dongbin, you are
a Sage of Love. You spout so much wisdom about love…why don’t you
have a Dao-companion of your own?” The True Immortal with the
blood-colored taiji diagram robes spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those in the game
are blinded by it. Those who are watching the game have clear eyes.”
Lu Dongbin gave a calm response, then stopped talking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a quiet
mountain. A bewildering formation had been set down. Ning was seated
in the lotus position atop a grassy area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Streams of fire and
water swirled around the surrounding area. Surges of power from the
Solar Star and the Lunar Star were being absorbed into Ning’s body.
Although they were within the world of the Diagram, he was still able
to train in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A series of rumbling
sounds could be heard from within Ning’s body. His bones were
clattering together as his muscles and skin were rapidly
transforming.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At his current level,
Ning’s physical body was already extremely tough; he wasn’t too
far off from the likes of the Fiendgod, Xiangliu Fang. A casual
breath from him could generate a hurricane that would sweep out for a
thousand kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly…everything
calmed down. Ning opened his eyes, revealing a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother?” Yu Wei, who had been standing guard for him,
looked eagerly at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. I’ve already
broken through.” Ning let out a laugh. “It took me quite a few
years, but I’ve finally managed to reach the twelfth level of the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. And it really is
different; the twelfth level of this technique…it’s comparable to
ordinary early Primal stage Fiendgod Body Refiners. My divine body
and my soul have completely joined…and I can feel that my soul is
rapidly strengthening.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fiendgod Body Refiners
and Ki Refiners…these were two different paths. Upon reaching the
Primal level, Fiendgods could directly split off a clone! Upon
reaching the Void level, they could pluck out a hair and transform it
into a clone!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that Ning had
trained to the twelfth stage, his body was actually quite similar to
the Primal Turtle-Snake in that it was capable of nourishing the
soul. In addition, he was able to join his soul to his body! His soul
was able to enter every single part of his body. In other
words…Ning’s current body was no longer made of mere flesh. His
flesh and blood contained his soul within it as well! This was why he
was now capable of creating mobile ‘clones’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your soul is rapidly
gaining in strength?” Yu Wei hurriedly said, “I heard that the
souls of Fiendgods are generally even more powerful than that of
ordinary Primal Daoists.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s true.” Ning
nodded. “The soul-nourishment provided by my divine body is even
more astonishing than that provided by the Primal Turtle-Snake…based
on what I sensed when I created my Primaltwin, my Fiendgod body is
strengthening my soul at least five or six times faster than the
Primal Turtle-Snake did.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder Fiendgod
Body Refiners are so powerful. Everyone says that at higher levels,
Fiendgod Body Refiners are even more powerful, especially after
overcoming the Celestial Tribulation and becoming Empyrean Gods.
Empyrean Gods are comparable to Pure Yang True Immortals in power,”
Yu Wei sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister, you know about Empyrean Gods and Pure Yang True
Immortals?” Ning was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t forget that
I’m a reincarnated Immortal.” Yu Wei nodded. “Based on what I
know…for Immortal cultivators, the stages are Zifu Disciples,
Wanxiang Adepts, Primal Daoists, Void-level Earth Immortals…and,
for those who pass the Celestial Tribulation, the stages are
Celestial Immortals and True Immortals! True Immortals are also known
as Pure Yang True Immortals. After them are Golden Immortals of the
Great Firmament, also known as Daofathers of the Great Firmament!
Alternately, they can just be addressed as Daofather! Daofathers are
the absolute most supreme figures of the Three Realms. They are
unquestioned hegemons who are even more exalted in status than the
Celestial Emperor!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes lit up.
He didn’t know any of these things. He had only trained for thirty
years. Compared to someone who had memories from a past life, he did
indeed know very little regarding the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Golden Immortals of
the Great Firmament, also known as Daofathers of the Great Firmament
or as Daofathers?” Ning murmured to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mastery of a
Dao-Path is a prerequisite for becoming a Celestial Immortal. Mastery
of a Grand Dao is a prerequisite for becoming a Pure Yang True
Immortal. And mastery of a Heavenly Dao is the prerequisite for
becoming a Daofather of the Great Firmament!” Yu Wei said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart shook.
Mastery of a Heavenly Dao?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the Black-White
College’s Headmaster Daoist Jadesea had discussed these things with
him, he hadn’t explained in such detail. It seemed as though Yu Wei
was truly extraordinary in her past life. At least, she knew much
more than Daoist Jadesea!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After Pangu
established the heavens and the earth, there were ten Heavenly Daos!
This is common knowledge for Celestial Immortals. It was a Celestial
Immortal who told me this,” Yu Wei said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ten Heavenly Daos?”
Ning immediately asked, “What are the ten?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are the
Heavenly Dao of Metal, the Heavenly Dao of Wood, the Heavenly Dao of
Water, the Heavenly Dao of Fire, the Heavenly Dao of Earth, the
Heavenly Dao of Life, the Heavenly Dao of Destruction, the Heavenly
Dao of Yin, the Heavenly Dao of Yang, the Heavenly Dao of Primordial
Chaos,” Yu Wei said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
memorized this all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Metal, wood, water,
fire, earth, Yin, Yang, life, destruction, and primordial chaos!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All things in the
world were born from primordial chaos. They are then split into Yin
and Yang. The Three Realms…its foundation comes from the Five
Elements,” Yu Wei said. “For example, your Dao of Rainwater
actually belongs to the Grand Dao of the Waterdrop. As for the Grand
Dao of the Waterdrop, it belongs to the Heavenly Dao of Water.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dao. Grand Dao.
Heavenly Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Five Elements
served as the foundation for the functioning of the Three Realms, and
were all Heavenly Daos. This was as he had expected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mastery of a
complete Grand Dao is already incredibly difficult,” Yu Wei said.
“As for the legendary Heavenly Daos…only those who master them
can have the exalted title of ‘Daofather’. After all, the
Heavenly Daos are the source of all things. Thus, their masters can
be titled Daofathers!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Threelives had
been born with mastery of a Grand Dao. He had later mastered many
Grand Daos, but never a Heavenly Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofathers of the
Great Firmament are seated above all. They possess inconceivable
power, and are the hegemons of the Three Realms,” Yu Wei said.
“Pure Yang True Immortals are the experts of the Three Realms!
Daofathers won’t casually engage in combat, and so the most
glorious, eye-catching figures of the Three Realms are actually the
True Immortals. As for Celestial Immortals, they are also
free-willed, unconstrained figures with immortal life. They can
dominate a region for themselves; after all, Pure Yang True Immortals
are fairly rare in the Three Worlds, and so Celestial Immortals have
very high statuses as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Only
today, did he understand…some of the higher levels of the Immortal
path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What about the path
of Fiendgods?” Ning immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After Fiendgods pass
the Heavenly Tribulation, they become Empyrean Gods! Empyrean Gods
are comparable to Pure Yang True Immortals in power. Every single one
of them is an expert of the Three Realms,” Yu Wei said. “Above
Empyrean Gods are True Gods! True Gods are generally actual Fiendgods
who have created their own divine ability. They war against the
heavens and against the earth with terrifying power, and are
absolutely comparable to Golden Immortal Daofathers of the Great
Firmament!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True Gods are the
highest level of Fiendgods possible. According to legends…the
Fiendgods born in the primordial chaos before the heavens were
established were at all least Empyrean Gods! The strongest amongst
them were True Gods of Primordial Chaos! They were born into the very
highest realms of power of the Three Realms. Even without training,
they were incomparably frightening figures.”

Chapter 14 - The Final Month
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei said with envy,
“They are the true favored children of the heavens. Ki Refiners
revere Golden Immortal Daofathers of the Great Firmament, whereas
Fiendgod Refiners revere True Gods of Primordial Chaos. Daofathers or
True Gods; ever since Pangu established the heavens, they have been
the most supreme of existences in the Three Realms. They are the ones
who truly determine the destiny of the Three Realms. Even the
Celestial Emperor is chosen by these major powers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly felt many
thoughts flood his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Threelives was
born in primordial chaos and had mastered a Grand Dao. Clearly,
Daoist Threelives was a True God of Primordial Chaos!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, according to
what the giant yellow bear had said, Daoist Threelives had once
suffered a catastrophic defeat, losing an arm in it. The proud Daoist
Threelives elected not to regrow his arm, continuing to only have one
arm. Thanks to his constant research and meditation, he had developed
one of the ten most terrifying divine abilities of the Three
Realms…the [Starseizing Hand]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” The
giant yellow bear’s voice suddenly echoed in Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior,” Ning
immediately said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Amongst Empyrean
Gods, there are those with powerful divine abilities and those with
weak ones. Amongst True Gods, there are those with formidable divine
abilities and ordinary ones. How can they all possibly be on par?”
The giant yellow bear clearly felt displeased on behalf of his
master. “In addition…if Master was still alive, I imagine that he
would have long ago mastered a Heavenly Dao. Only…despite the
passage of ages, Master has never come to seek me out…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear’s
voice suddenly faded away. He didn’t know if Daoist Threelives was
still alive or not either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After this conversation
with Yu Wei, Ning’s vision had been greatly broadened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the most exalted,
venerable positions were the Daofathers of the Great Firmament and
the True Gods of Primordial Chaos. The Three Realms were their
chessboard, and they controlled everything in it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Emperor
and the Yama-Kings of Hell were jointly decided upon and appointed by
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…I wonder
what Daoist Threelives encountered in the past, which caused even him
to feel that he had no confidence in being able to survive,” Ning
pondered to himself. When Daoist Threelives had left behind the
underwater estate, he had gone to deal with a so-called ‘tremendous
calamity’. Afterwards, all word of him had been lost, and he had
never returned to the underwater estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Threelives was a
major power. Something that could cause even him to feel uncertain
regarding his chances of survival…what sort of calamity was that?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three Realms…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine that
senior apprentice-sister Yu Wei doesn’t know the true face of the
Three Realms either.” Ning continued to feel as though a layer of
gauze was preventing him from understanding the truth of things. For
example, in the Netherworld Kingdom, he had encountered a
terrifyingly strong power which had assaulted the Six Paths of
Reincarnation. Fortunately, Ning had leapt into the Six Paths and
been reincarnated; otherwise, he would’ve died permanently on the
spot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who attacked the Six
Paths of Reincarnation?” The more Ning’s horizons were broadened,
the more he was amazed…because the Six Paths of Reincarnation were
the most important, central region for the functioning of the Three
Realms. Most likely, even major powers wouldn’t dare to act rashly
there. Otherwise, the other major powers would be enraged and join
forces to deal with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m nothing but an
ant; this matter isn’t for me to worry about. If the heavens fall,
the tall fellows will hold it up.” Ning quickly discarded these
thoughts for now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed in the
blink of an eye. It was already the twelfth month within the trial of
the Diagram. This was the final month!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A dirty-looking maiden
and a violet-robed youth were walking forward, shoulder-to-shoulder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where the hell did
this Adept Ninedeaths come from?” The violet-robed youth glanced
sideways at the maiden, secretly muttering to himself. He, Xiamang
Qi, was one of the most outstanding young members of the imperial
Xiamang clan, second only to Xiamang Zishan! In addition, he had
never been convinced of his inferiority; he always wanted to be able
to overcome Zishan with his power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During this Conclave,
Xiamang Qi had revealed his magnificence as well. His strength was
formidable…but upon encounter this girl, this so-called ‘Adept
Ninedeaths’, he had felt deflated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This girl is too
powerful. No matter how I hit her, I couldn’t injure her. Her body
is just like a magic treasure.” The violet-robed youth was very
resigned. “Adept Ninedeaths? More like Adept Nodeath!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dirty maiden had
said to him back then, “I have enough talismans already. The more
time passes in the Diagram, the more powerful the survivors are. Many
of them have already formed into small teams. Kid, you seem pretty
powerful; shall we join into a team of our own? That will make the
final two months easier.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we encounter any
enemies and kill them, can I have the talismans?” Xiamang Qi listed
his requirement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” The dirty
maiden nodded, and so Xiamang Qi and Adept Ninedeaths joined forces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The two
suddenly came to a halt. They stared into the distance, where four
figures had appeared, some male and some female.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a wild,
black-haired youth who was very skinny, a silver-haired maiden, a
woman who was so beautiful she looked like a fairy from the legendary
Moon Palace, and a bald, black-skinned youth. The black-skinned youth
was actually barefoot, and he wielded a gnarled black staff in his
hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kindwater Qi? Second
brother, why is it that you are travelling alongside Adept Danzhu?”
Xiamang Qi laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother?!” The
skinny, black-haired youth called out in surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These two were known as
the ‘Two Qis’ of the imperial capital. This was because both of
them had strange, rather wicked personalities. However, the two just
so happened to take a liking to each other, and they had become sworn
brothers. Xiamang Qi was the elder brother, while Kindwater Qi was
the younger brother. 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The more time
passes, the more dangerous it gets; I no longer dare to travel
alone.” Kindwater Qi said with resignation, “I feel confident in
my power, but even Xiamang Zishan and Cangwu Jiu have formed an
alliance long ago. We have to do the same! The four of us even fought
against those two. Fortunately, thanks to Blackstone’s presence,
the two were frightened into immediately fleeing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Xiamang Qi
was surprised, and the dirty maiden by his side, Adept Ninedeaths,
revealed a look of surprise as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Someone had caused
Xiamang Zishan and Cangwu Jiu to flee?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Introduce us,”
Xiamang Qi said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You already know
Adept Danzhu of the East Seas.” The black-haired Kindwater Qi
pointed at the beautiful maiden who looked like a fairy from the Moon
Palace. Adept Danzhu smiled and nodded at them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kindwater Qi then
pointed at the silver-haired maiden. “This is Adept Snowfly; her
magic arts are extremely powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He then pointed at the
barefoot, black-skinned youth with a gnarled black staff. “This is
Adept Blackstone. Adept Blackstone is exceptionally skilled in the
Fuxi Formation Staffs, and a true grandmaster of the art of
formations…with him present, we can flee when we wish and attack
when we wish. Adept Blackstone is also extremely powerful in close
combat. With a single blow, he was able to block an attack from
Xiamang Zishan…as I see it, Adept Blackstone absolutely has a
chance to become number one in this Conclave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiamang Qi and Adept
Nindeaths both looked towards the bald, staff-wielding, black-skinned
youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was quite curious.
When they faced this bald, black-skinned youth, they felt as though
they were facing the vast heavens themselves…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A grandmaster of
formations? Capable of withstanding Xiamang Zishan in close combat?”
Xiamang Qi was secretly shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm…” The dirty
maiden looked towards the bald, black-skinned youth with curiosity as
well. He, in turn, was looking back at her. The two of them both had
an indescribable feeling…that the other was quite terrifying!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How about it? Shall
we travel together?” Xiamang Qi asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kindwater Qi looked
towards the black-skinned youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-skinned youth
gave the dirty maiden a glance, then revealed an extremely thin
smile. “Fine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” The dirty
maiden spoke out as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six of them joined
into a squad.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this squad, Adepts
Blackstone, Ninedeaths, and Danzhu had already acquired more than
1400 talismans. As for the other three, Xiamang Qi, Kindwater Qi, and
Adept Snowfly still needed a bit more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Yu Wei were
wandering the mountains as well. They moved as fast as the wind,
instantly moving across the peaks. As they walked, they released
their divine sense to scan up to a thousand kilometers away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although it was the
twelfth month already, nothing had changed between the two. Ji Ning
and Yu Wei acted like a pair of normal fellow disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister, how many talismans do you have? How many more do
you need?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you have enough?”
Yu Wei asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have 1200 or so,”
Ning said. “Actually, since everyone is going to have different
amounts of talismans, I should have a 99% chance of ranking in the
top eighty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Better to be safe.
Only if you have 1370 will you be absolutely certain to be qualified
of passing the trial,” Yu Wei said. “I have slightly fewer
talismans than you; I have nearly eight hundred.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. The two
had continued to split talismans based on who had killed the foe.
Although Ning had been trying to hold back for her sake, ever since
he had reached the twelfth level of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the
Nine Heavens], his power had simply grown too great. Upon
encountering some powerful foes, Ning had to explode forth with full
power. Naturally, he would thus be the one to kill them, and so the
talismans would go to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the final month,
I imagine that all of the remaining survivors have hundreds of
talismans on them. As long as we just kill two or three, we’ll have
enough,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But killing those
final two or three will be very hard.” Yu Wei spoke with great
solemnity as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were now fewer
and fewer people present. It was quite hard to run into someone, and
in each battle, if the enemy felt that the situation was bad, they
would immediately flee! To kill them or force them to give up their
talismans…it was far too difficult!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We still have plenty
of time. We have more than half a month,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two continued to
advance, and in the blink of an eye, they had passed more than a
thousand kilometers. Their divine sense continued to sweep out to a
thousand kilometers as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning and Yu
Wei suddenly raised their heads, staring towards the sky. A ship was
charging downwards at high speed towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That ship is covered
with restrictive spells, making it unable to be scanned by divine
sense. They come with ill intentions. Be careful.” Yu Wei mentally
messaged Ning, but the two were bold due to their power; they
wouldn’t easily retreat or flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A thousand kilometers
was passed in an instant. The ship vanished, and six figures appeared
on the grassy ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Yu Wei’s
pupils contracted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang Qi, a genius
of the imperial Xiamang clan. Kindwater Qi, a genius of the Kindwater
clan. And Adept Danzhu!” Ning and Yu Wei’s glances fell upon the
figure of the beautiful Adept Danzhu, who looked like a fairy maiden
from the Moon Palace. Of the six before them, the most famous one was
Adept Danzhu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main hall of the
Skylight Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For the Ji Ning - Yu
Wei pair, their earlier encounter with Xiamang Zishan and Cangwu Jiu
was a tribulation.” Lu Dongbin said with a sigh, “That time, they
only escaped because Yu Wei awakened her former memories. This
time…these six are even more powerful. That dirty maiden has
mastered five complete Daos! That bald, bare-foot, black-skinned
youth is an expert in formations. Both of these two are capable of
fighting to be the number one competitor in this Conclave. Upon
encounter this six-person squad…Ji Ning’s duo is in huge
trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Within the world of
the Brightmoon Diagram of the Mountains and Rivers, how many have
died in the past year? Each battle was a life-and-death trial for
them. For your precious little pair of Dao-companions…this is
nothing more than a slightly tougher trial,” Truelord Chiji said
calmly. 2
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This battle is going
to be interesting,” the Xia Emperor laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were roughly
twenty or so that had a chance at the top spot in this Conclave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Ninedeaths, Adept
Blackstone, and Ji Ning, after his recent breakthrough…they all had
a chance at becoming number one in this Conclave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">

Chapter 15 - Dire Circumstances
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ji Ning and Yu
Wei were wary, they weren’t afraid. As they saw it, the only one of
the six who they needed to be careful of was Adept Danzhu. Ning had
broken through to the twelfth level of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of
the Nine Heavens], and he was completely confident in being able to
defeat Adept Danzhu. What he didn’t realize was that although Adept
Danzhu was formidable, in this six-person squad, Adept Blackstone and
Adept Ninedeaths were even more frightening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! The bald,
barefoot, black-skinned youth suddenly smirked, and instantly,
streaks of light shot out everywhere like bolts of lightning. They
were ancient, plain-looking Fuxi Staffs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fuxi Staffs! A
formation!” Ning was startled. There were very few supreme geniuses
who also trained in formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Streaks of light
intersected and runes formed and flowed. The formation appeared,
locking down the nearby region of space for ten kilometers,
completely capturing Ning and Yu Wei within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Done.” The
black-skinned youth said calmly, “I’ve already sealed this area
off. There’s no place these two can run to. Whether you decide to
kill them or release them is up to you.” He actually sat down in
the lotus position towards the edges of the sealing barrier, planting
his gnarled staff next to him. He just sat there, clearly not wanting
to intervene.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He already had enough
talismans; for him to set up this grand sealing formation against the
enemies was enough of a show of kindness for his teammates. Have him
do battle as well? He couldn’t be bothered to…and in his bones,
he wasn’t the type of person who enjoyed battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Xiamang
Qi said coldly, “Obediently hand over all of your talismans, and
the two of you can live. Otherwise…death is your only escape!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hand over your
talismans!” Kindwater Qi barked as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hand them over.”
The silver-haired maiden, Adept Snowfly, barked at them as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These three didn’t
have enough talismans yet. Naturally, they felt the most urgent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Danzhu smiled.
“Fellow Daoist Ji Ning, to tell you the truth, there are people in
this squad who are more powerful than me. I urge you to cease any
attempts at struggling and hand over the talismans. That way, you
will stay alive. You’ve only trained for a very short period of
time; your potential is limitless. There’s no need for you to push
yourself too far in this Conclave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there in the
distance. “Come and take them, if you can.” He replied coldly,
“You want me to just give them up to you? Keep dreaming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alongside Ning’s
voice, an enormous Waterflame Lotus suddenly appeared and bloomed.
The layers of fiery lotus petals and watery lotus petals were
incomparably beautiful as they continuously swiveled. Ning and Yu Wei
were in the center, protected by the enormous Waterflame Lotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t waste words
with them,” the silver-haired maiden said coldly. “Attack.” As
she spoke, a horsetail whisk suddenly appeared in her hand. She
flicked it outwards, and thousands of white strands flew towards the
air, then formed into a bizarre beast’s head. This snowy white
beast’s head appeared incomparably savage. Its mouth was filled
with rows on rows of jagged teeth that gnashed against each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The snowy white beast
head opened its mouth, then bit downwards towards Ning and Yu Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Waterflame Lotus,
however, continued to protect the two of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crunch. The snowy white
head bit down against the Waterflame Lotus, and its countless teeth
ground against each other, easily biting through a layer of leaves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning was
secretly startled. Still, as he had expected, no one who was able to
survive to this stage would be easy to handle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.” Kindwater
Qi’s hands formed together into a hand-seal. Instantly, layers of
black light flew out from his body, forming giant serpents that
appeared in midair. A total of six giant black serpents appeared,
wildly assaulting Ning and Yu Wei and also breaking through a layer
of leaves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too stubborn.”
Adept Danzhu let out a soft sigh, but then her eyes suddenly lit up.
An invisible divine will attack instantly swept towards Ning and Yu
Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei’s face turned
white. As for Ning, he felt as though his soul was being stabbed at
by a needle-like divine will. However, his soul and his divine body
had now completely fused together, and it was far more durable
against this sort of attack. He was able to completely withstand it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninedeaths, kill
them!” Xiamang Qi howled as he transformed into a 54-meter tall
giant. His entire body glowed with a golden light, and he radiated an
aura that filled the heavens. He was wielding a giant warblade in his
hands, and he trampled past the already-shattered lotus leaves as he
charged towards Ning and Yu Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning? Seems
pretty powerful.” The dirty-looking maiden chortled. With a
flicker, she transformed to a size of sixty meters, but her body
didn’t give off a hint of any aura at all. She seemed quite
ordinary, just enormous, and she charged forward with completely
empty hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five of them had
instantly attacked in unison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“F*ck off!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly exploded
with power, becoming a 54-meter tall giant with an aura that
similarly filled the heavens. Letting out an enraged roar, his divine
will formed into countless invisible swords, warblades, and
longspears that immediately struck towards Adept Danzhu, Adept
Snowfly, Adept Ninedeaths, Kindwater Qi, and Xiamang Qi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When a Ki cultivator
broke through to the Primal Daoist level, it was his soul that
benefited the most. Similarly, once a Fiendgod Body Refiner broke
through to the Primal level, his soul would be tremendously benefited
as well. Ning had reached the twelfth stage, and his soul had been
nourished by his divine body, resulting it in explosively increasing
in strength. In fact, it was already almost comparable to his
Primaltwin’s soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this clash, the
faces of all five immediately changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“BREAK!” Ning, his
aura filling the heavens, wielded two enormous Immortal swords in his
hands as he charged forward, sending the swords howling forth as his
sword-light chopped directly against that enormous snowy white
beast’s head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The snowy white beast’s
head was immediately chopped apart and collapsed, transforming back
into countless white strands that flew black to the silver-haired
maiden with the flywhisk. She had a look of shock on her face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!” After
breaking through the snowy white hound with one sword chop, Ning sent
his dominating sword-light forward once more, charging straight
against the six giant black snakes, knocking all of them flying
backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” With the
next step, Ning arrived in front of Xiamang Qi, and his sword-light
chopped directly towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Block!” Xiamang Qi
was frightened by Ning’s ferocious, savage aura. He didn’t dare
to be overconfident, and he focused on defense. CLANG! With a loud
sound, Xiamang Qi’s enormous, 54-meter tall giant body was knocked
backwards like a meteor, slamming directly against the walls of the
distant sealing barrier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s this
powerful?!” Xiamang Qi, Kindwater Qi, and Adept Snowfly were both
awestruck. Against the three of them, Ning had absolutely suppressed
and crushed them; if they were fighting one-on-one, he probably
would’ve taken their lives in just two or three exchanges of blows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Right at this
moment, the dirty-looking youth charged straight forward towards
Ning. She struck out with her palm, and it hacked downwards like a
knife towards Ning. This palm-blow…it was simply perfectly
exquisite. Ning could sense the unfathomable profoundness of it, a
profoundness which absolutely surpassed his own sword technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised his own
sword as well to meet the palm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-light and the
palm collided against each other; the dirty-looking maiden was
knocked backwards and forced to take three steps back, while Ning
only took a single step back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning was
shocked. During the final few months in the world of the Brightmoon
Diagram of the Mountains and Rivers, he had always immediately used
the [Starseizing Hand] when he attacked; he didn’t dare to hold
anything back at this point. After all, none of the survivors were
easy to deal with. For example, against Xiamang Qi, even though he
had immediately used the [Starseizing Hand], he still hadn’t been
able to kill him with a single blow. Clearly, all of the survivors
were extremely powerful! But this maiden actually dared to block his
sharp sword with her hands, and did so successfully?! This was
insane!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The rest of you, go
handle that woman. Leave this Ji Ning to me.” The dirty-looking
maiden was clearly quite excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s body blurred
momentarily, and he instantly transformed into a three heads and six
arms form. With six swords in his hands, he charged straight towards
the dirty-looking maiden. “If you don’t want to die, then hurry
up and leave!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s so rare for
me to encounter a good opponent.” Instead of leaving, the
dirty-looking maiden went to welcome his attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill, kill, kill!”
Ning showed no mercy at all. After using [Three Heads, Six Arms], his
sword-light rained down like a curtain of lightning. This
dirty-looking maiden, however, relied on her pair of palms. They
danced in front of her and were actually able to block the majority
of the sword-light. Although the remaining sword-light blows were
able to pierce onto her body…they were only able to leave some
minor wounds on her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can her body be
as tough as magic treasures?! My full-force blows can cause even
Earth-ranked magic treasures to be torn asunder…but are only able
to leave small wounds on her skin?” Ning was completely awestruck.
“I can’t waste time with her.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a flash, Ning
moved to charge towards Adept Snowfly and Kindwater Qi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are mine!” The
dirty-looking maiden’s body flashed as well. She, too, transformed
with the [Three Heads, Six Arms] technique. She moved alongside Ning
as though she were flying water, and her six palms continuously
smashed and hacked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What the hell?!”
Ning was frantic. The maiden in front of him was completely insistent
on continuing to fight against him. Although Ning’s swordplay was
ferocious, against a person whose entire body was comparable to an
unbreakable magic treasure, there was nothing he could do.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Snowfly,
Kindwater Qi, Xiamang Qi, and Adept Danzhu, seeing the situation, all
began to focus against Yu Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Black and white.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Taiji.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei stood there, the
black phoenix and the white phoenix twirling around her. She was like
an unbreakable steel wall, simultaneously dealing with the attacks of
all four. The giant snowy white beast head, the six giant black
serpents, and an enormous semi-translucent grand seal in the skies
created by Adept Danzhu through a secret art…they came smashing
down towards her two phoenixes repeatedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.” Yu Wei sent a frantic mental call.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister.” Ning understood that she wasn’t going to be
able to hold much longer. Although her power had increased
tremendously, and although she was an expert at defense…she still
wasn’t going to be able to defend against four at once.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three-headed,
six-armed Ji Ning roared furiously, “Get the f*ck away!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You aren’t strong
enough to make me.” The dirty-looking maiden, also with three heads
and six arms, had completely tied him down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hadn’t even felt
this stifled when fighting against Xiamang Zishan. Not only did this
maiden have a body like a magic treasure, she also had an extremely,
extremely high level of comprehension regarding the Dao. Each of her
techniques were unfathomably miraculous, and she was able to
completely tie him down, giving him no chance to run away from her at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.” Yu Wei’s voice rang out in Ning’s mind,
and as it did, Ning saw what was happening from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white phoenix
finally collapsed, and the 54-meter tall Xiamang Qi charged towardsYu
Wei, warblade at the ready.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Ning
frantically summoned the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation].
Instantly, more than seven hundred swords appeared, floating in
midair and condensing their power to form a streak of sword-light
that shot out towards Xiamang Qi. Although Ning’s close combat
power had increased tremendously, the power of his [Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation] hadn’t improve that much.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Xiamang Qi was
able to block the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] with one saber
blow. Although his body trembled from the collision, he continued to
charged towards Yu Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A single black phoenix
was left, and it was struggling to defend against the grand seal, the
giant black snake, and the snowy white beast head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiamang Qi was charging
into close combat…Yu Wei hurriedly moved to retreat, but given that
they were trapped within this grand sealing formation and being
attacked from all sides, where could she retreat to?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! After Xiamang
Qi’s warblade blocked the attack from the [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation], his right arm suddenly began to emanate hundreds of
bizarre colors and even a strange black ki that caused one’s heart
to tremble as he grabbed towards Yu Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Myriad
Hibernating Venoms]!” Yu Wei’s face immediately changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although she struggled
to block, how could she compare in close combat to a Fiendgod Refiner
like Xiamang Qi? Instantly, his right arm, still emanating that
terrifying black aura, pierced directly through her flank, and the
terrifying venoms instantly invaded her entire body, causing her face
to instantly turn a deathly dark gray color.

Chapter 16 - The Seventh Stance of the [Three-Foot Sword]
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei understood that
she was at a true life-and-death juncture. Her body suddenly flashed
with a bloody light, forming into a blood-colored taiji symbol.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei transformed into
a streak of blood light, retreating more than three hundred meters
before collapsing to the ground. She spat out a mouthful of
black-colored blood, a savage, jagged wound in her flank that was
filled with black blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning watched this
all happen. His senior apprentice-sister had been stabbed through the
flank by Xiamang Qi’s palm. She had spat out blood, then collapsed
to the ground. This caused Ning’s eyes to instantly turn red.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A surge of
uncontrollable rage and terror instantly filled his entire soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AAAAHHHHH!!!!”
Ning let out a massive howl, and a limitless bloodlust instantly
filled every part of his spirit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kill! Kill! Kill!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kill them all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kill all who oppose
him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Angry, eh? Won’t
do you any good.” The dirty-looking maiden continued to tie down
Ning, seeming quite entertained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“CHOP!” Ning let
out an enraged howl. This howl emerged from the deepest parts of his
soul, from the innermost depths of his spirit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three-headed,
six-armed Ji Ning simultaneously struck out with all six swords, and
six enormous streaks of sword-light immediately shone with
incomparable brilliance. They transformed into six strings of
line…the sword-light had been compressed into lines! There was
nothing capable of stopping Ning…he was going to chop through all
which stood in front of him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had never felt such
a desire to kill. He had never before felt so determined.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more than ten
thousand life-and-death battles he had engaged in over the past year
had been even more effective for improving his insights than the past
ten years. The [Three-Foot Sword], which Immortal Northwalker had
imprinted deep into Ning’s soul many years ago, once more arose. A
limitless, terrifying killing intent…determination which no one
would withstand at all…an sword-heart that was completely
enlightened…many former insights…they all combined together,
allowing Ning to immediately execute the seventh stance of the
[Three-Foot Sword].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seventh stance of
the [Three-Foot Sword] - Horizontal Sword Execution! 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six rays of silken
lines of sword light sliced through the body of the dirty-looking
maiden. When the first sword descended, her face began to
change…because the first sword actually chopped straight through
her hand, cutting it off. Her body, as tough as a magic treasure, was
completely unable to block this fierce, sharp sword-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“RETREAT!” The
dirty-looking maiden no longer appeared as relaxed as she had
earlier; in fact, she even seemed slightly frightened as she
frantically retreated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! As her hand was
chopped off, a massive wound appeared on her chest as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, she did
managed to actually retreat. Her Fiendgod-like body frantically
healed as she stared towards Ning in both terror and rage.
“Sword-light compressed into silken lines! He’s actually reached
this level!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword-light like
silk!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s only trained
for thirty years, right? He’s actually reached the level of
sword-light like silk…he truly is a rare genius of the Dao of the
Sword!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He truly does have a
chance to make it all the way to the top position of this Conclave. I
imagine that even Xiamang Zishan is inferior to him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Skylight
Palace, the nine Pure Yang True Immortals and the thousand Celestial
Immortals were all stunned by this. They all began to let out sighs
of amazement and chatter amongst each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light like silk…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This meant that a
person had already treached a truly, incomparably high level of
attainment in the Dao of the Sword. The seventh stance of the
[Three-Foot Sword], ‘Horizontal Sword Execution’, was at the
level of ‘sword-light like silk’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, each of the
final three stances of the [Three-Foot Sword] were more terrifying
than the last. The seventh, the eighth, the ninth…they were so
formidable that not even Immortal Northwalker was able to record them
down in books.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the first six
stances of the [Three-Foot Sword], it could be said that one would
advance through them in an ordinarly fashion, all the way until one
reached the Grand Dao Domain level. The increase in power between
each stance wouldn’t be too great, because these six stances
focused on an orderly sort of improvement; they were primarily meant
for guiding and teaching, which was why they could be compiled into
books. Naturally, the level of improvement between each stance would
be a bit smaller, which would make it easier to train.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But those final three
stances which could not be recorded down in any books…there was a
truly explosive increase in power between each of the three stances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seventh stance
represented that a person had reached a level that was comparable to
the techniques of a Loose Immortal who had trained for three hundred
thousand years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighth stance was
comparable to the technique of an ordinary Celestial Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ninth stance was
comparable to the techniques of an absolutely supreme Celestial
Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was because of the
ninth stance that Immortal Northwalker, despite being a Loose
Immortal, was comparable to a true Celestial Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These three
stances…there was a huge gap in power between each of them, but
each of them were tremendously powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei lay there,
struggling to control her magic treasures to form into the white
phoenix and black phoenix. At the same time, she produced a jade
bottle, shattered it with her elemental ki, then swallowed a pill
into her mouth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…the wound in
her flank began to rapidly heal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Myriad Hibernating
Venoms.” Yu Wei knew that this was going to be trouble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Myriad Hibernating
Venoms was a divine ability which the Black-White College had as
well. However, the imperial Xiamang clan had countless divine
abilities in its Dao Repository, amongst which was the Myriad
Hibernating Venoms. Xiamang Qi trained in this technique!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Myriad Hibernating
Venoms was an extremely deadly, poisonous art; it required one to
fuse a large amount of strange poisons into one’s own body. Xiamang
Qi, as a genius of the imperial clan, naturally was able to easily
procure many hard-to-find poisons. Thus, his Myriad Hibernating
Venoms was exceptionally vicious. Anything he touched would be
instantly poisoned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Fiendgod Body Refiner
might not fear him too much, but Yu Wei was a Ki Refiner; her body’s
defensive and recuperative power was insufficient, and she had to
rely on pills. But pills that could suppress the dire venom of the
Myriad Hibernating Venoms…Yu Wei had none of those precious pills
at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” The distant
Xiamang Qi howled with laughter, but as he did, a golden sword-light
suddenly flew towards him; it was the light of the [Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although the power
of this sword-light is significant, it’s not enough to do anything
to me.” Xiamang Qi had already withstood it several times; this
time, he once more swung his arms out as he chopped out with his
warblade towards it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-light was as
fine as silk, but it carried an incomparably powerful force. Xiamang
Qi was caught completely off-guard, and his warblade was instantly
knocked flying away. The skin between his thumb and forefinger was
split apart, and he himself was knocked backwards. However, Ning
suddenly charged towards him at an utterly astonishing speed, and so
Xiamang Qi hurriedly produced yet another warblade in his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” The
three-headed, six-armed Ning appeared incomparably savage. Six rays
of sword-light struck out like a giant windmill of light. Whoosh
whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh!!!!!! Six consecutive rays of sword-light
came howling down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiamang Qi stared, eyes
bulging. He was instantly chopped apart into small chunks of meat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Waterflame Lotus
suddenly bloomed, surrounding the chunks of meat and grinding down at
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…” Xiamang
Qi’s soul was howling. Bu unfortunately…he was ground to death,
until nothing remained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Adept
Danzhu, Adept Snowfly, and Kindwater Qi were all shocked. Xiamang Qi
had been killed in a single exchange!? This level of power was too
great! How could Ji Ning’s power have increased so explosively in
just an instant?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you should
die.” Ning immediately turned and threw himself at Adept Snowfly,
who was the closest to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, flee!”
Adept Danzhu, Adept Snowfly, and Kindwater Qi, upon seeing how savage
and ferocious Ning was, didn’t dare to take him on at all. They
immediately fled at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Open.” The bald,
black-skinned Adept Blackstone, who had been controlling the grand
sealing formation this entire time, quickly withdrew the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Danzhu, Adept
Snowfly, and Kindwater Qi all immediately charged out of the
formation. As soon as they did, Adept Blackstone, with a single
thought, once more activated the formation. The barrier of light
arose once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Open up!” Ning
howled. His sword-light was like silk, and six streams of silken
light chopped towards the grand sealing formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The grand formation was
immediately torn apart, and the three-headed, six-armed Ji Ning
charged out from within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Adept
Snowfly, who had just let out a sigh of relief after leaving the
formation, was completely shocked. She immediately turned to flee…but
how could her speed comparable to that of Ning, a Fiendgod Body
Refiner? Although she hurriedly brandished her flywhisk to defend,
transforming it into tens of thousands of tightly clustered strings
that formed into a strange white fox to defender her, she also threw
out a large number of talismans. She frantically sent to Ning, “Take
my talismans, spare my life!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh whoosh
whoosh…six more streams of sword-light came. They chopped straight
through the white fox, chopping Adept Snowfly to death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was too fast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three-headed,
six-armed Ning’s sword-light was so fast that there wasn’t even
enough time for Adept Snowfly to be teleported away after throwing
out her talismans. She was immediately killed by Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kindwater Qi and Adept
Danzhu were both terrified by Ning’s savagery. Adept Danzhu was
formidable, but she was a Ki Refiner…how could she possibly summon
the courage to fight Ning to the death?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kindwater Qi and Adept
Danzhu both flew far away, fleeing into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the bald,
black-skinned Adept Blackstone, he collected his grand sealing
formation. The dirty-looking maiden, Adept Ninedeaths, was standing
by his side. She was now wearing a pair of silver gloves on her
hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go. This
isn’t the time for us to be fighting with him to the death,”
Adept Blackstone sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Nindeaths gritted
her teeth, giving Ning a glare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two were quite
decisive in their actions; they realized that Ning’s power had
already reached a level where it posed a threat to them. They were
not confident in actually beating him in a fight to the death, and
they already had enough talismans; it wasn’t worth it for them to
risk it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! The two
quickly departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enraged Ning had
slaughtere Xiamang Qi and Adept Snowfly, then scared off Kindwater Qi
and Adept Danzhu as well as caused Adept Ninedeaths and Adept
Blackstone to choose to temporarily retreat as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning, still
filled with a boundless killing intent, swept the area with his gaze.
He collected the treasures which Adept Snowfly had left behind, then
quickly ran towards his senior apprentice-sister. Upon reaching her
side, he immediately returned to his normal form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister.” Ning saw that Yu Wei’s face was so dark, it
was almost black. She had been very badly poisoned. He couldn’t
help but begin to grow frantic. As for Yu Wei, she forced herself to
sit up, then smiled as she looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had seen
everything; it had been Xiamang Qi who had used the divine ability,
‘Myriad Hibernating Venoms’. This divine ability was one which
the giant yellow bear of the underwater estate had forbidden him from
training in; although it was quite formidable when the practitioner
was weak, once the practitioner grew strong, he’d probably actually
have to spend some effort in purging the poisons from his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…it had to be said
that this was an extremely terrifying divine ability at this level.
Anyone who was touched would immediately be poisoned and see their
power drastically lowered!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have antivenoms
here. They might be able to suppress…” Ning was extremely
frantic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s fine. I’m
fine.” Yu Wei sat there, looking at Ning. She smiled, then shook
her head gently. When she saw how crazed Ning had become, she
actually felt a blissful feeling in her heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, seeing the shape
his senior apprentice-sister was in, couldn’t help but feel pained
for her as well as feel frightened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Forgetting everything
else, he immediately took her into her arms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei allowed Ning to
hold her. She rested her head against his neck. She could sense the
warmth surging from Ning’s body, an almost boiling heat that
actually startled her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t want to
hesitate any longer.” Ning gently murmured into her ears, “I
don’t want to feel any regrets. No regrets. I was truly
afraid…afraid that you were dead. If you were dead…would I keep
hesitating?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei reached out as
well, tightly clinging to Ning as she revealed a smile on her face.
Her tears began to fall down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main hall of the
Skylight Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin suddenly
slapped his table, the force of the blow causing the Immortal wine in
front of him to be knocked flying. He jumped to his feet, then
pointed towards the portion of the enormous Brightmoon Diagram of the
Mountains and Rivers where Ning was holding Yu Wei. He roared with
laughter, “That’s how it should be! That’s exactly how it
should be! What’s the point of being so squeamish and indecisive?
If they missed this opportunity, they would never have a chance to be
together again for the rest of their lives. They had to seize this
opportunity! If you have the right feelings, then you should act on
them! You’ve been fighting in so many life-and-death battles
together; how could you not have understood your own hearts? How
could you have even hesitated for so long? Bahahaha, but now it’s
all better. In the final month, they are finally embracing.”

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin, you are one

Countless schools located throughout the three thousand major worlds

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…they all
understood that this was precisely Lu Dongbin’s temperament. He
loved to wander the mortal realms, and absolutely delighted in paying
attention to the love stories of minor figures as well as playing the
role of the Moon Elder as a matchmaker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial citadel
plaza. The disciples of the Black-White College were staring at the
massive Diagram in midair, feeling incomparably nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, quick, QUICK! YES! Kill them! KILL THEM
ALL!” Mu Northson was incomparably agitated as he stared at the
explosively savage Ji Ning within the Diagram.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, quick!”
Immortal Fivecraze watched anxiously as well…and in the end, he
finally let out a sigh of relief. “Fortunately, Xiamang Qi was only
a Wanxiang Adept as well; although his Myriad Hibernating Venoms is
powerful, by relying on some pills, its effects can be suppressed for
a short while, at least.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whaaaaat?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson, Little Qing,
the Whitewater Hound, Immortal Fivecraze, Adept Vastriver, Northmont
Baiwei, and the others all suddenly stared with bulging eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Yu Wei were
actually embracing!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But but but…”
Northson actually began to stammer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master…and Miss Yu
Wei…” Little Qing was completely flabbergasted as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northmont Baiwei was
the first to recover. Roaring with laughter, he slapped his thigh.
“My brother Ji Ning truly is formidable. In the Conclave of
Immortal Destiny’s trial within the Brightmoon Diagram of the
Mountains and Rivers…he actually is going to be returning with a
beauty in his arms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right!” Immortal
Fivecraze shook his head a few times, feeling extremely delighted.
“The Black-White College is going to be the talk of the world for
some time now!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus watched this
silently. She felt as though the entire world had turned still.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He ended up with
senior apprentice-sister after all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s for the
best.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am myself. He is
himself! Only…should I hope that the two will forever be together
and forever be blissful…or should I hope that they will separate as
well?” Ninelotus wanted to offer them her prayers, but while
searching in her own heart…she found that deep inside her heart,
for some reason she couldn’t explain, she still felt a strange sort
of hope. Hope that Ning and Yu Wei would separate as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus was an
Immortal cultivator who understood her own heart; she immediately
analyzed and realized what she was feeling. She quietly said to
herself, “It is said that the trial of emotions is the most
difficult trial to overcome…although I have already comprehended my
own heart, whenever I see Ji Ning, waves always once more appear upon
the lake of my heart. If I wish to be able to walk further on the
path of Immortal cultivation, then I should never meet him again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It will be better
for him. It will be better for me as well.” Ninelotus made up her
mind. After this Conclave of Immortal Destiny concluded, she would
return to the Dongyan clan. Unless there was an absolutely pressing
need, she would absolutely never meet Ning again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Dongyan
Forefather glanced sideways at Ninelotus, seated by his side. He saw
the look in her eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A look of
determination!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dongyan Forefather
shook his head gently. He had not desired for things between Ning and
Ninelotus to end up like this. However…this was Ninelotus’
decision, born from her heart. He would not interfere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Diagram.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei was tightly
embracing Ning. She could feel the warmth from his body, and she
could feel a sense of bliss that came with it. It had been a long,
long time since she had felt this sort of bliss. Far too long. Even
in her past life, as a child, she had known this bliss for just a
brief period of time. Now, she once more felt this sense of bliss and
contentment. This caused uncontrollable tears to streak down her
face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She moved slightly,
clutching Ning even more tightly to her. In her mind, she couldn’t
help but think back to that terrifying figure from her memories of
her past life, that figure which caused her heart to remble with
fear. Yu Wei bit her lips, bit them so hard that blood appeared. In
her heart, she quietly said to herself, “I swear that even if it
means that I, Yu Wei, will have my soul be shattered…I will never
hurt you. Never!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After making up her
decision, Yu Wei actually relaxed. Now that she was mentally prepared
for her soul to be destroyed, the knot in her heart had been
resolved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My man.” Yu Wei
revealed a smile on her face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning held Yu Wei in his
arms, smelling the fragrance that came from her body. The feathery
down on her clothings around her neck rubbed against his face. Ning
felt calmer than he ever had before. It had been a long time since he
had felt so calm. He could feel that the heart of this woman before
him was extremely close to his own. It was as though the two of them
were one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From today onwards,”
Ning whispered words gently into Yu Wei’s ears, words that sounded
like a sort of promise, “Yu Wei, you shall be my woman.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And you’ll be mine
as well,” Yu Wei replied softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two could both
sense each other’s hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You are willing to die
for me.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">I am willing to die for
you.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the future, we shall
walk the Immortal path together, never leaving or separating.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yu Wei.” Ning
released Yu Wei, looking at the deathly dark pallor to her face. He
said with concern, “You’ve been badly poisoned?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The poisons of the
Myriad Hibernating Venoms are very unique.” Yu Wei gently shook her
head. “The pills I have on me only suffice to temporarily suppress
them for two to four hours. To actually cure the poison, I would
either need an incomparably precious Immortal pill that could resolve
countless poisons, or a spirit-pill that was specially designed to
dissolve the poisons of this divine ability. There’s no way I can
do this from within the world of the Diagram. I have to leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gritted his teeth.
He and Yu Wei had been on the verge of passing the trial, but she now
had to depart. If the poison wasn’t cured, then once it was no
longer suppressed, she would die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough. Don’t be
unhappy.” Yu Wei smiled as she looked at Ning, contentment in her
eyes. “To ‘win’ you here is better than winning any other award
in the Conclave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Although
Ning wanted to continue to be together with Yu Wei, he immediately
said, “Hurry up and cure your poison. It won’t be so easily
cured, so don’t dawdle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the imperial
capital of the Grand Xia, and there are countless experts gathered
outside. It won’t be too hard.” Yu Wei nodded. “Take my
talismans.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Instantly, a
large number of talismans appeared on the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An invisible ripple of
power descended, teleporting Yu Wei away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning collected the
talismans. Actually, the number of talismans he had acquired after
killing Xiamang Qi and Adept Snowfly was more than enough to allow
himself and Yu Wei to pass the trial. But she had been poisoned by
the Myriad Hibernating Venoms…she had to leave and have it cured.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning took a single step
forward, then disappeared as a streak of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the main hall of
the Skylight Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine Pure Yang True
Immortals were all staring at the Diagram.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Yu Wei girl is
coming out. Xiamang, have her be teleported over here,” Lu Dongbin
immediately said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor, seated
on his imperial throne, simply smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black-robed woman
whose skin was as lustrous as white jade and who was roughly 1.7
meters tall by Earth measurements suddenly appeared within the main
hall of the Skylight Palace, right next to the nine Pure Yang True
Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?!” Yu Wei
stared at her surroundings, immediately poleaxed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor was
seated on high atop his throne. The other Pure Yang True Immortals
who were seated with him hadn’t suppressed their auras, and so
naturally their auras rippled out…causing absolute terror in Yu
Wei. She had seen Celestial Immortals in her past life, and not just
one; these figures before her gave her the semse of tremendous power.
They absolutely were not Celestial Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei looked backwards
and saw nearly a thousand Celestial Immortals. Their auras were
similarly shocking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yu Wei, disciple of
the Black-White College, prostrates before you, your Imperial
Majesty.” Yu Wei immediately fell to her knees with tremendous
respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quite clever.” The
Xia Emperor laughed and praised her. “Arise.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin was staring
at Yu Wei with interest. Actually, the other eight Pure Yang True
Immortals present rather looked down on Yu Wei; she was nothing more
than a reincarnated female Immortal. The only one intrigued by her
was Lu Dongbin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little girl.” Lu
Dongbin tossed her a gourd of wine, sending it flying towards Yu Wei.
Yu Wei immediately caught it, her eyes filled with puzzlement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Drink it,” Lu
Dongbin instructed. Yu Wei stared at the gourd of wine in her hands.
Although she was restless and nervous, she knew that there was no way
she could refuse. She immediately lifted up the gourd of wine and
gulped it all down. The sight of her lifting up her neck and drinking
the wine was extremely pretty; however, her neck and her face were a
bit black. Slowly, however, the color of her neck and face began to
change, beginning to turn pale. Moments later, Yu Wei had transformed
from a gray-skinned girl to a white-skinned girl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My poison…?” Yu
Wei was extremely startled. The poison in her body was no ordinary
poison…but just by drinking some wine, it had been dissolved?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little girl, this
Immortal nectar which you just drank was no ordinary wine. It came
from the Xia Emperor’s private stash, and he rarely brings it out.
Usually, not even Celestial Immortals will have a chance to drink it.
This was specially prepared by the Xia Emperor for Lu Dongbin.” The
Immortal Elder of the Northlands chortled as he spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei immediately
knelt down in gratitude.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need. It was just
a gourd of wine.” Lu Dongbin seemed quite indifferent. “Alright,
you can go now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go?” Yu Wei stared
at the vast Skylight Palace. Behind here were nearly a thousand
Celestial Immortals who were split into two lines that stretched far
off into the distance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei actually didn’t
know where to go for now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go sit down next to
King Yan,” the Xia Emperor instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Only now did
Yu Wei feel a bit relaxed. When she had scanned the room earlier, she
saw Yuchi Xiyue seated behind King Yan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei, her thoughts in
a confused jumble, walked before King Yan, then sat down behind next,
close to Yuchi Xiyue. All of the Celestial Immortals present stared
at the black-robed maiden. They had all personally witnessed Lu
Dongbin bestow a gourd of wine upon her. All of the Celestial
Immortals present knew of the legendary Lu Dongbin, but almost none
of them had ever spoken with him before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is this little
girl? She was actually able to chat with Patriarch Lu.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No clue.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She should be from
the Black-White College; that Ji Ning is from the Black-White
College.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Immortals
were all chatting amongst themselves regarding this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei was now seated
behind King Yan, next to Yuchi Xiyue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yu Wei, you are so
amazing.” Xiyue sent an excited mental message to her. “You were
actually able to chat with Patriarch Lu. Not even my grandfather has
ever spoken to Patriarch Lu before.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yeah…” Yu Wei
was still in a dazed state. She had heard of Lu Dongbin even in her
past life. He was one of the most famous experts of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. You and Ji
Ning have chosen each other to be life partners?” Princess Xiyue’s
eyes were shining brightly. As Ning’s cousin, she naturally paid
tremendous attention to this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei’s face
instantly became slightly red and bashful, but she still nodded and
sent back, “Right.” However, in her heart, Yu Wei felt a bit
nervous. This was because the outside world had long buzzed with
rumors that Princess Xiyue liked Ji Ning very much. It was said that
it was Princess Xiyue who had led Ji Ning into King Yan’s Estate
when he had just arrived at the imperial capital, and that it was
because of her that King Yan treated him so kindly!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was nothing more
than a genius. Think about who King Yan was! If it wasn’t for
Princess Xiyue, how could he have sent his Golden Imperials out to
protect Ji Ning?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone believed that
Princess Xiyue must have fallen for Ji Ning! Even many members of the
Black-White College believed this, and this was Yu Wei’s guess as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Has Princess Xiyue
truly fallen for Ji Ning as well? Is she going to be angry at me?”
Yu Wei was feeling worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“WONDERFUL!”
Princess Xiyue was absolutely delighted and excited. “Yu Wei, you
need to take good care of Ji Ning. Ideally, you would immediately
have his babies!”

Chapter 18 - The Year Ends
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the world of the
Brightmoon Diagram of the Mountains and Rivers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hazy glow of the
moon shone down upon the land. By the side of a river, Ning was
seated in the lotus position, a simple bewildering formation having
been laid down long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Streaks of silken
sword-light howled about the region. Sword-light criss-crossed
everywhere with astonishing power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had comprehended
the seventh stance of the [Three-Foot Sword] - ‘Horizontal Sword
Execution’. As a result, he had reached the level of silken
sword-light. He had also finally gotten together with Yu Wei, and as
a result was in extremely high spirits. His Dao-heart was
incomparably pure and comprehended, and his heart was currently calm
and peaceful, without a hint of rage or hate poisoning his soul at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
after making a breakthrough, one would need to stabilize one’s
foundations. Ning was doing this right now, focusing his heart on the
Dao of the Sword. Naturally, one thread of enlightenment after
another was filling his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Within the heart,
each person has their own desires, their own obsessions.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The stronger the
obsession, the sharper the sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What I ask for…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is to be carefree
and unrestrained!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning spoke these words
silently to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What did it mean to be
carefree and unrestrained? It meant to be able to protect those that
you loved. It meant being free from the threats of others. It meant
having your destiny in your own hands!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…is my Dao of
the Sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All those who oppose
my Dao shall be slaughtered!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes flashed
like lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light flew
everywhere in an invincible, dominating fashion. The sword-intent
contained within it was so powerful, it had reached a height which
Ning had never before reached! Every single Sword Immortal had their
own sword-heart. There were evil Sword Immortals, arrogant and
solitary Sword Immortals, carefree and unrestrained sword…and they
all continued to advance in accordance with their own sword-hearts.
If they were to hesitate, to be puzzled, to be confused…then their
sword-intents would grow weak. Their sword-intents would no longer be
pure, and the power of their sword would constantly drop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Three-Foot
Sword] of Immortal Northwalker…it desires to be ‘joyful’.
Better to live joyfully for a day, than to live a century while
stifled.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My [Three-Foot
Sword], however, desires to be carefree and unrestrained! To be
joyful is only one part of being carefree and unrestrained; to be
carefree and unrestrained is to surpass, to surpass the bounds of the
Three Realms, to possess invincible power. Only then can one truly do
as one pleases.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood the
difference between himself and Immortal Northwalker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Northwalker
was a Loose Immortal; it was guaranteed that he would eventually
perish under the increasingly powerful Three Calamities and Nine
Tribulations. Thus, the sword art of Immortal Northwalker was a sort
of savagery that came after a person knew that he was going to die.
No matter who opposed him, he would kill, kill, kill! He would
exterminate all injustices, exterminate all those who deserve
killing. All he asked for was to be joyful. He didn’t give a damn
how powerful one’s backer was; he would still slaughter you!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But in
reality…precisely because he knew that he was going to die,
Immortal Northwalker’s [Three-Foot Sword] was excessively savage.
When one went too far into an extreme, one’s sword art would
actually lessen in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had comprehended
profound mysteries of the Dao of the Sword through the [Three-Foot
Sword], but his sword-intent was his alone. It formed into a
[Three-Foot Sword] that belonged to himself and only himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Immortal
Northwalker understood this issue as well. This was why when each
time the [Three-Foot Sword] was transmitted to an heir, the heir
would form a [Three-Foot Sword] of their own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wielded the
Darknorth swords in his hands. He had the feeling of being one with
the sword as he strode forth through the world of the Brightmoon
Diagram of the Mountains and Rivers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone travelling
by himself? Let’s go. Surround him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, three
figures came howling through the air. One of them executed a secret
art, and a dense cluster of crows flew out, quickly and completely
surrounding Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning…actually just
smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Ning suddenly
moved. His entire body crackled with lightning, and he moved forward
with the speed of a Roc and the unpredictability of a ghost,
constantly darting and flashing about. His sword-light flew through
the air, like thin silken strands. Countless crows were instantly
sliced apart, transforming into one spike-type magic treasure after
another. And then, like a completely unpredictable ghost, he moved to
attack those three.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is this?! He’s
too fast!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Argh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning hadn’t
used the [Starseizing Hand], [Heavenly Transformation], or [Three
Heads, Six Arms], having only executed the [Pentabolt Vajra] and the
[Windwing Evasion], just by relying on these two divine abilities he
was still able to explode forth with enough speed and power to deal
with them. He wasn’t trying to completely crush these people; he
was using them to train and refine his sword art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light flashed
everywhere, beating the three into utterly sorry sights. All they
could do was use all their power to try and stay alive as they
started to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s too fast, and
his sword arts are too formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And he’s a
Fiendgod Body Refiner, but hasn’t even used the [Heavenly
Transformation]. I refuse to believe he doesn’t even know that
divine ability!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
stroll forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this final month
within the Diagram, he spread out his divine sense with abandon as he
searched for opponents, engaging in one battle after another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Against weaker Ki
Refiners, he wouldn’t use the [Heavenly Transformation].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Against tougher foes,
he would rely on [Heavenly Transformation].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Against a group of
tougher foes…he would use his full power, as well as the
[Starseizing Hand]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In short, Ning was
fast, had a savage sword, and was tremendously strong…he wandered
the Diagram as he pleased. He didn’t care about how many people
joined forces against him; he would kill, kill, kill them all as he
continued to roam forward! After all, by now, everyone was in a small
squad. If things were like they had been back at the very start, with
the possibility of hundreds of people joining forces against him,
Ning wouldn’t have dared to be so bold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But right now…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were very few
still alive!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That being said, the
survivors were all true monsters. Ning used them to temper his sword
arts; the sword was a weapon of battle, and in battle his sword arts
rose in power with great speed. Ning fused both the Dao-Path of
Rainwater and his Dao-Path of the Inferno into his Dao of the Sword;
it was hard when it needed to be hard and soft when it should be
soft. He was now significantly more powerful than back when he had
killed Xiamang Qi and Adept Snowfly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The people in the
imperial citadel’s plaza all sighed repeatedly with incomparable
amazement. Only two hundred or so individuals were left in the
Diagram, and each of them were peerless monsters…but there were
still a few that shone with particular splendor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of them was Ji
NIng!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning’s sword
arts are improving at a simply astonishing pace. He’s far more
powerful than he was when he first entered the Diagram. Now, in the
entire world of the Diagram…he should be one of the most powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As I see it, Ji Ning
can become number one in this Conclave of Immortal Destiny!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s only trained
for thirty years; how can he be so powerful?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Monster, what a
monster!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ning was
born to be a Sword Immortal! After only thirty years, he has already
reached such a level; I’ve trained for thirty thousand years, but
am inferior to him. What a damn waste of my life!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the entire
Conclave, as far as sword arts go….Ji Ning is definitely number
one!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The individuals who had
come from the 3600 commanderies and four seas were all chatting
amongst themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no question
whatsoever that of the hundred thousand-plus who had entered this
Conclave, Ning was the number one Sword Immortal! After all, those
few who were on his level, such as Xiamang Zishan, Adept Ninedeaths,
Adept Blackstone, and the Sloppy Daoist were not Sword Immortals.
Sword Immortals were extremely skilled in attacking, and so naturally
there were many who believed that Ning would become number one in
this tournament.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main hall of the
Skylight Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum
seemed to have quite an unpleasant taste in his mouth. Although it
was true that the Youngflame clan had the extremely powerful
Youngflame Zhan, who was comparable to Xiamang Zishan…in the world
of the Diagram, Youngflame Zhan wasn’t as brilliant or as
eye-catching as Ji Ning was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ning…”
Patriarch Arcanum ground his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The more of a
talented monster he is, the more he needs to be eradicated!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. I’ll let you
act smugly for now. You are nothing more than a genius in a Conclave.
There’s a Conclave every three centuries. I can’t even count how
many times a Conclave has gone on…but how many of the winners end
up being Celestial Immortals?” Patriarch Arcanum mused silently to
himself, “If you can’t become a Celestial Immortal, in the end
you’ll never be able to step out onto the grand stage.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Xia Emperor
cares deeply about this Conclave, and quite a few Pure Yang True
Immortals are watching as well. However, they are doing nothing more
than just watching; after all, consider how exalted a status True
Immortals have! They are experts of the Three Realms who definitely
will not choose apprentices casually. They shouldn’t decide to
accept Ji Ning as a disciple, right? So long as the True Immortals
don’t take him as apprentice…once the chance comes, I’ll
definitely exterminate him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum felt
an extremely intense desire to kill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had truly felt love
for Youngflame Nong, and he truly wanted to avenge him! In addition,
the feud between the Youngflame clan and Ning was by now an enormous
one; after all, the Youngflame clan had even sent Deathsworn to
assassinate him. If Ji Ning truly did spread his wings one day…how
could he not desire to take revenge?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given how much
monstrous talent he had displayed in this Conclave…how could Ji
Ning be permitted to continue to grow like this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had to be
eradicated!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course…if a
Pure Yang True Immortal really did accept Ji Ning as his disciple,
then Patriarch Arcanum would have no choice but to swallow this
bitter fruit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Generally speaking,
the number of disciples a Pure Yang True Immortal accepts can be
counted on one hand. They definitely will not casually accept new
apprentices.” Patriarch Arcanum quietly hoped that none of the True
Immortals would suddenly reach out and take on Ji Ning as a disciple.
If that happened…he would truly be stupefied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat in the lotus
position atop the mountain peak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The year has ended.
The eighty contestants with the most talismans have successfully
passed the trial of the Brightmoon Diagram of the Mountains and
Rivers.” The voice of the Emperor of the Grand Xia suddenly rang
out in the minds of every single person present within the Diagram.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With it, a rumbling
sound could be heard…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rays of golden light
shot out to surround Ji Ning, Xiamang Zishan, Adept Ninedeaths, the
Sloppy Daoist, and the rest of the eighty. Some were seated in the
lotus position, others were walking around, and still others were
sleeping. In short, all of their bodies were surrounded by golden
light; clearly, the light was meant to let the people in the outside
world be able to clearly see who the eighty were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish, swish, swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighty were all
immediately teleported out of the world of the Diagram.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The 159 of you who
remain must engage in the final battle. Only sixteen of you are
permitted to remain alive within the world of the Diagram.” The
voice of the Emperor of the Grand Xia reverberated in each of their
minds…and then all 159 of them were teleported to a vast, spacious
grassland.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A grand sealing
formation appeared on the grassland, spanning a hundred kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All 159 of them were
locked within the sealing formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all looked towards
their fellow contestants.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Start killing,”
boomed the voice of the Emperor of the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the 159
competitors within the grand sealing formation began a berserk, final
struggle against each other. This was a very small region of just a
hundred kilometers; to people like them, who could move a hundred
kilometers with a single movement…and with so many of them
present…the battle here was exceptionally fierce and miserable.
Many people were forced to voluntarily throw our their talismans and
give up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The clouds in front of
the main hall of the Skylight Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the rest of
the eighty all appeared atop the cloud. They looked at each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning quickly
saw quite a few familiar faces; Xiamang Zishan, Cangwu Jiu, Adept
Blackstone…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother.” Ning saw the Sloppy Daoist as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning.” The Sloppy Daoist beamed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The eighty of you,
all stand up!” An attendant wearing a crown spoke out to them
coldly: “The other sixteen will appear shortly, at which point the
ninety-six of you will jointly follow me to go pay your respects to
his Imperial Majesty, the Emperor. This time, some Pure Yang True
Immortals of the Three Realms have also arrived to watch. All of you
need to know what the rules are; no matter what, you cannot offend or
disturb one of the True Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The crowned attendant
had a pale, beardless face. He had an insidiously cold aura, and Ning
and the others could tell from the invisible ripples of power that
radiated from the man that this person…was most likely a Celestial
Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This caused Ning and
the others to all secretly sigh in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was possible that
not one of the hundred thousand-plus competitors would become a
Celestial Immortal…but this attendant was one. This instantly
caused Ning and the others to feel an invisible pressure push down
upon them.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 19 - The Conclave of Immortal Destiny’s Awards
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After a long period of
time passed, another sixteen figures appeared atop the clouds. Most
of these sixteen appeared to be in quite the sorry shape, and most of
them were heavily wounded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone is
present.” The crowned attendant wave his arm, and instantly a
rainbow-colored drizzle descended from the heavens onto Ning and the
rest of the ninety-six. The rainbow raindrops quickly merged into
their bodies, and the heavily wounded all saw their injuries
immediately repaired, leaving them in perfect condition. Even those
who had exhausted much of their divine power and elemental ki due to
having battled for a long period of time saw their energy
replenished. This caused Ning and the others to all feel stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember. The main
hall of the Skylight Palace currently has nearly a thousand Celestial
Immortals, his Imperial Majesty the Emperor, and Pure Yang True
Immortals who have gathered from various places throughout the Three
Realms. You absolutely must not be careless. If you anger a true True
Immortal who takes your life on the spot, don’t say I didn’t warn
you!” The crowned attendant swept his gaze past the ninety-six,
pausing very slightly as he glanced at the Sloppy Daoist, whom he
actually revealed a hint of a smile towards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Obey my commands.
Let’s move,” the crowned attendant ordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He led the way up
ahead. Ning and the other ninety-six followed from behind, walking
through the clouds. They quickly arrived at a wide, spacious palace
hall. The main hall of the Skylight Palace had no ceiling; above it
was the infinitely vast firmament.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many Celestial
Immortals.” Ning immediately saw the two rows of Celestial
Immortals. They stretched all the way to the deepest parts of the
main hall; there truly were nearly a thousand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In Stillwater
Commandery, I didn’t even see a single Celestial Immortal
Patriarch, but today I’ve seen so many. I imagine that the entire
Grand Xia Empire must have several thousand Celestial Immortals. No
wonder it is said that the emperor of a major world is capable of
sitting down and speaking with the Celestial Emperor as equals.”
Ning could sense the ripples of power coming from around him. The
ripples that emanated from a Celestial Immortal, even when they were
not actively flaring their power, was still enough to cause a
Wanxiang Adept like Ning to feel tremendous pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph!” Patriarch
Arcanum was seated there. Upon seeing Ning walk past him, his long,
narrow eyes flashed with a hint of coldness. He let out a cold snort,
not disguising his hostility towards Ning at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Halt.” The crowned
attendant sent a mental message to Ning and the others, who all
immediately came to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right in front of them,
not too far away, were the eight Pure Yang True Immortals and the
Emperor of the Grand Xia. Ning and the others could tell that the
auras emanating from those eight figures next to the Emperor of the
Grand Xia were simply too terrifying. In addition, the tables and
Immortal nectar placed before them were completely different from
those given the Celestial Immortals. They could immediately tell who
these eight were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are all Pure
Yang True Immortals!” Ning and the rest of the ninety-six all felt
as though they were looking up at unfathomably exalted figures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you, kneel,”
the crowned attendant sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the rest of
the ninety-six all fell to their knees, calling out at the same time,
“We prostrate ourselves before you, your Imperial Majesty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Emperor of the
Grand Xia looked downwards towards them, and his gaze along with the
gazes of the eight Pure Yang True Immortals all landed upon the
Sloppy Daoist. To these nine Pure Yang True Immortals, the only
person worth them paying serious attention to was the Sloppy Daoist.
This was because he was the disciple of Grand Emperor Xuanwu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the others?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine of them didn’t
hold them in too much regard. The only reason they paid even a slight
bit of attention to them was because the Three Realms was entering
turbulent times. During one of the ‘normal’ Conclaves of Immortal
Destiny, they wouldn’t even be bothered to come attend and watch,
nor would the Emperor of the Grand Xia come to officiate. The
officiator would at most record down the most exciting scenes of the
battles through a scryer technique and deliver it to some of the
major figures of the three realms. On occasion, someone might be
lucky and end up becoming an apprentice to one of those True
Immortals!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It would be
impressive if even three or four out of these ninety-six became
Celestial Immortals. As for Pure Yang True Immortals? If a true
expert of the Three Realms really was to emerge from this Conclave,
it will probably be this disciple of Grand Emperor Xuanwu.” This
was what the Immortal Elder of the Northlands and the others were
thinking. This was what even Lu Dongbin believed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For two Pure Yang True
Immortals to emerge from a group of ninety-six? That was bit too
unrealistic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise!” The Grand
Xia Emperor commanded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the other
ninety-six all arose, each acting with complete decorum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Xia Emperor
looked down upon them, then said calmly, “You have all passed the
trial of the Brightmoon Diagram of the Mountains and Rivers. You have
thus passed the preliminary sorting out process. From today onwards,
I will arrange for the ninety-six of you to engage in duels with each
other. The losers will be eliminated, while the winners will remain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ninety-six of
you will engage in a round of duels. After the first round,
forty-eight will remain. All forty-eight of you will each receive an
Immortal-ranked magic item.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The voice of the Grand
Xia Emperor echoed throughout the entire main hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone below was
stunned. Even the near-thousand Celestial Immortals were stunned. All
forty-eight would receive an Immortal-ranked magic treasure? In the
past, only the top three figures in the Conclave would receive such a
treasure. This was more than ten times as extravagant as the past; it
represented forty-eight Immortal-ranked treasures!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The forty-eight will
go through two rounds of elimination duels, resulting in twelve
remaining. These twelve will each receive five million kilograms of
liquefied elemental essence!” The Grand Xia Emperor said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Utter silence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Immortals
were all surprised…and Ning and the rest of the ninety-six were all
stunned. Their eyes turned red with desire. Even Ning, despite his
tremendous wealth, felt a surge of desire. Five million
kilograms…even if Ning sold off all of Youngflame Nong’s
treasures and everything he had acquired from the Witchriver Immortal
Estate, it would still be far less than five million kilograms. Five
million kilograms was a sum that would cause even many Celestial
Immortals to turn red-eyed with envy. Only the Grand Xia Emperor
could afford to be so generous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why is his Imperial
Majesty being so generous? Five million kilograms to each person?
Twelve people…how many kilograms is that?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His Imperial Majesty
has never been so generous when bestowing even the likes of us with
gifts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Immortals
were speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Xia Emperor,
still speaking in a very calm manner, continued: “The twelve will
engage in another series of duels, resulting in six remaining. These
six will fight until only three remain! The three final winners…will
be permitted to go into the imperial treasure vault of my Grand Xia
Dynasty and choose out any divine ability or secret art of their
choosing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Choosing?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
turned berserk with desire. The accumulated knowledge of an entire
major world…it vastly surpassed the Dao Repository of the
Black-White College by countless times! The techniques which the
local Raindragon Guard branches possessed were already enough to
cause Ning to turn red-eyed with desire, to say nothing of the main
Raindragon Guard headquarters! And the imperial treasure vault of the
Grand Xia Dynasty? It most assuredly had even more than the main
Raindragon Guard headquarters!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can they be
allowed to choose?! Divine abilities and secret arts are the
foundation of a powerful tribe.” Even King Qi, King Yan, and the
other Kings were completedly stunned. “That vault is the foundation
of our Xiamang clan. How can they be allowed to choose from it as
they see fit?! They will definitely choose the strongest techniques.
How can the most powerful divine abilities and secret arts we possess
be disseminated to outsiders?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the leader of
the Xiamang clan, the Emperor of the Grand Xia, held unquestioned
authority and power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition…per
the orders of my venerable master…!” The Grand Xia Emperor spoke
in an extremely solemn voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Pure Yang
True Immortals next to him, be it Bodhisattva Mahasthamaprapta, Lu
Dongbin, or the Immortal Elder of the Northlands, all felt their
hearts clench.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Amongst the final
three victors…my venerable master will choose a person to become
his own honorary disciple. After said person breaks through to become
a Celestial Immortal, said person shall become my venerable master’s
personal disciple.” The Grand Xia Emperor’s voice rang out
clearly, echoing throughout the entire main hall. All the Celestial
Immortals within the main hall fell completely silent. Even the Pure
Yang True Immortals had fallen silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eight Pure Yang
True Immortals were all in a state of shock; they had no idea that
this was going to happen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What boldness and
spirit! Daofather Crimsonbright truly is bold and spirited; he’s
actually going to accept a disciple from this Conclave!” Lu Dongbin
sighed mentally to himself. “Still…it makes sense. Amongst the
tens of major worlds under the command of Daofather Crimsonbright,
the world of the Grand Xia is number one in terms of luck and karma.
The Three Realms are in a state of upheaval and facing turbulent
undercurrents. It has only been a few decades since the collapse of
the Six Paths of Reincarnation…it is indeed true that one of the
future heroes of the Three Realms will emerge in the first Conclave
of Immortal Destiny to be held here after the collapse. It is worth
him taking on a new disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One of them will
become the disciple of Daofather Crimsonbright?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bodhisattva
Mahasthamaprapta and the others all stared at Ning’s group.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clearly, Grand
Emperor Xuanwu has taken a fancy to that sloppy-looking fatty, and
has even taught him his Grand Black Tortoise divine ability. There’s
no way Daofather Crimsonbright would disgrace himself by trying to
steal him! Then of the other 95…which one shall become the disciple
of Daofather Crimsonbright?” All of them were now guessing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The disciple of
Daofather Crimsonbright?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eyes of the
near-thousand Celestial Immortals below all turned red.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were the Celestial
Immortals of the world of the Grand Xia; thus, they were all
naturally under the command of Daofather Crimsonbright! Daofather
Crimsonbright had an exalted status far above theirs; he was a major
power of the Three Realms who commanded dozens of major worlds. The
Celestial Immortals under his command were as numerous as the clouds.
Almost all of these Celestial Immortals were his honorary
disciples…but most of them had never even said a single word to
Daofather Crimsonbright!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They dreamed about
becoming a personal disciple of Daofather Crimsonbright, but alas,
they had no chance. In fact…not a single one of these near-thousand
Celestial Immortals was a personal disciple of Daofather
Crimsonbright!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“None of us will
become a personal disciple of Daofather Crimsonbright, but one of
them will actually become the Daofather’s personal disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That Sloppy Daoist
is the personal disciple of Grand Emperor Xuanwu…as for the other
six, one of them will become the personal disciple of Daofather
Crimsonbright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is really too
insane.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Immortals
present found it hard to accept this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Daofather!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Someone who was capable
of controlling a Heavenly Dao. The personal disciples they took on
were innately endowed with astonishing potential and comprehension
ability; after spending enough effort and paying enough of a price,
they would generally all become Celestial Immortals! This was why,
even though the likes of Daofather Crimsonbright and Grand Emperor
Xuanwu nominally took on weak Wanxiang Disciples as mere ‘honorary
disciples’, in the future it was all but guaranteed that they would
be upgraded to ‘personal disciples’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eight Pure Yang
True Immortals were surprised…and the nearly-thousand Celestial
Immortals were filled with disbelief and envy. As for Ning and the
others, they were completely stunned silly. Most of them didn’t
even know who the master of the Emperor of the Grand Xia was! But
since the Emperor of the Grand Xia was the emperor of this major
world, someone capable of casually tossing out dozens of
Immortal-ranked magic treasures…how formidable was his master?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Xia Emperor
was someone who could speak with the Celestial Emperor of the
Celestial Court as equals. Then his master…?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ninety-six could
all guess the answer, and they were naturally both stunned and filled
with wild desire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Was this like manna
from the heavens?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The place where you
shall engage in your duels shall be atop the clouds outside the
palace.” The Grand Xia Emperor pointed to the distant clouds
outside the hall. Whoosh. Instantly, an enormous grand sealing
barrier that was ten kilometers in size appeared atop the cloud. “You
shall battle there, within the grand sealing formation. When one side
dies or admits defeat, then the battle will conclude.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first battle
shall be Cangwu Jiu of the Cangwu clan against Dragonmatch of the
Myriad Beasts School!” The Grand Xia Emperor continued, “The
others can rest off to the side.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, little
Sloppy, come over here.” Ning immediately heard someone call out.
Turning his head, he saw that it was King Yan. Behind King Yan was
his cousin, Yuchi Xiyue, along with Yu Wei. Ning immediately went
over. As for the Sloppy Daoist, upon seeing this he immediately
followed; they were all of the Black-White College, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The others who had
Celestial Immortal Patriarchs of their various schools or clans
present all went to the sides of those Celestial Immortals. As for
those who didn’t have any Celestial Immortals behind them, as long
as there was even a hint of a relationship with them, a Celestial
Immortal would call them over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Zhan, child!”
Patriarch Arcanum’s long, slanted eyes were filled with savagery.
He sent mentally, “This is a chance that rarely comes once in even
ten thousand reincarnations. You absolutely must use all your power
to fight into the top three! If you can become the disciple of
Daofather Crimsonbright, then you shall have done more for our
Youngflame clan than anyone else in our entire history. Even the
Celestial Immortal Patriarchs of our Youngflame command shall obey
your command!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Zhan
couldn’t help but send mentally, “Who is Daofather
Crimsonbright?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The teacher of his
Imperial Majesty!” Patriarch Arcanum explained, “He is one of the
true major powers of the Three Realms…someone who can determine
whether our Youngflame clan will flourish or decay with but a single

Chapter 20 - Daoist Threelives and Daofather Crimsonbright
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you die here as a
result, I guarantee that after reincarnating, you will be reborn into
our Youngflame clan once more, and I will take you on as my
disciple.” Patriarch Arcanum looked at Youngflame Zhan. “Zhan,
child, this is a rare chance. You have to seize it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Zhan could sense
Patriarch Arcanum’s ardent desire. He understood how important this
was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you succeed…then
you might become an expert on the level of his Imperial Majesty, the
Emperor,” Patriarch Arcanum said eagerly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Zhan nodded heavily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have
reincarnated nine times for the sake of overcome the Celestial
Tribulation and becoming a Celestial Immortal. To become a Celestial
Immortal is far, far too difficult…the path in front of you is
almost guaranteed to be a dead end. Little girl, if you become
Daofather Crimsonbright’s disciple, you need not fear that you will
not be able to become a Celestial Immortal!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Jiu, child, you
absolutely have the power to make your way into the top three of this
Conclave. Although our Cangwu clan has already reached the very
pinnacle of power in the Grand Xia Empire, that’s our limit;
there’s no way the imperial clan of the Grand Xia will give us any
chance to increase in power any further, unless our Cangwu clan also
produces a Pure Yang True Immortal. That, however, is too
difficult…but you now have that chance! You have to seize this sort
of a chance!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The various major
clans, sects, and schools were all saying these words to the
competitors with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If previously the
Celestial Immortals were quite relaxed, upon learning that Daofather
Crimsonbright was going to take on a disciple, all of them were
frantic. They even felt hatred…self-hatred for not having
personally taught these young geniuses! If they had personally taught
them, then the young geniuses on their side would probably be even
more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unfortunately, they had
previously held these so-called geniuses in no regard at all; after
all, there were far too many geniuses in the world. It was too late
for any regrets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Yu Wei were
next to each other. They were even holding hands, and the dreamy
looks they were giving each other were causing even the nearby Yuchi
Xiyue and Sloppy Daoist to get a bit sick of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, junior apprentice-sister, the two of you…?”
The Sloppy Daoist blinked a few times.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You just found out?”
Yuchi Xiyue smirked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Yu Wei
looked at each other and smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After sharing life and
death experiences together during the past year, their hearts had
long ago become linked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha,
congratulations and felicitations. The disciples of the Black-White
College, in participating in this Conclave, have actually produced a
pair of Dao-Companions. This shall be the talk of the world,” the
Sloppy Daoist laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sloppy Daoist, Ji
Ning, don’t be too relaxed,” Yuchi Xiyue quickly warned. “Didn’t
you hear? The top three have a chance to become accepted by Daofather
Crimsonbright as a disciple. This is a chance to ascend to the
heavens at one go! Daofather Crimsonbright is one of the true
hegemons of the Three Realms, someone who has mastered a Heavenly
Dao.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right! We have to
fight for this chance,” the Sloppy Daoist nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded as well. At
the same time, he mentally asked, “Senior, if I become apprenticed
to Daofather Crimsonbright, will he recognize my [Starseizing Hand]
and realize the relationship between myself and Daoist Threelives?
Will this be trouble?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a voice rang
out in his mind. “Ji Ning, don’t worry; Daofather Crimsonbright
was born a True God of Primordial Chaos. Like Master, he was born
from the primordial chaos itself. They even adventured and faced life
and death together; the relationship between them is quite deep.
Although he wasn’t one of Master’s most intimate of friends, they
were still on extremely good terms. Even if he knows of the
relationship between you and Master, he won’t harm you. Someone
like Daofather Crimsonbright would not lower himself by acting
against you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A True God of
Primordial Chaos…and they adventured together?” Ning was puzzled.
“Daoist Threelives was one of the major powers of the Three Realms,
while Daofather Crimsonbright is one as well. Even they need to
adventure together and risk their lives?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t understand
this very clearly either; all I know is that there truly are some
extremely terrifying places in the Three Realms. Master and some
other True Gods of Primordial Chaos have joined forces in the past to
fight in those places. All of them are very close to each other, and
some of them are in fact individuals who are willing to sacrifice
their lives for Master, and vice versa.” The giant yellow bear
sent, “Don’t worry. The True Gods of Primordial Chaos are quite a
unified group.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition, it was
Daofather Crimsonbright who developed the [Crimsonbright Diagram of
the Nine Heavens] which you train in.” The giant yellow bear
sighed, then sent, “After countless years have passed, Daofather
Crimsonbright has mastered a Heavenly Dao and become a Daofather. If
Master is still alive, he should have perhaps mastered a Heavenly Dao
as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather
Crimsonbright is very good-natured, and all the other True Gods of
Primordial Chaos praise him. If you can become his apprentice, you
should be able to learn some information regarding Master from him.”
The giant yellow bear had always wanted to learn if Daoist Threelives
was still alive or not.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then I will force my
way into the top three, or even become number one. I will do my best
to make Daofather Crimsonbright choose me as his disciple,” Ning
sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The giant
yellow bear felt eager as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Yan suddenly
turned to look at the Sloppy Daoist, then asked mentally, “Little
Sloppy, you also want to become the disciple of Daofather
Crimsonbright?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I naturally have to
at least give it a good shot,” the Sloppy Daoist said, puzzled.
“How can I let a chance like this just slip away? If I miss it, I
probably won’t have another chance like this for the rest of my
life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How did you learn
the Grand Black Tortoise divine ability?” King Yan asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sloppy, pudgy youth
grinned. He knew that upon revealing it, his secrets would be
eventually revealed. After all, the Grand Black Tortoise divine
ability was simply too easy to recognize. He laughed then sent
mentally, “Your Highness, I acquired this Grand Black Tortoise
divine ability by luck. While adventuring, I entered a cavern estate
and thus inherited a legacy and was taught this grand divine
ability.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” King Yan now
understood. Most likely, the Sloppy Daoist had no idea…that his
master was Grand Emperor Xuanwu!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the main hall of the
Skylight Palace, the various Celestial Immortals were all chatting
and laughing amongst themselves while paying attention to the duels
that were going on atop the cloud.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first round of
duels was currently taking place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the first battle,
Cangwu Jiu battled against Dragonmatch. This was an exceptionally
vicious battle, as both were Fiendgod Body Refiners. Dragonmatch was
unwilling to admit defeat until almost all of his divine power had
been used up. However, his eyes were clearly filled with resentment.
As for the Celestial Immortal Patriarchs of the Myriad Beasts School,
they couldn’t help but shake their heads with resentment and sigh
as they saw this. The chance had come and go, just like that.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the second battle,
Adept Woodpass battled against Kindwater Qi. Kindwater Qi immediately
used a forbidden technique at the very start, going all out. However,
Adept Woodpass actually showed mercy; at a critical moment in the
fight, he merely gave Kindwater Qi a heavy wound, not taking his
life. The helpless Kindwater Qi was forced to admit defeat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One battle after
another went on, everyone going all out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The allure of
becoming a Daofather’s disciple…who can resist it?” Lu Dongbin
shook his head and sighed. Raising his head, he took a swig of wine
from his cup. “And yet, how many of them understand…that the
disciple of a Daofather is still nothing more than a disciple. The
master can bring you into the school, but training is a matter of
personal cultivation. The major powers of the Three Realms…they all
relied on their own abilities for their achievements.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lu Dongbin! You
hypocrite, you have two Daofathers standing behind you and even more
Daofathers who have provided you guidance, and you’re going to sigh
and shake your heads at them?” The Immortal Elder of the Northlands
was clearly rather displeased. “This old man can’t stand your
words.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’re just
jealous.” Lu Dongbin cast the Immortal Elder a sideways glance out
of the corner of his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Jealous my ass. This
old man is also a Pure Yang True Immortal; if you have true ability,
then go become a Daofather! By then, I’d definitely admire you; in
fact, I’d even go to your door and obediently listen to you expound
on the Dao and treat you as I would a teacher,” the Immortal Elder
snorted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shameless old fogey.
Once I truly do become a Daofather…I might not even be willing to
expound on the Dao with you. It’ll depend on my mood.” After
saying these words, even Lu Dongbin himself felt that he was boasting
too much; after all, it wasn’t so easy for someone to become a
Daofather. He didn’t even have mastery over a Heavenly Dao yet! He
immediately pointed towards the outside and said, “Look, the
disciple of Grand Emperor Xuanwu has entered the arena.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the sixth battle,
the Sloppy Daoist fought against Adept Gloomcloud.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Gloomcloud truly
was an extraordinary figure; however, there was a quite a bit of
difference in power between himself and the Sloppy Daoist.
Fortunately, the Sloppy Daoist showed mercy and so Adept Gloomcloud’s
life was spared. He admitted defeat, then left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Xia Emperor,
seated atop his imperial throne, stared downwards at his subjects. He
said calmly, “The 41th duel shall be between Ji Ning of the
Black-White College and Zhuxiang of the Redlotus Sect.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice didn’t just
reverberate within the main hall; his echoing voice, filled with all
of his majesty, reverberated within the imperial citadel plaza as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The delegates from the
3600 commanderies and four seas all stared into the skies. In the sky
above them was a massive mirror, which reflected the scenes of battle
between the geniuses within the grand sealing formation atop the
cloud.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, you have to be careful.” Within the palace, the
Sloppy Daoist said with a laugh, “This Zhuxiang is a Fiendgod Body
Refiner. All Fiendgod Refiners are tough to deal with. Thankfully,
the Adept Gloomcloud I ran into just now was a Ki Refiner, which made
it a bit easier.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, be
careful.” Yu Wei looked at Ning as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. I’m
planning to go for number one.” Ning immediately turned and walked
outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment, a
youth who had been seated in the lotus position behind a distant
Celestial Immortal also rose to his feet and began to walk towards
the outside. This youth seemed quite wanton and dissolute, and gave
the impression of being perpetually sleepy. However, he was the
number one Holy Child of an extremely large sect, the Redlotus Sect.
His power was indeed formidable; previously, the outside world had
known very little about him, and he had only become famous during
this Conclave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are coming out.
Coming out!” Mu Northson stared upwards excitedly. “Quick, look,
senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning is coming out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Ji Ning’s
power is formidable; that Zhuxiang of the Redlotus Sect is no match
for him at all. Brother Ji Ning is aiming to be number one.”
Northmont Baiwei was watching with excitement as well; he naturally
was pleased upon seeing his good friend ascend farther and farther
along this Immortal path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wonderful. My
Black-White College is about to suddenly become famous, utterly
famous!” Immortal Fivecraze was in extremely high spirits and
excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Little
Qing’s serpentine eyes were flashing with light as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound’s
head was also lifted. As he watched, he felt his chest heave with
emotions. “Big brother, if you were still alive…how wonderful it
would be for you to be here and watch Ji Ning become such a dazzling
figure in this Conclave of Immortal Destiny of the Grand Xia
Dynasty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the cloud. Within
the grand sealing formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Zhuxiang of
the Redlotus Sect were both standing within the grand sealing
formation. Zhuxiang was dressed extremely casually. His Daoist robes
appeared quite sloppy, and a large portion of his chest was revealed
as well. He looked at Ning, appearing to be still half-asleep.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Zhuxiang sighed gently,
“I didn’t expect to run into you in the very first duel. I heard
that you are one of the participants in this Conclave who is the
hardest to deal with. In the Diagram, I travelled alongside my fellow
disciples. No one was capable of forcing me to unleash my supreme
technique…but I didn’t expect that I would be forced to do so in
this very first battle. You should feel lucky to lose to my supreme
technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Zhuxiang.” Ning
spoke out. “Do you know…what I view you as?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” Zhuxiang
smiled lazily. “A pile of crap? A mere ant? A mighty dragon? Or…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, no…in my
eyes…you are an Immortal-ranked magic treasure,” Ning chortled.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_21___The_Top_Twenty_Four"></A>
Chapter 21 - The Top Twenty-Four
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor, Lu
Dongbin, and the rest of the nine Pure Yang True Immortals were
watching the two competitors within the grand sealing formation. Upon
hearing their dialogue, all nine of them couldn’t help but laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Zhuxiang…he
is fearless due to his ignorance.” Lu Dongbin shook his head and
sighed, “Actually, everyone who has been watching this Conclave
already has a rough sense of who the most powerful individuals of the
ninety-six are. By contrast, the ninety-six themselves actually
aren’t clear about how powerful many of them are.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Zhuxiang had only been
warned by a Celestial Immortal Patriarch of the Redlotus Sect that Ji
Ning was one of the most difficult to deal with contestants in this
Conclave, and that he had to fight with full power and not be the
slightest bit overconfident. But Zhuxiang himself had never fought
against Ning; how could he understand how powerful Ning was?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The spectators on the
outside had seen all the battles within the Diagram. The Wanxiang
Adepts themselves, however, were ignorant despite having been
actually within the Diagram itself. Even Ning himself had only fought
against ten or so members of the other 95.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first round of
duels doesn’t matter that much.” The Xia Emperor nodded. “The
purpose of this first round is to separate the most powerful experts;
I’m not actually having the most powerful ones fight against each
other yet. Ji Ning truly is far more powerful than Zhuxiang.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, you had best hurry up and prepare those
Immortal-ranked magic treasures. All forty-eight of the winners are
going to need one.” Sovereign Hao let out a loud laugh. “Right;
are the forty-eight Immortal-ranked magic treasures going to be
low-grade or middle-grade?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Low grade, of
course!” The Xia Emperor laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I knew it!”
Sovereign Hao nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You aren’t ashamed
to take out low-grade Immortal-ranked magic treasures? The
Immortal-ranked magic treasures I carry with me and which I hand out
on a whim are all at least high-grade!” Lu Dongbin glanced sideways
at the Xia Emperor, who instantly felt resigned. “I have many
subordinates under my command, and I also need to keep control over
an entire major world. It isn’t easy, you know! I can’t just
randomly throw out Immortal-ranked magic treasures like you, Lu
Dongbin. You are free to do what you please.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning exploded forth
with his full power. His six Immortal swords simultaneously chopped
downwards towards Zhuxiang of the Redlotus Sect like a series of
catastrophes, giving him no chance to fight back at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I admit defeat,”
Zhuxiang called out loudly. He then gave Ning a hard look, as though
memorizing Ning’s appearance. This defeat had been simply too
disastrous…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. One
Immortal-ranked magic treasure down.” Ning quickly returned to
normal, then lazily left the grand sealing formation and returned to
King Yan’s side within the palace, moving to stand together with
his cousin and Yu Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, all forty-eight
battles came to an end. The battles in this first round were all
fairly simple; after all, the Xia Emperor had arranged a strong
competitor to fight a weak competitor in each duel, with the goal of
selecting out the strongest competitors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The forty-eight of
you have each won a duel in the first round. Each of you shall
receive an Immortal-ranked magic treasure. Now, I shall bestow them
unto you.” The Grand Xia Emperor, seated high up above them on his
throne, waved his hand. Instantly, magic treasures that emanated
massive ripples of power came flying out. There were ropes, flying
swords, clocks, millstones, needles, shuttles, spikes, warhammers,
grand sealings, longstaffs, silk ribbons, flywhisks…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The forty-eight
Immortal-ranked magic treasures all flew outwards to the forty-eight
winners.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was an
Immortal-ranked sword that flew towards Ning. The sword-ki revolving
around the Immortal sword transformed into the appearance of an old
man that looked towards Ning with curiosity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is…” Ning
stretched his hand out, catching the Immortal sword and sending his
senses into it briefly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was someone who had
seen the Azuresilk Godfire Lamp and the Thousandbull Sword, after
all; Ning had the feeling that this was comparable to the ripples
given off by the Azuresilk Godfire Lamp.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It should be a
low-grade Immortal-ranked item.” Ning mused secretly to himself,
“But it is still a flying sword, extremely suited to attacks. The
Grand Xia Emperor saw that I am a Sword Immortal and so bestowed an
Immortal sword upon me? Mmm…it’s probably worth around 1.75
million kilograms of liquefied elemental essence.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had expected this
Immortal-ranked magic treasure to be low-grade. After all, the top
twelve would receive five million kilograms of liquefied elemental
essence. It was reasonable for the top forty-eight to be bestowed
with a low-graded Immortal-ranked magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, your
Imperial Majesty!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the rest of
the forty-eight all kowtowed as their voices rang out in unison. Some
of them had looks of uncontrollable excitement on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Low-grade
Immortal-ranked?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not all of these
Wanxiang Adepts were as lucky as Ji Ning! Many Loose Immortals were
not in possession of Immortal-ranked magic treasures; for them to
possess one was already quite incredible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The Xia Emperor
smiled and nodded. Instantly, rainbow-colored raindrops appeared
above Ning and the others. As they landed upon the bodies of the Ning
and the others, Ning could feel his divine power and elemental ki be
quickly restored. Those who were wounded were all quickly healed as
well. Although most of them had spirit-pills that could have
accomplished this, Ning and the others couldn’t help but feel
excited that the Xia Emperor had personally healed them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise. All of you
can go back and get some rest. Prepare for the next competition,”
the Xia Emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others all
returned to their respective locations. Ning and the Sloppy Daoist
returned to King Yan’s side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the Xia Emperor
ordered for the second round of duels to begin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second round of
duels shall begin now,” the Xia Emperor said calmly. “In the
first battle, Xiangtian Xiao of the Xiangtian clan shall face
Kindwater Gan of the Kindwater clan.” 1.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiangtian Xiao…he was
the final remaining competitor of the Xiantian clan within this
Conclave. Kindwater Gan, in the same way, was the final disciple the
Kindwater clan had within this Conclave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of these ancient
clans hoped for their own disciples to win.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, victory was
determined after a few short exchanges in this duel. Xiangtian Xiao,
with clear superiority, defeated Kindwater Gan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiangtian Xiao is
quite powerful.” The Sloppy Daoist watched the battle outside the
palace and spoke out in praise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
“His Dao is the Grand Dao of the Sabre; the Dao of the Sabre is a
Grand Dao that is comparable to the Dao of the Sword…and it is even
more dominating and overbearing. Xiangtian Xiao himself is quite a
heroic and straightforward figure, and his sabre arts are like him…he
is indeed a formidable foe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He can indeed be
described as a formidable foe,” the Sloppy Daoist nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second battle
shall be between the unaffiliated Adept Blackstone and Adept Danzhu
of the East Seas,” the Xia Emperor proclaimed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing this,
Adept Danzhu, as beautiful as a fairy from the Moon Palace, couldn’t
help but frown. Still, she still walked into the grand sealing
formation outside of the main palace. As for Adept Blackstone, he
appeared as he always did; barefoot, bald, and pitch-black. He leaned
on a gnarled staff as he walked forward with a calm smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Xia Emperor
actually pitted Adept Danzhu against Adept Blackstone? Based on what
we saw from the first round…the Xia Emperor generally pits a strong
fighter against a weak fighter, so as to ensure that strong fighters
won’t clash against each other too early on.” Ning shook his
head. “It seem as though in the Xia Emperor’s eyes, Adept
Danzhu’s power should be in the bottom twenty-four of these
forty-eight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Although
Adept Danzhu is quite famous, she still isn’t a Fiendgod Body
Refiner,” the Sloppy Daoist agreed. “When Ki Refiners fight
against Fiendgod Body Refiners, they are generally at a significant
disadvantage…especially seeing as how all the competitors in this
Conclave are supreme geniuses. The weaknesses of Ki Refiners are made
even more apparent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. It was
true. And this was before the tribulation; upon a Fiendgod Body
Refiner becoming an Empyrean God, his power would immediately be on
the same level as a Pure Yang True Immortal! From this, one could
tell how major an advantage Fiendgod Body Refiners towards the late
stages!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battle between
Adept Blackstone and Adept Danzhu was an extremely weird battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Blackstone only
had to use his Fuxi Staff Formation to cause Adept Danzhu to be
completely unable to fight back. In the end, she had to admit defeat.
From start to finish, Adept Blackstone hadn’t been forced to fight
in close combat a single time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a terrifying
Adept Blackstone.” This caused Xiamang Zishan, Ji Ning, Adept
Ninedeaths, Cangwu Jiu, and the other geniuses to all memorize what
had just happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One competition after
another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Several figures
appeared who caused Ning to be secretly alarmed. There were some whom
he wasn’t too familiar with, such as the likes of Adept Goldcrow,
Adept Primalback, or Adept Unicosmo. Actually, everyone in the top
twenty four was quite frighteningly strong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The twenty-fourth
battle. The unaffiliated Adept Saberslave shall fight against Adept
Bloodfiend of the Heaven Piercing clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the final
battle of the second round.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Bloodfiend was a
fairly dazzling figure; his berserkness and his bloodlust had caused
everyone watching to firmly fix them in their minds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was actually
defeated miserably!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just two blows of the
saber! The first blow caused Adept Bloodfiend to be knocked flying
backwards, but he had enough power to want to come back and try to
fight again. The second blow, however…it chopped his body
completely in half! The bisected Adept Bloodfiend hurriedly called
out loudly, “I admit defeat!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, the Sloppy
Daoist, Xiamang Zishan, Adept Blackstone, Adept Ninedeaths, and the
others were all tremendously shocked. A serious look appeared in
their eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A formidable foe!
Without question, a formidable foe! Nobody dared to say that they
were confident in being able to defeat this mysterious ‘Adept
Saberslave.’
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Saberslave was a
black-robed man that carried a warcleaver. He was cold-faced and
didn’t say anything at all. When he stood there silently, he was
easily overlooked…but when acting against Adept Bloodfiend, he
revealed his fierceness!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This wandering
cultivator…he should be the disciple of a good friend of mine.
Previously, he didn’t cause any stir at all, and I thought that he
simply had the same Daoist title. But those two saber blows, and his
status as a wandering cultivator…there should be no doubt about
it.” Lu Dongbin’s eyes lit up, and he laughed as he praised,
“This good friend of mine once mentioned this disciple of his; he
said that his disciple had taken on the Daoist title ‘Saberslave’
and had sworn that he would offer everything he had to the Dao of the
Saber. He was going to infuse everything he had into the Dao of the
Saber, and that he was willing to be a slave to the Dao of the
Saber!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? Intriguing.”
Truelord Chiji’s eyes lit up. “Eastflower, who is friend of
yours?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Umm…nice weather
we have today!” Lu Dongbin suddenly turned his head to stare into
the void of the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Truelord Chiji was
instantly speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor and the
others couldn’t help but smile. Still, they could tell that Lu
Dongbin clearly didn’t want to name this friend of his; most
likely, this friend of Lu Dongbin most likely belonged to an alliance
that was an enemy of one of the Daofathers supporting Lu Dongbin! Lu
Dongbin made friends throughout the Three Realms; he even dared to
befriend some enemies and some vile demons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are quite a
few solitary wandering cultivators this time,” the Xia Emperor
said. “This Adept Saberslave is one of them. There are some truly
powerful figures amongst this group; some most likely come from other
worlds. No matter where they are from, however…since they have
participated in this Conclave, I will naturally treat them all
equally.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, for this
Saberslave to suddenly explode with such power causes me a bit of a
headache.” The Xia Emperor shook his head. “Based on my previous
understanding of their power levels, in the third round, I had
already made plans for who would fight who…but for this Saberslave
to explode with such power in the final battle of the second round
makes it so that I don’t know what to do.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have a
recommendation,” Lu Dongbin suddenly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The others
all looked over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Saberslave
should be the most powerful expert of the Dao of the Saber out of
these remaining twenty-four. As for that Dao-companion of the little
girl I like, that Ji Ning…he’s the most powerful expert of the
Dao of the Sword. One is a Sword Immortal while the other is a Saber
Devil; having the two of them fight each other will undoubtedly be
quite interesting.” 2
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor,
hearing this, let out a laugh. “Each of the twenty-four are
formidable. No matter who I put Adept Saberslave against, it will
still cause me a headache. Since you’ve spoken out, Lu Dongbin…then
let’s have this Ji Ning fight against this Saberslave.”

Chapter 22 - Ji Ning and Saberslave
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Yu Wei, the
Sloppy Daoist, and Yuchi Xiyue were quietly whispering amongst each
other, discussing each of the remaining twenty-four competitors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept Woodpass
always defends passively, reacting to whatever the enemy throws at
him…but he ended up winning, just like that.” Yuchi Xiyue sighed.
“I have the feeling that he hasn’t shown his full power yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept Ninedeaths,
her body is like a magic treasure. Enemies aren’t able to do
anything to her at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept Goldcrow is
bizarre and savage.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That Adept
Saberslave is also quite terrifying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, the Xia
Emperor isn’t going to arrange for you to fight against the Sloppy
Daoist, is he?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Xia Emperor
wouldn’t, unless senior apprentice-brother and I both make it into
the top three.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They continued to chat
amongst themselves. Not a single remaining expert was easy to fight;
after all, all of the twenty four were favored by the Xia Emperor.
Although it seemed as though Ji Ning, Adept Ninedeaths, Adept
Blackstone, Xiamang Zishan and the others were the most outstanding,
the others weren’t much weaker. Perhaps they were hiding supreme
techniques, or perhaps they might make a sudden breakthrough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At a time like this,
anything could happen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The twenty-four of
you!” The Xia Emperor suddenly spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire main hall of
the Skylight Palace fell silent. All of them listened carefully. The
closer they were to the finale, the more cautious the Celestial
Immortals present were; after all, a disciple of Grand Emperor Xuanwu
had appeared in this Conclave, and one of the final three would
definitely become the disciple of Daofather Crimsonbright.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the third round
of duels, the twelve winners shall each receive five million
kilograms as a reward,” the Xia Emperor said calmly. “I hope that
you will all use your full power. Don’t let it all be for nothing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the rest of
the twenty-four held their breaths as they waited eagerly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the first battle
of the third round…Ji Ning of the Black-White College shall fight
against the unaffiliated Adept Saberslave,” the Xia Emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless gazes turned
towards Ji Ning and Adept Saberslave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of Yuchi
Xiyue Yu Wei both changed. They were both looking towards Ning as
well. To both of them, Ji Ning was the most important person in their
world. Although they had great faith in him…Adept Saberslave’s
earlier performance had been simply too shocking. In addition, they
had the feeling that they hadn’t seen the full extent of his power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Adept
Saberslave both began to walk towards the grand sealing formation
outside the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is the two of
them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The delegates from the
3600 commanderies and four seas who were watching from the imperial
citadel plaza were all completely focused. During this past year,
they had been relaxing, chatting, eating, and drinking…but these
were the final battles between the ninety-six. This was going to be
the most dazzling spectacle in this entire Conclave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was especially
true now that only twenty-four remained! Each of them were
incomparably amazing, supreme geniuses. In addition, this Conclave
itself was far more dazzling than previous ones; the top twenty-four
were each capable of being ranked in the top three of ordinary
Conclaves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist,
Saberslave, Adept Goldcrow, Adept Ninedeaths, and most of the others
had originally not planned to come. It was only because their
subconscious called them to come that so many peerless monsters had
gathered in this place!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Adept
Saberslave, when fighting against Adept Bloodfiend earlier, chopped
through him as easily as chopping through vegetables. He’s
terrifyingly strong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning was also one
of the most dazzling figures in the world of the Brightmoon Diagram
of the Mountains and Rivers. He is tremendously strong as well. For
these two to fight…it’s truly going to be hard to say who shall
win.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone present
couldn’t help but hold their breaths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the disciples
and Loose Immortals of the Black-White College, which had skyrocketed
in fame during this Conclave, all of them were extremely nervous.
This was because the person who was going to enter battle was Ji
Ning, of their own school!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Little
Qing watched without blinking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
Northmont Baiwei looked towards his good friend as well. When he had
first met Ning, Ning was nothing more than a youth of Swallow
Mountain…but now, he had become the focal point of attention for
the entire Grand Xia Dynasty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the grand
sealing formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Saberslave
stood there atop the cloud, staring at each other from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning carefully
inspected Saberslave. The black-robed man who carried a warcleaver
appeared to be extremely calm. He was as still as water, and his aura
was completely withdrawn; it was indeed easy for others to pay no
attention to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For him to be able
to remain so calm at a time like this…for his heart to have reached
such a level…when he explodes forth with full power, it will be
extremely terrifying. Even I didn’t pay any attention to him before
he unleashed his full power.” Ning was quite cautious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Saberslave was
inspecting Ji Ning as well. This delicate-looking fur-clad youth
before him seemed to be like a young bumpkin from the vast
wilderness, quite ordinary-looking without appearing to be the
slightest bit threatening. But Adept Saberslave had watched the two
previous rounds of duels; he naturally knew how terrifying this
seemingly-delicate youth could be when he exploded with power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And his eyes…they
were as deep as a bottomless pool of water, but within them one could
faintly make out a spirit that was as sharp and fierce as the blade
of a sword!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was quite a
terrifying youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Based on the
intelligence reports he had seen earlier, this youth had trained for
only thirty years or so. He truly was an incredible monster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to attack
with full power,” Adept Saberslave mused to himself. He had often
fought those at a higher level of power, and had even killed quite a
few Primal Daoists. However, he had never encountered such a
terrifying foe who was also at the Wanxiang Adept level, just like he
was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to fight with
full power.” This was Ning’s private conclusion as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their bodies
simultaneously flickered as they both transformed, one into a
54-meter tall giant and the other into a 60-meter tall giant.
Clearly, Ji Ning had spent comparatively less time training in the
[Heavenly Transformations], and so was slightly lacking in this
regard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next, the two of them
simultaneously executed [Three Heads, Six Arms]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Heavenly
Transformations] and [Three Heads, Six Arms]…these were two
extremely widespread divine abilities in the Three Realms, and were
viewed as absolutely necessary for all true experts who trained as
Fiendgod Body Refiners.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two charged towards
each other like a pair of true Fiendgods. Ning wielded six Immortal
swords in his hands, while Adept Saberslave wielded six warcleavers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As they moved next to
each other…both of them released their most powerful divine
abilities as well! Ning held nothing back, immediately executing his
[Starseizing Hand].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang! Clang! ……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A consecutive, frantic
flurry of sounds could be heard as the swords and sabers collided.
The sounds were actually incomparably clear as they spread far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In total, they
exchanged a total of twelve blows. The six Immortal swords and the
six warcleavers clashed against each other twice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Adept
Saberslave suddenly retreated at high speed, transforming into a
streak of black light. He retreated all the way to the edge of the
grand sealing formation. His entire body seemed to be brimming with
dim flames, and he stared coldly towards Ning with a dark gaze. His
six hands had already split open at the juncture between his thumb
and forefinger, and blood was dripping out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Saberslave stared
at Ning, his pupils contracting. “What a terrifying strength this
Ji Ning possesses, and what terrifying sword arts! Sabers are
single-edged weapons that are thicker at the back, allowing them chop
out with even greater force. In terms of weapons…if two opponents
with equal strength fight against each other, the side wielding a
saber will have a greater advantage. But I was actually at a
disadvantage!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Practitioners of the
Dao of the Sword were referred to as Sword Immortals; they were
agile, relaxed, refined, and free-spirited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Practitioners of the
Dao of the Saber were referred to as Saber Devils; they were savage,
brutal, vicious, and ferocious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were two
diametrically opposed styles!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But in a frontal
clash…Adept Saberslave had actually been at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve reached the
twelfth stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], and
my Fiendgod-like body is incomparably mighty. I also have the
[Starseizing Hand]; in terms of pure strength, I am definitely number
one in this Conclave of Immortal Destiny! My sword arts are
comparable to his saber arts; in a frontal clash, how can he compare
to me?” Ning felt complete self-confidence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he looked like
a delicate youth, his physical strength was definitely number one in
this Conclave! His [Starseizing Hand] allowed his hands to explode
forth with truly tremendous power; after all, it was ranked as one of
the top ten divine abilities to be invented ever since the universe
had been created!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning refused to believe
that in this Conclave, there would appear another divine ability that
ranked in the top ten divine abilities of the Three Realms. That was
simply too unlikely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are the most
powerful Wanxiang Adept I have ever met. However…a battle isn’t
just about fighting head-on against your foes,” Adept Saberslave
growled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In terms of agility,
the Dao of the Sword has always been superior to the Dao of the
Saber,” Ning replied tranquilly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as Ning’s
words came out…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Saberslave,
moving like a ghost, suddenly appeared in front of Ning. His six arms
simultaneously chopped down with his warcleavers, all moving in an
extremely strange pattern. It was as though a series of illusions had
appeared, each of which was completely silent, either stabbing or
hacking towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately used
his own Windwing Evasion, and his six arms also executed his own
sword arts. His sword-light was like silk, dancing and fluttering
about in the surrounding area with absolute beauty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was quite bizarre.
There were no sounds of weapons colliding at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their sword-light and
saber-light howled past each other repeatedly, seeming to almost
clash but then separate before actually doing so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Saberslave’s
warcleavers were truly unfathomably strange.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s swords were
moved about in a profound, agile manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning still held the
upper hand! After all, in terms of agility, the Dao of the Sword was
indeed slightly superior to the Dao of the Saber.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The saber…is my
life!” Suddenly, a hoarse voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Saberslave’s
eyes suddenly brimmed with a fiery light. His six hacking warcleavers
suddenly began to move with incomparable speed! One chop after
another…they all chopped down towards Ning. The six warcleavers
seemed to have transformed into the spokes of a wheel. A limitless
amount of saber-light was constantly descending towards Ning, and
Adept Saberslave’s eyes, glowing with fiery light, appeared to burn
with insanity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this moment, he had
forgotten himself. Only the saber remained!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this world of the
saber…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fast! Faster! Fastest!
One blow after another!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">CLANG CLANG CLANG
CLANG!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning fought back
against his foe, and their two figures began to appear in multiple
places throughout the grand sealing formation. The saber-light
flashed at a simply incomparably fast rate; after all, sabers were
single-edged weapons that were used to hack and chop. In terms of raw
speed…their attacks had an advantage over the attacks of a sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break! Break!
BREAK!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, assaulted and
pressured by countless saber-assaults that flashed as fast as fire,
instantly exploded with power. Previously, he had been planning to
use this as a chance to temper himself, but he now had no other
choices. His six Immortal swords instantly became unfathomable in
their movements; some were invincibly savage and ferocious, some were
as nimble and dextrous as an Immortal maiden sewing clothes, while
others solely focused on support.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“YOU CANNOT WITHSTAND
ME!” Adept Saberslave had gone completely berserk. In the area
around him, a fiery dragon suddenly appeared. The fiery dragon
wrapped itself around him as it launched sneak attacks against Ning,
disturbing Ning’s rhythm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Around Ning’s own
body, an enormous Waterflame Lotus suddenly appeared. The Waterflame
Lotus bloomed open, the petals of the lotus swiveling against each
other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blood flew everywhere
as the two battled with utter madness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Saberslave could
only be described in a single word - fast!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, in turn,
brought out all of the magnificent splendor of the Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">CLANG! A warcleaver was
suddenly knocked aside…and attached to it was a severed hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I admit defeat.” A
hoarse voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two separated with
a swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Saberslave’s
entire body was covered in wounds. The wound on his chest was
particularly bad; it had torn apart almost his entire chest. His face
was covered with many savage wounds, and one of his hands had been
severed, causing his warcleaver to fly away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, by comparison,
was a bit better off. He only had a single vicious wound on his
chest, as well as several wounds that were about to completely finish
healing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You weren’t
completely defeated yet.” Ning looked at Adept Saberslave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With six sabers, I
still lost a hand. With only five sabers…you probably would’ve
taken my life.” Adept Saberslave gently shook his head. He picked
up his discarded warcleaver, then walked out of the grand sealing
formation. Ji Ning walked out as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Wanxiang
Adepts within the main hall had extremely solemn looks on their
faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battle between Ji
Ning and Adept Saberslave had been too berserk, too violent. The two
had pulled out almost all the stops in their battle, releasing the
full power of the Grand Dao of the Sword and the Grand Dao of the
Saber, the two Grand Daos that were most suited for attacking. This
caused all of the spectators to feel nervousness in their hearts.
Many of them would most likely have been defeated had they been the
one to encounter Adept Saberslave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, it was Ji
Ning, a Sword Immortal, who had been the one to fight. He had managed
to suppress this Saber Devil!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And now…Adept
Saberslave had admitted defeat, leaving behind the even more
terrifying Ji Ning!

Chapter 23 - Ji Ning’s Divine Ability
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning won!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning of the
Black-White College of Stillwater Commandery won!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial citadel
plaza was a hubbub of noise. The delegates from the 3600 commanderies
and four seas were all excitedly discussing this most recent battle.
It had indeed been quite spectacular! This was because the other
competitors, such as Xiamang Zishan, Adept Ninedeaths, or the Sloppy
Daoist all relied on their hands or on staffs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When they fought, their
techniques might be more exquisite or more violent…but in terms of
murderous savagery, they were far from being a match for the Dao of
the Sword or the Dao of the Saber. Sword Immortals and Saber Devils
were highly suited to combat! Previously, the two had easily defeated
their foes, but this time when they collided against each other…they
finally, truly revealed the strengths of Sword Immortals and Saber
Devils, these two major schools of combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sight of their
battled caused hearts to shudder and grow numb.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-light, the
saber-light…any casual blow was capable of slaughtering a Primal
Daoist!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning walked back into
the main hall of the Skylight Palace, moving behind King Yan and
seating himself alongside the Sloppy Daoist, Yuchi Xiyue, and Yu Wei
once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gazes of many
individuals within the main hall all fell upon Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I absolutely can’t
exchange blows head-on against this Ji Ning. I need to use my
strengths to seize his weaknesses.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword Immortals
truly are formidable in an all-out fight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t take him
head-on.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rest of the
twenty-four Wanxiang Adept competitors were all pondering. Only when
knowing one’s self and one’s enemies could one win a hundred
battles without fail. They all knew that Sword Immortals specialized
in attacking, and they naturally knew where their own advantages lay
as well…and so the likes of Adept Ninedeaths, Xiamang Zishan,
Cangwu Jiu, Youngflame Zhan, and Adept Blackstone were all quietly
pondering on their plans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine Pure Yang True
Immortals seated on high, by contrast, began to grow puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wasn’t able to
see it clearly previously,” the Immortal Elder of the Northlands
said in a suspicious manner, “But during the battle between Ji Ning
and Saberslave, everything became apparent. In terms of their levels
of comprehension regarding the sword and the saber, the two were on
par…but when they fought head-on, Ji Ning actually held the upper
hand. This Saberslave is the disciple of a good friend of Eastflower;
his divine abilities shouldn’t be weak. So…this Ji Ning should
train in an even more powerful divine ability! Or perhaps the power
of the swords he wields is greater!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Truelord Chiji nodded
as well. “Ji Ning has only trained for around thirty or so years,
but has already reached such a level; he should have had a tremendous
stroke of luck that allowed him to learn a powerful divine ability.
However, this divine ability is a support-type divine ability that is
quite low-key, making it extremely hard to detect from the surface.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He should indeed
have a formidable divine ability.” Lu Dongbing laughed loudly. “But
each of those who have managed to survive this Conclave thus far are
the darlings of this entire major world of the Grand Xia; I’m sure
that all of them have had tremendous strokes of luck. Since the
universe was established, countless divine abilities have been
invented. Some are for attack, others are for suppressing and
sealing, others are for poison, while some are for raw strength…they
are all different. Ji Ning should have trained in one meant for raw
strength.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His speed isn’t
exceptionally impressive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were, after all,
far too many variables that could affect a person’s combat power.
Some were exceptionally talented; even if they were also just at the
twelfth stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens],
their talent made it so that they were a bit stronger! Not everyone
at the same level would necessarily have the exact same level of
strength! Even those who trained in the same Ki Refining technique,
such as the [Flowing Watersource], would need different levels of
liquefied elemental essence for a breakthrough. After all, each of
them were born with unique bodies that had their differences; the
only thing that could be said was that the difference between them
wouldn’t be too ridiculous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Different weapons,
different insights into different Daos, particularly special divine
abilities, or secret arts that allowed elemental ki to explode in
certain ways…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These could all cause
differences in one’s level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, they hadn’t
even been able to tell that Ning possessed a powerful divine ability,
but in Ning’s battle against Saberslave, the two had simply been
too similar! One was of the Dao of the Sword, the other was of the
Dao of the Saber. Putting them side by side made the differences very
easily detected, which was why the Pure Yang True Immortals were able
to ascertain that Ning should be in possession of a powerful divine
ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But that was nothing
special.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were plenty of
formidable divine abilities; the imperial treasury of the Grand Xia
Emperor even held the [Torch Dragon’s Eye], one of the top hundred
grand divine abilities of the Three Realms. However, the treasury
only held the first part of the [Torch Dragon’s Eye]; it was only
suitable for Void-level Fiendgods to train in. They didn’t have the
higher-level training techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, a grand
divine ability like this, ranked in the top hundred in the entire
Three Realms, shouldn’t actually have been transmitted to
outsiders, even if it was just the first part. The reason the
imperial treasury of the Grand Xia had it was because…the creator
of the [Torch Dragon’s Eye], the major power of the Three Realms
known as the Torch Dragon, had died long ago during the era of the
Primordial World!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning might have
learned a unique divine ability developed by some Empyrean God or
major power,” the Pure Yang True Immortals believed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The divine abilities
developed by major powers weren’t necessarily the most supreme
abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, Grand
Emperor Xuanwu; only his ‘Grand Black Tortoise’ divine ability
was exceptionally famous. He would occasionally develop some other
unique divine abilities as well. Some were suited for fleeing, others
were suited for defense, while still others were suited for
attacking…these types divine abilities, which he would create in a
fairly casual manner, were comparatively speaking of much lower
value. Only supreme abilities which the creator poured all of their
blood and sweat into would become truly precious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, the ‘Grand
Black Tortoise’ divine ability of Grand Emperor Xuanwu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Or for example, the
[Starseizing Hand] of Daoist Threelives.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the second duel,
the unaffiliated Adept Ninedeaths will battle against Adept
Rainflower of the Soaring Immortal School.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a battle
between two women.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Ninedeaths had a
body like a magic treasure; Adept Rainflower was completely unable to
do anything to her. After all, her attacks weren’t as powerful as
that of a Sword Immortal like Ji Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this battle…Adept
Ninedeaths was the victor!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The third duel…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fourth duel…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One duel after another.
The people watching from the imperial citadel plaza below were all
breathless. The Celestial Immortals and Pure Yang True Immortals
seated within the main hall of the Skylight Palace were all watching
attentively as well. The only reason why the Pure Yang True Immortals
were paying so much attention was because Daofather Crimsonbright
would choose one of them as a disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The eighth duel
shall wee Youngflame Zhan fight against Xiangtian Xiao.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a battle that
many people cared about.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because,
amongst the twenty-four competitors, only four came from the major
clans of the Grand Xia Dynasty – Xiamang Zishan of the imperial
Xiamang clan, Cangwu Jiu of the Cangwu clan, Youngflame Zhan of the
Youngflame clan, and Xiangtian Xiao of the Xiangtian clan. Just four
of them! This proved that in terms of searching for geniuses, the
number of geniuses within the various clans was vastly inferior to
the number of geniuses spread out within the entire world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this battle,
Xiangtian Xiao was quite berserk. He completely displayed the
legendary valor and savagery of the Xiangtian clan, famous for being
willing to challenge the heavens themselves. However…he still lost.
His power was indeed quite a bit lower than Youngflame Zhan’s. 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, Youngflame
Zhan had been entrusted with the hopes of his clan; he had also gone
all out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The victor of the
eighth battle was Youngflame Zhan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good, good, good.
Very good!” Watching the battle, Patriarch Arcanum couldn’t help
but laugh so hard his mouth was about to split apart. Everyone knew
how crazed and cold-blooded he was; it was rare to see him smile a
single time in ten thousand years. But right now, he was laughing!
And in truth, the other Celestial Immortals all understood how
Patriarch Arcanum was feeling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Zhan, child, well
done. Charge forward in just this manner. You’ve already made it to
the top twelve.” Patriarch Arcanum watched as Youngflame Zhan
walked to his side, then immediately encouraged him, “You are very,
very, very close to being in the top three now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, the twelve
competitions in the third round came to an end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This resulted in the
final twelve being determined!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the rest of
the twelve all stood in a neat line in the main hall, awaiting the
Grand Xia Emperor’s bestowal of five million kilograms of liquefied
elemental essence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang Zishan.
Cangwu Jiu. Ji Ning. Sloppy Daoist. Youngflame Zhan. Adept Woodpass.
Adept Blackstone. Adept Ninedeaths. Adept Whitedragon. Adept
Unicosmo. Adept Primalback. Adept Goldcrow.” The Xia Emperor stood
at the front of the hall, listing out the names of all twelve before
continuing. “The twelve of you have ranked in the top twelve in
this Conclave of Immortal Destiny. I said previously that those who
made it into the top twelve would each receive five million kilograms
of liquefied elemental essence.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor waved
his hand. Instantly, twelve violet-jade bottles appeared out of
nowhere in the air before them. One of the twelve violet-jade bottles
flew to each of the twelve victors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This caused even the
Celestial Immortals present to stare towards the bottles. Five
million kilograms! This caused even them to feel envy and desire.
These twelve little fellows ended up acquiring so much!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
reached out to grab them. They then swept the bottles with their
divine senses!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wow.” Ning
secretly sighed in amazement. “This violet bottle is a wonderful
treasure for storing liquefied elemental essence as well. It is
actually able to hold five million kilograms of it. It’s comparable
to a high-grade Heaven-ranked flying sword in value.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With these five
million kilograms, my Primaltwin should be able to charge all the way
to the peak of the Void-stage,” Ning mused to himself. “But
there’s no need to rush it; my Primaltwin has spent very little
time at the Primal level. I should keep it there for a period of time
longer and understand it better.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At every single level,
there were different insights to be gained. Reincarnated Immortals
might have already trained at a certain level, so it didn’t matter,
but Ji Ning was no reincarnated Immortal. It was best for him to
spend a bit of extra time at each level. But of course, after his
true body broke through to become a Primal, his Primaltwin could make
the breakthrough to the Void-level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You shall first
enter the world of the Brightmoon Diagram of the Mountains and
Rivers,” the Xia Emperor suddenly said. “I will change the flow
of time in the place where you reside. I shall wait for you for two
hours in the outside world; within the Diagram, you will have three
days to quietly train.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
were flabbergasted. Train for three days within the Diagram?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Strange. Previously,
when the hundred thousand-plus competitors entered the world of the
Diagram, wasn’t the flow of time inside it the same as the flow of
time outside it? Why is it that all of a sudden, three days in the
diagram becomes equal to two hours outside of it?” Ning was
puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning!” The
giant yellow bear’s voice rang out in Ning’s mind. “It seems as
though the emperor of your Grand Xia Dynasty has quite a bit of
insight into the Grand Dao of Time. However, changing the flow of
time will use a tremendous amount of energy; although the Grand Xia
Emperor is a Pure Yang True Immortal, he still wouldn’t dare to try
and change the flow of time for more than a hundred thousand people.
The twelve of you represent a much lower burden to him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh swoosh swoosh!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the rest of
the twelve were teleported straight into the world of the Diagram,
and then the scroll of the Diagram itself flew into the Grand Xia
Emperor’s hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang, you want to
let them train for three days?” Truelord Chiji laughed. “It seems
you truly do place tremendous importance on this Conclave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s not that I
place importance on it; it’s that I must not only be hard-working
in service to Master, I also must put thought into it,” the Xia
Emperor said. “There are only twelve who remain in this Conclave.
The previous battles they engaged in have caused their hearts to be
tempered through the invisible pressure their competitors placed upon
them…and they are currently in the process of evolving. I am giving
them three days. Perhaps, this will be enough to let them make a
breakthrough. I naturally wish to ensure that only the three best
geniuses are presented to Master for the choosing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. When you are
working for your master, you need to not only be hard-working, but
also put thought into it.” Lu Dongbin nodded and smiled. “No
wonder Daofather Crimsonbright likes you so much, Xiamang.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the others
appeared atop a mountain peak. The mountain peak was more than a
three hundred meters in size; naturally, it was enough for twelve
cultivators to train in. In addition, there were invisible barriers
surrounding the mountain peak; there was no way for Ning or the
others to walk out from the area of the peak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
immediately sat down into the lotus position, not even saying
anything to each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all felt as though
their souls had been filled with new insights; perhaps this might be
their chance to apply them and make a breakthrough. A little bit of a
breakthrough might make a tremendous difference in whether or not
they would be able to be selected into the top three! That meant a
chance to become the disciple of Daofather Crimsonbright! Who
wouldn’t go all out for that chance?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, too, had the
ardent desire to become Daofather Crimsonbright’s disciple!

Chapter 24 - The Sloppy Daoist Against Adept Ninedeaths
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While Ji Ning and the
rest of the twelve were in secluded meditation and training within
the world of the Brightmoon Diagram of the Mountains and Rivers. The
imperial citadel’s plaza.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twelve names repeatedly
came up in conversations: Xiamang Zishan, Cangwu Jiu, Ji Ning, Sloppy
Daoist, Youngflame Zhan, Adept Woodpass, Adept Blackstone, Adept
Ninedeaths, Adept Whitedragon, Adept Unicosmo, Adept Primalback,
Adept Goldcrow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The top twelve have
been determined.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our South Seas have
Adept Woodpass.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our North Seas have
Adept Goldcrow!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Quchang
Commandery has Adept Whitedragon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You guys are
nothing. Our Stillwater Commandery has two people; Ji Ning and the
Sloppy Daoist!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only twelve finalists
had emerged from the 3600 commanderies. Two of them belonged to
Stillwater Commandery, and both were from the Black-White College!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Fivecraze was
grinning so broadly his jaw was almost crooked. Clutching a calabash
of wine, he gulped it down happily, occasionally chatting through
divine sense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, you are the
leader of the Myriad Beasts School? Haha, yup, I’m Fivecraze. Yup,
Ji Ning and little Sloppy both belong to our Black-White College. To
be honest, Yu Wei of our Black-White College was poisoned; otherwise,
she would’ve made it into the top ninety six as well. She might
have even entered the top twelve! What? You would like to get to know
the disciples of our Black-White College? You want to go spend some
time viewing the Black-White Diagram within the Black-White College?
Sure, no problem! How about letting the disciples of our Black-White
College also go take a look at the ten thousand beasts of your
school?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiangtian clan? Your
Xiangtian clan wishes to send its disciples to the Black-White
College? But, but…the Black-White College is in Stillwater
Commandery, after all. We have very little room, and it’s not
convenient for us to have too many disciples! That’s why we are
extremely strict whenever we take on new students. What’s that?
Your Xiangtian clan wishes to send an envoy delegation to the
Black-White College? No problem. Our Black-White College will
definitely take good care of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many people had come to
seek out Immortal Fivecraze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that the Xiangtian clan and the Myriad Beasts School were some of the
most supremely powerful schools in the entire Grand Xia Dynasty. They
had all learned from their Celestial Immortal Patriarchs that the
Sloppy Daoist was the disciple of Grand Emperor Xuanwu. Given how
outstanding Ji Ning was as well…all of the major powers were
puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For a small school
to suddenly produce one outstanding genius is one thing; that can
just be attributed to luck. But they actually produced two! The
entire Grand Xia Dynasty has only twelve on their level…and one of
them is the disciple of Grand Emperor Xuanwu. I imagine that this
Black-White College must be one of the places within our Grand Xia
Dynasty where luck is gathering and flourishing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It must be a place
of tremendously positive karmic luck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many major powers came
to this conclusion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Luck; it couldn’t be
seen, nor could it be touched. But some places were just naturally
lucky! When the imperial capital of the Grand Xia had been built, the
Grand Xia Emperor had invited a major power to personally choose a
site with great karmic luck to build on, then set up a grand
formation that guarded the entire world from the site.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have to send our
disciples over there. When they train in a place of such karmic luck,
they too will be blessed by luck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. We also need
to go spend some time observing the Black-White Diagram of this
Black-White College.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main hall of the
Skylight Palace. An hour had passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Xia Emperor
sat above all others atop his throne. With a wave of his arm, a
furled scroll appeared in his palm. It was the Pure Yang treasure,
the Brightmoon Diagram of the Mountains and Rivers. The scroll
opened, and twelve streaks of light flew out and landed on the
ground. It was Ji Ning, the Sloppy Daoist, and the rest of the
twelve.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We prostrate
ourselves before you, your Imperial Majesty,” Ning and the others
said as they all fell to their knees.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Xia Emperor
glanced at them, then nodded in satisfaction. He could vaguely sense
that after three days of quiet training, all twelve of these had made
some improvements. Some of them had improved considerably.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is now the most
important part of this Conclave. Three of you shall emerge from the
twelve…and one of the three shall definitely be chosen by my master
as a disciple,” the Xia Emperor said. “There is no time to waste.
Let the first battle in the fourth round of duels begin. Let us have
the Sloppy Daoist of the Black-White College fight against the
unaffiliated Adept Ninedeaths. The others can all rest, watch, and
prepare for their own duels.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Xiamang Zishan,
and the others were all surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist
against Adept Ninedeaths?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Ninedeaths was
extremely strong, and she had yet to unleash all of her full power.
As for the Sloppy Daoist, the Celestial Immortals had all gushed over
him endlessly. Xiamang Zishan and the others had all heard their
respective Celestial Immortal Patriarchs praise the Sloppy Daoist and
warn them to be wary of him. It was as though the Sloppy Daoist was
the strongest amongst them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Due to the warnings of
their Celestial Immortal Patriarchs, all of them were paying very
close attention to the Sloppy Daoist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sloppy against
Ninedeaths? So soon?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Sloppy
Daoist and Adept Ninedeaths, they each gave the other a glance, then
walked out from the main hall and towards the grand sealing
formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine Pure Yang True
Immortals seated at the front of the main hall of the Skylight Palace
began to argue amongst each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang, is
something wrong with your head?” Truelord Chiji said with a frown,
“This is just the fourth round, meant to determine the top six; why
are you pitting the Sloppy Daoist against Adept Ninedeaths? Adept
Ninedeaths has mastered five complete Dao-Paths long ago, and her
divine abilities and training techniques are all incredibly powerful.
Her might is significant! She should rank amongst the very top, and
definitely has a chance to become number one. The Sloppy Daoist is
the disciple of Grand Emperor Xuanwu; he should rank at the top as
well, and also has a chance to become number one. For you to have
them fight now…that means one of them will have to be discarded
prematurely.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is indeed too
early. It isn’t appropriate to have the two of them compete so
soon.” Bodhisattva Mahasthamaprapta slowly spoke out as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do all of you think
that I can’t tell that Adept Ninedeaths is powerful?” The Xia
Emperor shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang has his own
difficulties.” Lu Dongbin shook his head. “Actually, by now, I
have a favorable impression of eight…but six must be eliminated!
Thus, no matter how you match them up, at least two of the eight I
like will be eliminated.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor nodded.
“Right. By now, of these twelve, I have a particularly favorable
impression of Xiamang Zishan of my own clan, Ji Ning, Adept Goldcrow,
Adept Woodpass, Adept Blackstone, the Sloppy Daoist, and Adept
Ninedeaths! No matter how I match them up, two of these seven will
have to end up fighting each other. I pondered for a long time about
what to do. The Sloppy Daoist is already the disciple of Grand
Emperor Xuanwu; Master definitely won’t try to steal someone else’s
disciple. As for Adept Ninedeaths, she’s the only female amongst
the seven. They stood out. So, I ended up deciding to stop worrying
about it and just have the Sloppy Daoist and Adept Ninedeaths fight.
Whoever wins will stay behind.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s quite
decisive of you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The reason you are
having Adept Ninedeaths fight the Sloppy Daoist is actually because
she’s female?” The other Pure Yang True Immortals couldn’t help
but laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Yu Wei, and Yuchi
Xiyue were all behind King Yan. They were staring at the distant
grand sealing formation outside the hall. Within the formation, there
were two individuals; a sloppy, chubby youth and a similarly dirty
maiden.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Both of them are
incomparably slovenly. They are a good match,” Yuchi Xiyue
whispered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But both are very
powerful,” Yu Wei praised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are indeed.
When Adept Ninedeaths puts on those silver gloves, even I can’t
tell how great her power is. Although I fought against her
previously, she hadn’t used that magic treasure at all.” Ning
watched carefully. “Eldest apprentice-brother’s power is
unfathomable as well. It’s hard to say who will win.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were all staring
at this battle. The Pure Yang True Immortals were paying absolute
attention as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist? A
disciple of Grand Emperor Xuanwu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Ninedeaths?
Everyone had noticed long ago that she was one of the two masters of
five Dao-Paths, and she had a body like a magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are starting.”
Yuchi Xiyue stared intently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes instantly
narrowed. “They are finally showing their powers. Adept
Ninedeaths…she truly is frightening.” Till now, Adept Ninedeaths
had never before revealed her full power. When she had fought Ning,
she had mainly focused on tying him down. But this time, in her duel
against the Sloppy Daoist, she actively launched a sudden, violent
attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Gloves on hands, Adept
Ninedeaths six arms had become six incomparably fierce weapons!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Attack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sometimes, her hands
hacked down like blades with invincible sharpness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At other times, they
glided like water, swirling about in a soft, circular manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Ninedeaths
circled around the Sloppy Daoist, attacking wildly. The two of them
both used their divine abilities, both having transformed into
three-headed, six-armed giants.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Which Grand Dao is
this?” Ning frowned. The attacks of Adept Ninedeaths were extremely
strange. They created an extremely uncomfortable stifling feeling,
while her own attacks were constantly fluctuating in style in an
unfathomable manner. “It shouldn’t be an especially well-known
one. I, at least, have never seen this Grand Dao.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Grand Dao of
Mortality 1! This little girl truly is quite ambitious. The Grand Dao
of Mortality…it is one of the most supreme of the many Grand Daos.
It is extremely hard to train in. She actually dares to trod on this
Grand Dao?” Lu Dongbin shook his head with a sigh. “But if she
reaches a certain level in this Grand Dao, then overcoming the
Celestial Tribulation will become significantly easier by
comparison.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Daos of
Taiji, the Sword, and the Saber were all technique-focused Daos!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By contrast, the Grand
Dao of Mortality contained the infinite mysteries of life and death
within it, as well as the technical principles regarding how life and
death interchanged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was a Grand Dao that
not only contained many profound mysteries, but also ways to apply
techniques! It was extremely difficult to train in, even more so than
the Daos of the Sword or the Saber.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Interesting.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This little lass
truly is formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Ninedeaths
attacked wildly, occasionally becoming as savage and vicious as a God
of Death, while at other times seeming to be as gentle and soft as
the caress of a mother. The interchange and the linkages between life
and death…they caused even the Sloppy Daoist to be suppressed for a
period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist was
truly too stable and unshakeable. When executing the Grand Black
Tortoise divine ability, he also executed his Grand Dao of Taiji.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist
seemed to have transformed into a whirling and spinning turtle-shell.
His defense was absolutely impregnable. The Grand Black Tortoise
divine ability was exceptionally suited for defense, and the Grand
Dao of Taiji was also extremely suited for defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” Adept
Ninedeaths let out a furious growl as she grew even more berserk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By contrast, the Sloppy
Daoist was incomparably relaxed and leisurely. His six arms seemed to
have transformed into the spokes of an enormous windmill, blocking
one attack after another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">HISS!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sound like the
hissing of a serpent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist had
been defending this entire time, his guard as tight as a turtle
shell, allowing the opponent no flaws to slip attacks through. All of
a sudden, his arm came slamming out! His hand struck out in a
serpentine stance, viciously stabbing forth! As it did, it just so
happened to strike at a flaw in the stances of the frantically
attacking Adept Ninedeaths, tearing her arm apart at the shoulder and
sending it flying off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After his first attack,
the Sloppy Daoist suddenly exploded with power. He charged forth with
the power of a formerly dormant volcano that was suddenly exploding,
and his six arms had all transformed into vipers that moved with
strange savagery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His defense had been
completely impregnable. His attacks…they were as terrifying as the
strikes of a viper.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perfect. I was
afraid you’d keep hiding!” Adept Ninedeaths wasn’t startled; in
fact, she was delighted. If her opponent had continued to defend, he
might have been able to exhaust her divine power. That would be an
unfair way to lose! Adept Ninedeaths immediately moved forward to
exchange blows, and her severed arm was quickly regrowing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of them truly did
have the power to contend for the number one position!

Chapter 25 - Secret Art ‘Wavefolding’
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist’s
six arms were currently striking out like six venomous serpents,
moving with unstoppable ferocity and extreme viciousness! His savage
attacks seemed as torrential as a storm of rain, and each strike was
potentially lethal. Clearly, he wanted to seize this chance to break
down Adept Ninedeaths; after all, she had lost an arm and now had
only five remaining.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…hahaha…”
Adept Ninedeaths actually let out a delighted laugh. Each of her palm
blows seemed to contain the power of life and death within them,
causing everyone who looked at her to feel a stifled feeling. She
madly blocked all of the Sloppy Daoist’s attacks, and she even used
her own body to block some strikes to win a little bit of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist was
ferociously attacking, while Adept Ninedeaths was striving to hold on
until her severed arm had regrown.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Yu Wei, and
Yuchi Xiyue all felt nervous as they saw this. Even though Adept
Ninedeaths only had five arms, the Sloppy Daoist remained unable to
shatter through her defenses. She was currently planning to hold on
until her sixth arm grew back…at which point, it would be even
harder for the Sloppy Daoist to defeat her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is this all he
has…this disciple which Grand Emperor Xuanwu took such a fancy to?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He can’t even defeat
an unaffiliated cultivator like Adept Ninedeaths?” The True
Immortals at the front of the Skylight Palace were all quite puzzled.
As they saw it, given Grand Emperor Xuanwu’s status, his disciple
should naturally be extraordinary. Otherwise, that would be an utter
loss of face for Grand Emperor Xuanwu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin, by
contrast, was staring far into the distance. Smiling, he said, “This
battle is interesting. This Adept Ninedeaths has an extremely deep
level of insight into the Grand Dao of Mortality; in fact, I even
suspect that she has memories from several previous lives…she is
definitely extremely strong. Can it be that the Sloppy Daoist is
actually going to lose to her?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It wouldn’t be
strange if he did,” Truelord Chiji agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just because someone
is going to become a Celestial Immortal in the future doesn’t mean
they cannot lose a battle in the present.” Sovereign Hao shook his
head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Pure Yang
True Immortals felt that the outcome of this battle was now in doubt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Based on their
judgment, both the Sloppy Daoist and Adept Ninedeaths had used all of
the powers available to them. The Sloppy Daoist had am impregnable
defense, and his attacks were absolutely savage as well…and yet, he
remained unable to do anything to his opponent. This was indeed quite
dangerous for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist
suddenly took a break from his frantic attacks, beginning to launch a
different tempo of strikes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is…?!”
Adept Ninedeaths face suddenly changed. The Sloppy Daoist was
currently very calm; his six arms moved in unfathomable ways, and at
almost all times four of them were defending while two of them were
attacking! They felt like the waves of the sea. Each successive wave
was increasingly powerful, and the same was true for the Sloppy
Daoist’s attacks. When defending, he was accumulating power…and
when attacking, he would let it erupt forth!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Accumulating power,
then unleashing it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sort of strange
tempo caused the Sloppy Daoist’s attacks to slowly become
increasingly ferocious. One wave after another continued to merge
into each other, causing Adept Ninedeaths to feel increasingly
stifled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What what what…what
is this?!” Adept Ninedeaths couldn’t understand it at all. The
waves were growing increasingly savage in power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist
suddenly struck out with all six arms. They all struck out as fists
with a power that felt faintly similar to an enormous black tortoise
slamming against the pillars of heaven. Boom….Adept Ninedeath
blocked the blows, but was knocked flying backwards. Her body had
split open at many places from the force of the collision, and blood
was flowing from the wounds nonstop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The Sloppy
Daoist took a single step, appearing before Adept Ninedeaths. His six
fists once more moved to strike out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I admit defeat.”
Adept Ninedeaths discontented voice rang out. She was now using all
her efforts to dodge. Only now did the Sloppy Daoist come to a halt.
The turtle-shell runes covering his body disappeared as well as he
returned to normal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dirty face of Adept
Ninedeaths was filled with resentment and an unwillingness to accept
this. She looked towards the Sloppy Daoist: “Sloppy Daoist; your
level of comprehension of the Dao is limited, and whether I am
attacking or defending, I can handle you. So why is it that this last
technique of yours became increasingly hard for me to withstand…until
in the end, I had to admit defeat?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist just
laughed. This was a battle technique he had developed after gaining
insight into the Grand Black Tortoise divine ability. When he had
been transmitted this Grand Black Tortoise divine ability, he had
sworn an oath to the Dao of the Heavens that without permission, he
absolutely wouldn’t teach anyone any part of it at all. This
technique involved some of the profound mysteries of the Grand Black
Tortoise divine ability; naturally, he couldn’t teach it to anyone
else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is the name of
this sort of battle technique?” Adept Ninedeaths quickly asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wavefolding!” The
Sloppy Daoist responded to her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wavefolding…one
wave after another, folding onto each other…I was trapped within
the waves, and death was the only way out…I clearly wasn’t weaker
than you, but I was still defeated…wavefolding…wavefolding…”
Adept Ninedeaths walked away, murmuring the word ‘wavefolding’ to
herself. She even had a sudden feeling…that if she could comprehend
the mysteries of this ‘wavefolding’, then she would have a chance
to overcome the Celestial Tribulation and become a Celestial
Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a stroke of
luck for her! But if she was unable to comprehend it, then in this
life, her ninth life, she would probably once more fail the
tribulation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Skylight
Palace’s main hall. The nearly thousand-strong Celestial Immortal
Patriarchs were all frowning. Although they were very experienced,
even they couldn’t understand what had just happened. Clearly,
these two were both on par with each other in terms of divine
abilities, comprehension of the Dao, and Fiendgod Body Refining
techniques. In fact, Adept Ninedeaths was even at a slight advantage.
So why, in the end, had she been defeated like this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had seemed as though
Adept Ninedeaths had walked into an endless tide; no matter how much
she struggled, it was useless. In the end, the tide had completely
drowned her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What was that?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could that have
happened?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t
understand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Immortals
all felt that there were strange mysteries to what had just happened.
It should have been some sort of battle art they just saw, but none
of them could comprehend it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He truly lives up to
being the disciple of Grand Emperor Xuanwu.” This was the only
thing they could come up with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wavefolding!” The
Xia Emperor and the rest of the nine Pure Yang True Immortals all
revealed a look of surprise and amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I sigh in amazement.
I sigh in amazement!” The Immortal Elder of the Northlands shook
his head and sighed with emotion, “This Sloppy Daoist truly has
astonishing comprehension abilities. He was even able to comprehend
some of the true exquisiteness of this secret art of Grand Emperor
Xuanwu’s…when I watched that battle just now, I was even reminded
of that scene from back when I was listening to Grand Emperor Xuanwu
expound on the Dao.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Truly incredible!”
Lu Dongbin sighed in disbelief as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formidable.” The
Xia Emperor seemed to show a hinit of envy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grand Emperor
Xuanwu…he truly is a major power!” Truelord Chiji’s eyes were
filled with admiration.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At their level, they
actually all understood the profound principles behind the Sloppy
Daoist’s ‘wavefolding’ technique. This was a technique that
constantly circulated and accumulated waves of power; the longer the
power was stored up for, the more terrifying the final explosion of
power would be! But even if one was taught this technique and
completely understood its principles, that didn’t mean one would
necessarily be able to use it. This was a matter of heart, a matter
of comprehension.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all understood
some of the profound underlying principles, but as the saying goes,
some things are ‘easy to understand, but hard to do’!
Understanding was one part; actually executing the technique was
something else entirely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can comprehend
the mysteries of this Sloppy Daoist’s ‘wavefolding’ technique,
but when the Grand Emperor personally executes it, the profound
mysteries are countless times more complicated,” Lu Dongbin sighed.
“Grand Emperor Xuanwu’s ‘Grand Black Tortoise’ divine
ability…its true exquisiteness lies in a single word; the so-called
‘folding’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was frowning as he
watched. He could vaguely sense that the final battle technique the
Sloppy Daoist had used had seemed to contain an utterly
heaven-shaking profound mystery. He could even sense that the Grand
Dao of Taiji was mixed into it. But Ning himself did not walk upon
the Grand Dao of Taiji; he couldn’t understand what he had seen at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yu Wei, what do you
think?” Ning looked towards the nearby Yu Wei; she herself was
walked upon the Grand Dao of Taiji.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t understand
it. It is very profound, unfathomably so. I can vaguely sense the
exquisite essence of the Grand Dao of Taiji, but that’s just one
part of this secret art. I imagine that eldest apprentice-brother has
only mastered the tiniest portion of this secret art.” Yu Wei
completely couldn’t understand the technique either; she couldn’t
get the slightest bit of insight into it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Immortals
were puzzled, while Ning and the others were completely baffled. Just
like that…this battle ended.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the top six had
been determined…the Sloppy Daoist!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a ripple of
the Dao descended within the main hall of the Skylight Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone’s gazes
turned in unison to stare at the point where the Dao-ripple had
descended. They saw Cangwu Jiu, seated in the lotus position behind a
Celestial Immortal Patriarch of the Cangwu clan. In the area around
him, a hint of a black wind could vaguely be seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He comprehended a
Dao?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He comprehended yet
another complete Dao-Path?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually
comprehended a complete Dao-Path by watching that battle?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone present was
completely astonished. Generally speaking, it was fairly common for
someone to suddenly make a breakthrough during the course of a
battle, but Cangwu Jiu had just been watching the battle. In that
tense atmosphere, he had actually gained sudden mastery over a
complete Dao-Path?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Xiamang Zishan,
Youngflame Zhan, Adept Blackstone, Adept Woodpass, Adept Whitedragon,
Adept Goldcrow, and the rest of the twelve Wanxiang Adepts all sensed
a new threat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cangwu Jiu had been
very powerful to begin with. And now, he had mastered yet another
complete Dao-Path….and in doing so had immediately become a truly
formidable foe!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But, but…” The
Grand Xia Emperor, seated atop his throne above the others, shook his
head and laughed bitterly. He looked towards the other eight Pure
Yang True Immortals. “Everyone, how do you think I should arrange
these next battles? With this breakthrough, he has now mastered five
complete Dao-Paths. In addition, this breakthrough was in one of the
Daos of the Wind, one of the Five Elements. He was already
exceptionally fast; he now will be even more formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had already come up
with a plan for matching up duelists. But Cangwu Jiu’s sudden
mastery of a new Dao-Path, combined with the fact that he was already
very formidable…this made him an even more shocking competitor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I view Cangwu Jiu
quite positively,” Lu Dongbin said with a laugh. “He was actually
able to make a breakthrough just by watching a battle…I imagine
that his level of luck must be quite high as well. He was already
quite formidable, and had never exploded forth with his full power;
now that he has made another breakthrough, I imagine that his power
is most likely not inferior to even the likes of Adept Ninedeaths.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is going to be
trouble.” The Grand Xia Emperor was pondering. He immediately made
some slight mental adjustments to the pairings he had come up with
earlier. He had originally ranked Cangwu Jiu as number eight or nine
amongst the twelve, but now he ranked him somewhere around the third
or fourth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sudden breakthrough
in the main hall of the Skylight Palace…this naturally attracted
quite a bit of attention. The Celestial Immortal Patriarch of the
Cangwu Clan had extremely long eyebrows, and he was currently
extremely excited. He stared at Cangwu Jiu, this disciple of his
clan. Upon seeing him open his eyes, the Celestial Immortal
immediately said, “Good, good, good. Jiu, child, this is an
excellent breakthrough. For you to make a sudden breakthrough here in
the Skylight Palace must be the arrangement of the heavens; this
time, you’ll definitely make the top three.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Immortal
Patriarch was almost able to visualize how glorious the Cangwu clan
would be in the future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why did the Cangwu clan
necessarily have to submit to the Xiamang clan? With Daofather
Crimsonbright supporting them, in the future the Cangwu clan would be
able to grow and develop to the point where they would be able to sit
down with the Xiamang clan as equals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second duel in
the fourth round shall see Adept Whitedragon of the Divine Dragon
Mountain against Cangwu Jiu of the Cangwu clan.” The Xia Emperor’s
voice suddenly echoed in the main hall of the Skylight Palac as well
as the vast imperial citadel plaza below.

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every person who had
battled through the Conclave of Immortal Destiny to this point was a
peerless genius. As if by unspoken agreement, they had all but given
up using divine will attacks or spell-based attacks against each
other! This was because using magic treasures and elemental ki was
not enough to threaten their foes; they all had to rely on divine
abilities to battle. Ji Ning had given up the [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation] as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! WHOOSH!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cangwu Jiu and Adept
Whitedragon were battling savagely against each other. Both of them
used [Heavenly Transformation] and [Three Heads, Six Arms], then each
unleashed their respective divine abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Whitedragon had
completely transformed into a snowy white divine dragon, while Cangwu
Jiu had exploded forth with a level of speed that was utterly
amazing. The only thing that could be seen was a howling wind which
flashed with streaks of lightning. Within the berserk lightning, the
vague form of Cangwu Jiu could be barely made out. He flashed forward
repeatedly at an utterly astonishing speed…it was as though a group
of Cangwu Jius were fighting against this single snowy white divine
dragon!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What terrifying
speed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What shocking
agility.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone was secretly
amazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Xiamang Zishan,
the Sloppy Daoist, and the others all felt their hearts sink. In
terms of speed, Cangwu Jiu had always been ranked number one in this
Conclave! Now, with this additional new breakthrough, his speed and
agility had reached an unfathomable new level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In close combat, speed
and agility were even more important than strength!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a terrifying
Cangwu Jiu.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A single
overwhelming advantage can be used to great effect everywhere. Just
by relying on his absolute advantage in speed and agility, he is an
extremely terrifying foe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no question
about it. In t his battle between two powerful Fiendgod Body
Refiners, Cangwu Jiu could attack when he wished and could retreat
when he wished; he completely controlled the tempo of battle!
Although Adept Whitedragon was powerful, in the face of Cangwu Jiu’s
agility and speed, he had no tactical options available at all. In
the end…he was defeated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second of the sixth
finalists in this Conclave had been chosen…Cangwu Jiu!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Goodd, good, good!”
The long-browed Celestial Immortal Patriarch of the Cangwu clan grew
even more excited, and his eyes gleamed with light. He was a
Celestial Immortal; naturally, he could tell that although by this
point there shouldn’t be any tremendous differences in power
amongst the finalists, Cangwu Jiu was able to make his enemies
helpless against him, thanks to his tremendous advantage in speed. If
this continued…he would definitely be in the top three as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Xia Emperor
spoke out once more. “The third duel in the fourth battle…Ji Ning
of the Black-White College shall battle Youngflame Zhan of the
Youngflame clan!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice echoed forth
everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was seated by King
Yan. His pupils contracted. Youngflame Zhan? The Youngflame clan? It
was well-publicized that he had a major feud against the Youngflame
clan…and his opponent would actually be Youngflame Zhan?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Yu Wei
held Ning’s hand in her own as she looked at him. “Be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, none of the
remaining opponents could be underestimated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the other side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum’s
face had changed slightly as well. Ji Ning? He had long ago desired
to find a chance to get rid of Ji Ning, but compared to the chance of
having a clansman becoming the disciple of Daofather Crimsonbright,
getting rid of Ji Ning was much less important. He had put that in
the back of his mind, and his entire focus was on Youngflame Zhan
making the top three.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Zhan, child.”
Patriarch Arcanum looked at Youngflame Zhan, who was by his side. He
instructed mentally, “This Ji Ning is a Sword Immortal; he’s most
skilled in attacking and battling. There is no need for you to fight
him head on…and your talents don’t lie in fighting head on
either. Use your strengths to strike as his weaknesses. You
absolutely can win.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Zhan nodded
gently as well. This battle…it was more important than life or
death!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Youngflame Zhan
immediately walked over towards the outside of the main hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang, when you
instructed Ji Ning and Youngflame Zhan fight…why is it that I felt
as though the atmosphere within the Skylight Palace became a bit
strange? Those Celestial Immortals seem to be looking at Ji Ning and
Youngflame Zhan in a rather queer manner,” Lu Dongbin said,
puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other Pure Yang
True Immortals had noticed this as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor laughed
loudly, “Everyone, you don’t know this, but there is a feud
between Ji Ning and the Youngflame clan. To be honest, it’s
actually become a bit of a legend.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Legend?” Lu
Dongbin and the others all began to listen carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of these True
Immortals had arrived after this Conclave had already begun; they
didn’t have much of an understanding regarding these Wanxiang-level
geniuses of the Grand Xia Dynasty. Naturally, they didn’t know of
the matters between Ning and the Youngflame clan. The only reason the
Grand Xia Emperor himself knew about it was because he had collected
intelligence reports on all of the geniuses, which was why he learned
of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Youngflame clan
had a member known as Youngflame Nong, who was going to be their next
clan leader…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“……”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…and in the end,
that Deathsworn which the Youngflame clan sent out ended up being
killed by this Ji Ning’s Primaltwin,” the Xia Emperor said with a
loud laugh. “So…you now understand the feud between Ji Ning and
the Youngflame clan, yes?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other Pure Yang
True Immortals now all understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang, that’s a
nasty little trick. You know that there is a feud between them, and
yet you intentionally set them up against each other. Still…given
that such a feud exists, they are definitely going to fight even more
insanely against each other.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. This battle is
definitely going to be quite exciting.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two of the six
finalists had already been determined. Ji Ning and Youngflame Zhan;
only one of them could enter the final six! So long as they could
enter the final six…they would be very close to becoming the three
victors. Just one step away!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The disciple of
Daofather Crimsonbright should be me.” Youngflame Zhan’s gaze was
cold. He was a very low-key person; in the younger generation of the
Youngflame clan, the most famous person had been Youngflame Nong. He,
Youngflame Zhan, had kept his head down and focused on quietly
training; his goal had always been to overcome the Celestial
Tribulation and become an immortal, free, unconstrained Celestial
Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had never held that
playboy, Youngflame Nong, in any regard at all. Youngflame Nong
merely relied on the affection of the Patriarch; he would only be
able to dominate for a period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To become a disciple
of a Daofather…this is indeed a chance that rarely comes even after
a thousand reincarnations. I have to seize it.” Youngflame Zhan
walked into the grand sealing formation, then stared at the distant
Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three Realms are
unfathomably mysterious. After I become Daofather Crimsonbright’s
disciple and have the guidance of a Daofather, I shall be able to
advance along my path in a faster, more stable manner!” Ji Ning
knew very well that personal hard work and comprehension abilities
were only part of it; luck and fate were another part. For example,
if he hadn’t had the [Nuwa Painting] visualization technique as he
had worked hard under the tutelage of his father, Ji Yichuan…although
he still might have been able to surpass his father and become a
major figure of Stillwater Commandery after a few centuries, it was
thanks to the [Nuwa Painting] that his rise to prominence had become
more than ten times faster!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, were it not
for the [Nuwa Painting]…he probably would’ve died when he had
entered the underwater estate. Strictly speaking, without the [Nuwa
Painting], Ning’s talent might not have been high enough for the
underwater estate to even teleport him inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An initial advantage
snowballs into continuous advantages!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To walk farther, to
make it to a higher position, to become a major power of the Three
Realms…one had to seize every single opportunity possible!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am definitely
going to enter the top three, and perhaps even become number one!”
Ning looked towards Youngflame Zhan. “This Youngflame Zhan…he’s
a stumbling block, a tiger blocking a critical juncture in my path of
Immortal cultivation. I must annihilate him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their gazes collided
from far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even their gazes seemed
to be striking at each other. Everyone could sense the resolute aura
emanating from the two. Either I can live, or he can…we cannot
coexist!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Their
bodies moved at the same instant as both transformed into
three-headed, six-armed giants!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s six arms were
holding six Immortal swords, while Youngflame Zhan’s six arms were
holding onto six long black whips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, although
your swordplay is indeed formidable, I perfectly counter you. You
will definitely lose.” Youngflame Zhan’s voice echoed forth from
his chest as his six arms struck out. The six long black whips began
to dance, each one contorting and twisting in the air like an
enormous, coiling black serpent. The whips were tipped with a series
of sharp spikes, and were also covered with runes. A powerful aura
sprang out from each of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youngflame Zhan,
once you get into close combat with me, you will definitely lose.”
Ning’s voice was also incomparably valorous and echoing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although both their
words held some degrees of truth, they were actually trying to cause
their opponent’s Dao-hearts to become unstable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At their level, if
their Dao-hearts became the slightest bit unstable, then the amount
of power they could unleash would be slightly lessened. If a strike
at a critical moment was slightly weaker…one might be defeated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was pondering to
himself. “Youngflame Zhan is an expert in using whips. Once one
whip entangles me, the other whips will come to surround me as well.
By then, I will be in serious trouble, and might even lose! Thus, I
absolutely cannot give him that chance. That means I can’t be too
straightforward and rely on brute force…in this battle, I need to
focus on agility.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Against different
opponents, different battle tactics were needed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them, who
had been speaking and sensing each others auras, suddenly began to
charge forward. The battle had instantly begun!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Waterflame Lotus
bloomed around Ning. He stood at the pistil within the center of the
lotus, within the leaves. This Waterflame Lotus was capable of
affecting the opponent’s whips…although the amount of influence
was miniscule, it was enough to be of tremendous help in this fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble! Rumble! Rumble!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three long black whips
simultaneously lashed out, unleashing crackling sounds of thunder as
they did. They were like three black Flood Dragons, containing an
incomparably dominating power! As for the other three long black
whips, they silently struck out like deadly vipers towards Ning as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning brandished his
Immortal swords while doing his best to close the gap with his foe.
The closer they were to each other, the greater his advantage was!
Whips…they needed sufficient space to unleash their power. The
closer they were in distance, the less of a threat a whip would be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crackle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light like silk.
Silken rays of sword-light flew about in midair, constantly colliding
against the whips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying, dancing
silken rays of sword-light carried an incomparable resilience. They
came out in an interconnected, unending cycle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What tremendous
strength.” From this first exchange, Youngflame Zhan immediately
sensed how terrifying Ning was. Although Ning had not chosen to fight
him head-on, and had instead chosen to rely on a sword technique that
was like water, repeatedly carrying away the strikes of the long
whip…each time the sword-light and a whip collided, a terrifying
tremor of power would be unleashed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Zhan even
felt as though his six arms were beginning to slightly grow numb!
Each time he lashed out wih his whip, they were knocked to the side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After using the
[Starseizing Hand], Ning truly did have an absolute advantage in
terms of power against him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Fivecraze of
the Black-White College, Uncle White, Little Qing, Yu Wei, Yuchi
Xiyue, and the others were all watching nervously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum was
incomparably nervous as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both Ji Ning and
Youngflame Zhan seemed to be quite cautious in their clashes. They
were both familiarizing themselves with their opponent’s
techniques, giving their foe no chances at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him, kill him!”
Patriarch Arcanum’s narrow eyes flashed with cold light as he
quietly chanted these words to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the grand
sealing formation, Youngflame Zhan’s six arms suddenly,
simultaneously changed. His arms actually became covered with many
black scales, as though he himself had transformed into serpent as
well. His arms instantly became soft and boneless. His whip strikes,
which had previously been savage and vicious…immediately became
softer and more insidious as they frantically moved forward to
encircle and bind Ning.
</P>

Chapter 27 - The Six Finalists
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youngflame Zhan has
lost for sure.” Upon seeing Youngflame Zhan execute this divinen
ability, and upon seeing how the whip grew even more insidious and
soft in its movements, the Xia Emperor couldn’t help but shake his
head and say these words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Indeed. Youngflame
Zhan lost his composure. He actually made a mistake like this!” Lu
Dongbin shook his head disdainfully. “Ji Ning has been extremely
cautious and hasn’t used any power attacks…thus, Youngflame
Zhan’s whips seemingly held the upper hand for a while. In reality,
however, Ji Ning’s attacks are the most powerful amongst the top
twelve! Just because he didn’t reveal his fangs doesn’t mean that
he isn’t powerful; rather, he was just being cautious against
whip-type weapons. Who would’ve thought that Youngflame Zhan,
frantic to achieve victory, would have immediately used this divine
ability as soon as he held the upper hand. He wants to use the whips
to try and entangle and bind Ji Ning…but in reality, he’s doomed
himself!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pure Yang True
Immortals had exceptional judgment. They saw right away, as soon as
Youngflame Zhan executed this unnamed divine technique, that the
divine technique was meant to make one’s arms soft and boneless, so
as to allow the movements of the whips to become even more insidious
and softer as well. However, this caused the strength of the attacks
to actually drop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this battle between
Ning and Youngflame Zhan, Youngflame Zhan was already at an absolute
disadvantage in terms of strength! And now, he was being so
hot-headed as to execute this divine technique and further lower his
own strength…wasn’t this the same as dooming himself?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had started off
quite cautious, and his six Immortal swords flowed like water in an
airtight defense. Youngflame Zhan, upon seeing this, had immediately
used a divine ability to make his arms soft and boneless, making his
whip movements even more softer and insidious as well. He thought to
himself, “Although my strength will lessen slightly, the movements
of my whips will become even more unfathomable and insidious. So long
as I can tie him down, I’ll definitely win.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Zhan had
gone completely berserk; in the face of this opportunity to become
the disciple of a Daofather, even someone as cold and calm as him had
grown hot-headed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning was
surprised and speechless. “I haven’t even started fighting at
full power; I’ve just been carefully guarding. I wasn’t trying to
seize an advantage, just working to ensure I didn’t suffer a loss.
This would allow me to get a clear look at the secrets of his whip
techniques. Why has this Youngflame Zhan suddenly lowered his own
strength?” Upon discovering the changes in Youngflame Zhan’s
whips, Ning felt surprised and perplexed. “He’s dooming himself!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning trained in the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His divine ability was
the [Starseizing Hand]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of raw
strength, he had an absolute advantage! He was just being very
careful and cautious, but his opponent actually lowered his own
strength in a frantic rush towards victory…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s delivering a
present to my door.” Ji Ning suddenly exploded with power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six brilliant streaks
of sword-light flashed through the air, each one incredibly
dominating and savage! The power of the [Starseizing Hand] and his
Fiendgod-like body simultaneously exploded forth!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black whip was
blasted away as soon as Ning’s sword-light brushed past it. The
difference in power between the two was simply too great, causing the
whips to be blasted away. Although Youngflame Zhan managed to keep
his grip on it, the skin between his thumb and forefinger had split
apart and blood was leaking out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six streaks of
sword-light, carrying extraordinary savagery and ruthlessness, swept,
chopped, and slammed against the whips, blasting all of them apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning instantly
charged right next to Youngflame Zhan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Zhan was
tremendously shocked. His face instantly turned ashen as he realized
that he had acted too impetuously and rashly. He had completely
underestimated Ji Ning. Previously, he had watched Ji Ning’s other
battles, but only now did he realize how savage and powerful Ji
Ning’s attacks actually were. At the very beginning, when his hands
were turning slightly numb from the colliding blows, Ning had
actually been fighting very carefully and conservatively; he hadn’t
exploded forth with full power at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He now knew how utterly
terrifying Ning was when fighting him head-on. Unfortunately, it was
too late. Ning had already reached him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I admit defeat!”
Youngflame Zhan’s face was ashen as he called out these words
loudly. His six arms brandished his whips as well as he frantically
tried to create a wall of whips in front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Slash! Ning’s
six rays of sword-light streaked out before Youngflame Zhan’s voice
actually rang out. As soon as he spoke out, Ning immediately came to
a halt. This was in accordance with the rules of the duel. Anyone who
dared violate them would be killed by the Grand Xia Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even though Ning had
halted, Youngflame Zhan’s body had already been chopped into
several sections. His body quickly began to pull together and
reconnect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I lost.”
Youngflame Zhan rose to his feet, a look of self-mocking in his eyes.
“I, Youngflame Zhan, have always felt myself to be an extremely
cold and calm person. I didn’t imagine…that this time, I was
defeated because I wasn’t calm enough. The allure of becoming a
disciple of a Daofather combined with your ability, Ji Ning…they
put me under too much pressure. I wanted to win too badly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning also felt that
this battle had been too easily won.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his previous battle
against Saberslave, he had to go all out in order to win. This battle
against Youngflame Zhan, however, he had won easily. He had actually
been fighting very carefully and conservatively, for fear of the
unpredictable movements of the whip.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, amongst the
top twelve, all of the Pure Yang Immortals including the Xia Emperor
and Lu Dongbin felt the most favor towards the Sloppy Daoist, Ji
Ning, Xiamang Zishan, Adept Blackstone, Adept Woodpass, Cangwu Jiu,
and Adept Goldcrow. As for Youngflame Zhan…they actually didn’t
hold in much favor. Still, any of the top twelve, no matter how weak,
shouldn’t have been defeated so calamitously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he hadn’t been in
a rush to win, and had instead moved to make the blows of his whips
more powerful, so as to counter his disadvantage in strength…Ning
probably would’ve had to first understand and familiarize himself
against the whip technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Useless thing!”
Patriarch Arcanum gave Youngflame Zhan a glance, his gaze filled with
nothing but ice. “You knew that his attacks were powerful, but
still lowered your own strength…you are utterly useless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Zhan sat
down in the lotus position silently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Arcanum felt
like his belly was filled with fire…but he had forgotten that all
the things he had told Youngflame Zhan earlier had actually also
contributed to Youngflame Zhan being insufficiently calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Calm…even in the
face of a tremendous stroke of fortune, one still must be calm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This was a
tremendous fall for me. Patriarch Arcanum even cursed me as
‘useless’. I imagine that upon my return to the clan, the other
high-level clan members will also be filled with endless rage.”
Youngflame Zhan came to a decision. “Since I would have to endure
the mockery and insults of others within the clan…after this
Conclave concludes, I shall leave the clan and go adventuring.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had always been an
extremely calm person. This rare case of hotheadedness had caused him
to lose his chance. This was a tremendous loss to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But one learns wisdom
from each setback. He became even calmer as he coolly reflected on
the path he should take in the future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor had
originally viewed seven favorably. He had been forced to decide on
having the Sloppy Daoist and Adept Ninedeaths fight, but then Cangwu
Jiu had unexpectedly made a breakthrough. The number of people the
Xia Emperor viewed favorably had suddenly risen to eight as a result.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the eight, the
Sloppy Daoist and Adept Ninedeaths had already fought. But what
should his next arrangements be?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the fourth duel,
Adept Woodpass battled Adept Primalback! Adept Woodpass was like a
human-shaped tree; he was too sturdy and resilient, seemingly even
tougher to deal with than the Sloppy Daoist. He, too, was a
terrifying foe that was extremely, extremely good on defense. He
forced Adept Primalback to use up all of his divine power…and in
the end, forced him to admit defeat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the fifth duel,
Adept Blackstone battled Adept Unicosmo! The bald, bare-footed youth,
Adept Blackstone, was indeed extremely powerful. He executed the Fuxi
Staff Formation, then relied on it to launch sudden attacks and then
vanish. Adept Unicosmo was thoroughly abused until he was finally
forced to admit defeat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the sixth duel,
Xiamang Zishan battled Adept Goldcrow!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most vicious,
bloody battle was the sixth duel; that between Xiamang Zishan and
Adept Goldcrow! Both of them were viewed favorably by the Pure Yang
True Immortals. Per the Xia Emperor’s original plans, Xiamang
Zishan was going to fight Adept Whitedragon, while Adept Goldcrow was
going to fight Cangwu Jiu. But Cangwu Jiu’s sudden breakthrough had
transformed him into an extremely formidable figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was nothing for
it. The second duel had become Cangwu Jiu against Adept Whitedragon.
The sixth one had thus become Xiamang Zishan against Adept Goldcrow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That Adept Goldcrow
is truly formidable; he will be a test for Zishan. If he cannot even
defeat Adept Goldcrow, how can he possibly become Master’s
disciple?” The Xia Emperor was quite harsh in dealing with with the
disciples of his clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And thus, this battle
was an exceptionally violent one!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiamang Zishan was even
more powerful than he had been when battling Ji Ning; his staff
techniques were now even more overbearing and dominating than before.
As for Adept Goldcrow, his speed and agility were second only to
Cangwu Jiu, while his attacks were even more savage vicious and
savage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two battled until
their blood flowed like rivers. It was an incomparably savage sight.
In the end, because Adept Goldcrow had been badly injured and had
used up almost all of his divine power, he had been forced to admit
defeat!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this battle…Xiamang
Zishan had won!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, the six
finalists of this Conclavef of Immortal Destiny had finally emerged
from the crucible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were the Sloppy
Daoist, Cangwu Jiu, Ji Ning, Adept Woodpass, Adept Blackstone, and
Xiamang Zishan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two of the top six
are actually of the Black-White College of Stillwater Commandery.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But but but…what
sort of a place is this Black-White College? Two of these six
peerless monsters are actually from them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hear that the
Black-White College is merely a school within Stillwater City that
takes up a very small amount of land. They have a total of just a few
hundred disciples.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! They only
have a few hundred?! Our school has nearly a million, and is one of
the most supreme, large schools of the entire Grand Xia Dynasty, but
we didn’t even make it into the top ninety-six. But they actually
have two in the top six?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the top six
finalists, two came from major clans; Xiamang Zishan and Cangwu Jiu.
Two were unaffiliated wanderers; Adept Blackstone and Adept Woodpass.
Two came from a school…and they both actually came from the same
school, the Black-White College; Ji Ning and the Sloppy Daoist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha, ahahaha…”
Immortal Fivecraze was laughing so hard his jaw was turning crooked.
He was utterly beside himself with delight. “Haha, I didn’t
expect that an old alcoholic like myself would actually be showered
with such glory before dying. Even if I die right now, it would be
worth it. Ji Ning, little Sloppy, well done, well done, ahahaha! If
that little girl Yu Wei had also entered the top six, things would be
even better!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch, you want
senior apprentice-sister Yu Wei to make the top six as well? This…is
a bit too ambitious, isn’t it?” Upon hearing this, the nearby Mu
Northson’s eyes couldn’t help but twitch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You think this is
ambitious? Nope…in fact, I’m still hoping for little Sloppy and
Ji Ning to both make it into the top three. That would be even
better. Ahahaha! Two of the top three finalists of this entire
Conclave of the Grand Xia Dynasty both belonging to the Black-White
College…I’d wake myself up laughing whenever I fell asleep. When
I die and go to the Netherworld Kingdom, I’d be able to brag a bit
with the Judges of the Dead.” Immortal Fivecraze was indeed
absolutely overjoyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial citadel
plaza was incomparably lively right now, but the atmosphere in the
main hall of the Skylight Palace was rather stifled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because the
top six had been determined! Next would come the top three! One of
the top three would definitely become the disciple of a Daofather.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Top three…”
Xiamang Zishan’s gaze was crackling with hidden thunder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Top three…”
Cangwu Jiu was seated, head lowered. He murmured these words to
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, the Sloppy
Daoist, Adept Woodpass, Adept Blackstone…they were all silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, they weren’t
even talking to the people nearby them. An invisible pressure had
completely surrounded the six of them. With one more fight, it would
be determined whether or not they would make it into the top three.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six people. Three
duels. Three eliminations. Three victors!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Who would be
eliminated? Who would remain?

Chapter 28 - The Sloppy Daoist Battles Adept Woodpass
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor sat
above all others atop his throne. Staring downwards, he said calmly,
“This is the most crucial point of this Conclave of Immortal
Destiny. Xiamang Zishan. Cangwu Jiu. Ji Ning. Sloppy Daoist. Adept
Woodpass. Adept Blackstone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the other six
all looked towards the Xia Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This next round will
determine which three of you six will have the chance to be chosen by
Master as a disciple.” The Xia Emperor’s voice was calm, but his
gaze swept past Ning and the other of the six. He knew very well that
if the Grand Xia Dynasty’s world was to produce a peerless hero in
this upcoming period of upheaval for the Three Realms, it would most
likely be one of the six! In addition, it was guaranteed that one
would be taken on by Daofather Crimsonbright as a disciple, while a
second one was already a disciple of Grand Emperor Xuanwu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First, spend two
hours calming your minds. After two hours, the final, crucial battles
shall begin,” the Xia Emperor said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the rest of
the six were instantly stunned. Calming their minds for two hours?
The pressure of making it into the top three had already made it hard
for them to even breath. They were all prepared to start beginning
their one-on-one duels…but who would have imagined that the Xia
Emperor would instruct them to spend two hours calming their minds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After two hours, the
duels shall begin. These duels shall be the fulcrum on which your
destinies shall turn,” the Xia Emperor said calmly, then fell
silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang, you are
quite the tormenter,” Lu Dongbin said with a smirk. “As the
saying goes, death isn’t frightening; the terror you feel right
before dying is what is frightening. If they were to compete right
away, that’d be one thing, but you insisted on delaying for two
hours…during these two hours, the invisible pressure they are
feeling will most lkely torment all of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can a chance to
become a Daofather’s disciple be so easily given?” The Xia
Emperor said calmly, “The nine of us all encountered countless
life-and-death tribulations before making it to our present levels.
They, however, are merely Wanxiang Adepts. They must be tempered a
bit, and the invisible pressure created by this chance of becoming a
Daofather’s disciple is an excellent form of tempering.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, which one
amongst the six do you think the Daofather will choose?” The
Immortal Elder of the Northlands said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Sloppy Daoist
won’t have any problems entering the top six, but he is already the
disciple of Grand Emperor Xuanwu. There’s no way the Daofather will
choose him. Mm…it might be Xiamang Zishan. Xiamang Zishan’s
dominating aura is bone-deep, and he is most likely being assisted by
the karmic luck that surrounds the Xiamang clan. As long as he can
become the Daofather’s disciple, his future potential will be
limitless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I favor that bald,
bare-foot youth. I keep on feeling as though I can sense the shadow
of the Shennong clan on him.” 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The human race was the
most powerful of the countless races of the Three Realms. In the
Primordial World which Pangu had established after creating the
universe, after Maiden Nuwa created humanity, the human race began to
flourish nonstop. They learned, they grew powerful, and they began to
embark upon the Immortal path…and so even as far back as the era of
the Primordial World, mankind had already given birth to countless
supreme powers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Emperor of Mankind,
the Divine Farmer Shennong, was one of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mahāsthāmaprāpta,
is something wrong with your head? That bald, bare-foot lad uses the
Fuxi Staff Formation; if anything, he arguably has a connection to
the Fuxi clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I favor Ji Ning.
This Ji Ning has trained for just thirty years, but he’s already
such a monster; his talent is limitless. Perhaps the Daofather shall
choose Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I think Adept
Woodpass is not bad.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I favor Cangwu Jiu.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor and the
rest of the nine Pure Yang True Immortals each had their own
favorites amongst the top six, aside from the Sloppy Daoist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Yu Wei, Yuchi
Xiyue, and the Sloppy Daoist were currently seated together. Yu Wei
and Yuchi Xiyue looked at each other, not daring to say a word. As
for Ning and the Sloppy Daoist, they were silent as they meditated
calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yu Wei, the two of
them are…” Yuchi Xiyue sent a worried mental message.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry about
them. Although both their Dao-hearts are formidable, the allure of
becoming a Daofather’s disciple is simply far, far too great. In
addition, this is the final, critical battle. It’s good for them to
sit quietly for a time and temper their Dao-hearts,” Yu Wei said.
Her training experience was, comparatively speaking, much greater;
after all, she had her memories from her past life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning also had
memories from his past life, not only was his past life a short one,
he had also been an ordinary mortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on. In the
blink of an eye, two hours passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fourth round.
The most important round.” The Xia Emperor’s voice suddenly rang
out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Swish! Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, the Sloppy
Daoist, Xiamang Zishan, Adept Blackstone, Cangwu Jiu, and Adept
Woodpass; their gazes turned scorchingly hot as they simultaneously
turned to look towards the Xia Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After careful
consideration, the six of you shall fight these three battles.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the first battle,
the Sloppy Daoist shall fight Adept Woodpass.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the second
battle, Adept Blackstone shall fight Cangwu Jiu.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the third battle,
Ji Ning shall fight Xiamang Zishan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice was deep and
resonating. It echoed throughout the hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the rest of
the six instantly turned their gazes towards their respective
opponents.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist and
Adept Woodpass both appeared to be simple, honest, good-natured
individuals…and yet these two good-natured individuals had both
battled their way into the top six. Only one of the two could enter
the top three. Their gazes turned towards each other…but both were
very calm. However, behind the calmness, an unshakable resolve could
be seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Blackstone and
Cangwu Jiu were both unconventional. The bald Adept Blackstone always
walked around barefoot, leaning on his staff. Cangwu Jiu, in turn,
always appeared to be like a hawk, his gaze predatory and devouring.
The two gave each other a glance, and their eyes both seemed to spark
with fire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Xiamang
Zishan were the two most ferocious individuals of the six. Xiamang
Zishan’s domineering, tyrannical temperament was bone-deep, and his
staff techniques were similarly overbearing. Ji Ning, in turn, was
the number one Sword Immortal of this Conclave; although he looked
like a handsome, delicate youth, in terms of strength, he was the
strongest of them all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Good-natured against
good-natured.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unconventional against
unconventional.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Savage against savage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first battle.
Sloppy Daoist, Adept Woodpass, the two of you can go to the grand
sealing formation. You can begin now,” the Xia Emperor instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The Sloppy
Daoist and Adept Woodpass both responded with respect, them
immediately both moved towards the outside of the hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang, your
arrangements truly are like pitting the point of the nail against the
tip of the needle.” Lu Dongbin shook his head. “Not even I would
dare guess as to which of them shall become the top three. I can’t
tell, I truly can’t tell.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s precisely
because we can’t tell that makes this intriguing.” Although the
Xia Emperor was chatting with Lu Dongbin, his gaze was focused on the
grand sealing formation outside the palace. He had to pay extremely
close attention to each of these three battles…after all, watching
with his own eyes was completely different from watching using a
water scryinig technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Water scrying
techniques only transmitted images. Watching with his own eyes,
however, allowed him to sense the ripples of the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, which of
the two will win?” Yuchi Xiyue was extremely nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t know.”
Ning shook his head, then gave a sideways glance towards the nearby
Xiamang Zishan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiamang Zishan seemed
to feel his gaze, as he turned to look back at Ning as well. Their
gazes met…and then both turned away to look towards the battle
outside that had just begun.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist and
Adept Woodpass; one of them would make it into the top three.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Who would it be?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the grand
sealing formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist and
Adept Woodpass were staring at each other from far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are the most
powerful foe I have encountered so far in this Conclave.” Adept
Woodpass normally looked quite amiable, but right now his eyes were
as sharp as knives. He said seriously, “I watched you defeat Adept
Ninedeaths, but…you will be defeated by me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh. Just saying the
words is nothing; if you have any formidable techniques, bring them
out,” the Sloppy Daoist said with a chortle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two simultaneously
transformed into towering giants, each with three heads and six arms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each of the six arms of
Adept Woodpass clutched a giant hammer, while the Sloppy Daoist
remained barehanded. However, with the Grand Black Tortoise divine
ability, he truly didn’t need any weapons at all. Actually, Ning
didn’t need to use any weapons either; his [Starseizing Hand] made
his hands comparable to Immortal-ranked magic treasures, after all.
But the implications of the [Starseizing Hand] were simply too great;
Ning didn’t dare to casually reveal this technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he revealed it in
front of Daofather Crimsonbright, that was one thing, but the
Conclave of Immortal Destiny had too many eyes and ears present. Once
he revealed the technique, news would surely spread like wildfire,
and most likely many individuals within the Three Realms would learn
of it. Perhaps some of the major powers who held grudges against
Daoist Threelives would decide to wipe out Ning, the successor to
Daoist Threelives’ legacy!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t dare to
make this gamble. Thus, he had never used his bare hands to block
magic treasures, even though his hands were even more powerful than
the Darknorth swords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Growl…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous
Turtle-Snake had appeared. It was even letting out a slight growl.
The Sloppy Daoist, in the very center of the Turtle-Snake, came
crushing downwards towards Adept Woodpass with an absolutely
dominating air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is my world…”
Adept Woodpass narrowed his eyes, a look of intoxication appearing on
his face. Instantly, fruit tree saplings began to appear and grow
throughout the sealed region. The saplings quickly grew into towering
trees which died, transformed into ash, then gave birth to new
saplings. Countless saplings were growing, and the three-headed,
six-armed Adept Woodpass was himself like a human-shaped tree, with
his six arms like tree branches and the giant warhammers in his hands
like fruit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG! The Sloppy
Daoist’s attack had arrived. His fist smashed down like thunder,
crushing downwards. Adept Woodpass, in turn, waved a great warhammer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The warhammer met
the fist. Adept Woodpass just took one heavy step back after another,
deflecting the force of the collision. He continued to look like a
human-shaped tree as he brandished about those six giant warhammers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I couldn’t break
through?” The Sloppy Daoist was surprised. “He truly is a
peerless genius who was famous even as far back as three cenuturies
ago who insisted on stifling himself for three hundred years as he
waited for this day.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist’s
attack form c hanged. He immediately executed the ‘Wavefolding’
secret art, and his attacks began to seem to turn into the waves of
the sea, each wave more savage than the last as power continuously
accumulated! Even Adept Woodpass, legendary for his defense, was
finding it increasingly difficult to handle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For trees to grow,
they need water!” Adept Woodpass’ face changed slightly as he
suddenly spoke out in a gravelly voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The trees that had
sprung up within the sealed region began to be surrounded with a
large amount of water. The vast amount of water swirled around the
trees…and the feeling which Adept Woodpass gave off changed. He
previously seemed like a man-shaped tree, but now he seemed more
agile, with perfect dexterity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two Grand Daos?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually has
embarked on two Grand Daos?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin, the Xia
Emperor, and the rest of the Pure Yang True Immortals were instantly
shocked. During the previous duels as well as when he was within the
Brightmoon Diagram of the Mountains and Rivers, Adept Woodpass had
always used the Grand Dao of Verdant Wood. This Grand Dao of the
Watersource, Adept Woodpass had never before revealed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Dao of the
Verdant Wood. The Grand Dao of the Watersource. These were two Grand
Daos that reinforced and supported each other. For a Wanxiang Adept
to simultaneously train in two Grand Daos to such an extremely high
level, at very least at the Grand Dao Domain level…in this entire
Conclave, only Adept Woodpass had accomplished such a thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This seemingly amiable
and honest Adept Woodpass had never before revealed this, and upon
doing so, he shocked everyone.

Chapter 29 - Ji Ning Enters the Fray
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s hard to say
who will win and who will lose.” Watching the battle, Lu Dongbin
said softly, “The two of them really are similar…their battle
styles are both majestic, using absolute power to crush their foes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The Xia
Emperor and the others nodded as well. Adept Woodpass and the Sloppy
Daoist were indeed quite similar. And both were extremely skilled at
defense!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for attacking? The
Sloppy Daoist had always used his bare hands, while Adept Woodpass
used six large warhammers. But in reality, those six large warhammers
were just bigger fists! Since Adept Woodpass didn’t have the Grand
Black Tortoise divine ability, he naturally didn’t dare to actually
use his bare hands to fight. The Sloppy Daoist’s fists were
definitely no weaker than the large warhammers in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang! Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two were clashing
head on. The Sloppy Daoist was like a wave that was growing
increasingly savage and powerful. Adept Woodpass, in turn, seemed
incredibly resilient. His six arms swung about those six giant
warhammers, counterattacking again and again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Warhammers and fists.
Boom, boom, boom! They slammed against each other repeatedly!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They really are
similar.” Ji Ning, seated behind King Yan, couldn’t help but
mumble to himself, “Eldest apprentice-brother and Adept Woodpass
are both so majestic in their attacks…and the more majestic their
attacks, the harder it is to defend against them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of them had
extremely strong defenses and would fight opponents head on! Other
peerless geniuses, when encountering them, would most likely use up
all of their divine power and then be forced to admit defeat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eldest
apprentice-brother seems like a black tortoise divine beast.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept Woodpass seems
like a mobile, man-shaped tree.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as Ning and the
others were watching and pondering, suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist,
whose aura had been growing increasingly wild and explosive, suddenly
came to a halt. The folding waves of attacks came to a halt as well.
Adept Woodpass immediately noticed this weakening, and with a grand
hammer blow, he directly caved in the Sloppy Daoist’s chest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! This hammer blow
was incomparably heavy, and cracks appeared on the turtle shell runes
on the Sloppy Daoist’s body as he spat out a mouthful of blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM BOOM BOOM! Adept
Woodpass struck out repeatedly with his great hammer, showing no
mercy at all in seizing the advantage. The Sloppy Daoist was smashed
by multiple hammers in virtually the same instant. Heavily wounded,
he struggled to defend while calling out: “I admit defeat!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Adept Woodpass
immediately retreated, the giant hammers in his hands disappearing as
he returned to a normal size.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist
returned to a normal size as well. He looked at Adept Woodpass with a
hint of resignation. “I lost…but I’m convinced by my defeat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your attacks clearly
had me at a disadvantage. Why did you suddenly stop?” Adept
Woodpass asked, puzzled, “Your earlier attacks were becoming
increasingly berserk…if that continued, I probably would’ve
lost.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If the ‘wavefolding’
secret art can continue to explosively increase in power into
perpetuity, wouldn’t that make me invincible?” The Sloppy Daoist
shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Woodpass now
understood. Right. If the power of this wavefolding technique could
increase without end…how crazy would that be?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The length of time I
sustained in using this secret art today…it is already the longest
I have ever used it in all these years.” The Sloppy Daoist shook
his head and laughed. “But no matter what, this Conclave has proven
to be a tremendous tempering experience to me, and my wavefolding
abilities have increased dramatically as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Woodpass
instantly began to feel admiration for the Sloppy Daoist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The top three…they
had a chance of becoming a Daofather’s disciple. Losing such a
supreme chance was something that would definitely cause a major
mental setback towards one’s self-confidence. And yet, this Sloppy
Daoist was actually able to recover from it almost instantly; he was
even able to laugh. This sort of Dao-heart alone was already enough
for Adept Woodpass to feel endless admiration.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, when they
fought earlier, Adept Woodpass also noticed that both their
personalities and their paths were quite similar!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The path of Immortal
cultivation was an incomparably difficult one. Upon finding a
powerful figure that was very similar to one’s self…they were
practically bosom friends now. Adept Woodpass felt tremendous
affection and admiration for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
fellow Daoist Woodpass,” the Sloppy Daoist said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This duel with you,
fellow Daoist Sloppy, was a truly joyful one for me. It is rare for a
person to encounter a bosom friend on the Immortal path, but you,
fellow Daoist Sloppy, feel like a bosom friend to me…if you are
free, you must come to the South Seas. When I’m free, I’ll
definitely visit the Black-White College of Stillwater Commandery,”
Adept Woodpass said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Definitely.” The
Sloppy Daoist nodded as well. Over the course of this battle, he had
also come to feel very positively towards Adept Woodpass.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were some people
who had never met before in the past, but upon meeting a single time
would become bosom friends with each other! The Sloppy Daoist and
Adept Woodpass were two such people…their Dao-hearts, their
beliefs, and their ideas were all very similar. It was rare to
encounter such a similar bosom-friend!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor, Lu
Dongbin, and the rest of the Pure Yang True Immortals all nodded
silently. When Adept Woodpass had suddenly demonstrated yet another
Grand Dao, they had all come to believe that the results of this
battle had become hard to predict.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Woodpass winning
was reasonable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wavefolding has a
limit…upon reaching it, it will collapse and become
uncontrollable.” Lu Dongbin nodded. “This is true even when Grand
Emperor Xuanwu personally uses the technique. Although it might not
actually collapse, upon reaching the limit, there will be no way to
increase the power of the wavefolding any further. For this Sloppy
Daoist to be able to use this technique for so long is already quite
rare.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Adept Woodpass
is a rare talent as well. He was actually able to defeat the disciple
of Grand Emperor Xuanwu,” Mahasthamaprapta said. His gaze was
focused on Adept Woodpass; clearly, he felt quite positively about
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For the Sloppy
Daoist to be defeated makes sense,” the Xia Emperor said. “This
Sloppy Daoist, when entering the Black-White College of Stillwater
Commandery, was a fairly ordinary disciple in the sect. However, he
grew increasingly formidable; in training, he’s one of those that
becomes increasingly brilliant as time goes on. His late-blooming
potential is tremendous. In terms of amount of time spent training,
the Sloppy Daoist has trained for much less time than Adept Woodpass
has. For him to lose by a stroke isn’t strange. I imagine…that if
we were to give them another century, most likely the Sloppy Daoist
would be able to defeat Adept Woodpass.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tremendous
late-blooming potential.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were far too many
‘geniuses’ in the Three Realms that were exceptionally brilliant
early bloomers. Much rarer were those who were not only dazzling in
the early stages, but were also able to train all the way through the
Primal and Void levels, or even all the way up to the Celestial
Immortal and True Immortal levels! Those who grew more formidable as
more time passed…these late-bloomers were the true, unpolished
jade. After being ‘sculpted’ properly, they would become even
more dazzling. Clearly, the Sloppy Daoist was one such person.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he was young, he
was very unremarkable. Afterwards, he entered the Black-White College
but was still just an ordinary disciple. After even more time passed,
he became the number one figure amongst the Black-White College’s
third generation disciples. And now, he was so incredibly dazzling in
this Conclave for the entire major world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sort of rise…was
quite terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And more
importantly…his heart!” Lu Dongbin sighed. “I can tell that
this Sloppy Daoist doesn’t actually know that Grand Emperor Xuanwu
has taken note of him; he’s been working hard this entire time in
the hopes of making it into the top three and apprenticing himself to
Daofather Crimsonbright. But just now, after losing that battle…he
should have felt a tremendous psychological blow. And yet, he was
able to almost instantly grow calm again, and he was even able to
laugh. A heart like his…incredible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” They all
nodded. The more these Pure Yang True Immortals watched the Sloppy
Daoist, the more strengths they discovered. No wonder Grand Emperor
Xuanwu accepted him as a disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this first battle to
determine the top three…the Sloppy Daoist had been eliminated!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This caused the members
of the Black-White College, such as Immortal Fivecraze, Mu Northson,
and Adept Vastriver to all feel tremendous regret. Ning shook his
head and sighed as well. There was nothing to be done; there was
nothing that could be said regarding this loss. These two fought each
other in a completely head-on manner…and in the end, the Sloppy
Daoist had lost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second battle had
begun!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Blackstone
against Cangwu Jiu!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sloppy.” Yuchi
Xiyue began to chat with the Sloppy Daoist. “You have good
judgment. Can you tell who is going to win in this fight between
Adept Blackstone and Cangwu Jiu?” The two had already begun
battling within the grand sealing formation outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me watch for a
bit first.” The Sloppy Daoist watched in a seemingly casual manner,
but his eyes were very intent. After watching for just a brief
moment, he gently nodded. “Adept Blackstone has a major advantage.
He has a higher chance of winning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Yuchi Xiyue
was puzzled. “But that Cangwu Jiu seems to be quite formidable, and
he’s also astonishingly fast. Why do you think Adept Blackstone has
a better chance of winning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuchi Xiyue actually
wanted to ask Ning his opinion as well. But this was the second duel;
the third would be Ning’s. She naturally didn’t want to disturb
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist
laughed, “Adept Blackstone is skilled in the Fuxi Staff Formation.
Through his usage of the formation…he has actually made it so that
Cangwu Jiu is already unable to use his speed to its full potential.
Adept Blackstone can just hide inside the formation, and there’s no
way Cangwu Jiu can even find him. Adept Blackstone has complete
control over the tempo of this entire duel. He can attack when he
wants to and flee when he wants to!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Based on what you
are saying, by relying on his formation, Adept Blackstone is now
invincible?” Yuchi Xiyue was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” The Sloppy
Daoist shook his head. “This sort of duel has to come to a
conclusion. Although Cangwu Jiu is trapped within the formation, if
Adept Blackstone doesn’t actually attack, Cangwu Jiu can just relax
and wait within the formation. He wouldn’t need to use up any
divine power at all, but Adept Blackstone needs to maintain that
powerful formation. It definitely is consuming a large amount of
elemental ki. And, as time passes, I imagine that the Xia Emperor
will also order Adept Blackstone to attack. Otherwise, who knows how
long this would drag out to?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuchi Xiyue nodded
gently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus, in the end, it
is still Adept Blackstone’s close combat ability that will
determine victory or defeat! But of course, he still benefits from
the advantages of his formation. And, based on what I saw from their
close combat previously, Adept Blackstone is definitely no weaker
than Cangwu Jiu in close combat!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Comparable power in
close combat, but with Adept Blackstone having the advantage of a
formation, and Cangwu Jiu being unable to fully utilize his speed…in
this battle, Cangwu Jiu is completely countered. He should lose.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as the Sloppy
Daoist’s words were concluding…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the formation,
Cangwu Jiu was like a hawk that had been trapped within a cage. He
was injured repeatedly until finally, Adept Blackstone saw his
opportunity and seized it, suddenly delivering a heavy wound to
Cangwu Jiu. Cangwu Jiu was unwillingly forced to call out, “I admit
defeat!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, the second of
the three had been chosen…Adept Blackstone!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang, are you
trying to prevent this Cangwu Jiu from entering the top three? It
wouldn’t have been so bad if he had encountered Ji Ning, Xiamang
Zishan, the Sloppy Daoist, or even Adept Woodpass; he would’ve been
able to make full use of his speed and agility. He’s at the
greatest disadvantage when fighting against Adept Blackstone, a
master of the Fuxi Staff Formation,” Lu Dongbin said with a smirk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ambitions of the
Cangwu clan are a bit too grand,” the Xia Emperor said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was suppressing them
by doing this! The other major clans all had extremely deep roots of
power; if given a chance, they would be able to soar into the skies!
And so, he let Ji Ning fight Youngflame Zhan while having Adept
Blackstone fight Cangwu Jiu. In truth, this was his scheme to
suppress them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ji Ning, Adept
Woodpass, and the others, they didn’t come from major clans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third duel was now
beginning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, be
careful.” Yu Wei held Ning’s hand and spoke gently to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded lightly,
then rose and began to walk towards the grand sealing formation
outside the hall!
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 30 - Desiring to Accept a Disciple
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Xiamang
Zishan both walked towards the outside of the main hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the main hall of
the Skylight Palace. The nine Pure Yang True Immortals and nearly one
thousand Celestial Immortals were all gazing towards these two young
men. Two of the top three had been determined; Adept Woodpass and
Adept Blackstone. Now, only the last one remained…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Which of them will
win?” Lu Dongbin said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor and the
others were all silent. Only after a long moment did Truelord Chiji
say slowly, “Their power is comparable, and both are extremely
skilled in close combat. The end of this battle will most likely come
when one side runs out of divine power and admits defeat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Lu Dongbin
nodded gently as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Zishan has a better
chance,” the Xia Emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei looked quietly
at Ning. She knew very well that Ning wanted to seize this chance to
become a Daofather’s apprentice and thus soar into the heavens. She
was eager for his success…but she hoped even more that Ning would
be safe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, be
careful.” Yu Wei watched him nervously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One last step before
entering the top three.” Ninelotus was seated behind the Dongyan
Forefather. In this moment, she was quietly hoping to herself, “Ji
Ning, I hope you succeed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they had
broken up, in her heart, Ji Ning would forever be a peerless genius.
She didn’t want to see him discouraged and defeated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Little
Qing raised her head, staring at the massive curtain of water and the
scene within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son…” The
Whitewater Hound was even more restless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, you have to win!” Mu Northson called out in a
high voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the clouds, within
the grand sealing formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Xiaman Zishan
stared at each other from afar. Both of them just stood there with
seeming tranquility. However, underneath the tranquility, there was a
savage self-confidence…they had to win! Both of them felt
incomparable desire for entering the top three, but to do so, they
had to defeat the opponent before them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of them was a young
man dressed in violet; the other was a youth dressed in furs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their auras were
completely different. The violet-robed young man was born with a
dominating aura, as well as an air of nobility that came from being
born into an imperial clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By contrast, due to Ji
Ning’s sufferings in his former life as well as this life, Ning
looked like just an ordinary, bumpkin-like youth…but due to having
come from a world of peace, he showed neither subservience nor
arrogance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We meet again.”
Xiamang Zishan’s voice boomed out heroically. “Last time, you
were defeated by me. This time, you will be defeated again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have only trained
for a bit more than thirty years,” Ning said calmly. “It has only
been ten or so years since I became a Zifu Disciple…and during
these ten years, I’ve reached my current level. That year of
nonstop battling in the world of the Diagram was definitely
equivalent to ten years of hard training in the outside world. The
battle between us was more than half a year ago…and during that
half a year, my power has vastly surpassed your imagination.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiamang Zishan’s
pupils shrank. Indeed. Ji Ning’s short period of training truly did
cause astonishment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You improved during
the past half year. So did I.” Xiamang Zishan’s natural, inborn
aura of arrogance caused him to release an angered laugh. “If you
have any techniques to show, go ahead and show them. Otherwise…when
you are defeated, you won’t be thoroughly convinced.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come.” Ning looked
calmly towards Xiamang Zishan. This sort of calmness…masked an even
more berserk desire for battle!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiamang Zishan’s body
instantly flickered as he transformed into a 60-meter tall giant that
had three heads and six arms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With regards to the
[Heavenly Transformation], it was true that Ning had spent several
fewer centuries training in this technique compared to Xiamang
Zishan. However, unlike other divine abilities such as the [Myriad
Hibernating Venoms], the amount of power the early stages of the
[Heavenly Transformation] granted significantly weaker. In the early
stages, other divine abilities were better than the [Heavenly
Transformation].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the latter
stages of [Heavenly Transformation], especially during the Empyrean
God stage, were truly and terrifyingly formidable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for now?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning used the second
Cycle of the [Starseizing Hand]; thus, [Heavenly Transformation]
didn’t increase the power of his hands in even the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Taste my staf!”
Xiamang Zishan bellowed with incomparable savagery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three black steel
staffs simultaneously smashed through the air, carrying an invincible
aura as they slammed towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Staves were heavy
weapons. Only powerful experts with truly great strength would be
able to unleash the advantages of staves. Compared to sabers and
swords, staves were inferior in terms of agility. Compared to spears,
which were also long weapons and even had sharp tips, staves
naturally were naturally inferior in terms of piercing power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But staves had a
tremendous advantage as well. This was…in smashing as one pleased!
In the Three Realms, especially amongst Empyrean Gods who were famed
for their strength, there were very many people who used staves! The
power of a single staff blow could pierce through the heavens…and
could smash apart the earth!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These two were the same
in terms of strength, level of cultivation, and divine abilities. A
staff-wielder was naturally much more savage and overbearing than a
sword-wielder; this was due to the differences in the weapons. The
‘best’ type of weapon was the weapon that was most suited to
you…and clearly, Xiamang Zishan was best-suited for wielding
staves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The staves cleaved
through the skies, causing the world to change in color.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wielded six
Immortal swords in his hands. Although it wasn’t too suitable for
him to brashly use Immortal swords to block head-on, Ning wanted to
give it a try, given the power of his divine abilities. He blocked
the attacks head on!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three staves
thundered forth with the power of a flood!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were met by six
dazzling sword-lights!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They smashed directly
onto each other. They caused the surrounding area to tremble with the
terrifying force of the collision…and the result of this head-on
strike was that the two were actually on par with each other!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re actually on
par.” Ning was startled. “Last time, I was at an absolute
disadvantage. I’ve made repeated breakthroughs…but this Xiamang
Zishan has made some breakthroughs as well. It seems there’s no
hope of defeating him in a head-on fight. In addition, the amount of
divine power my [Starseizing Hand] uses up is quite astonishing; it
can’t be used for prolonged combat!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew exactly what
his own weakness was. Although he was very powerful in the Grand Dao
of the Sword, with regards to ‘ordinary’ Daos, he had mastered
only two Dao-Paths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiamang Zishan’s
‘Grand Dao of Lightning’ might be a bit weaker than Ning’s own
‘Grand Dao of the Sword’, but he had mastered four complete
‘normal’ Dao-Paths! In addition, after spending the past half
year constantly infusing all four Daos into his staff technique, his
staves had become increasingly powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of Ning’s
divine ability compensated for this weakness…but the power of his
divine ability resulted in a similarly astonishing rate of using
divine power. After fighting for a prolonged period of time, his
divine power would probably be exhausted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am a Sword
Immortal; why should I fight him head-on?” Ning’s swordplay began
to change. Previously, his six streaks of sword-light had flown out
in straight lines, but they now changed. Ning’s sword-light became
like an unending flow of water, constantly striking in a steady
stream towards Xiamang Zishan. Xiamang Zishan continued to do as he
normally did, releasing his staff strikes as he pleased, either
smashing down, lashing out, or suddenly sweeping forth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s swordplay was
like water, flowing without an end. Xiamang Zishan’s staff
techniques were unable to accomplish anything at all…but in turn,
Ning was unable to leave even a single wound on Xiamang Zishan’s
body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no chance
at all. It seems I’ll have to use that unfinished sword technique,”
Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword changed
once again. Of Ning’s six Immortal swords…some of them suddenly
blazed like fire, containing the fierce sharpness of the Dao of the
Sword! Others flowed like an unbroken stream of water, continuously
moving to entangle and hinder his foe! The rest fluctuated
unpredictably with tremendous speed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After, this sort of
sword technique placed a great deal of strain on Ning’s mind and
spirit upon execution.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sort of combat
technique was something Ning had thought up when he had watched the
Sloppy Daoist battle with his ‘wavefolding’ technique. The Sloppy
Daoist used four arms to defend and two arms to attack, and then
formed a ‘folding’, circular wave of power…although Ning didn’t
understand it, he had still been stimulated by the Sloppy Daoist’s
combat method.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The sword can be
used as a spear, but it doesn’t have as much penetrative power as
the spear. It can be used as a warblade, but it doesn’t have a
warblade’s savage chopping power. It can be used as a staff, but it
isn’t as heavy as a staff…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swords have two
edges; they are incomparably agile, and can be used in many different
manners of battle. After using the [Three Heads, Six Arms] divine
ability, if I were to use the six arms to fight in different
manners…perhaps they might affect each other and cause a loss of
power, but it’s also possible that just like with the Sloppy
Daoist, the power will actually join together increase.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prior to this battle,
Ning had been constantly visualizing and hypothesizing regarding this
technique in his mind. Earlier, during the previous battle, he had
been completely silent, partially because he had been spending part
of his attention in pondering the [Lesser Five Elements Sword] that
he had learned back at the Black-White College. Within the manual,
there was a combination technique that used the Five Elements. Ning
carefully reflected on these things, and had already come up with a
vague technique in his mind. In this moment, he unleashed it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light like water,
sword-light like fire, and sword-light that fluctuated unpredictably…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was
incomparably agile and graceful, occasionally advancing and
occasionally retreating. His swordplay became similarly illusory and
fluctuating as large amounts of sword-light howled everywhere.
Suddenly, all sorts of different types of sword-light appeared…it
was like a melody that was occasionally soft, occasionally bright,
sometimes flowing, and sometimes explosive…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daos of Water,
Fire, Wind, Space, and the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He infused all of his
insights into the Dao of the Sword and into his hands. Ning had a
wonderful feeling, as though many different types of sword techniques
were cooperating together and supporting each other. It was all so
natural that he didn’t even have to intentionally come up with next
sword techniques; everything came out naturally, in accordance with
this marvelous feeling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He didn’t want to
disrupt this sort of feeling; he wanted to flow with it and let it
unleash what it could!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Beautiful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So beautiful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So swordplay can
actually become this beautiful!” The nearly one thousand Celestial
Immortal Patriarchs within the main hall of the Summerlight Palace
all felt a carefree, relaxed feeling in their heart as they watched.
Ning’s three-headed, six-armed form executed various different
sword techniques. It was just like he was painting a beautiful
watercolor painting. The watercolor splashed everywhere, but it had a
beauty that moved the heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this moment, Ning’s
form was like the wind. His six Immortal swords were graceful and
agile, putting the exquisite essence of the sword on complete
display.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword was by nature
incomparably complicated. Even the most simple of sword techniques
could be divided into thirteen different basic movements, which was
far more complicated than the spear, the staff, and the saber. This
sort of complicatedness…to a true expert, it represented many
materials to work with, allowing him to produce a consummately
beautiful product. For a weakling, however, too much complicated was
actually a bad thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Genius!” Lu
Dongbin, within the main hall of the Skylight Palace, couldn’t help
but sigh in amazement. “He’s actually able to enter such a deep
state during such a crucial battle. If my judgment is correct, he is
currently in a state of no-thought, where everything simply flows
from the heart…when executing swordplay in this state, the power is
naturally going to be extraordinary. In addition, he will also firmly
memorize these extraordinary sword techniques. After this battle
ends, his insight into the Dao and into swordplay will both rise
dramatically.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He is indeed a rare
genius of the Dao of the Sword,” Bodhisattva Mahasthamaprapta
couldn’t help but say. “We Buddhists are willing to accept this
sort of genius.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He has only mastered
two ordinary Daos, but his Dao of the Sword is at such a high level
that he is absolutely the number one genius Sword Immortal of the
Conclave.” Lu Dongbin couldn’t help but say, “He was indeed
born to be a Sword Immortal. His talent in the Dao of the Sword is
absolutely inconceivable. Xiamang…if you don’t accept this Ji
Ning, can I take him on as my disciple?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eastflower, is your
heart feeling itchy?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even the Buddhists
are feeling itchy. Why can’t I?” Lu Dongbin looked back at the
Xia Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor shook
his head. “All of the top six in this Conclave must first be given
to my master and his many disciples for choosing! If no one picks Ji
Ning, then you, Lu Dongbin, can be his master. What do you say?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bullshit! Are you
telling me that you guys won’t choose a potential peerless Sword
Immortal like him?” Lu Dongbin immediately shook his head.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_31___Closed_Door"></A>
Chapter 31 - Closed Door
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor
laughed, saying nothing else. Ji Ning and the others were of the
Grand Xia Emperor’s world to begin with; thus, as the saying goes,
‘fertilizing water must not be allowed to flow into the fields of
another’. He naturally had to keep these individuals who had a
chance of becoming experts of the Three Realms on his side. How could
he release them?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You old scallywag.”
Lu Dongbin pursed his lips. “Look at how smug your smile is.
Haven’t you noticed that Ji Ning’s power is currently increasing,
and that his opponent Xiamang Zishan is at an increasing
disadvantage? This is someone of your Xiamang clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Indeed, in this
battle, Zishan is going to lose.” The Xia Emperor was extremely
calm. “I have nothing to say if he is beaten by Ji Ning. In
addition, given Zishan’s temperament…he’s too brash and wild,
making him excessively hard and brittle. Given Master’s
temperament, I imagine that he would choose Ji Ning even if both he
and Ji Ning were in the running.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This guy Xiamang…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other Pure Yang
True Immortals all shook their heads. Still…given that the Xia
Emperor had spoken out, all of them had no choice but to give up any
thoughts of acquiring Ji Ning. In truth, given how turbulent the
undercurrents were in the Three Realms right now, and how the Grand
Xia Dynasty’s major world was one that was exceptionally blessed by
karmic luck, this world did indeed have a very good chance of giving
birth to a future expert of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…not even they
fully understood how enormous the impending tribulation would be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The greater a
tribulation, the more powerful major figures would born from it. In
fact, even multiple Daofathers might be born! However, they would be
spread out throughout the three thousand major worlds and the
trillion minor worlds. It was very hard to say exactly how many
experts the Grand Xia Dynasty’s major world would give birth to.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Sloppy Daoist,
as a disciple of Grand Emperor Xuanwu, must be blessed with luck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of the top three…one
of them will become a disciple of Daofather Crimsonbright. He too
will be blessed by luck. For this single Conclave of Immortal Destiny
to give birth to two future experts would be quite remarkable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And precisely because
of this, their desire to acquire Ji Ning wasn’t too burning; after
all, Ning was still just a Wanxiang Adept. No one could tell how far
he would be able to actually make it…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the grand
sealing formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiamang Zishan was
growing increasingly surprised and worried. The Ji Ning before him
wielded those six Immortal swords as though they were parts of a
moving melody. They danced with tremendous beauty, and just watching
them felt like a form of enjoyment! But this sort of ‘enjoyment’
wasn’t something which Xiamang Zishan could withstand. He only felt
increasingly stifled, and no matter how he fought back, he remained
at a disadvantage!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s swords were
simply too inconceivable. They were savage, gentle, fast,
slow…Xiamang Zishan was unable to keep up, and wounds began to
appear repeatedly on his body. Blood sprayed everywhere as his divine
body had to heal repeatedly as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t accept
this. I’m going to win. I have to win.” Xiamang Zishan’s eyes
were crackling with thunder as he grew increasingly berserk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If before this, he
could be described as ‘dominating’ in a heroic manner that
subjugated his foes, then his current berserk status was like a sort
of utter madness, a madness born from despair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was struggling to
hang on! And it was lucky for Ning that he did. His struggle to hang
on allowed Ning to continue to stay immersed in this wondrous state
for even longer. This sort of level of no-thought didn’t actually
mean that one had lost all consciousness; rather, it allowed one to
unleash one’s full potential and be guided by the invisible hands
of the heavens…simply put, it was as though gods were helping him
reach a perfect state that he normally would find it hard to enter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, some poets
might suddenly feel divinely inspired and write a line of poetry that
would be passed down for ages…but for the rest of their lives, they
would never again be able to write something to match it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the wondrous
state which Ning was currently immersed into.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I admit defeat!”
Suddenly, an unhappy, dissatisfied voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did Ning come
back to his senses. Whoosh. Ning came to a halt. The area around him
was completely splattered with blood, and half of Xiaman Zishan’s
body was lying off in the distance. His two halves quickly flew to
each other and began to fuse together, but his bloodshot eyes
remained filled with discontent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A pity that it ended
so soon.” Ning understood how rare it was for him to have entered
such a state just now. If Xiamang Zishan had been able to hold on for
a bit longer, it would’ve been even better for him. However, more
than half of Ning’s divine power had been used up as well; it was
enough for him to have battled for so long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then…a look of
wild joy appeared in Ning’s eyes. “I won!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I won.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Won.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The top three. The
Xia Emperor will send a recording of my battle to Daofather
Crimsonbright. He might choose me as a disciple.” Ning was filled
with eager expectation. “But ideally, I shall become number one in
this Conclave of Immortal Destiny. That way, I’ll have a better
chance of being chosen.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I won.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial citadel
plaza was filled with delegates from the 3600 commanderies. Amongst
them, many of the delegates from Stillwater Commandery began to call
out in celebration. Although they each belonged to different powers
within Stillwater, they were all from the same commandery! They had
all felt regret when the Sloppy Daoist had been defeated, but now
that Ji Ning had successfully entered the top three, they all felt
incomparably proud.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, senior apprentice-brother, I knew you’d do it!
Haha, and to think the Heavenly Treasures Mountain ranked Xiamang
Zishan at number one. He still got taken care of by my senior
apprentice-brother!” Mu Northson was incomparably delighted. He
called out loudly, “Number one! Number one! Take number one in this
Conclave!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take number one!”
Little Qing spoke out in the human tongue as well as she called out
in excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
grinned as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A series of joyful
shouts swept the plaza.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei watched from
afar as Ning walked out from within the grand sealing formation. In
this moment, all of the Celestial Immortal Patriarchs within the main
hall of the Skylight Palace were watching Ning. Ning was the most
dazzling figure of them all at present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei felt a surge of
excitement as well. Excitement for Ning. “Right. He’s entered the
top three. Perhaps Ji Ning shall become the Daofather’s disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus was watching
from afar as well. A hint of a faint smile appeared on her face. In
this instant…her heart and soul suddenly became tranquil. With
regards to Ning and Yu Wei being together, she still felt jealousy,
but with regards to Ning himself…she was filled with nothing but
hopes for the best for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the most important
top three victors of this Conclave being now chosen, all three of
them advanced to stand shoulder-to-shoulder in front of the main hall
of the Skylight Palace, awaiting the Grand Xia Emperor’s orders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the Celestial
Immortal Patriarchs had a hint of envy in their eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One of the three
will definitely become the Daofather’s disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such luck…and yet,
we can’t touch that luck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps in the
future, one of them shall become a figure which we must revere with
tremendous respect.” The Celestial Immortal Patriarchs all sighed
with emotion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…only one of the
three would become a Daofather’s disciple. The other two by
comparison wouldn’t be nearly as well-off. If they were lucky, they
might become a disciple of a Pure Yang True Immortal, but there was
an enormous difference between becoming the disciple of a Pure Yang
True Immortal and a Daofather’s disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon becoming a
Daofather’s disciple, it was virtually assured that one would
become a Celestial Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, far too many
disciples of a Pure Yang True Immortal would fail in their Celestial
Tribulation. It could only be said that compared to ordinary
cultivators, they had a much higher chance. Perhaps not even one out
of a hundred thousand Void-level Earth Immortals would successfully
pass the tribulation. If a Pure Yang True Immortal patiently taught
his disciple, then perhaps one out of ten might become a Celestial
Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And individual
variables mattered as well. Some were very skilled at training
disciples, while others were not.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, in terms
of training disciples, Lu Dongbin was clearly far superior to the Xia
Emperor. Lu Dongbin’s disciples even included another Pure Yang
True Immortal. This was often spoken of and praised in the Three
Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor looked
down upon the three youths, revealing a smile. “I have to
congratulate you. You are all extremely fortunate…and in the
future, many years from now, you will understand how special this
Conclave of Immortal Destiny was for you! This is a critical turning
point in your lives. It is clear that all three of you shall soar
into the heavens. Only, it’s hard to say exactly how high you shall
each soar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Adept Woodpass,
and Adept Blackstone all listened obediently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One of you three
shall definitely become the Daofather’s disciple,” the Xia
Emperor said. “As for the other two…I can promise you that you
shall both become disciples of a Pure Yang True Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh. The nearly
thousand Celestial Immortals were all stunned. What?! For a Daofather
to take a disciple was one thing, but the other two would also become
the disciples of a Pure Yang True Immortal? Pure Yang True Immortals
didn’t casually take on disciples either. Why would two suddenly be
taken on today?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems this
Conclave truly is special. First a Daofather chooses a disciple, but
then even Pure Yang True Immortals will take on disciples.” These
Celestial Immortals now all realized how unique this was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, because they
didn’t have a high enough status, they only came to realize this
now. As for the experts and major powers of the Three Realms, they
had long ago understood that a storm was coming…and that this storm
would most likely be a major one. Naturally, these major powers would
have to plan early in advance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Daofather’s
disciple.” Ji Ning, Adept Woodpass, and Adept Blackstone all wished
to become a Daofather’s disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for a Pure Yang True
Immortal? There was a thousandfold difference between a Daofather and
a Pure Yang True Immortal! For Ji Ning, in particular…since he had
already received the legacy of Daoist Threelives, and the Stellar
Hall provided guidance in multiple Dao-Paths and Grand Daos…what
was a Pure Yang True Immortal? They weren’t that attractive for
Ning. He still felt more desire for becoming a Daofather’s
disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But of course, all
of you will desire to become the Daofather’s disciple, and so these
final battles are still very important,” the Xia Emperor said. “Two
hours from now, the three of you shall engage in the final duels,
divided into three sets.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning battling Adept
Blackstone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Blackstone
fighting Adept Woodpass.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Woodpass battling
Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three duels…each
person would compete twice against the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I shall use a water
scrying technique to record all three duels and give it to Master.
Master shall watch all three of your duels, then choose who his
disciple will be,” the Xia Emperor said. “In these three
competitions, you need to display out all of your abilities; after
all, the number one victor in this Conclave isn’t necessarily going
to be the person the Daofather shall choose. The choice is his. But
of course…if you become number one, the chances the Daofather shall
choose you might be a bit higher.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the other
three all waited quietly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now, all three of
you shall enter the world of the Brightmoon Diagram of the Mountains
and Rivers. Two hours in the outside world shall be equivalent to a
month of quiet training in the Diagram,” the Xia Emperor said. “In
this month, you need to reflect on the experiences you have gained in
this Conclave and prepare for the final competition.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” Ning and the
other three all said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor waved
his arm, and the Diagram floated up into the skies. Ning, Adept
Woodpass, and Adept Blackstone were all sucked into it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Diagram. The
moonlight continued to shine everywhere. Atop a mountain peak, Ning
seated himself in the lotus position. In two other corners of the
peak were Adepts Blackstone and Woodpass, also seated in the lotus
position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These three were the
most powerful competitors in this Conclave. Of the three of them…only
one could become a Daofather’s disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm…?” Ning sat
there in the lotus position, beginning to reflect on what he had
learned and gained during his battle against Xiamang Zishan. Many
insights began to fill his mind…
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 32 - Number One
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of appearance,
Ji Ning appeared the youngest of the three, like a youth. However,
although that was younger than his actual age of over thirty, the
other two had trained for more than a century.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is…?” Adept
Blackstone and Adept Woodpass both turned their heads to stare at
Ning. They saw Ning sit there in the lotus position as sudden gusts
of wind began to swirl around him. At the same time…ripples of the
Dao descended.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? He broke
through?” Adept Woodpass and Adept Blackstone both felt shock. They
could naturally tell that Ning should’ve completed an entire
Dao-Path pertaining to wind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was actually able
to master yet another Dao-Path at such a critical moment. Ji Ning was
formidable to begin with. In close combat, Adept Saberslave and
Xiamang Zishan were both very powerful, but both were defeated by
him. For him to make a breakthrough now…his close combat ability
will most likely be superior to even me.” Adept Blackstone made
some calculations. Instantly, he began to grow nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the competition
in the world of the Diagram, he had somewhat of an advantage. This
was because the most important part in that competition was to stay
alive and have enough talismans! Naturally, he was able to put on
full display all of his advantages gained from his mastery of
formations. But in a one-on-one fight, where one side had to win, he
was at a disadvantage. The aid provided to him by his formations
skills wasn’t as significant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, the
Daofather isn’t necessarily going to pick the number one winner for
his disciple,” Adept Blackstone mused to himself. “When the duel
comes, I’m going to unleash all of my insights in the art of
formations so as to let the Daofather see my full potential…and I
believe he will choose me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was very powerful in
close combat as well, close to Xiamang Zishan’s level. But he was
more confident in his formations ability! He had spent far, far too
much of his blood and sweat on formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense the
ripples of the Dao from around him. He opened his eyes, revealing a
hint of a smile. The Dao of the Gale…he had finally mastered this
Dao-Path!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, long ago when
he had mastered the Dao of the Raindrop, his Dao of the Inferno and
Dao of the Gale had already been close to mastery. These two Daos had
been just slightly lacking…but the many battles over the past year
had been very helpful towards him. In the end, he had finally
mastered both the Dao of the Inferno and the Dao of the Gale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three Daos.
Rainwater, Inferno, Gale. I’ve mastered them all.” Ning had
primarily been spending his time meditating on these three Daos, and
they had all advanced in unison. It wasn’t too strange that by the
time of the Conclave, he would have mastered all three.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Dao of the Sword
improved tremendously as well,” Ning celebrated. During his earlier
battle with Xiamang Zishan, his insights into the Dao of the Sword
had indeed increased significantly. However…there was a huge gap in
difficulty between the seventh, eighth, and ninth stances of the
[Three-Foot Sword].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all, the eighth
stance was comparable to an ordinary Celestial Immortal’s
technique, while the ninth stance was a skill that allowed a Loose
Immortal like Immortal Northwalker to unleash the power of a
Celestial Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s current level
of insights into the Dao of the Sword was between the seventh and the
eighth stance. He had yet to be able to unleash the eighth stance…but
he had still improved enormously. His combat power had risen by a
large amount.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Xia Emperor gave
us a month. During this month, I need to fuse the Daos of Rainwater,
Inferno, and Gale into my Dao of the Sword, making the power of my
sword increase even further,” Ning mused to himself, then calmed
down and began to meditate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main hall of the
Skylight Palace. Everyone was waiting for the two hours to conclude,
and for the three final duels to begin. These three final duels would
be recorded and given to Daofather Crimsonbright to watch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In his battle with
Xiamang Zishan, Ji Ning entered a state of no-thought; I imagine that
he must’ve improved considerably. By the time they have left their
secluded meditation, Ji Ning’s power will most likely have risen
significantly yet again. In terms of attack power, he is most likely
the absolute number one in this Conclave. As for Adept Woodpass, he
should be the absolute number one in terms of defense. Adept
Blackstone…he’s a bit worse off. If this was a battle in the
outside world, his skill in formations would make it difficult for
others to slay him. But this is a duel in the Conclave in which a
victor must be determined,” Truelord Chiji said calmly. “As I see
it, the number one position should go to either Ji Ning or Adept
Woodpass.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’ll be a bit
harder for Adept Blackstone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin and the
others all nodded in agreement. Even the Xia Emperor nodded as well.
“Ji Ning has mastered yet another Dao-Path in secluded meditation
in the world of the Diagram. This should be part of what he gained
during the previous battle with Xiamang Zishan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No-thought, no-self;
as expected, he has gained power after having entered that state of
mind.” The Pure Yang True Immortals were all quite calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Comparatively speaking,
in the final three duels, who won and who lost wasn’t as important.
This was because the Daofather wouldn’t necessarily choose the
top-ranked person. However, without question…the victor would have
a better chance of being chosen. After all, over the course of
history, victory and defeat usually determined who would be acclaimed
as the hero.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
two hours passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish swish swish!
Three figures flew out from the world of the Diagram, appearing on
the main hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Imperial
Majesty.” Ning and the other two both called out in unison with
respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With regards to
these three duels, the first shall see Ji Ning against Adept
Blackstone,” the Xia Emperor instructed. “After these three
duels, I’ll arrange for all of you to go to the imperial treasury
of my Grand Xia Dynasty and pick out a divine ability of your choice.
However, compared to becoming the disciple of the Daofather, choosing
a divine ability is naturally a small matter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the other two
just listened quietly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let it begin, then,”
the Xia Emperor instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning and
Adept Blackstone exchanged a glance, and then both walked towards the
outside of the hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, Ning and the
other two no longer had any more tricks up their sleeves. They had
long ago unleashed all of their abilities, which was why Lu Dongbin
and the others were able to get a very good picture of what would
happen!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Blackstone was
clearly a master of formations, but Ning just stood there without
moving, just using a Waterflame Lotus to protect himself. As soon as
Adept Blackstone moved near him, Ning would fight him…but if he
didn’t, then Ning wouldn’t move about randomly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Blackstone began
to put on his ‘performance’, unleashing all of his abilities as a
master of formations. The seemingly simple Fuxi Staff Formation
unleashed one mighty formation after another. Some were illusory,
others were meant to kill, while still others were meant to seal. In
fact, the formations actually were layered atop each other, causing
the area to be filled with illusions and killing intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning didn’t even
try to break the formation; all he had to do was wait for Adept
Blackstone to move close to him and start fighting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only after putting on a
show of displaying his formidable formations did Adept Blackstone
begin to actually fight with Ning. And indeed…in close combat, now
that Ning had improved even further, he ended up defeating Adept
Blackstone!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the first battle…Ji
Ning won!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the second
battle, Adept Woodpass and Adept Blackstone fought against each
other. Adept Woodpass was even more shameless than Ning! Although
Ning had stood there without moving, he had still at least engaged
Adept Blackstone in a frenzied battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Woodpass,
however, had just stood there as unmoving as a mountain. Like a
giant, human-shaped tree, he just stood there and let Adept
Blackstone whale on him. No matter how Adept Blackstone attacked,
Adept Woodpass was still able to withstand it…and he didn’t even
counter-attack! And so, just like that…Adept Blackstone’s divine
power ended up being exhausted. He was forced to admit defeat!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the second battle,
Adept Woodpass had won!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third duel was
between Ning and Adept Woodpass. This battle was clearly much more
exciting than the last two. In the two previous battles, Ning and
Adept Woodpass hadn’t dared to run about randomly within Adept
Blackstone’s formations. In this battle, the two fought each other
head on!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was the most
powerful attacker in this Conclave! His [Crimsonbright Diagram of the
Nine Heavens] was at the twelfth stage, his Dao of the Sword was at
an extremely high level, and he had three complete Dao-Paths as well
as the [Starseizing Hand]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this battle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning put his sword arts
on full display, wildly unleashing all of his attacking abilities. At
the beginning, Adept Woodpass had attempted to counter-attack, but he
was quickly forced by Ning into a point where he was spending 90% of
his efforts on defense, with only the occasional counter! This was
because Ning was different compared to the Sloppy Daoist; the Sloppy
Daoist’s wavefolding technique would eventually collapse, whereas
Ning’s sword arts would not. His sword arts came out in an endless
series, causing Adept Woodpass to begin to be injured. With each
injury, he would have to spend divine power to heal it…and in the
end, Adept Woodpass was forced to admit defeat!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I used up more than
70% of my divine power in wild attacks before he admitted defeat.”
Ning felt cold sweat trickle down his back as well. His [Starseizing
Hand] used up far too much divine power. If Adept Woodpass had been
able to hold on for a bit longer, Ning’s own divine power probably
would’ve been used up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three duels. Ning won
two! Adept Woodpass won one! Adept Blackstone won none!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He won!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha, won, won,
WON!!!” The Stillwater Commandery delegation in the imperial
citadel plaza let out an incomparably excited roar of delight. They
all called out jubilantly and their roars of laughter rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were more than a
million delegates present from the 3600 commanderies and the Four
Seas, but the number of them who knew that the Daofather would choose
a disciple could be counted on one hand. To them…seizing the number
one position in the Conclave was a matter of the utmost glory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Number one, number
one!” Mu Northson was so excited, his entire face was red. He was
incomparably delighted as he said, “My senior apprentice-brother Ji
Ning is number one!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Vastriver sighed
with emotion. “In the past, when I saw junior apprentice-brother Ji
Ning kill Youngflame Nong, all sorts of worries had appeared. But
unexpectedly, after such a short period of time, senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning actually became number one in this
Conclave. This is really…a miracle. A real miracle!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“NUMBER ONE!”
Immortal Fivecraze was so excited that he actually tossed his gourd
of wine to the ground. He seemed to have gone mad, and was so excited
he seemed berserk. “Ahahaha! A disciple of my Black-White College
has become number one in this Conclave! This has never before
happened in the entire history of my Black-White College, never ever!
Haha, the champion of the Conclave…belongs to a disciple of my
Black-White College! Haha, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning truly is
incredible.” Northmont Baiwei’s breathing was rather ragged. He
was simply too excited. “He actually became number one in the
Conclave. I didn’t even dare imagine this happening. This is truly
unfathomable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master is so
amazing.” Little Qing’s eyes were glowing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother…”
The Whitewater Hound thought back to the scenes of Ji Yichuan and
Yuchi Snow teaching Ji Ning swordplay. “Can you see this? You
taught him movement arts…taught him swordplay…and now, sword in
hand, he has become the champion of the Conclave of Immortal Destiny
of this entire vast Grand Xia Dynasty! Can you see it? Can you see
it?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound’s
tears began to fall. He was incomparably agitated.

Chapter 33 - Grand Emperor Xuanwu
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within the void of
the Three Realms. There was a world here that had been born from
chaos, filled with endless, fathomless amounts of seawater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fathomless oceans
had several islands within it, and Immortal cultivators as well as
Immortals were very common.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the very center of
this ocean world, atop an island surrounded by the waters of the sea,
there were a series of indescribably beautiful palaces. Immortal
maidens, celestial generals, and celestial soldiers were everywhere
to be seen. On the top of the highest palace, there was an enormous
diagram of a yin-yang taiji symbol that hung high up in the air,
constantly emanating boundless amounts of white and black light…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An old black-haired man
was seated atop a bed formed from clouds, and the enormous yin-yang
taiji diagram was directly above him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm?” The old
black-haired man opened his eyes. “Novice,” he said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Beneath him were a pair
of male and female novices, who were obediently awaiting his orders.
The golden-robed male novice immediately responded obediently,
“Patriarch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go and call out your
uncle-master, Seatopple,” the black-haired elder instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The
golden-robed male novice acknowledged with respect, then took a
single step forward through a ripple in the air that had appeared. He
teleported away and disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within the sea of
this world, there was an underwater palace. The golden-robed novice
teleported straight into the depths of the sea, and where he passed
by the waters of the sea parted, allowing him to go straight to the
jade-colored underwater palace. There were many soldiers and guards
protecting this underwater palace, and upon seeing this person
approach, they immediately moved to block him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle-master
Seatopple,” the golden-robed novice called out. His voice echoed
within the sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the underwater
estate. There was a tall, skinny man dressed in deep green armor
whose eyes flashed with deep green light and a gaze that caused the
hearts of others to quiver. In front of him was a white-robed
cultivator. The two were happily drinking and chatting with each
other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It isn’t that I,
your big brother, don’t want to help you. You must understand, I’ve
been confined to this place by Master…I want to help, but there’s
nothing I can do. But come, come, come, let’s stop talking about
these unhappy things. Let’s drink.” The tall, skinny man in the
deep green armor lifted up a large bowl of wine, drinking happily.
That bowl contained at least a kilogram of wine, but he gulped it all
down at once.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The
green-armored man’s face suddenly changed. With but a thought…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The
golden-robed novice that had been outside the underwater palace was
instantly teleported inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle-master
Seatopple.” The golden-robed novice bowed respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Apprentice-nephew,
why have you come to my place?” The green-armored man asked
hurriedly. Although this golden-robed novice was merely a Celestial
Immortal, he was permanently stationed by the side of Grand Emperor
Xuanwu to carry out his orders. Thus, the green-armored man was very
courteous to him and didn’t dare show him any discourtesy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed
cultivator next to him hurriedly rose to his feet as well. “I greet
you, Immortal novice.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-robed novice
glanced sideways at the white-robed cultivator, just nodding slightly
at him, then said, “Uncle-master Seatopple, I have come per the
orders of the Patriarch. The Patriarch wishes to see you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Upon seeing
this, Seatopple immediately said, “Then I shall go right away.”
Seatopple then immediately said to the white-robed cultivator next to
him, “Master is ordering me to go to him. I must…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother, no
worries; go take care of your matters first. I won’t stay here any
longer; I’m going to pay the Heaven Realm a visit and see if I can
find anyone to help that poor child of mine,” the white-robed
cultivator hurriedly said, then left gracefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master!” The
green-armored man called out with respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Above him was the
black-haired elder, seated atop a cloud. He nodded lightly, then said
with a smile, “Seatopple, there is something I am going to have you
go do.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, please
instruct me,” Seatopple said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A hundred years ago,
I accepted a disciple in the world of the Grand Xia, one of the three
thousand major worlds,” the black-haired elder said with a calm
laugh. “In other words, a junior apprentice-brother for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A junior
apprentice-brother?” Seatopple was amazed. A hundred years ago?
When his master took on a disciple, it was a matter of tremendous
importance. And yet, he had no idea of this whatsoever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His true name is
Zhang Qi. He is learning the Dao in a small school known as the
Black-White College within the world of the Grand Xia. He is
currently just a Wanxiang Adept, and others refer to him as the
Sloppy Daoist.” The black-haired elder said with a laugh, “The
Grand Xia world has just held a Conclave of Immortal Destiny. Your
junior apprentice-brother attended this Conclave, which has now
concluded. Go to the imperial capital of the Grand Xia’s world and
bring your junior apprentice-brother before me. Remember…on this
trip, you absolutely cannot cause any trouble. All you need to do is
bring your junior apprentice-brother back here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,”
Seatopple said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go then,” the
black-haired elder nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seatopple immediately
departed respectfully, and then he left this major world to go to the
world of the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world of the Grand
Xia Dynasty. The imperial capital. The main hall of the Skylight
Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Adept
Woodpass, and Adept Blackstone were all standing there respectfully,
awaiting the order of the Grand Xia Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ning truly
is formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s only trained
for thirty or so years, and yet became number one in this Conclave.
It seems he has an extremely good chance of becoming the Daofather’s
disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’ll be soon. His
Imperial Majesty is about to deliver the scryer recording of the
duels to the Daofather.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearly thousand
Celestial Immortals were all chatting amongst themselves. The
Conclave had come to an end, with Ji Ning number one, Adept Woodpass
number two, and Adept Blackstone number three. However, right now
what everyone was paying attention to was…who the Daofather would
choose as a disciple! The ‘champion’ of the Conclave was nothing
but a meaningless title; to become the disciple of the Daofather was
what really matter and came with real benefits.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The three of you.”
The Grand Xia Emperor’s voice once more rang out. Ning and the
other two immediately listened carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have already
recorded all three of the previous duels using the water-scrying
technique. I am now going to go to my master’s place and offer them
to Master for the viewing.” The Grand Xia Emperor’s voice once
more rang out, and a second, white-robed Xia Emperor appeared by his
side who looked identical to the main body of the Xia Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! The white-robed
Xia Emperor took a single step forward, entering the skies above
them, then tearing open the void and departing from this major world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the other two
were incomparably nervous. The white-robed Xia Emperor was clearly
the clone or Primaltwin of the Xia Emperor. Clearly, he had gone to
visit Daofather Crimsonbright. Now, they were going to wait for the
Daofather’s selection.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Who would be chosen?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My formations are
even more formidable than my personal close combat strength. The
Daofather will naturally have excellent judgment and will be able to
see how special and blessed I am in formations.” Adept Blackstone
was ranked number three. He had very complicated feelings in his
heart right now. “Given my talent in formations…the Daofather
should choose me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I became the
champion. I did everything I could. Next, all I can do is wait for
the Daofather’s decision,” Ning said to himself silently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s see if this
destiny is mine,” Adept Woodpass silently mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Xia Emperor,
seated up high, once more spoke out. “My Primaltwin has already
headed towards Master’s place, but it is hard to say when Master
will meet me and when he will choose a disciple.” The Grand Xia
Emperor looked down at the three nervous individuals below him.
Clearly, it was hard for Ning and the other two to feel at ease for
even a second. “Since the three of you are the top three of this
Conclave, you can go pick a divine ability of your choosing from the
Grand Xia’s treasury.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“King Qi,” the
Grand Xia Emperor spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Imperial
Majesty.” King Qi immediately rose and acknowledged him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lead these three to
our Grand Xia treasury. Let them choose a divine ability,” the
Grand Xia Emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How could Ning and the
other two be in a mood to choose a divine ability right now? In a
normal situation, yes, they would be incomparably excited at this
chance to choose a divine ability from the Grand Xia’s treasury.
But they were waiting for Daofather Crimsonbright’s decision. Their
hearts felt suspended, and they only had one thought in their minds…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Who will the Daofather
choose…who will be the one to be chosen…?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Choose me, choose me,
choose me…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go. After my
Primaltwin returns, I will naturally notify you of Master’s final
decision,” the Grand Xia Emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” Ji Ning,
Woodpass, and Blackstone both responded respectfully. Then they moved
to follow King Qi through a side corridor leading away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearly thousand
Celestial Immortals in the main hall, as well as the eliminated
Wanxiang Adept geniuses, all watched the three leave with envious
eyes…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Xia Emperor
had already informed them all that one would be chosen by the
Daofather as a disciple, while the other two would be chosen by Pure
Yang True Immortals as disciples. In other words, all three of them
would see their statuses suddenly and dramatically change. How could
the eliminated contestants not feel envious?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yu Wei, Sloppy, do
you two think Ji Ning will be chosen by the Daofather as a disciple?”
Yuchi Xiyue was both excited and nervous. He was her most important
family member; naturally, she hoped that Ning could ascend to the
heavens with a single step. That way, it would also be much easier
for Ning to deal with the Youngflame clan in the future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He will. The
Daofather definitely will.” Yu Wei was holding Yuchi Xiyue’s
hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sloppy?” Yuchi
Xiyue looked towards the Sloppy Daoist, who shook his head. “I
don’t know the Daofather’s temperament. It’s hard to say.
Still…since junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning has become number one
in this Conclave, and has trained for such a short period of time…he
is indeed the most dazzling figure of the three. There is a very high
chance that the Daofather will choose junior apprentice-brother Ji
Ning. However…no one can be absolutely certain regarding this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those who cared deeply
about something would often find their thoughts in a jumble because
of it. Both Yu Wei and Yuchi Xiyue cared far too deeply about Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But even if he
cannot take on Daofather Crimsonbright as his master, he’ll be
apprenticed to a Pure Yang True Immortals. There’s no need to be
too nervous,” the Sloppy Daoist said with a sigh. “I wonder if I
would have this same good fortune to become the disciple of a Pure
Yang True Immortal one day.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eldest
apprentice-brother, you were also quite dazzling in this Conclave.
You should be accepted by a Pure Yang True Immortal as well,” Yu
Wei said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It won’t be as
simple as that. Pure Yang True Immortals won’t casually accept new
disciples.” Although the Sloppy Daoist did feel a hint of hope, he
maintained a calm heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a heroic but
terrifying aura spread out from the main hall. At the same time, a
voice rang out: “Xiamang, long time no see.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Nearly a
thousand Celestial Immortals, along with the eliminated Wanxiang
Adepts, all turned to stare towards the outside in astonishment. This
aura was so powerful and the words were so grandiose that this was
clearly an extraordinary person.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” The Xia
Emperor rose to his feet, and the other eight Pure Yang True
Immortals rose to their feet as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From the outside, a
tall, skinny man dressed in deep green armor strode in. He had a
heroic aura of vigor that caused all the surrounding Celestial
Immortals to feel stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s Great Sage
Who Topples the Seas.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empyrean God
Seatopple!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Demon King
Seatopple!” 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearly thousand
Celestial Immortals all cried out in their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor was now
on his feet. He said with a laugh, “Seatopple, it has indeed been a
long time. The Three Realms are currently filled with the stories of
your heroics.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seatopple, have you
come to receive your junior apprentice-brother?” Lu Dongbin said
with a lazy grin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Seatopple
had an incomparably dominating aura, and his deep green eyes swept
the surrounding figures. He immediately called out, “Who here is
known as Zhang Qi? Who here is known as the Sloppy Daoist?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sloppy-looking
fatty seated behind King Qi trembled with shock. What the hell?

Chapter 34 - A Mighty Divine Ability
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seatopple was an
extremely famous figure of the Three Realms. He was a Diremonster who
had trained all the way to the Empyrean God level. Generally
speaking, others would refer to him as ‘Empyrean God’ or ‘Great
Sage’ when being respectful to him…but in reality, since Empyrean
God Seatopple was something of an unruly, lawless individual who was
also quite savage and tyrannical, others would often secretly refer
to him as the ‘Demon King’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sloppy, chubby
youth had indeed been badly frightened. After all, Seatopple’s
savage aura…was utterly terrifying within the main hall of the
Skylight Palace. Even the Celestial Immortals were shocked by it, to
say nothing of the Wanxiang Adepts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, I am…” The
Sloppy Daoist rose to his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Seatopple
turned to look at him, then nodded in satisfaction as he revealed a
smile. “You really are pretty sloppy-looking.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he spoke, he walked
over, then grabbed the Sloppy Daoist by the arm, pulling him over as
he walked towards the Grand Xia Emperor. A new table had already been
prepared, covered with Immortal nectar and fruit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist was
slightly panicking now. Still…this Empyrean God, Seatopple, was far
too powerful. After having his arm grabbed, the Sloppy Daoist was
completely unable to resist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What in the world is
going on? Why has this savage-looking man with a dark-green Flood
Dragon armor sought me out upon entering the Skylight Palace? Even
the Grand Xia Emperor is polite to him, but I have never met such a
formidable figure before.” The Sloppy Daoist was panicking, but
could do nothing but just go with the flow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time…the
Sloppy Daoist that the gazes of those nearly thousand Celestial
Immortals who were looking at him were filled…with envy! In fact,
some of these Celestial Immortals smiled in a friendly manner towards
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was eliminated…but
these Celestial Immortal Patriarchs are still this polite towards me?
And they are envious of me?” The Sloppy Daoist’s mind began to be
filled with many thoughts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, come and sit.” Seatopple first sat down, then
pulled the Sloppy Daoist to sit next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother?” The Sloppy Daoist was completely bewildered
now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seatopple, it seems
your junior apprentice-brother doesn’t understand the situation
yet,” the Xia Emperor laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seatopple turned his
head to look at the rather confused Sloppy Daoist. He said in a very
straight manner, “Junior apprentice-brother, Master ordered me to
come to the Grand Xia world, one of the three thousand major worlds,
in order to take you back!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, are you…sure
you aren’t mistaken?” The Sloppy Daoist was feeling rather
unnerved. He had no idea who this person was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Sloppy,” Lu
Dongbin laughed, “This person before you is a disciple of Grand
Emperor Xuanwu, Empyrean God Seatopple! He’s not just an Empyrean
God; he’s also reached the Pure Yang True Immortal as a Ki Refiner
as well. In the Three Realms…he is extremely well-known. Not too
long ago, he actually wrecked the Celestial Court.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empyrean God? Pure
Yang True Immortal? Wrecked the Celestial Court?” The Sloppy Daoist
stared at this savage-looking man, completely shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…”
Seatopple began to laugh loudly. Slapping the Sloppy Daoist on the
shoulder, he said, “Junior apprentice-brother, I have come on
Master’s orders to receive you. Master said that you took part in
this Conclave, and said that you come from the Black-White College,
that your name is Zhang Qi, the Sloppy Daoist. There shouldn’t be a
second person in this entire Conclave who comes from the Black-White
College and who is known as the Sloppy Daoist Zhang Qi, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist
nodded. In this competition, the Black-White College only sent a
total of three participants. There was naturally only one called the
Sloppy Daoist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Sloppy,”
the Xia Emperor laughed as well, “Don’t question it. Earlier, the
divine ability which you displayed is called the ‘Grand Black
Tortoise’ divine ability. Did you know that?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I did.” The Sloppy
Daoist nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Grand Black
Tortoise divine ability was created by Grand Emperor Xuanwu. Without
his permission, there’s no way you could’ve learned this divine
ability,” the Xia Emperor laughed. “Perhaps you don’t realize
this, but Grand Emperor Xuanwu has long ago viewed you as his
disciple. He is a major power of the Three Realms, on the same level
as my own master. He is a Daofather! When you put your divine ability
on display earlier during this Conclave, all of us already guessed
that you are the disciple of Grand Emperor Xuanwu.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist began
to think back to the strange encounter he had so long ago…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So…he was Grand
Emperor Xuanwu…” The Sloppy Daoist was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So…there had been no
need at all for him to fight so crazily in order to become Daofather
Crimsonbright’s disciple. He had long ago been chosen as a disciple
by Grand Emperor Xuanwu. However…this Conclave had been extremely
beneficial to him. His insights into the Dao, especially into the
‘wavefolding’ secret art, had reached a very high level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, you’ve learned the Grand Black Tortoise divine
ability? Then there’s no mistake about it; without Master’s
permission, there’s no way you could’ve learned this.”
Seatopple knew quite well that someone who had been accepted by his
master at the Wanxiang Adept level or perhaps even earlier was
someone who his master clearly viewed with tremendous favor. Thus, it
would be best if he made friends with this Sloppy Daoist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seatopple himself
usually caused quite a bit of trouble. In the future, once this
junior apprentice-brother became powerful, he’d be able to give
Seatopple a hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the saying went,
every hero should have at least three helpers by his side. The more
powerful figures by his side, the better. That would naturally give
him more confidence in roaming the Three Realms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, senior
apprentice-brother,” the Sloppy Daoist immediately said while
saluting him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, don’t be
so courteous.” Seatopple was extremely happy. “A while ago, I
wrecked the Celestial Court and was confined by Master to my
quarters. It’s rare for me to be allowed out. And today, I’ve
even run into Eastflower, this old fogey from the Northlands, and all
of these others as well. I’m just going to drink some wine first;
in a bit, I’ll take you back to meet Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll listen to
your arrangements, senior apprentice-brother.” The Sloppy Daoist
naturally was willing to follow his lead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seatopple patted the
Sloppy Daoist on the shoulder. “Junior apprentice-brother, you have
quite a good temper.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eastflower, this
Grand Xia world is holding a Conclave…why have all of you come as
well?” Seatopple’s gaze swept forward as he asked this question.
He felt quite puzzled. Pure Yang True Immortals were considered
experts of the Three Realms. For nine of them to be gathered in one
place was indeed fairly rare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Conclave is
quite special. One of the top three of this Conclave shall be chosen
by Daofather Crimsonbright as a disciple,” Lu Dongbin said with a
laugh. “Including little Sloppy, this Conclave actually includes
two Daofather disciples.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? Daofather
Crimsonbright is taking on a disciple?” Seatopple looked towards
the Xia Emperor. “Who is he choosing? Let me take a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The top three of
this Conclave consist of Ji Ning, Blackstone, and Woodpass,” the
Xia Emperor said. “As for who Master shall choose…my Primaltwin
is heading towards Master’s estate right now. After a little bit
more time, I imagine we’ll know the results.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seatopple immediately
nodded, his eyes gleaming. Daofather Crimsonbright was taking on a
disciple? This was quite an interesting affair. He had been confined
to his quarters for years now, and had been incredibly stifled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, let’s drink
while chatting. Xiamang, you are of the Primordial Imperial Clan…you
need to prepare more wine.” Seatopple immediately guzzled down all
the wine on his table, causing the corners of the Xia Emperor’s
eyes to begin twitching. The others were drinking in a fairly
graceful way, but this Great Sage Who Topples the Seas was a Flood
Dragon; it was a minor matter for him to swallow all the water of a
river with a single gulp. In drinking Immortal wine, he was similarly
savage beyond all compare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial treasury
of the Grand Xia was located on the sixth floor of the main hall of
the Skylight Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place holds the
abridged versions of all of the books held by the Dao Repository of
our imperial Xia clan,” King Qi said with a laugh as he pointed
towards countless bookshelves that were filled with books. “You can
choose a divine ability at will, or a secret art or technique. But
only one!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Adept
Blackstone, and Adept Woodpass all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although their minds
were still occupied with the matter of becoming Daofather
Crimsonbright’s disciple, for now they put that matter aside. The
three began to search through this Dao Repository.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, they saw a black
jade table that was the most eye-catching of all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This enormous black
jade table was filled with abridged versions of divine abilities! On
another table, a white jade table, there were abridged versions of
precious secret arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Moving Mountains,
Overturning Seas] [Qiankun Arrow] [Myriad Hibernating Venoms]
[Formless Illusions]
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the other two
hurriedly grabbed one divine ability book after another, flipping
through them. These books all had had some prerequisites listed on
the front; for example, some required a person to have reached a
certain level in order to train in it. These requirements, however,
were all meant for the clansmen of the imperial Xia clan. Ning and
the other two could choose as they pleased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They read for a long
period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They flipped through
all the secret arts as well. In the end, as if by tacit agreement,
all three of them chose the same divine ability - [Torch Dragon’s
Eye]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you certain you
are going to choose the [Torch Dragon’s Eye]?” King Qi asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ji Ning,
Adept Woodpass, and Adept Blackstone all nodded in unison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” King Qi
revealed a smile. “Come with me, then.” King Qi was actually
fairly happy that all three had chosen the [Torch Dragon’s Eye],
because this technique was still fairly widespread amongst the
various major powers of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, this [Torch
Dragon’s Eye] really was the most powerful divine ability within
the imperial treasury of the Grand Xia! Although this was only the
first part to the whole technique…this was still a technique that
ranked in the top hundred of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…a stone door
was pushed open. King Qi led Ji Ning and the others into the stone
room. In the center of the stone room, there were bamboo books that
was hovering in midair, emanating a dreamy light and covered with
restrictive spells.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the [Torch
Dragon’s Eye].” King Qi pointed towards a bamboo book. “The
restrictive spells covering them have been unsealed. The other ones
remain sealed; there’s no way for you to touch them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All you need to do
is touch the bamboo with your hands. The large amounts of information
contained within the bamboo will instantly be transmitted into your
soul,” King Qi said. “Fortunately, this is merely the first part
of the [Torch Dragon’s Eye], and so it won’t take too much time
to accept the transmission. For each person, it will at most take as
much time as needed to brew a pot of tea.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood. This
divine ability was one of those that increased dramatically in
difficulty at the higher levels. Most likely, the part meant for
Empyrean Gods was thousands of times more difficult than the part
meant for Void-level cultivators. In addition, the part meant for
True Gods would be thousands of times more complex than the part
meant for Empyrean Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had accepted the
complete transmission of the [Starseizing Hand], which was why it had
taken him months to do so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you come
first,” King Qi said. Ning nodded, stretching out his hand and
pressing it against the hovering bamboo book.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as he touched
it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Instantly, a
large amount of information began pouring into his soul. Although the
transmission wasn’t as efficient and fast as when he had received
the [Starseizing Hand] transmission, Ning’s soul was far more
powerful than it had been back then, and the speed at which he
accepted the data was faster as well. In just a short while, the
complete first part of the [Torch Dragon’s Eye] had been
transmitted into Ning’s soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So that’s how it
is.” Ning was secretly startled and delighted. The [Torch Dragon’s
Eye]…this was a divine ability developed by the Torch Dragon, one
of the major powers of the Three Realms. This divine ability was
extremely famous! The legends often mentioned abilities like the
[Torch Dragon’s Eye] or [Houyi Shooting the Sun]. Now, upon seeing
the real method to activate this technique and its real power, Ning
was secretly startled as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Torch Dragon’s
Eye], in short, relied on harvesting the light of the Nine Heavens
and focusing it in the eye, and then cultivating a so-called ‘innate
torch-light’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although this is
just the first part, which any Fiendgods up to the Void-level can
train in…it’s enough. After all, beyond that is the tribulation
that results in Empyrean Gods. Upon becoming an Empyrean God, I’d
be someone on the level of the Xia Emperor. I can just rely on my own
powers to search for the second part to the [Torch Dragon’s Eye].”
Ning was extraordinarily excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aside from the
[Starseizing Hand]…he had finally acquired yet another truly
powerful divine ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Adept Woodpass,
and Adept Blackstone all meditated on the contents of the [Torch
Dragon’s Eye]. Each of them felt delighted in their hearts; after
all, this was a technique comparable to the [Grand Black Tortoise]
technique. If it hadn’t been for the fact that the Torch Dragon had
perished, how could they have had a chance to learn this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright,” King Qi
suddenly said. Ning, Adept Woodpass, and Adept Blackstone all raised
their heads to look at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His Imperial Majesty
has sent word to me that Daofather Crimsonbright has chosen a
disciple. The three of you need to hurry back with me to meet his
Imperial Majesty at the main hall,” King Qi said.

Chapter 35 - Daofather’s Disciple
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Adept
Woodpass, and Adept Blackstone all felt their hearts clench. The joy
they felt upon acquiring the [Torch Dragon’s Eye] instantly fled to
the back of their minds. All three of them had the same question in
their heart: “Who did the Daofather choose? Was it me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,” King
Qi said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning and
the other two obediently followed behind him, but in their hearts,
they felt their emotions surge like the waves of the ocean.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main hall of the
Skylight Palace. The Xia Emperor’s face changed as he revealed a
look of surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it,
Xiamang?” Lu Dongbin, Seatopple, and the rest of the nine all
looked towards the Xia Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang, can it be
that the Daofather has already chosen a disciple?” Lu Dongbin
chortled as he spoke. These Pure Yang True Immortals were all clever
fellows; a simple change in expression by the Xia Emperor instantly
drew their attention and caused them to be able to guess at what had
happened. After all, given the Xia Emperor’s status, why would he
suddenly appear surprised for no reason at all?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” The Xia
Emperor laughed and nodded. “I really can’t hide anything from
you all. Indeed, my Primaltwin has visited Master, and Master just
made his choice.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who did the
Daofather choose?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These Pure Yang True
Immortals from the Celestial Court, the Buddhist Sangha, and the
Daoist Path were all filled with curiosity as they asked the Xia
Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No rush, no rush.
I’ve already sent for King Qi to bring those three little fellows
back,” the Xia Emperor laughed. “After those three little fellows
return, I’ll make the announcement.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Show-off!”
Seatopple pursed his lips, then glanced at the Sloppy Daoist. “Junior
apprentice-brother, this Conclave you participated in the world of
the Grand Xia really is quite special. You are a disciple of Master,
while Daofather Crimsonbright is going to accept a disciple as
well…the news that there were two disciples of a Daofather in a
single Conclave is most likely going to soon spread throughout the
Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sloppy Daoist just
smiled. In front of these True Immortals and Empyrean Gods, he rarely
said anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who will the
Daofather choose?” The Sloppy Daoist felt puzzlement in his heart
as well. “Will it be junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning?” In his
heart, he hoped that his own junior apprentice-brother would be the
one to be apprenticed to the Daofather. If that were to happen, then
things really would be perfect for the Black-White College this time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later. King Qi
led Ning and the other two back into the main hall. Instantly, the
gazes of the nearly thousand Celestial Immortals present swung
towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why have the three
of them returned?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that the
Daofather has already made his choice?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Immortals
instantly guessed at the reason, and they all felt nervousness in
their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Imperial
Majesty, the three have come,” King Qi said respectfully. Ji Ning,
Adept Woodpass, and Adept Blackstone stood obediently behind him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The Xia
Emperor nodded slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Qi retreated to
one side, sitting down in the lotus position in the seat he had been
in previously. Ning and the other two were now the focal point for
the entire main hall of the Skylight Palace. They found it difficult
to hide the restlessness and nervousness in their eyes. Although all
three of them were monstrous geniuses, they were still extremely
nervous right now!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor, seated
above them atop his throne, revealed a rare smile. He said in a clear
voice: “Master has already chosen a disciple amongst you three. The
disciple shall be…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When these words came
out, everyone held their breaths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gotta be Ji Ning.
Gotta be Ji Ning.” Yuchi Xiyue was tightly clenching Yu Wei’s
hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning. Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus raised her
head to watch as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t let it be Ji
Ning. Don’t let it be him!” Patriarch Arcanum’s narrow eyes
were filled with frantic worry. If Ji Ning became the Daofather’s
disciple, then in the future, he would most likely prove to become a
true disaster for the Youngflame clan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many people were
waiting silently. Some hoped it would be Ning; others hoped it would
be Adept Woodpass; still others hoped it would be Adept Blackstone.
They each had their own supporters and detractors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the world of the
Grand Xia to give birth to a new disciple of a Daofather was
something that would completely, fundamentally change the balance of
power in the entire Grand Xia Dynasty.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor’s
gaze swept downwards, pausing to intentionally prolong the tension.
Only upon seeing Seatopple glare angrily at him and Lu Dongbin rub
his nose did the Xia Emperor declare, “The Daofather’s chosen
disciple is…Adept Woodpass!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept Woodpass!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor’s
voice echoed within the entire main hall. For a moment, the entire
main hall was completely silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept Woodpass!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Daofather’s
disciple…Adept Woodpass!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept Woodpass!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In perfect unison, all
of the Celestial Immortals and eliminiated Wanxiang Adepts within the
main hall all turned their gazes towards the simple, honest-looking
youth, Adept Woodpass. For a time, all of the Celestial Immortals
found it difficult to mask the envy and desire they felt. They knew
very well that this honest-looking youth’s status had just soared
into the heavens!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daofather’s
disciple! Adept Woodpass!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this instant, Adept
Woodpass had become the most dazzling figure in the entire Skylight
Palace!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was actually
Adept Woodpass!” Yuchi Xiyue, Yu Wei, the Sloppy Daoist, and some
others all turned to look at Ji Ning. They felt unhappy on Ning’s
behalf.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had already tried
his best. He was the youngest of the three, and was number one in
this Conclave. Why hadn’t he been chosen?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, they didn’t
argue against this decision, because the decision was Daofather
Crimsonbright’s! Only the person who the Daofather took a favoring
to would be chosen…and that person didn’t necessarily have to be
number one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Daofather’s
chosen disciple is…Adept Woodpass!” The voice rang out in Ning’s
ears. He felt dazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For an extremely brief
moment, Ning’s entire mind went blank. However, he quickly came
back to consciousness. Although he was clear-headed now, in his
heart, he still felt countless emotions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why would it be him?
Why did the Daofather choose him?” Ning’s heart was filled with
urgency, resentment, rage…and helplessness!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was helpless. Truly
helpless. The choice of a disciple was up to the Daofather; no matter
how dazzling Ning had proven himself to be, if the Daofather didn’t
like him, it was all for nothing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I had completely
exposed my [Starseizing Hand], then perhaps Daofather Crimsonbright
would have chosen me.” This thought suddenly came to Ning’s
mind…but it was nothing more than a disgruntled thought. Ning knew
very well that given how many people were watching this Conclave, as
soon as his [Starseizing Hand] was revealed, the after-effects would
be completely unpredictable!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms were
currently filled with turbulent undercurrents that were simply too
mysterious. Daoist Threelives’ status was unknown. Ning didn’t
dare take this risk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
brother Woodpass.” Ning immediately turned to the nearby Adept
Woodpass, expressing his congratulations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On his other side was
Adept Blackstone, who had an extremely complicated look in his eyes.
Upon hearing Ning’s words, he immediately came to his own senses.
In his heart, he secretly felt ashamed; in the face of this mental
blow, he had actually taken longer to recover than Ji Ning, who had
trained for just thirty or so years. But no matter what…he hadn’t
been chosen. It was guaranteed that two of them would be eliminated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
brother Woodpass,” Adept Blackstone said as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Woodpass’s eyes
were filled with joy. He immediately said, “Brother Ji Ning,
brother Blackstone, I was just lucky. Neither of you are inferior to
me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor, seated
on his throne, nodded slightly upon seeing this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and
Blackstone’s Dao-hearts were fairly formidable. The chance of
becoming the Daofather’s disciple had suddenly disappeared; this
was a tremendous blow that would cause some people’s Dao-hearts to
completely crumble, and perhaps even cause them to go insane. For Ji
Ning and Adept Blackstone to be able to quickly recover from this
blow and regain their faculties…they did indeed live up to being
top of the top three contestants in this Conclave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning,
Blackstone,” the Xia Emperor said. “The two of you don’t need
to be depressed. I told you that the two of you will both be able to
apprentice yourselves to a Pure Yang True Immortal! I will help you
select a suitable master…and if others do not take you in, then I,
Xiamang Xun, will personally take you on as my disciples. However, I
do not travel on the Dao of the Sword, nor do I travel on the Dao of
Formations. I’m not necessarily the best suited master for you two.
Go and spend three days in the imperial capital first. Within three
days, I’ll send someone to meet you two.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, your
Imperial Majesty.” Ning and Adept Blackstone both responded
respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you can
leave now,” the Xia Emperor said. He was quite favorably disposed
towards both Ji Ning and Adept Blackstone. The attack on the Six
Paths of Reincarnation and its collapse…the fact that this Conclave
gave birth to two Daofather’s disciples…the Xia Emperor felt
increasingly certain that this Conclave was going to give birth to
future heroes of the Three Realms. Ji Ning and Adept Blackstone both
had this potential!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Woodpass, go ahead and seat yourself next to
junior apprentice-brother Sovereign Hao,” the Xia Emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Woodpass couldn’t
breath. ‘Junior apprentice-brother’? The Xia Emperor had just
referred to him as junior apprentice-brother? Adept Woodpass now
truly understood…that from today onwards, his destiny had indeed
been completely changed. He truly was about to soar into the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Adept
Woodpass obediently walked forward. Sovereign Hao grabbed him and
pulled him over to sit next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Only now did
Adept Woodpass see Empyrean God Seatopple, as well as the Sloppy
Daoist who was beside him. “Why is the Sloppy Daoist sitting here
as well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This place was a place
where the True Immortals and Empyrean Gods were seated; not even the
Celestial Immortals were permitted to come close. Why was the Sloppy
Daoist here? And who was this man dressed in deep green Flood Dragon
armor?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was seated back
before King Yan once more. King Yan consoled him, “Ji Ning, don’t
feel dispirited. After all, you shall still become the disciple of a
Pure Yang True Immortal. Even if there are no suitable ones…you
will at least become his Imperial Majesty’s personal disciple. For
him to become your master means that in the future, you will have no
troubles at all within the world of the Grand Xia Dynasty. You will
no longer need to fear the Youngflame clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded lightly.
Since he couldn’t become the Daofather’s disciple, then all he
could do was lower his expectations for now. Pure Yang True Immortals
were truly formidable figures of the Three Realms as well. Perhaps
they might know about whether Daoist Threelives was alive or not. In
addition, with a Pure Yang True Immortal as his master, he would have
a powerful backer in the future!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Yuchi
Xiyue looked towards Ning with concern.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Yu Wei
looked towards him as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of them were
worried about him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, after sitting
down, smiled gently. “There’s no way I can change the Daofather’s
decision on whether or not too choose me! No matter what, I’ve
already done all I can.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Both Yu
Wei and Xiyue let out sighs of relief. Ning’s Dao-heart was even
more firm and strong than they had expected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning then looked
towards the place where the True Immortals and Empyrean Gods were
gathered. He immediately whispered, “Why is eldest
apprentice-brother seated over there? Who is that fellow dressed in
the dark green Flood Dragon armor in front of him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei and Xiyue
exchanged a glance. Xiyue spoke out, “When you went to choose a
divine ability, that Empyrean God known as Seatopple arrived. He is
the disciple of Grand Emperor Xuanwu, and he has come to this
Conclave for the express purpose of bringing back the Sloppy Daoist.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s taking him
away?” Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei said, “You
didn’t see it, Ji Ning. Everyone in the main hall was talking about
it earlier. The divine ability which eldest apprentice-brother uses
is known as the ‘Grand Black Tortoise’ divine ability, which was
created by Grand Emperor Xuanwu, one of the major powers of the Three
Realms. In reality…he had been chosen by Grand Emperor Xuanwu long
ago to be his disciple. After this Conclave, he is going to be taken
before Grand Emperor Xuanwu and truly taught the Dao.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning was
stunned. Woodpass was a major power’s disciple, and now the Sloppy
Daoist was becoming one as well?
</P>

Chapter 36 - Lu Dongbin Accepts a Disciple
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Adept
Blackstone, and Adept Woodpass quickly came to understand the
situation. It wasn’t so bad for Adept Woodpass, but Ji Ning and
Adept Blackstone found it hard to refrain from feeling envy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Becoming a Daofather’s
disciple! Aside from personal effort, luck was another part of it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang,”
Seatopple said, puzzled. “I heard you say earlier that it seems as
though of the three, Ji Ning is the youngest. In addition, he also
became number one in this Conclave. In turn, Blackstone is a
grandmaster in formations. Why would the Daofather end up choosing
Adept Woodpass?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How should I know?”
The Xia Emperor shook his head. However, in his heart, the Xia
Emperor thought back to his Primaltwin’s visit with Daofather
Crimsonbright.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Beyond the Three
Realms, within the infinite void. There was a mountain that was
hovering within the void. The mountain was a million kilometers in
size, and it was filled with palaces. This was the place where
Daofather Crimsonbright, a major power of the Three Realms, resided.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, here are the
recordings of the top three youths who participated in this Conclave
of Immortal Destiny.” The white-robed Xia Emperor stood there
respectfully while handing over a scroll.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Off in the distance,
there was an elder with long azure hair seated in the lotus position
atop a stone. The void around the place where he was seated seemed to
be incomparably stable and steady.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-haired elder
nodded gently. The scroll instantly unfurled, its surface flashing
through the images of those three duels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh…the scene of
the first battle suddenly turned dramatic and exciting. Instantly,
the battle between Ji Ning and Adept Blackstone began to proceed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The
azure-haired elder revealed a hint of a smile as he nodded lightly.
“This young fellow who uses formations truly is quite remarkable in
this respect. If he were to focus on it, in the future, he would most
likely become a true grandmaster of the Dao of Formations! By relying
on the Dao of Formations, he has a chance of overcome the Celestial
Tribulation and becoming a Celestial Immortal. He is worth
nurturing!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The young fellow who
uses the sword isn’t bad either. His sword-intent is quite
formidable; he should be an excellent potential Sword Immortal,”
the azure-haired elder said in praise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Xia
Emperor said respectfully, “Master, of the final three in this
Conclave, the number one victor is the sword-wielding one. His name
is Ji Ning, and he has only trained for thirty years. This formations
wielder is known as Blackstone; he ranked number three, and has spent
a hundred years in his training. As for the last one, his name was
Adept Woodpass. He ranked number two in this Conclave, and has
trained for more than three hundred years!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thirty years?”
Daofather Crimsonbright was surprised. He nodded lightly, a look of
delight appearing in his eyes. “It seems his talent in the Dao of
the Sword is quite astonishing. He’s worth nurturing as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Xia
Emperor nodded lightly as well. That went without saying. Even Lu
Dongbin had grown intrigued, and he was someone who was quite skilled
at guiding disciples, and who had exceptional judgment. He had taken
a liking to Ji Ning…and had long ago praised him as being a genius
in the Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Daofather
Crimsonbright flicked through to the second battle. This was between
Adept Woodpass and Adept Blackstone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon seeing seeing this
battle, Daofather Crimsonbright’s eyes lit up. He immediately
flicked through to the third battle, the one between Ji Ning and
Adept Woodpass.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good, good, good.”
Daofather Crimsonbright said the word ‘good’ three times in a
row.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Xia
Emperor was immediately surprised and perplexed. Who was Daofather
Crimsonbright praising? Was it Ji Ning?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, there was
someone else in this Conclave known as the Sloppy Daoist. He is the
disciple of Grand Emperor Xuanwu, and has trained for a hundred
years. The Sloppy Daoist was actually himself kept in the dark, and
had no idea that he was the Grand Emperor’s disciple. In the end,
Seatopple personally came to receive him back to meet with Grand
Emperor Xuanwu,” the white-robed Xia Emperor added.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Turtle-Snake’s
disciple?” Daofather Crimsonbright was curious. “Do you have a
scryer recording?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I do.” Since the
white-robed Xia Emperor had mentioned the Sloppy Daoist, he naturally
had come prepared. He immediately offered yet another scroll, this
one with multiple battles recorded, including that between Adept
Woodpass and the Sloppy Daoist, where the Sloppy Daoist had been
defeated in the end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After viewing that
battle, Daofather Crimsonbright couldn’t help but laugh. “Hahaha,
that old Turtle-Snake’s temperament is very similar to mine, and
his judgment is the same. This Sloppy Daoist that he chose…he is
quite low-key and quite reliable, with a solid, deep foundation that
has no flaws. Although in his youth he may have seemed to be slow in
training, as time passes…his deep, solid foundation will allow his
Immortal path to be a long and stable one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Woodpass and this
Sloppy have almost identical Immortal cultivation paths,” Daofather
Crimsonbright nodded with a sigh. “Both have incomparably perfect
and stable foundations, and both have extremely strong Dao-hearts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Xia
Emperor was startled. Judging from these words…it seemed as though
his master favored Adept Woodpass.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather, can it be
that you are going to choose Adept Woodpass?” The white-robed Xia
Emperor couldn’t help but speak out. He had spent the most time
training out of the top three.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember,”
Daofather Crimsonbright said with a calm laugh, “Don’t just judge
a person just by his temporary prominence. The path of Immortal
cultivation is an incomparably long and limitless one…and these
three have just embarked on it a short while ago. In choosing a
disciple, one must see through the present and into the infinite
future.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thirty years? A
hundred years? Three hundred years? In the fact of the long Immortal
path, these timeframes are nothing,” Daofather Crimsonbright said.
“The Sloppy Daoist and Adept Woodpath are both unrushed and stable,
with calm, leisurely dispositions! Just by looking at their combat
styles, I can tell that they didn’t waste any of their attention on
small tricks and benefits.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Xia
Emperor nodded. Indeed, the Sloppy Daoist and Adept Woodpass were
quite similar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This sort of
temperament is the best sort of mentality and heart for an Immortal
cultivator,” Daofather Crimsonbright said with a laugh. “Or at
least, it’s the sort that I and the old Turtle-Snake favor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Crimsonbright
was an extremely good-natured person; everyone knew this. As the
saying goes, when a turtle sees a pea, he would like it for its
color! Daofather Crimsonbright favored Woodpass for his heart and
mind. He knew very well that although the Immortal path required a
certain degree of comprehension ability and talent, towards the later
parts of the path, it required even more regarding one’s mind and
Dao-heart!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’ll be
Woodpass,” Daofather Crimsonbright nodded. “As for the other two,
they are moldable talents as well. Go and seek out your fellow
disciples and see which of them are willing to accept these two as
disciples. The Three Realms are in a state of upheaval; perhaps my
gaze has gone astray and either Ji Ning or Adept Blackstone shall
become formidable in the future as well. Thus, we should still bring
them into my Crimsonbright League!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” the
white-robed Xia Emperor nodded. “Ji Ning is a Sword Immortal. I
shall go seek out junior apprentice-brother Evergreen! Junior
apprentice-brother Evergreen is a Sword Immortal as well. As for this
Blackstone…it seems as though none of us are truly peerless with
regards to the Dao of Formations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you can’t find
anyone suitable, then you can accept this Blackstone yourself.
Although your talent in formations isn’t amongst the top within the
Three Realms, it is more than enough to teach this Blackstone,”
Daofather Crimsonbright said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Xia
Emperor nodded in acknowledgment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Back within the main
hall of the Skylight Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amongst the True
Immortals and Empyrean Gods, Lu Dongbin was the strongest. He was
ranked at the very top amongst the Pure Yang True Immortals of the
Three Realms, and was a peerless Sword Immortal who had an extremely
good chance of becoming a Daofather of the Great Firmament.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Daofathers
supporting him…they were Lieges of the Daoist Path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was viewed with
great favor by those two Daofathers, and had even produced a disciple
who became a Pure Yang True Immortal. Lu Dongbin’s vision was
particularly astute! Long before the others had realized how special
Ji Ning was, Lu Dongbin had been able to somewhat sense it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang,” Lu
Dongbin said with a laugh, “Since Daofather Crimsonbright has not
accepted Ji Ning as his disciple, then I’ll shamelessly raise this
topic again; Ji Ning truly has exceptional potential as a Sword
Immortal, and I like him very much. I wonder, Xiamang, if you would
ber willing to give me some face and let me take Ji Ning. I truly do
want to take on this disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lu Dongbin…” The
Xia Emperor shook his head. “Although Master didn’t choose Ji
Ning, he still praised him multiple times. So…please don’t make
things hard for me, Lu Dongbin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang, it is just
a Wanxiang Adept.” Empyrean God Seatopple pursed his lips. “Since
Eastflower has asked this of you…can it be that Eastflower’s face
is worth less than a young Wanxiang Adept? In addition, your
Crimsonbright League only has a single Pure Yang Sword Immortal,
Immortal Evergreen, right? Immortal Evergreen isn’t a good teacher;
it’s been so many years, but I’ve never heard of him producing a
single Celestial Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The corners of the Xia
Emperor’s eyes twitched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since Eastflower has
made the request, just give him some face, Xiamang,” the Immortal
Elder of the Northlands spoke out as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the beginning, Lu
Dongbin had mentioned this in a joking way, but had been refused. But
this time…he was being extremely serious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin had many
good friends. He was very influential, and his backers were very
powerful. All of the True Immortals and Empyrean Gods present aside
from Sovereign Hao, who was also Daofather Crimsonbright’s
disciple, were speaking out on his behalf.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang, you know
what sort of a temperament I have. I’ve always been a blunt,
straight-talker. I truly am intrigued by this Ji Ning, and I want to
take him on as my disciple. Xiamang, help me out here. I’ll owe you
a favor and I won’t forget it. What do you say?” Lu Dongbin spoke
out earnestly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor was
startled. A favor from Lu Dongbin? That was quite valuable indeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…Daofather’s
Crimsonbright’s words remained within his mind. Although the
Daofather hadn’t chosen Ji Ning and Blackstone, he still had a very
good impression of them. He had said that perhaps Ji Ning and
Blackstone would also be quite astonishing in the future…and that
they had to be brought into the Crimsonbright League.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lu Dongbin, it’s
not that I won’t allow it, it is that Master has given his orders.”
The Xia Emperor shook his head. “There’s nothing I can do.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor could
tell that Lu Dongbin was unhappy…but there was nothing he could do
about it. He had to make this refusal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin shook his
head and sighed. It seemed as though he truly was not destined to
become Ji Ning’s master! He didn’t dare to actually kidnap and
forcibly take away Ji Ning…after all, that would be the equivalent
of slapping Daofather Crimsonbright directly in the face! A Daofather
who had emerged from the primordial chaos and had survived into the
present era…he absolutely would not offend such a person for no
good reason.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then Ji Ning’s
Dao-companion, Yu Wei. I rather like this little lady as well. If I
take her as my disciple, you won’t stop me, will you Xiamang?” Lu
Dongbin said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, that’s a
small matter. Lu Dongbin, you can pick anyone you want from outside
the top ninety-six. Even if you choose them all, it’d be fine.”
The Xia Emperor spoke out in a very magnanimous way. He knew that he
had caused Lu Dongbin to feel unhappy, and so he naturally now spoke
out in a way to make him feel better.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin nodded, then
turned his gaze towards King Yan’s side, towards Yu Wei. She was
currently holding hands with Ji Ning and whispering with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little girl, come
over here,” Lu Dongbin smiled towards Yu Wei. His voice rang out
directly within her ears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Yu Wei was
startled. Raising her head to look over, she immediately saw that the
Xia Emperor and the others were all looking towards her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yu Wei, come here,”
the Xia Emperor said as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did Yu Wei,
rather puzzled and lost, rise to her feet. She began to walk towards
them…and in doing so, caused quite a few of the Celestial Immortals
and Wanxiang Adepts present to pay attention to her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little girl,” Lu
Dongbin said with a laugh as he looked at Yu Wei, “I, Lu Dongbin,
wish to take you on as a disciple. Are you willing?”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 37 - Sword Immortal Evergreen
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin didn’t
mask his voice at all. It echoed throughout the entire main hall of
the Skylight Palace, and all of the nearly thousand Celestial
Immortals as well as the various Wanxiang Adepts were all
incomparably surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Exalted Immortal
Eastflower is taking on that little girl of the Black-White College?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why is Lu Dongbin
taking on this little girl?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lu Dongbin’s
judgment is exceptional. Even I would like to take him on as a
master, but he wouldn’t even look at me! But why is it that today…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many of the Celestial
Immortals present were rather jealous. Becoming the disciple of a
Daofather was a stroke of tremendous karmic fortune! They didn’t
even dare to dream of such a thing, and so most of them actually
hoped for becoming a disciple of a Pure Yang True Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin was one of
the very top True Immortals or Empyrean Gods, and his background was
incredible as well. He was also superb at teaching his students! He
was a passionate man, and whenever he took on a disciple, he would
use all his heart in training them. Compared to him, many of the
other True Immortals or Empyrean Gods were focusing on training in
the Dao, and didn’t care as much about their disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lu Dongbin?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The legendary Lu
Dongbin?” The Wanxiang Adepts, such as Adept Ninedeaths, Cangwu
Jiu, Xiangtian Xiao, Youngflame Zhan, and the others all turned
red-eyed with jealousy. They had fought into the top ninety-six, and
some had even fought into the top twelve or top six!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin’s fame was
such that even many ordinary mortals and commoners had heard of it.
This was because figures such as Houyi, Father Kua, and the Eight
Immortals of the High Caves were simply too famous and too well-known
in the legends. As for Lu Dongbin…he was the leader of the Eight
Immortals of the High Caves!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they were
red-eyed with jealousy, the Celestial Immortals all knew that this
was the type of person Lu Dongbin was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you willing?”
Lu Dongbin asked once again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei was stunned.
This sudden, unexpected surprise had made her somewhat speechless. Of
course she was willing! Who wouldn’t be willing to be an apprentice
to Lu Dongbin? This was something that was second to only becoming a
Daofather’s disciple!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But she had just become
Dao-companions with Ji Ning…were they going to be separated just
like this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei turned her head
to look towards the distant Ning. Ning understood what she was
feeling. Although he couldn’t bear to let her go, he knew that Yu
Wei was also a person whose heart was focused on the Dao. He nodded
gently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t feel too
much regret for your little lover.” Lu Dongbin saw Yu Wei turn her
head towards Ji Ning. He explained, “Your little lover is
definitely going to become an apprentice to a True Immortal or
Empyrean God as well; he’s definitely going to spend some time by
their side. And so, regardless of whether or not you accept me as
your master, in a short period of time, Ji Ning himself will depart
from the world of the Grand Xia.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei now understood.
She gave the distant Ning another glance. Ning himself repeatedly
gestured with his eyes at her while nodding.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can I ask how long
it will be?” Yu Wei asked nervously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At least a few
decades, at most a century,” Lu Dongbin said with a laugh. “Don’t
worry; once I hear that Ji Ning has returned to the world of the
Grand Xia, I will soon let you come back and reunite with your little
lover.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei said with
desire, “Then can Ji Ning take you on as his master as well?” She
knew that Lu Dongbin was a Sword Immortal; he was quite suited to
teach Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want that too,”
Lu Dongbin said, shaking his head and sighing. “But unfortunately,
this Grand Xia Emperor of yours won’t allow it no matter what.”
As he spoke, he gave the Xia Emperor a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor just
sat there smiling, not saying a single word. Clearly…there was no
room for discussion on this at all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei nodded. She no
longer hesitated at all. Falling to her knees, she called out
respectfully, “Your disciple greets you, Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” Lu
Dongbin began to laugh loudly. “Good, good, good. To be able to
take on a good disciple such as you…this trip of mine to this
Conclave was worth it. Yu Wei, go spend some more time with your
little lover; in a short while, when the Conclave concludes, we shall
leave this world of the Grand Xia.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.” Yu
Wei once more headed right back to Ning’s side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yu Wei,
congratulations.” Yuchi Xiyue was very happy for Yu Wei. Her
cousin’s Dao-companion had become Lu Dongbin’s apprentice; this
was a joyous matter indeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, after this
Conclave concludes, the True Immortals and Empyrean Gods will leave.
Master will take me away from this world of the Grand Xia as well.”
Yu Wei had a look of longing in her eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gently took Yu
Wei’s hand in his own. “Both of our hearts are focused on the
Dao. An opportunity like this is rare; how can we let it pass by? In
addition, I’m going to be apprenticed to a True Immortal or
Empyrean God as well. By then, I’ll be stayed permanently by
Master’s side…and I too shall leave this world of the Grand Xia.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he wasn’t
going to be able to become a Daofather’s apprentice…by becoming a
True Immortal or Empyrean God’s apprentice, he would still have a
powerful backer! He would also learn more about the various powers
within the Three Realms! Ning had already decided to spend some time
alongside the True Immortal or Empyrean God and focus on training
with him or her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei nodded. “Master
said the same thing. He will probably take me away for a few decades,
no more than a century. Once you come back, Ji Ning…Master will
know and will quickly release me as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll both work
hard,” Ning said softly. “We are both going to overcome the
Celestial Tribulation and become Celestial Immortals. We truly be
together for eternity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Together for
eternity.” Yu Wei nodded as well, her eyes slightly red. To be by
the side of her lover for all eternity…how beautiful that would be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But can I truly be
together for eternity with Ji Ning?” Yu Wei once more thought back
to her past life, and her heart began to be filled with a surge of
terror. “…no matter what, I will rather let my soul be destroyed
than harm Ji Ning in the slightest. At least before I die…everything
will be perfect.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within one of the
trillion minor worlds of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a beautiful
world with fragrant flowers and chirping birds. The people were
simple folk. Although the world was separated into three nations,
they usually just engaged in shouting matches against each other.
Occasionally, some Immortal cultivators would compete against each
other in order to win some advantages for their respective nations,
but actual large-scale wars were very rare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A tear in space
appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Xia
Emperor strode out from the void. Upon arriving within this minor
world, he soon headed towards a mountain. Atop the mountain, there
was a Daoist monastery, known as the Evergreen Monastery. Evergreen
Monastery was extremely ordinary, and in this minor world very few
knew of it. It was only known in the nearby counties and towns.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How could the people of
this minor world have any idea that within this Evergreen Monastery,
there was a truly exalted and peerless Sword Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Evergreen, so all you do is train in the Dao
alongside your four or five novices within this crappy monastery?”
The white-robed Xia Emperor went to the back of the monastery, where
several farm plots were located. A young man was next to a pool of
water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can manage your
major world. As for myself, I have nothing holding me back. Why
should I trouble myself with various things?” The young man said
calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What about your
disciples?” The white-robed Xia Emperor shook his head. “If you
are going to stay in this monastery, why don’t you bring those
disciples of yours over and give them some good tutelage.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Teachers can show
you the way, but cultivation relies on one’s own abilities. I
guided them for ten years and taught everything which I should’ve
taught. It is enough. As for what they will end up like, and as for
whether or not they will become Celestial Immortals…there’s
nothing more I can do.” The young man sat down casually, scooping
up a ladle of water from the water bucket in front of him and
drinking it. He sighed to himself, “Such sweet water.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Xia
Emperor felt resigned. Anyone capable of becoming a True Immortal or
an Empyrean God was an expert of the Three Realms; even the Celestial
Court would have to treat them with courtesy. Every person had a
different personality. He was unable to persuade this junior
apprentice-brother of his.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve come on
Master’s orders,” the white-robed Xia Emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master?” The young
man immediately became serious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Xia
Emperor said. “You know that three or so decades ago, the Six
Realms of Reincarnation suffered an attack and collapsed. The Three
Realms are filled with hidden, dangerous undercurrents. A major storm
is most likely coming, and it is unavoidable. And…the more chaotic
an era, the more heroes will emerge from it into the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The young man nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Grand Xia world
is blessed by karmic luck. During this Conclave of Immortal Destiny,
even Master choose one of the top three to be his disciple, a man
named Adept Woodpass. Even a disciple of Grand Emperor Xuanwu
appeared in this Conclave,” the white-robed Xia Emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The
white-robed man said in surprise, “One Conclave, two Daofather
disciples?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to
Master’s instructions, all three of the top three in this Conclave
are to be brought into our Crimsonbright League. Master himself chose
Adept Woodpass, while the other two are known as Adept Blackstone and
Ji Ning. Ji Ning is a potential peerless Sword Immortal; he’s only
trained for thirty years, and even Lu Dongbin wanted to take him as a
disciple. I didn’t let that happen, though. In addition…he was
born shortly after the Six Paths of Reincarnation were destroyed.
Perhaps he truly is blessed by tremendous luck,” the white-robed
Xia Emperor said in a persuasive manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to try and
sway me.” The young man shook his head. “Whether or not Lu
Dongbin takes on a disciple has nothing to do with me. That
personality of his…he can even take on ordinary mortals as
disciples. As for the fact that this Ji Ning has trained for just
thirty years, and was born shortly after the collapse of the Six
Paths of Reincarnation…that’s an utter joke!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The reason why
heroes emerge from periods of chaos in the Three Realms is because
those periods are periods of constant battle. Many experts will die,
and their luck will dissipate from them and gather around others…”
The young man continued, “With each storm in the Three Realms, old
experts fall and new experts rise. Even some Daofathers fall, while
new Daofathers emerge. The total number of experts in the Three
Realms has remained constant.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whether or not one
will become an expert depends entirely on whether or not one can
seize the right opportunity during periods of chaos in the Three
Realms!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for the time of
their birth? Hmph, try that line on someone else.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The young man wasn’t
swayed in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Xia
Emperor could only laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even Daofathers could
re-establish the cycle of reincarnation! Everyone knew what the
secrets of reincarnation were. A person’s destiny, however, wasn’t
determined by their birth; what mattered was what happened to them
after it! Nobody was guaranteed to be a Daofather upon birth! There
was no such thing. At most, one might be born into a good family,
thanks to good karma stored up from a past life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And, senior
apprentice-brother…it’s not that I want to criticize you,” the
young man said, “But so what if a storm is coming to the Three
Realms? Whether or not one takes on a disciple doesn’t matter at
all. What matters is one’s personal power!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The only ones we can
trust, that we can control, are ourselves!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciples can turn
traitor. Subordinates can turn traitor. Even friends can stab you in
the back…only by increasing your own power can you fundamentally
grow strong,” the young man said. “As far as I am concerned, this
period of chaos in the Three Realms is a chance for me, Evergreen, to
break through to become a Daofather of the Great Firmament. As for
taking on disciples? Even if my disciple trained to become a
Daofather, it wouldn’t mean a damn thing for me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Xia
Emperor no longer said anything. He and Sword Immortal Evergreen were
on two completely different paths; he himself was born from the
lineage of the Primordial Imperial Clan, and so his way of thinking
was naturally different. He immediately took out a scroll. “Take a
look. These are the scenes of Ji Ning’s duels.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The scroll unfurled.
One scene of battle appeared after another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Sword Immortal?”
The young man nodded. He gave the white-robed Xia Empror a small
azure sword. “This kid truly is quite talented. Since Master has
ordered it, then I shall take on this Ji Ning as my apprentice. This
is my talisman; arrange for someone to give it to him. If he is
willing to take me on as Master, then let him crush it within ten
days, and I will go find him. After ten days, the talisman will
automatically dissipate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if a master was
willing to accept an apprentice, the apprentice also had to be
willing to take on this master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin had needed
to ask Yu Wei for her agreement. The same was true for Sword Immortal
Evergreen. If Ji Ning wasn’t willing…then given his arrogance as
a Pure Yang True Immortal, he naturally wouldn’t run over to beg
Ning to accept him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The
white-robed Xia Emperor accepted the little azure sword, then said
with a laugh, “Then junior apprentice-brother, I won’t disturb
your leisurely life in your monastery any more.” After speaking, he
vanished into thin air.

Chapter 38 - A Friend Comes From Afar
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Conclave of
Immortal Destiny had concluded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Skylight Palace.
The various Celestial Immortals were all beginning to leave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s rare that I’m
allowed out, but I have to go back now.” Empyrean God Seatopple
opened his mouth, and all of the platters of delicacies on his table
flew into his mouth. He then rubbed his belly, then said in
satisfaction, “Xiamang, Eastflower, everyone, I’m going to take
my junior apprentice-brother back now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, he pulled the
Sloppy Daoist by the arm. Whoosh! He flew onto a cloud and
disappeared deep into the depths of the sky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go,
apprentice,” Lu Dongbin said as he looked towards Yu Wei, who was
next to Ji Ning in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei and Ning were
speaking to each other. Upon hearing Lu Dongbin urge her to leave,
she couldn’t help but feel even more reluctant to part from Ning.
She gave him a tight hug, and Ning held her in his arms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could sense Yu Wei’s
heart. This was a woman with a cold exterior but a scorchingly hot
heart. Upon becoming Dao-companions with her, he could sense the
warmth of her heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait for me,” Yu
Wei said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning pressed his face
against Yu Wei’s, feeling the warmth of her skin. He whispered back
gently, “Gotta. I swear it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need for oaths.”
Yu Wei released Ning, tears appearing in her eyes. “I believe you.”
And then, she turned and ran to Lu Dongbin’s side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sorry for making you
wait so long, Master,” Yu Wei said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Silly child, silly
child.” Lu Dongbin shook his head and sighed. A cloud appeared
beneath their feet, and they too quickly flew into the skies and
disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised his head to
watch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the cloud, Yu Wei
lowered her head to look at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their gazes met…but
soon afterwards, the cloud completely disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After this
departure…they had no idea how long it would be before they met
again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister Yu Wei and Ji Ning…they are very suited to each
other.” Ninelotus looked at Ning and Yu Wei, at the looks in their
eyes as they parted. Their gazes were filled with longing and a
reluctance to part. “The feelings between them are deeper than the
feelings between myself and Ji Ning had been. My heart and Ji Ning’s
heart…they were never so close.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We should leave as
well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bodhisattva
Mahasthamaprapta, the Immortal Elder of the Northlands, and the
others all flew away gracefully as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Woodpass, come with me to meet Master.” The Xia
Emperor left alongside Adept Woodpass.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the nearly
thousand Celestial Immortals present all began to depart as well. Ji
Ning and Yuchi Xiyue departed alongside King Yan, while Ninelotus
left alongside the Dongyan Forefather.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Per King Qi’s
command, the delegations from the 3600 commanderies and Four Seas
began to leave in an orderly fashion. As for Ji Ning, he flew back to
return to the Stillwater Commandery’s delegation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning! The
champion of the Conclave!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept Darknorth!”
The delegates of Stillwater Commandery saw Ji Ning fly down from the
skies. Instantly, they began to call out in celebration.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They didn’t know
about the matter of the Daofather accepting a disciple. All they knew
was that Ji Ning was the champion of this entire Conclave! This was
an incomparable glory, a proud moment for the entire Stillwater
Commandery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Little
Qing transformed into a streak of light that flew towards Ning, then
wrapped herself around Ning’s arm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, child.” The
Whitewater Hound flew to Ning’s side as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Qing. Uncle
White.” Ji Ning was feeling rather miserable due to Yu Wei’s
temporary departure. He immediately felt much better; at least Little
Qing and Uncle White would continue to accompany him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Ji Ning, you are too awesome.” Mu Northson
called out excitedly, “The champion of the Conclave. The champion!
The entire world of the Grand Xia has 3600 commanderies, as well as
countless islands in the Four Seas. You’ve only trained for thirty
years, but you actually seized the championship. You are too awesome.
The person I admire most in the world is you, senior
apprentice-brother!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
junior apprentice-brother Ji Ning,” Adept Vastriver said as he and
others came over as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
Northmont Baiwei walked over as well, delight on his face. He pounded
Ji Ning on the chest. “What a fellow. When you first said you were
participating in the Conclave, I actually tried to stop you. It seems
I underestimated you! You are so formidable that you actually were
able to become the champion of this Conclave. You are now a truly
major figure in our Stillwater Commandery; in fact, your name will be
ringing throughout the entire Grand Xia Dynasty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could only laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If this Conclave of
Immortal Destiny had only been an ordinary one, then he would indeed
feel quite delighted. But the most important part of this Conclave
had been the Daofather’s choice of a disciple. As for the empty
title of ‘champion’, it wasn’t that important. Sadly…he
wasn’t able to be apprenticed to the Daofather.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, our
Black-White College has really gained a lot of face this time,”
Immortal Fivecraze said in a gratified manner. “Both you and little
Sloppy entered the top six, and you even became champion. Haha…our
Black-White College has to memorialize this occasion. Even after a
million years, even after a hundred million years…so long as our
Black-White College still exists, we’ll make sure that those who
come after us know of this matter. This is the pride of our
Black-White College!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is eldest
apprentice-brother?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is senior
apprentice-brother Sloppy?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And senior
apprentice-sister Yu Wei, where is senior apprentice-sister Yu Wei?”
One question after another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sent mentally to
Immortal Fivecraze, “Eldest apprentice-brother was accepted as a
disciple by a Daofather, Grand Emperor Xuanwu, while Yu Wei was
accepted as a disciple by a Pure Yang True Immortal, Lu Dongbin. They
have all been taken away from this major world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What…” Immortal
Fivecraze was greatly shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Grand Emperor Xuanwu?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fivecraze was the
longest living Loose Immortal the Black-White College currently had.
He had met Celestial Immortals before, and had a vague understanding
of the Three Realms. He knew what it meant for a person to become a
Daofather’s disciple. Lu Dongbin accepting Yu Wei as a disciple was
also an earth-shaking matter for the Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood. Don’t
let anyone learn of this,” Immortal Fivecraze said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And you?” Immortal
Fivecraze sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I should be arranged
to be apprenticed to a Pure Yang True Immortal,” Ning sent. “The
Xia Emperor told me to spend three days in the imperial capital to
await word.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon the conclusion of
this Conclave, the various Celestial Immortals all departed. A long
time later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh. In the air
above the imperial capital. Deep within the void. A tunnel was ripped
in space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed youth
with long, unbound hair leisurely strolled out from this corridor. He
stared downwards, his gaze passing through space and seeing the vast
imperial capital of the Grand Xia before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grand Xia?” The
white-robed youth nodded gently. He quickly moved through the void,
descending into the imperial capital.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He walked forward in a
very relaxed manner. A short time later, he arrived outside King
Yan’s Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.” Outside King Yan’s Estate, Ning gave
Northson a hug, then separated. “Both myself and your senior
apprentice-sister Yu Wei will be apprenticed to a Pure Yang True
Immortal. Once the Xia Emperor’s notification comes, I trust that I
will soon follow the True Immortal to leave this major world of the
Grand Xia. After this departure, it may be decades or a century
before I return. It will be many years before we two brothers shall
meet again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of his fellow
disciples, Ning had the closest relationship with Northson. They were
true, lifelong brothers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, you are following a Pure Yang True Immortal in
order to overcome the Celestial Tribulation and become a Celestial
Immortal. This is a good thing.” Northson’s eyes were turning
slightly red. “However…I really can’t bear to part from you,
senior apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, we two
brothers will still meet again,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although you will be
following a Pure Yang True Immortal, don’t get too cocky. I, Mu
Northson, will also train hard. If you get lazy, upon your return,
our big Champion of the Conclave might end up be weaker than me, Mu
Northson. Ahaha, that would be a huge joke,” Northson laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright, no need to
send me off! When you return to the world of the Grand Xia, come find
me,” Northson said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Definitely. I’ll
definitely seek you out.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Northson
turned and left, riding an azure dragon and soaring into the skies.
The other disciples had bid farewell to Ning long ago, after they
left the imperial citadel. Only Northson, who was closest to Ning,
had escorted Ning all the way to King Yan’s Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning watched him fly
away atop the azure dragon. He watched for a long moment, then turned
and led Little Qing and the Whitewater Hound into King Yan’s
Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm!” The
white-robed youth who had been quietly watching from afar shook his
head. “It seems this Ji Ning is a fellow who cares quite a bit
about relationships. Not bad, no bad.” As he spoke, he leisurely
sauntered towards King Yan’s Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Yan’s Estate had
many guards watching the gate, but when the white-robed youth
leisurely sauntered through it, none of them seemed to notice a
thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The restrictive
spells covering King Yan’s Estate have a bit of power behind them.
This new Celestial Immortal, King Yan…he’s not too shabby.” As
the white-robed youth walked forward, he encountered quite a few
maids and soldiers on his path. None of them, however, noticed a
thing. It was as though he was invisible, as though he didn’t
exist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The royal estate was
very tightly guarded, and it was protected by restrictive spells. It
was no weaker than any major sect. Logically speaking, as soon as
someone entered, the master of this royal estate, King Yan, would
have immediately noticed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the white-robed
youth walked in without a single person noticing him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rustle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By the side of a creek,
there was an Immortal estate. This was the place where Ning was
living.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning is just a
Wanxiang Adept, but he’s not doing too bad for himself.” The
white-robed youth walked to the door of the Immortal estate, then
entered it. Not a single one of the spells covering the Immortal
estate activated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Immortal
estate. Ning, who had just returned to the estate, quietly sat down
within a pavilion. Yu Wei had already left along with her master, Lu
Dongbin. This caused Ning to feel a melancholy feeling in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, someone
entered. Someone entered your Immortal estate.” The giant yellow
bear’s voice rang out in Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Entered my Immortal
estate? I’m the master of this Immortal estate; how could I not
have noticed?” Ning’s face changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s very
powerful. Even I can only vaguely sense him; I don’t dare to really
go test him,” the giant yellow bear said urgently. “This person
is very powerful; he should be on the level of a True Immortal or an
Empyrean God. Your Immortal estate is merely an ordinary
residence-type magic treasure, and the door to your estate was open.
How could you possibly notice someone like him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was shocked. A
True Immortal or an Empyrean God? This was someone comparable to the
Grand Xia Emperor. They were quite rare in the Three Realms, and were
very powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You became the
champion of the Conclave, but not only do you not celebrate with
friends, you actually sit here by yourself, drinking wine unhappily?
Strange, quite strange.” An airy voice rang out, and a white-robed,
long-haired youth strolled forward into the spacious courtyard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the courtyard,
Ning hurriedly rose to his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A friend has come
from afar; is this not a wonderful affair?” The white-robed youth
said with a smile, “Young friend Ji Ning, I’ve made quite a long
and arduous journey to come to your place. Aren’t you going to at
least invite me to have a cup of wine?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, please do!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his arm, and
the table before him became filled with Immortal nectar and
spirit-fruit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although the wine
and the fruit are a bit lacking, I suppose they are edible.” The
white-robed youth took a step forward and sat down in front of Ning.
Picking up a gourd of wine, he took two sips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, might I ask
why you have come to see me?” Ning asked nervously.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 39 - The Most Mysterious Daofather
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed youth
laughed as he spoke. “Young friend Ji Ning, you are a bit too
nervous. You don’t even know who I am, but you are asking me what
I’m doing here. Aren’t you being a bit too impatient?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning muttered to
himself. Nervous? A Pure Yang True Immortal had just sat down in
front of him. How could he not be nervous? After this Conclave, Ning
had come to understand quite well that unless a True Immortal or an
Empyrean God had taken a fancy to you, they wouldn’t pay you any
heed, even if you were a so-called genius. After all, there were far
too many ‘geniuses’, but how many would be able to overcome the
Celestial Tribulation to become a Celestial Immortal? Much less
become a Pure Yang True Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dare I ask who you
are, senior?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A carefree figure of
the Three Realms, born in the era of the ancient Primordial World,
where I gained my Dao. I am Lord Jiang.” The white-robed youth said
with a sigh, “I rarely roam the outside world, and even when I do I
rarely use my own name. Thus, there are very, very few people who
know of me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He then winked towards
Ning. “I just told you my real name.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning relaxed a little
bit. It seemed as though this person bore him no ill-will.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Also, don’t
addresss me as senior this and senior that. You can just address me
as brother Jiang,” the white-robed Lord Jiang said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled.
Brother Jiang? For a Pure Yang True Immortal to tell him to refer to
him as just ‘brother’…Ning was no fool. He naturally understood
the meaning hidden within these words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But it seems if I
don’t spell things out, you won’t be able to calm down.” The
white-robed Lord Jiang glanced sideways at Little Qing and the
Whitewater Hound. “Have your two spirit-beasts step back for now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright,” Ning
immediately said. He had Uncle White and Little Qing temporarily
leave. A Pure Yang True Immortal could crush him to death; Ning was
naturally going to listen to his instructions with obedience.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the courtyard,
only Ji Ning and Lord Jiang were present. They were seated facing
each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine that you
have already guessed that I have come today per the orders of my
master to receive you,” the white-robed Lord Jiang said with a
smile. “In other words, my master wishes to take you on as a
disciple, and you shall become my junior apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could barely
breathe. He couldn’t help but ask, “Then brother Jiang, your
master is…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He is naturally one
of the most supreme major powers of the Three Realms, a
Daofather-level figure,” the white-robed Lord Jiang said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes lit up.
It was as he had thought. When this person had instructed him to
refer to himself as ‘brother Jiang’, Ning had already been able
to guess at what this was about. But upon hearing the full
explanation, he still couldn’t help but feel that this was
inconceivable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Daofather!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had fought and
clawed to become the champion of this Conclave, but in the end,
Daofather Crimsonbright still did not choose him to be his disciple.
The Sloppy Daoist, in turn, was chosen as a disciple by Grand Emperor
Xuanwu. There was nothing Ning could do about these things, and he
had already resigned himself to becoming the disciple of a
lower-ranked Pure Yang True Immortal. But now, a Pure Yang True
Immortal named Lord Jiang had appeared, saying that he represented
his master!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” The
giant yellow bear’s voice suddenly rang out in Ning’s mind. “Lord
Jiang said that he was born in the Primordial Era, and gained his Dao
in that era as well! But…I’ve never even heard of him. And he
says his master is a Daofather…you need to figure out exactly which
Daofather it is. Some of the Daofathers of the Three Realms were good
friends of my master, Daoist Threelives…but some of them were his
mortal enemies! Don’t end up becoming an apprentice to one of his
mortal enemies. Given a Daofather’s vision, if you learn the Dao
from him, he will sooner or later see hints of the truth and discover
that there is a relationship between you and Daoist Threelives. If
you become apprenticed to one of his mortal enemies, then you’ll be
throwing yourself up for capture.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly came to
his senses. He felt as though someone had just poured a bucket of ice
water over him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dare I ask which
Daofather it is?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Jiang’s eyes had
a look of reverence in them as he spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master was born from
the primordial chaos, and was good friends with Pangu and Nuwa.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He became famous in
the Primordial Era, and has killed many Fiendgod Daofathers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His name is known
throughout the Three Realms, but very few have ever seen him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Buddhist Sangha,
the Daoist Path; he is a master of both. With but a dream, he knows
of all the affairs of the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He has many
disciples, but very few know this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In terms of who is
the most mysterious figure in the Three Realms…it is my master!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Lord
Jiang nodded as he spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, hearing this, was
stunned. “Who on earth is he?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mount Innerheart 1,
the Tristar Crescent Abode…Patriarch Subhuti!” 2 The white-robed
Lord Jiang’s eyes lit up, and he smiled as he looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s him. It’s
him! The Tristar Crescent Abode…the most mysterious Daofather…the
most secretive Daofather! Ji Ning, you’ve hit the jackpot.
I…ahahaha…you really hit the jackpot! Patriarch Subhuti actually
knows about you. He actually knows about your existence. How in the
world does he know?!” The voice of the giant yellow bear rang out
within Ning’s mind. Clearly, he was incomparably excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…is it really
necessary for you to be so worked up?” Ning asked mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course! You have
no idea how mighty he is! Ji Ning, let me put it to you this way…in
terms of teaching disciples, Patriarch Subhuti is definitely one of
the absolute most peerless figures of the Three Realms. What this
Lord Jiang said earlier was absolutely correct; Patriarch Subhuti
truly has produced many formidable disciples. However, Patriarch
Subhuti has a rule; whenever the disciples he has taught leaves his
side, unless he gives permission, they are forbidden from telling
others that he is their master. Thus, even back in the Primordial
Era, there were already many powerful and seemingly unaffiliated
wandering Immortals who were actually under the command of Patriarch
Subhuti!” 3
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ordinary people
don’t know about this, but my master, Daofather Threelives, did. He
knew exactly how formidable Patriarch Subhuti is.” The giant yellow
bear was extremely excited right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Ning asked,
“Why is he the most mysterious, then?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, he really is
the most mysterious Daofather!” The giant yellow bear said with
absolute certainty, “In the Three Realms, not even Pangu or Nuwa
were as mysterious as him! In fact, to this very day, no one even
knows where his estate is located. Without his permission, no one can
even find his estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The estates of the
other major powers of the Three Realms are all findable; after all,
major powers often interact with other figures of the world, and they
will often invite their good friends into their estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch Subhuti
has taken in many disciples, and also invites his friends over to his
estate. But be it disciples or friends…upon leaving his estate,
they’ll never be able to find it again. You must understand that
all of his friends are also at the True God level. After having
entered the estate once, how is it that they cannot locate it again?
Isn’t this completely bizarre? Isn’t this very mysterious?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s that
mysterious?” Ning was amazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofathers were major
powers of the Three Realms who controlled a Heavenly Dao. For a
Daofather to visit a place, then be unable to find it again
afterwards? How bizarre!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No one knows where
his estate is. Even his disciples who have trained within the estate
for many years are still unable to find it upon leaving. Unless
Patriarch Subhuti nods and permits it, none of them can return.”
The giant yellow bear sighed emotionally. “In the past, my master
Daoist Threelives once said…in the entire Primordial World, of all
the major powers, Maiden Nuwa would be ranked number one in terms of
survival abilities, but right after her was the legendarily
mysterious Patriarch Subhuti.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch Subhuti.
He’s so secretive that other major powers can’t even find his
estate. You tell me; how formidable are his survival skills?” The
giant yellow bear sighed, “If Master had Patriarch Subhuti’s
survival skills, he would definitely still be alive to this very
day.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless as
he heard these things. This was an absolute bizarro amongst the major
powers of the Three Realms. No one could even find his estate, and
his survival abilities were second only to Maiden Nuwa.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch Subhuti
trains in both Buddhism and Daoism. 4 With a single dream, he learns
of all the matters of the Three Realms. His power is simply
unfathomable. This Lord Jiang said earlier that Patriarch Subhuti has
slaughtered many Fiendgod Daofathers. Although I don’t know much
about this, it should be true. There should have been Daofathers and
True Gods who had fallen to him, and not just one,” the giant
yellow bear said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a formidable
figure.” Ji Ning felt stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Most importantly of
all, your master Daoist Threelives and Patriarch Subhuti were true
lifelong friends who went through life and death together!” The
giant yellow bear was extremely excited. “They were true lifelong
friends! The relationship between Master and him was even closer than
the relationship Master had with Daofather Crimsonbright. When Master
forged this underwater estate, he even asked Patriarch Subhuti to
come help out!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?!” Ning now
understood exactly how close the relationship between Daoist
Threelives and Patriarch Subhuti was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given Patriarch
Subhuti’s status, he definitely won’t harm you at all,” the
giant yellow bear said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was mentally
speaking with the giant yellow bear. Gradually, traces of unbearable
excitement and astonishment appeared on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Lord
Jiang laughed as he watched. “My master learns of the matters of
the Three Realms in a single dream. In his dream, he saw the Conclave
in your world of the Grand Xia. It was as though he watched in
person. During this Conclave, Master took no interest in anyone else;
just you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He watched
personally?” Ning instantly understood. Perhaps True Immortals and
Empyrean Gods would find it hard to discover his [Starseizing Hand],
but greater powers could, especially one who was such an incredibly
good friend with Daoist Threelives.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition, Master
instructed me to deliver a message. He told me to say: ‘Little
yellow-furred bear, how have you been’?” Lord Jiang continued,
“He said that after I delivered this message, you would agree to
leave with me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s pulse began to
speed up. Little yellow-furred bear? He was speaking of the spirit of
the underwater estate!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, Patriarch
Subhuti must have discovered your [Starseizing Hand] through his
‘Dream of the Three Realms’. He must have guessed that you are
Master’s heir. That’s why he personally ordered someone to
receive you.” The giant yellow bear’s voice was filled with
excitement. “Hurry, hurry and go! So long as you go to Patriarch
Subhuti, we can learn about what has happened to Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The spirit of the
underwater estate…he truly wanted to know if his master was alive
or dead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning and the
white-robed Lord Jiang were chatting, King Qi had arrived at King
Yan’s estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Conclave of
Immortal Destiny has concluded. Why have you come to my place?”
King Yan said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Because of Ji Ning,
of course,” King Qi laughed as well. “His Imperial Majesty
personally went to visit uncle-master Evergreen. You know what sort
of a temper he has; he doesn’t like to teach students, and is an
extremely solitary person. Still…since this was the Daofather’s
order, uncle-master Evergreen nodded and agreed to accept Ji Ning as
his disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh. Uncle-master
Evergreen is a Sword Immortal, while Ning was born to be a Sword
Immortal. He is quite suited for teaching Ji Ning. However, I’m
just worried that uncle-master Evergreen…” King Yan was rather
worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s not for you
to worry about.” King Qi shook his head. “I’m here on his
Imperial Majesty’s orders to give uncle-master Evergreen’s
talisman to Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though
Ji Ning really is going to become uncle-master Evergreen’s
disciple,” King Yan said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because of his
granddaughter, King Yan had actually been hoping for Ji Ning to be
apprenticed to a better teacher. However…of the Pure Yang True
Immortals under Daofather Crimsonbright’s command, the only Sword
Immortal was Sword Immortal Evergreen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two chatted and
laughed as they walked to Ning’s Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning,” King Yan
called out.

Chapter 40 - A Swift Departure
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the entrance to
Ning’s Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning came out to the
entrance to greet them. Upon seeing the two, he immediately said with
respect, “Greetings, King Yan, King Qi.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, good news
has arrived,” King Yan said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning was
startled. Good news? Could it be that the Grand Xia Emperor had found
a Pure Yang True Immortal to be his master?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby King Qi said
with a laugh, “His Imperial Majesty has sought out his junior
apprentice-brother, Sword Immortal Evergreen. Sword Immortal
Evergreen is a Pure Yang True Immortal. He is very powerful, and has
thoroughly mastered the Grand Dao of the Sword. He is quite a famous
Sword Immortal in the Three Realms…he is quite suited for teaching
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded gently.
Sword Immortal Evergreen?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning,” King Yan
said in a lowered voice, “This Sword Immortal Evergreen is rather
arrogant and aloof. You need to be careful around him and be very
respectful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart
twitched. To respect one’s master was only proper; that didn’t
need to be said. But for King Yan, as a Celestial Immortal, to
describe a Pure Yang True Immortal like Sword Immortal Evergreen as
arrogant and aloof, then tell him to be very respectful…Ning
thought to himself, “I imagine this Sword Immortal Evergreen isn’t
merely ‘aloof’ and ‘arrogant’. Luckily, I don’t need to
take him on as my master at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t say so many
things,” the nearby King Qi frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Yan laughed,
saying nothing else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” King Qi
waved his hand, and a little azure sword appeared within it. “This
is Sword Immortal Evergreen’s talisman. I’ll hand it to you now.
All you need to do is crush it, and Sword Immortal Evergreen will
come find you and take you away! Remember - you have to crush it
within ten days. After ten days, the talisman will automatically
disintegrate. By then, given Sword Immortal Evergreen’s temper, he
probably won’t take you on as a disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
accepted the talisman. “I understand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The talisman is in
your hands now. I’m going to leave now.” King Qi smiled towards
Ning, then turned and left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Yan whispered
softly, “Sword Immortal Evergreen has a rather bad temper. You have
to remember this. Also, before you leave with your master, let Xiyue
know. You don’t need to inform me of it. I’ll pray that when you
leave, you’ll be able to learn some real abilities, and that you
shall overcome your Celestial Tribulation in the future and become a
carefree and unbound Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could feel King
Yan’s caring towards him. “Thank you, King Yan. Ji Ning will
remember it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” King Yan
immediately left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just moments later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuchi Xiyue arrived at
Ning’s estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cousin.” Ning
didn’t want to part with her either. He truly was about to leave,
but it wasn’t with Sword Immortal Evergreen; rather, it would be to
meet the most mysterious major power of the Three Realms, Patriarch
Subhuti. After this departure, it would probably be decades or a
century before he could return.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little brother.”
Xiyue sat down, then took Ning by the hand. Her eyes were filled with
tears…but they were tears of joy. “The two of us were together
for two or three years, but it is now time to part. However…don’t
feel unhappy. This is your chance, your chance to soar into the
heavens. Although you weren’t able to become a Daofather’s
disciple, it’s still quite good for you to become a Pure Yang True
Immortal’s disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning truly wanted to
tell his cousin that he was taking on Patriarch Subhuti as master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he had gone to
greet King Yan and King Qi, Lord Jiang had instructed him, “Remember,
no matter what you cannot tell them of this. Upon Xiamang Xun
learning of this, he will move to obstruct it. He might even pull in
Daofather Crimsonbright, who stands behind him. That will make things
troublesome.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cousin, after I
leave the world of the Grand Xia, you need to take good care of
yourself,” Ning said. “Don’t let yourself suffer because of
your hatred for the Youngflame clan. In the future, I will overcome
my tribulation and become a Celestial Immortal. By then, dealing with
the Youngflame clan will be much easier.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, right.”
Xiyue nodded. “I get it. I get it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two chatted for a
long period of time. Xiyue only left when the sky was completely
dark.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Immortal
estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Jiang, what
should I do with this talisman of Sword Immortal Evergreen?” Ning
pulled out the little azure sword. “If I crush it, Sword Immortal
Evergreen will come take me away. If I don’t crush it, it will
dissipate naturally.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Give it to me,”
the white-robed Lord Jiang said with a laugh. He stretched his hand
out, and the little azure sword flew into it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This world of the
Grand Xia is part of the territory of Daofather Crimsonbright, after
all.” Lord Jiang said with a laugh, “We can’t be too brash
here. Fortunately…when a Pure Yang True Immortal takes on a
disciple, the disciple has to be willing. If you don’t crush it
within ten days, then Sword Immortal Evergreen will assume that you
weren’t willing to accept him as your master…and they will have
no idea that you’ve actually taken on Patriarch Subhuti as your
master. They will probably think that you are adventuring in the
outside world. Even if you reveal hints of it upon returning once you
are powerful, causing someone to learn that you are Patriarch
Subhuti’s disciple, so what? In the Three Realms, my master has
quite a bit of face.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “Then my
two spirit-beasts?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can bring your
spirit-beasts into the Tristar Crescent Abode,” the white-robed
Lord Jun said. “However, they cannot take on Master as their
teacher.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As long as I can
bring them.” Ning nodded repeatedly in delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If there’s nothing
else, we can head out right now,” the white-robed Lord Jiang said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded, them immediately called out, “Uncle White, Little Qing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Little Qing
flew over with a swoosh, wrapping herself around Ning’s arm. Uncle
White arrived by Ning’s side as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White, Little
Qing, we are preparing to leave the world of the Grand Xia,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave the world of
the Grand Xia?” The two of them were both amazed. Leave this world?
“To where?” Little Qing asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned to ask,
“Brother Jiang, where is the Tristar Crescent Abode?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Tristar Crescent
Abode…it consists of a crescent hook and three stars. Tell me, what
character is this?” The white-robed Lord Jiang said with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A crescent hook and
three stars? The character for heart ‘<FONT FACE="Cambria">心’</FONT>?”
Ning instantly understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. The character
‘heart’. The Tristar Crescent Abode is Master’s estate. The
Three Realms is vast, but no one can find the location of Master’s
estate. This place is a place where one can only go through the
heart, a place you find with your heart,” the white-robed Lord
Jiang said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly felt
that this was incomparably mysterious. A crescent hook and three
stars? This was indeed the character ‘heart’ <FONT FACE="Cambria">心</FONT>.
This name which Patriarch Subhuti gave his cavern estate was quite
interesting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch Subhuti,
the Tristar Crescent Abode…” Ning began to think back to one of
the mythological fantasy novels he had read in his world, [Journey to
the West]. [Journey to the West] was a novel written by ancient
individuals, and it included Pangu, Nuwa, Patriarch Subhuti, and
others. However, there was no mention of the three thousand major
worlds or trillion minor worlds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had gone to the
Netherworld Kingdom and been reincarnated before learning a few
things about the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now understood
that every single world shared some legends, especially those
regarding formidable figures such as Pangu, Nuwa, Houyi, and Kuafu,
were discussed by countless people of the Three Realms. Novels like
[Journey to the West] were influenced by even more ancient legends;
for example, the legends of Pangu establishing the heavens or Nuwa
creating humanity didn’t come from [Journey to the West].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, in the world
of the Grand Xia as well, there were some novels and literature
regarding various Gods and Immortals; these novels even recorded down
tales involving divine abilities such as [Heavenly Transformations]
or the [Torch Dragon’s Eye], which compiled into various stories.
Some of these stories were real while others were false. Some even
got the names wrong!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Perhaps in the ancient
days on Earth, there were actual Immortal cultivators. In fact, some
humans on Earth might have been reincarnated Immortals who had awoken
their previous memories, and so had left behind certain legends to
the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three Realms
have countless legends, and many of them have been compiled into
novels. However…the true secrets of the Three Realms remain unclear
to me, even though I have slaughtered Loose Immortals and received
the legacy of Daoist Threelives.” Ning sighed to himself, “Why
was the previous Primordial World destroyed and transformed into the
three thousand major worlds and trillion minor worlds? Who on earth
attacked the Six Paths of Reincarnation?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were mysteries!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Tristar Crescent
Abode is an estate of one of the major powers of the Three Realms,
and the most mysterious one at that. Although I’ve always remained
within the Tristar Crescent Abode, I don’t actually know where it
is. I have to have Master guide me into it in order to return.” The
white-robed Lord Jiang said with a sigh, “Let’s go. Pick up your
Immortal estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
willed it. Instantly, the Immortal estate was collected. Ning stood
there on the grass next to the river, Little Qing around his arm and
the Whitewater Hound by his side. The white-robed Lord Jiang said,
“This journey will last decades or even longer. Is there anything
you need to do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head
gently. There was nothing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason he had left
Stillwater Commandery was because of the Youngflame clan’s pursuit.
He had told Autumn Leaf and the leaders of the Ji clan that he would
be leaving for a very long period of time! Yu Wei had already been
taken away by Lu Dongbin to train in the Dao, while he had already
told his cousin, Yuchi Xiyue, of his departure. He had also bade
farewell to his fellow disciples of the Black-White College.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then let us go.”
The white-robed Lord Jiang willed a cloud to appear beneath their
feet. The cloud floated upwards, carrying Lord Jiang, Ji Ning, and
the Whitewater Hound to quickly soar into the skies, completely
bypassing the restrictive spells as they flew deep into the void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, they reached the
very highest parts of the sky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Riiiip. Lord Jiang
waved his hands. The dim, twisting void above them was instantly torn
apart, and a corridor emerged. Within the corridor, one could vaguely
see twisted, distorted rainbow light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” The
white-robed lord Jiang gave the little azure sword a toss, and it
fell down many tens of thousands of kilometers towards the ground. He
then led Ji Ning, Little Qing, and the Whitewater Hound into the
spatial tunnel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The spatial tunnel
quickly closed. Everything was back to normal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the world of the
Grand Xia…there was no longer a Ji Ning to be found.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twelve days passed
after the conclusion of the Conclave of Immortal Destiny.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor was
within a side hall of the Skylight Palace, seated in the lotus
position with eyes closed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The Xia
Emperor suddenly opened his eyes, revealing a confused look. “Why
has junior apprentice-brother Evergreen come?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, a young man
walked into the side hall. The servants and guards present didn’t
seem to see him at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother,” Sword Immortal Evergreen said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, why have you come to my place?” The Xia Emperor
asked, puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the twelfth
day. The talisman I gave you has long since dissipated.” Sword
Immortal Evergreen shook his head. “Normally, I couldn’t be
bothered to come; after all, Ji Ning didn’t crush the talisman, and
so I couldn’t be bothered to take him as my disciple. But since
this was Master’s instruction…I came to make a trip to this world
of the Grand Xia. If Ji Ning is willing, I’ll give him another
chance to be my disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What did you say?!”
The Xia Emperor was shocked. “Ji Ning didn’t crush the talisman?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. He didn’t
crush it.” Sword Immortal Evergreen shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But Ji Ning left
King Yan’s estate long ago. I thought that you had taken him away.
I thought that because of how arrogant and aloof you are, you simply
didn’t inform me.” The Xia Emperor was flabbergasted. “I even
did an investigation; he’s no longer in the imperial capital of the
Grand Xia. Lu Dongbin, Mahasthamaprapta…they wouldn’t go so far
as to offend the Daofather for the sake of this little fellow, right?
Can it be that Ji Ning is just too young? He became the champion of
the Conclave, but wasn’t able to become the Daofather’s
apprentice, and so in his anger he decided not to accept a Pure Yang
True Immortal as his master and instead left by himself?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal
Evergreen snorted coldly. “Oh? You say he left the imperial capital
long ago? If that’s the case, then senior apprentice-brother, I’ve
already done all I can. This matter no longer has anything to do with
me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After speaking, Sword
Immortal Evergreen turned and departed, quickly leaving this major
world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He really didn’t care
about Ji Ning at all. He had only made a trip here because of his
master’s instructions.
