Chapter 1 - You Did Not Sin
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mu Northson was
watching from within the ten thousand kilometer formation region,
wracked by agony and self-hatred for being unable to help Ji Ning.
Little Qing and Uncle White’s faces both changed dramatically as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of them could tell
that there had just been a spatial teleportation of some sort!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can no longer
sense Master’s location,” Little Qing said frantically. “I
can’t even get the vaguest sense of the direction he is in. Master
is no longer in the world of the Grand Xia; he’s gone to an
extremely distant place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t sense him
either,” Uncle White said, trying to attentively sense Ning’s
location.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s all my fault.
It’s all because of me, a useless piece of trash. I shouldn’t
have been in such a rush to take revenge. I shouldn’t have…”
Northson was filled with utter regret.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had been Ning who
had rescued him and Yu Xia’s soul from the Eastwoods mountain
range…but afterwards, when the Youngflame clan’s Celestial
Immortals had ambushed Ning, Yu Xia’s sould had been completely
destroyed. Although he had felt utter hatred for the Youngflame clan,
in truth, Northson did feel a bit of resentment towards Ning as well
in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…given Ning’s
great kindness towards him, and given that they were lifelong friends
to begin with, he had buried that resentment deep within his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But in this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he saw the descent
of the karmic sinflames, as well as the agonized look on the face of
Ning as he was being burnt by the sinflames…Northson felt
incomparable guilt in his heart. “If I hadn’t kept clamoring on
and on about revenge, senior apprentice-brother wouldn’t have been
in such a rush. He would’ve kept on waiting, waiting until he grew
even more powerful…and then, he would’ve completely wiped out the
entire Youngflame clan. This is all due to my own impatience.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Say no more.”
Uncle White growled, “The Youngflame clan’s Celestial Immortals
are already flying towards us. Let’s hurry up and leave. Little
Qing, we need a Greater Teleportation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Little Qing tamped down
the grief and pain she felt, immediately waving her hand and bringing
along Uncle White and Northson into a Greater Teleportation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They disappeared into
thin air, having returned to Swallow Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven Celestial
Immortals of the Youngflame clan were indeed flying straight towards
the formation area. With but a single void blink, they arrived
directly outside of the formation. However…as soon as they arrived,
Little Qing, Uncle White, and Northson departed. Little Qing and the
other two knew quite well that there was no way they could possibly
deal with these Celestial Immortals. They were far too weak; they
could only suppress their hatred for now. If Ning had truly died…they
would train hard so that in the future, they would be able to take
revenge for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They ran quite
fast,” Celestial Immortal Arcanum sneered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They were weak to
begin with; they only dared to attack this place because of Ji Ning.
Now that he’s dead, why wouldn’t they flee?” Celestial Immortal
Blackrain said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Infatuation
shook his head. “Blackrain, Ji Ning isn’t dead yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When karmic
sinflames descend, they shall bring multiple rounds of punishment. I
refuse to believe he won’t die,” Celestial Immortal Blackrain
said. “In addition, Master also used his Worldhold Pagoda; he must
have sent Ji Ning to one of the danger zones within the void beyond
the Three Realms. Some of those danger zones are enough to cause even
True Immortals or Empyrean Gods to perish, much less a little brat
that hasn’t even overcome his Celestial Tribulation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby horned,
golden-robed man turned his head to look at the distant Old Demon
Windraiser, still wracked by indescribable pain. He spoke out and
said, “If Windraiser is able to withstand this tribulation of
karmic sinflames…I shall personally escort him to the Ten
Yama-Kings of Hell. When he is reborn, he absolutely must be reborn
into our Youngflame clan. No expenses will be spared in training
him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was no joke. If
someone was able to overcome karmic sinflames, they would undergo an
utterly astounding transformation, and their Dao-hearts would become
truly remarkable in strength. Although they would lose their memories
of their former lives upon being reborn…such a soul would still
have enormous potential in the new life. Upon regaining one’s
previous memories…one would have an extremely good chance of
overcoming the Celestial Tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s see if he
can overcome the karmic sinflames,” the horned, golden-robed man
said with a sigh. “Every single person who is capable of overcoming
karmic sinflames is an extremely remarkable person. Even amongst
Celestial Immortals, such individuals are amongst the very top.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were very few,
even amongst Celestial Immortals, who could withstand the power of
karmic sinflames!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, it was very
hard for someone to tell how strong another person’s Dao-heart was.
Even someone as powerful as Celestial Immortal Infatuation wouldn’t
dare claim for certain that he was able to withstand karmic
sinflames! Thus…Celestial Immortals were generally quite cautious.
Only if there was no other choice would they allow themselves to act
in a way that would cause karmic sinflames to swirl around their
bodies. The descent of karmic sinflames was truly terrifying…but
once one overcame it, one’s power would generally skyrocket!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Three
Realms…every single person who overcame karmic sinflames would end
up being an incredible figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, Ning’s
senior apprentice-brother, Empyrean God Silvermoon, was a person who
had karmic sinflames constantly swirling around him. Silvermoon,
however, completely ignored them…proof that he truly was an utter
demon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world of the Grand
Xia. The western seas. The Seamless Gate’s gathering spot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous mirror had
displayed all the scenes of the battle that had just occurred in the
Oldjade mountain range. The escape and wild assault of nine
hundred-plus Fiendgods…the pursuit of the Godslayer Gods…Ning’s
sudden, unexpected explosion of power that had resulted in the
slaying of two Celestial Immortals…Old Demon Windraiser, a Loose
Immortal of the Youngflame clan, attacking ‘suicidally’…the
descent of karmic sinflames…Ning being burnt by karmic
sinflames…Ning being teleported away by the Worldhold Pagoda…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Exciting. How very
exciting.” Celestial Immortal Blackheaven sighed repeatedly in
praise. “That Windraiser…he really is both decisive and vicious.
He was able to come up with this plan and settle on it in such a
short period of time…and those who died were all his own clansmen!
Ten billion of his clansmen died, just like that…his heart truly is
vicious and merciless. He truly does have the temperament necessary
for a demon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are actually
praising him? You are actually praising such a despicable,
contemptible little man?” Violetgrass frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Violetgrass, little
girl, you are wrong; although you are a Celestial Immortal, in terms
of Dao-hearts, you are probably inferior to that Windraiser.”
Celestial Immortal Blackheaven shook his head. “As far as
craftiness…you are even more inferior to him. This is one of the
reasons why the Gatemaster has never let you truly command your own
forces; there are far, far too many things you need to see and
experience first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So I’m inferior to
him?” Violetgrass was angry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How many setbacks
have you encountered in life?” Celestial Immortal Blackheaven shook
his head. “Although we are Celestial Immortals who hold Loose
Immortals in contempt, and although indeed 99% of Loose Immortals are
not worthy of us paying attention to…amongst the countless Loose
Immortals who are alive, there are some who have lived for over a
million years. This type of Loose Immortal has suffered repeated
assaults from the Three Calamities, Nine Tribulations. Their many
experiences with the demonheart tribulation has caused their
Dao-hearts to become incomparably mighty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You, by comparison,
became a Celestial Immortal early on. Although you’ve lived longer
than them…how many actual tribulations have you undergone? Despite
your talent and the fact that you have superior comprehension
abilities…you’ve suffered far too few setbacks. Your Dao-heart
truly might be inferior to theirs. Look - even though he’s being
burned by karmic sinflames, he’s still able to maintain enough
presence of mind to carry on a conversation with the Celestial
Immortals of the Youngflame clan. Would you dare make the claim that
you could do the same?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Violetgrass was
startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even monsters like Ji
Ning were just barely able to maintain a modicum of consciousness
when being assaulted by karmic sinflames. Old Demon Windraiser,
however, was clear-minded enough to carry on a conversation. He
clearly was far superior.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The lives of ten
billion commoners, in exchange for the life of a peerless, monstrous
genius like Ji Ning…worth it.” Violetgrass suddenly said, “Old
geezer, tell me; can this sort of method be used against Celestial
Immortals?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you suicidal?”
Celestial Immortal Blackheaven shook his head. “As the person who
gave the order…you, the mastermind, will also incur enormous sin.
Ten billion mortal lives! If you are lucky, you’ll have a bloody
aura of sin that will surround you and stretch out to many hundreds
of meters; if you aren’t lucky, you’ll probably see karmic
sinflames descend right away as well! As for the person you sent out
to actually do it…that person will definitely suffer the descent of
karmic sinflames. Such an action is utter suicide.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition…perhaps
ordinary Celestial Immortals are unable to withstand karmic
sinflames, but the truly powerful Celestial Immortals are generally
able to do so. As for True Immortals or Empyrean Gods…they are the
experts of the Three Realms! All of them are capable of withstanding
karmic sinflames. Don’t even ask about Daofathers.” Celestial
Immortal Blackheaven sighed. “Thus…this sort of method really
isn’t worth it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Anyhow. This Ji Ning
is being burned by karmic sinflames, and has also been teleported by
Youngflame Freak to one of the danger zones in the void beyond the
Three Realms. There’s nothing for me to do here. Time for me to
go.” Celestial Immortal Blackheaven rose to his feet, still
carrying a gourd of Immortal nectar. Drinking and whistling, he began
to walk away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old geezer, this one
doesn’t count. You still owe me two favors,” Violetgrass called
after him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. I’m
not as shameless as you.” Celestial Immortal Blackheaven’s voice
echoed out within the palace, but he himself had disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Violetgrass turned to
stare back at the mirror, still depicting events within the Oldjade
mountain range. She mumbled to herself, “So he was actually sent
into a danger zone, just like that. I didn’t even have anything to
do with it. Still…that’s a good thing for me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the ancient
pagoda tower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All seven of the
Celestial Immortals, including the Youngflame Ancestor, were gathered
here. Not too far away was Old Demon Windraiser, who was seated in
the lotus position. However, his body was clearly trembling slightly.
The karmic sinflames around him were beginning to vanish; clearly,
the trials brought by the karmic sinflames were nearing their end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is already the
seventh day. Windraiser is still holding on.” Celestial Immortal
Arcanum’s narrow eyes were filled with eagerness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The longer it goes
on, the more dangerous it becomes. The seventh day is the final day.
If he is able to withstand this day…he’ll survive. But if he
doesn’t…” The Youngflame Ancestor shook his head. Suddenly,
however, his face changed as he turned to stare at Old Demon
Windraiser.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Demon Windraiser’s
aura was beginning to gradually weaken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the aura of
his soul weakening in strength.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why is his aura
weakening?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone was extremely
worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They knew very little
about karmic sinflames; all they knew was that the karmic sinflames
brought a tribulation that lasted for seven days, and that the final
stages were the most terrifying of all! Once one made it past the
seven day mark, the karmic sinflames would vanish; one would only be
able to detect them through coresense or divine sense, and not with
the naked eye. However…although invisible, the karmic sinflames
would always be present. The constant swirl of karmic sinflames on
one’s body would feel like being eternally roasted in the pits of
hell.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His heart…his
heart is weakening,” the Youngflame Ancestor said. “When his
heart weakens, his aura weakens as well. Once his heart dies…then
his soul will instantly be burnt to ash. This is why karmic sinflames
are so terrifying! The initial ‘Agony’ phase from when the karmic
sinflames first descend merely cause brute-force pain. Those with
powerful Dao-hearts, however, are often able to overcome this phase.
The latter parts have a softer approach which will slowly cause pain
and regret to seep into one’s heart…causing the tormented
person’s heart to slowly wither and die. It is akin to suicide!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Demon Windraiser’s
aura was indeed growing weaker and weaker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven Celestial
Immortals watched with incomparable nervousness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six more hours passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His aura was completely
extinguished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After his aura had
completely disappeared for just a few seconds…it suddenly began to
increase rapidly in power. Finally, Old Demon Windraiser opened his
eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I survived.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Demon Windraiser
said in a low voice, “What terrifying ‘karmic sinflames’
indeed! They were far more powerful than the Three Calamities, Nine
Tribulations that one experiences at the million year mark. I
actually survived…but I really don’t want to experience that
again. I really do not.” A deep, haunted look was in Old Demon
Windraiser’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Windraiser,” the
Youngflame Ancestor called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Windraiser hurriedly
came to his senses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ancestor.”
Windraiser said hurriedly, “Patriarchs, I, Windraiser, condemned
ten billion members of our clan to death. My sin…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough. You did not
sin; in fact, you rendered major merits,” the Youngflame Ancestor
said with a loud laugh. “It was just ten billion mortals, after
all. We can bring a few billion mortals over from our other two
headquarters, and in a few more decades this place shall be
flourishing once more. The reason why we were able to deal with Ji
Ning this time was you; you ignored your own well-being and willingly
endured karmic sinflames to deal him a fierce blow. You did very
well!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Demon Windraiser’s
voice was still very low. “Ancestor, I’ve incurred far, far too
many sins. A storm is coming to the Three Realms. Me being alive will
only result in a hugely negative influence upon the Youngflame clan.
I’m preparing to kill myself, then head to the Netherworld.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The Ancestor
nodded. “It is for the best. Given how many sins you have
incurred…after you die and go to the Netherworld, you will be
punished in the deepest depths of hell and tormented in countless
unspeakable ways. After you are finally allowed to be reborn…I will
definitely bring you back into the Youngflame clan. In the past,
dealing with matters in the Netherworld Kingdom might be a bit
troublesome, but now that Daofather Crimsonbright has re-established
a minor cycle of reincarnation, all ten of his Yama-Kings of Hell
will assuredly give me some face. I will arrange everything necessary
for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Old Demon
Windraiser said respectfully, “Then…I’ll leave now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Demon Windraiser
didn’t hesitate at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His golden lotus spirit
voluntarily dissipated, and a human-shaped soul, wreathed by karmic
sinflames, flew straight towards the minor cycle of reincarnation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! The Youngflame
Ancestor immediately headed towards the minor cycle of reincarnation
as well.

allegorical Buddhist term that refers to worldly affairs,
attachments, and desires. It is often said that in order to achieve
Buddhahood, one has to be able to ‘see past the red dust’. ‘Women

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stillwater Commandery.
Swallow Mountain. Serpentwing Lake. Brightheart Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Uncle White, in human
form, was seated within a pavilion, moodily drinking wine by himself.
Mu Northson was seated as well, leaning against the pavilion railings
with his eyes shut. As for Little Qing, she was hugging her knees,
seated quietly within a corner of the pavilion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were all
completely silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long time later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Should we tell
Autumn Leaf?” Little Qing suddenly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We should not.”
Uncle White sighed. “In Autumn Leaf’s heart, my son Ning is…ugh.
She wouldn’t be to take the blow. Let’s wait for now. We can tell
her that Ning is in secluded meditation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are we supposed to
just keep hiding this from them?” Little Qing asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can sense that my
son Ning is still alive,” Uncle White said. “As long as he is
still alive…let’s keep things hidden from Autumn Leaf, as well as
all of the Ji clansmen.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Little Qing nodded
gently as well, then said, “Then about about Ji Ning’s master,
Immortal Diancai?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Diancai…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Uncle White hesitated a
moment, then said, “Let’s wait. The most terrifying punishment
brought by karmic sinflames will arrive on the seventh day. As long
as he survives the seventh day, he will have survived the karmic
sinflames. If he doesn’t come back after seven days…that means he
truly is trapped in some mysterious danger zone located outside the
world of the Grand Xia…at which point, we will notify Immortal
Diancai.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Little
Qing nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They fell silent once
more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of them had
anything to say. They just waited, quietly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seven days…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These seven days posed
a huge tribulation for Ning. If he didn’t die within these seven
days and withstood the karmic sinflames…he would have overcome this
tribulation. However, they didn’t have any idea as to where the
Youngflame clan had teleported him to…but given the amount of
hatred they felt towards him, they must have sent him to a truly
terrifying place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The banks of a vast,
roaring river. There was an azure-robed man seated in the lotus
position here. He wielded an Immortal sword in his hands, but the
Immortal sword actually had a fishing line hanging down from it;
clearly, he was using it to fish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From high up in the
skies, a handsome-looking youth came flying over atop a cloud. He
landed on the ground, then bowed respectfully. “My respects to you,
Patriarch Lu. Per the Xia Emperor’s orders, this junior has come to
send you a message.” A scroll appeared before him, which he
respectfully offered with both hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A letter? The Xia
Emperor?” Lu Dongbin turned his head to look. He waved his hand,
and the scroll flew straight to him. He tapped on it gently, and the
scroll unfurled on its own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin read through
it carefully. His face changed slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood. You can
leave now,” Lu Dongbin said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The handsome
youth departed gracefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin, however,
began to frown. “Karmic sinflames descended? The Youngflame clan
actually used a method like this? Although Ji Ning is indeed
talented, he’s trained for less than a century. Will he be able to
survive?” Lu Dongbin turned his head to look towards the distance.
A golden rune suddenly appeared in his pupils, and instantly his gaze
was able to pierce through space, seeing an island that was ten
million kilometers away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the quiet, secluded
island, there was a black-robed maiden seated in the lotus position
on a beach.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This disciple of
mine…she keeps her thoughts and secrets guarded quite tightly,”
Lu Dongbin mused softly to himself. “That killing intent within her
heart…it is even more terrifying than I had predicted it to be. In
addition, at the Grand Xia Dynasty, she was hiding her true power the
entire time. But…when I went to find Judge Cui to inspect her past
lives, everything seemed normal. Although in her previous life, she
was a powerful, fiendish figure, a demon whose power was comparable
to a Loose Immortal who had lived for a million years…for a person
to be powerful in a previous life is a good thing. There’s no need
to hide it. When she awakened her memories during the Conclave of
Immortal Destiny, given how powerful she was in her previous life…she
absolutely could’ve made it to the top three, and perhaps she
could’ve even become champion.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Originally, Lu Dongbin
had deeply desired to take on Ji Ning as his disciple, because Ji
Ning truly was born to be a Sword Immortal. In addition, he had
vaguely sensed some of Ning’s other extraordinary attributes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Yu Wei…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin had
originally felt that Yu Wei was hiding even more secrets. However, he
wasn’t certain at first; after taking her on as his disciple and
interacting with her for a long period of time, he had naturally been
able to discover many flaws in Yu Wei’s façade. In the end, Yu Wei
had been forced to admit it: “Master, I was indeed hiding my true
strength. This was because I don’t wish for others to know about my
past life. I don’t want others to know that in my past life, I was
such a vile, demonic figure. I’m tired…so tired. I want this life
to be a bit more relaxed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei clearly knew
very well that Lu Dongbin, given his status, could easily investigate
her past lives. She no longer maintained her façade before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Was it really just
because she wishes for this life to be a bit more ordinary and
relaxed?” Lu Dongbin was at such a high level of enlightenment that
he was extremely close to the level of the Daofathers! He could
vaguely make out the tides and portents of destiny…and he always
felt that Yu Wei wasn’t as simple a figure as she made herself to
be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, he had
investigated the Book of Life and Death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei hadn’t lied to
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Could it be that he was
wrong?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right now, Yu Wei
needs to keep her heart steady and calm. When the time is right, the
Celestial Tribulation shall come,” Lu Dongbin mused to himself.
“The Celestial Tribulation is incomparably dangerous; in her past
life, she failed to overcome it. In this life, it shall be extremely
dangerous as well! I can sense that her feelings towards Ji Ning are
genuine. If he truly is trapped in a danger zone…if I tell her, her
demonheart tribulation will probably become even more terrifying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For now, I won’t
tell her. After she overcomes her tribulation, I’ll tell her.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin continued to
ponder pensively.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei sat there in the
lotus position at the beach. The seas and the skies were the same
color, giving an impression of a infinitely vast firmament. Her heart
was extremely calm right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She was nurturing her
Dao-heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She was quietly
preparing…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Based on what Patriarch
Lu had said, once she overcame her tribulation and became a Celestial
Immortal, she would leave his tutelage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, I’ll undergo my tribulation soon. Afterwards,
I’ll go seek you out right away.” A hint of a smile played at the
corner of Yu Wei’s mouth. Ji Ning was the warmest memory in her
heart; when Ji Ning had returned to the Grand Xia, Patriarch Lu had
naturally informed her once he had learned of this. However, Yu Wei
didn’t have any idea that Ji Ning was currently trapped in a danger
zone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The term ‘Three
Realms’ referred to the Heaven Realm, the Netherworld Kingdom, and
the Mortal Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heaven Realm and
the Netherworld Kingdom were extremely vast, while the three thousand
major worlds and trillion minor worlds of the Mortal Realm were as
countless as the stars of the Milky Way. And beyond all of these
realms…there was the vast, limitless Void, an empty region that was
even greater than the Three Realms themselves. Within the Void were
two supreme stars, the Solar Star and the Lunar Star, as well as many
other stars.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the infinite
Void, there were countless danger zones, including some which would
cause even True Immortals and Empyrean Gods to perish. In fact, there
were some places which even True Gods and Daofathers would hesitate
to venture into, preferring to simply watch them from a distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three thousand
major worlds and trillion minor worlds were like tiny little islands
or reefs located within the infinite Void. The three thousand major
worlds were like large islands, while the trillion minor worlds were
reefs. At the very center of the three thousand islands and trillion
reefs, there was an enormous ‘continent’ located within the
infinite void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This ‘continent’
was countless times greater than any of the major worlds. There,
space and time clashed and twisted against each other…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It truly was a
terrifying place. And at the places where the chaotic continent and
the empty Void intersected, there were constant waves of void-ripples
that spread out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was much like how,
on a mortal world, where the waters of the ocean met the land,
enormous oceanic waves would slam down against the land.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The waves of Void
slammed repeatedly against the margins of the vast, chaotic
continent…and the constant collisions formed a region of utter
annihilation. The Nihilum Zone!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nihilum Zome.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A streak of white light
suddenly flashed by, transporting a youth to this location.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AAAARGH!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pain like he had never
experienced before. For mortals, once their level of pain reached a
certain threshold, they could actually die from it. As for Immortal
cultivators…the terrifying agony brought by the first round of
punishments from the karmic sinflames was an agony that was applied
directly to their souls. There was no escape, nowhere to hide. The
pain of it vastly outstripped the pain of one’s soul being torn
apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a limit to
how much pain the body and the soul could take.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The amount of pain the
heart could suffer, however, was limitless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once the Dao-heart
collapsed due to agony, the soul would quickly burnt to ash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No. No…” Ning
was struggling to stay alive. He was able to remain just barely
conscious, but that hint of consciousness was simply too weak; he
wasn’t even able to pay any attention to his surroundings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, the increasing
amount of pain reached a peak, a plateau.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly…the pain
vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was rather
stunned. To go from a peak of pain to no pain at all…this, too,
caused Ning’s Dao-heart to tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place is…”
Ning finally managed to look at his surroundings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackness surrounded
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aided by the
incomparably dim wisps of light sent forth by the distant Solar Star,
Ning was able to just barely see that the darkness arounded him
seemed to surge and ebb like flows of water. The void waves…they
stretched off into infinity, while Ning was nothing more than a tiny
little speck in the midst of a vast, endless void sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…a void wave
came sweeping over. Ning felt his entire body tremble; the terrifying
power of the wave vastly surpassed the combined power of all the
Celestial Immortals of the Youngflame clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immediately afterwards…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s entire world
went dark.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.” An
utterly ravishing beauty, dressed in thin, gauzy clothes, was looking
straight towards Ning. She gently loosened her clothes, allowing them
to slide downwards, half-revealing her body. She then gently licked
at one of her fingertips, then used that finger to flick at her her
shoulders, causing her clothes to slip down even further. Instantly,
her clothes slipped all the way down, revealing her completely bare
body. She walked over slowly, her large, limpid eyes staring
longingly towards Ning. “Young master, I want it…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This woman’s
appearance was a mixture of the best aspects of Cloudjade, Autumn
Leaf, Yu Wei, and Ninelotus’ appearances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, she was even
more alluring and even more enchanting; she completely aroused Ning’s
desire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“F*ck off.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning remained
clear-minded; he knew that this was an illusion created by the
descent of the karmic sinflames. This was the second tribulation
brought by the sinflames; the ‘lust tribulation’ of the ‘red
dust tribulations’. Once one became enmeshed into the illusions,
one would truly die. He immediately struck out with his arm,
intending to smash the woman before him into dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…Ning suddenly
realized that his body had become extremely weak. When his palm
struck out, it only carried the amount of power an ordinary mortal
would have. The nude beauty stretched her own hand out, immediately
catching Ning’s arm. She whispered softly, “Are you shy?” She
immediately pressed Ning down to the ground…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When gripped by the
throes of lust, one’s Dao-heart could indeed be shaken. Ning was
completely unable to fight back; all he could do was strive to
maintain his Dao-heart, strive to resist what was happening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems this humble
one’s services weren’t enough. However…this humble one has six
sisters who are even better.” The woman lying across Ning’s chest
whispered gently into his ears. Instantly, six more beauties appeared
in the distance. Each had their own unique charms; truly, beauties
like these were almost impossible to encounter the real world. In
addition, each were exactly the type of woman which Ning liked the
most, and also the type of woman that stirred his lust the most.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew that this was
all just part of the ‘lust tribulation’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…how could the
lust tribulation be so easily overcome? It was much like how, in real
life, many people knew that drugs were harmful, but upon having
tasted it once, they would never be able to abstain from them ever
again. By the same principle…a person might know that his soul
would be destroyed if he succumbed to lust, but succumbing to lust
was a very basic part of human nature. There was no way for a person
to completely rid himself of lust; all a person could do was suppress
it. However…when one was unable to resist, one would still be
repeatedly enticed and aroused by lust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Powdered skeletons.
All of them are nothing more than skeletons; they are transformed
toads that have pustules on their skin. All of them have
intentionally transformed into this appearance to deceive me.” Ning
repeatedly mumbled these words to himself, continuously and forcibly
suppressing his own desires.
</P>

Chapter 3 - Iceheart
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he did his
best to visualize these seven beauties as skeletons, or as
transformed toads and other abominations…deep in his heart, Ji Ning
knew that they weren’t toads. They were part of the ‘red dust
tribulation’ which the karmic sinflames had brought; they were
created from his own heart, and they weren’t actually disgusting.
This caused Ning to unconsciously be drawn further and further into
lust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hold, hold, hold…”
Ning was repeatedly suppressing his own lusts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But as time flowed on,
the amount of lust he felt was increasing nonstop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly came to
his senses. He thought about a legend he had read about on Earth, a
legend about Yu the Great taming the floods. “Rather than dam it
all up, he spread it out in channels. How can lust possibly be
forcibly suppressed? The red dust tribulation…the red dust
tribulation…according to the records of Mount Innerheart, in order
to overcome a red dust tribulation, one has to both enter the red
dust as well as emerge from the red dust.” 1
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But if I allow
myself to enter the red dust…if I succumb to it, what then?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All sorts of thoughts
began to war with each other in Ning’s heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more one knew, the
harder it was to deal with the red dust tribulation. In
addition…‘knowing’ was one thing, being able to actually ‘do’
was another thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter what…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My heart cannot
succumb.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is nothing more
than my baptism through the red dust.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t dare to
relax his vigilance in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually…Ning had
actually made the correct decision. This was because ordinary
cultivators, when being tested by a red dust tribulation, would
generally be able to first allow themselves to succumb for a long
period of time. Afterwards, when the day came for them to suddenly be
enlightened and emerge from the red dust, their Dao-hearts would
naturally be strengthened tremendously. Ning’s situation, however,
was different! His ‘red dust tribulation’ came from the descent
of karmic sinflames; he absolutely couldn’t allow himself to
succumb to them at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lust. Gluttony. Rage.
Avarice. Love. Hate…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the red dust
tribulation, all the desires one could feel when trapped within the
mortal world, the world of red dust, would be amplified to an
extreme.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lust - The most
soul-stirringly beautiful women would appear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Gluttony - Unimaginably
delicious delicacies, delicacies that would cause your soul to
quiver.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rage - All sorts of
arguments, jealousies, disputes…as well as the joy and jubilation
that came after violent conquest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Love - Parental love,
spousal love, romantic love, brotherly love, master-disciple love…the
word ‘love’ truly did involve many things that people were
willing to die for.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hate - Towering,
earth-shattering hatred and resentment that filled every inch of
one’s heart. Hatred that not even the waters of the four seas could
wash away…boundless hatred and a desire to kill one’s foes…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At first, Ning did his
best to suppress all of the desires of the red dust, trying to push
them away from him. This, however, caused Ning’s heart to feel
increasingly tired. But slowly…Ning began to understand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let these
enticements come as they may. My heart abides.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…this is
nothing more but a mortal, fleshly coil.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning completely
separated the innermost part of his heart from the outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He let his lust soar to
the skies. He let himself feel excitement, rage, hatred, joy,
disappointment, grief, happiness…Ning no longer suppressed any of
it, allowing the feelings to invade every part of his entire body.
Ning’s heart, however, transcended it all. It was like a bystander,
simply watching everything and keeping an eye on everything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One’s true
heart…one’s fleshly body…?” Ning slowly began to
understand…and he thought of [Houyi’s Archery].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why [Houyi’s
Archery] was able to rank amongst the top ten divine abilities of the
universe and was considered comparable to the [Starseizing Hand], but
the actual application of it was even more complicated. It had higher
requirements with regards to skill, it required extremely good bows
and arrows…and it only allowed for very, very few shots.
However…its power was truly ridiculous as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the peak of its
power, [Houyi’s Archery] was even more terrifying than the
[Starseizing Hand] at its peak! Even Houyi, a divine archer of the
Primordial Era, would only be able to shoot out ten or so arrows at
maximum power before growing exhausted. The power of those arrows,
however, was truly terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, the
application of divine power was just one part of [Houyi’s Archery].
The true reason why it was dominant throughout the Three Realms and
became acknowledged as the number one archery technique was thanks
to…heartforce!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartforce was a source
of power that was invisible, formless, but incomparably mysterious
and miraculous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a force that
was completely outside the types of power which Immortals and
Fiendgods could normally control. Elemental ki, Immortal power, and
divine power were all visible to the naked eye…but heartforce was
invisible. In fact, unless one was using it to support something like
archery, heartforce alone was completely unable to injure anyone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, it was
precisely this energy, ‘heartforce’, which allowed divine archers
to become truly terrifying figures. Houyi was the most powerful of
the divine archers, and the [Houyi’s Archery] technique which he
developed was able to strengthen the application of heartforce to a
truly frightening level. This was why this technique was such an
unearthly, powerful one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartforce, invisible
and formless…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And yet, it allowed one
to reach astonishing levels of power. In the Primordial World, not
even True Gods or Daofathers would willingly become enemies with
Houyi. He was truly an incomparably terrifying man amongst the True
Gods and Daofathers, a legendary divine archer even in an age of
legends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Houyi’s Archery]
clearly differentiated heartforce into multiple levels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first level of
heartforce could be considered the ‘basic’ level, the level which
Ning had currently reached. If one could truly apply heartforce to
one’s arrows and cause one’s arrows to be able to strike
unerringly at a distance of ten thousand kilometers, one had reached
the basic level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had spent many
years training archery painstakingly at Mount Innerheart before
reaching the basic level. Generally speaking, upon reaching the basic
level, one could already be considered as having entered the ranks of
the ‘divine archers’ and be viewed as one of them, having reached
a level that was as far above the other archers of the Three Realms
as the heavens were above the earth. If one didn’t understand
heartforce, one would never be able to become a true ‘divine
archer’. Only by understanding heartforce could one’s archery
become truly terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second level of
heartforce was known as ‘iceheart’!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Iceheart…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This meant that one’s
inner heart had completely transcended the body. It would no longer
be shaken or bedazzled by foreign influences. The waters of one’s
inner heart would have frozen into a cube of ice; there would no
longer be any ripples within it! Once one’s heart reached this
level, one’s ‘heartforce’ would begin to qualitatively evolve
and also increase in power tremendously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So, under the
pressure of the sinflames of karma…I had unknowingly reached the
level of ‘iceheart’, improving my heartforce.” Ning felt a calm
joy in his heart. “It truly is as others have said; so long as one
can survive the descent of karmic sinflames, one’s Dao-heart will
undergo a qualitative change, and one will increase in power
dramatically.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The descent of karmic
sinflames was a portent for three great tribulations, each more
powerful than the last.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had just
experienced the second round of tribulations, the ‘red dust
tribulations’, resulting in him reaching the iceheart level of
heartforce. From this, one could see that that although karmic
sinflames truly did represent a tremendous tribulation…disaster and
fortune came in a pair. If one survived this tribulation, one would
reap certain rewards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, very few
Immortal cultivators would willingly allow karmic sinflames to
surround them. After all, once they did, even if one did survive the
three rounds of karmic tribulations, in the future, the karmic
sinflames would perpetually blaze around their bodies. One would
constantly suffer from the agony of being burnt by karmic sinflames!
Although the pain wouldn’t be as agonizing as during the three
rounds of tribulations, to be constantly burnt alive…unless it was
absolutely necessary, who would willingly endure such a thing?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, it was
extremely difficult for one to lower one’s level of sin by enough
to drop back down to the level of being surrounded by a ‘bloody
aura of sin’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Karmic virtue, karmic
sin. It was hard to gain karmic virtue, but karmic sin came with
ease!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Killing mortals was a
tremendous sin; doing so would allow one to effortlessly accrue an
enormous amount of sin…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But it was far, far
harder to acquire karmic virtue. For example, after Ning had killed
that evil Patriarch and many evil Diremonsters that had been
surrounded by the bloody light of sin, and after when he had taken on
a disciple who had whole-heartedly devoted herself to him, he had
only just barely been able to upgrade his level of karmic virtue to
being surrounded by golden karmic light. The range of his aura of
golden karmic light had been extremely small as well! To reach the
legendary level of karmic virtue where one’s body would be
surrounded by a rainbow of light would be unfathomably more
difficult!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And in fact…sometimes,
one might do evil, even with the best of intentions. Karmic virtue
was something which even figures as possible as True Gods or
Daofathers were unable to completely understand the rules of.
Although saving figures of karmic virtue and killing sinners did seem
to be virtuous acts, and although ninety-nine out of a hundred such
actions would result in an increase in karmic virtue…there would
always be one who would instead be condemned as a sinner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For one to go from the
level of having karmic sinflames to having a bloody aura of sin was
comparable in difficulty to increasing from having a golden aura of
karmic virtue to a holy rainbow-colored aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus…once one became
bathed in karmic sinflames, it was virtually guaranteed that one
would never, ever be able to escape from them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To be eternally burnt
by karmic sinflames…who would be willing to suffer such a thing?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is there anything
else?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a time, Ning had
transcended everything; it was as though he had been seated upon an
imperial throne, as though he had unified the world, as though no one
would disobey his orders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But suddenly…everything
in front of him disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The scene before him
transformed. He now saw a very ordinary courtyard, within which was a
woman who was carrying an infant. Another woman was next to her,
teasing the infant. In the center of the courtyard, there was a
muscular man who was slicing animal meat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning suddenly
realized that he had become that infant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
When Ning realized that he had taken on the role of the infant, he
was puzzled; during all of the previous tribulations, he had always
remained in his own body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But as time went
on…Ning slowly began to understand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had become the
infant. The infant slowly grew up, becoming a toddler. All the
toddlers received the same type of tutelage within the clan…but
given how young he was, how could he possibly not be restless? Only
after even more time passed did he slowly begin to study hard. And at
eight years of age…his father went out hunting in the mountains,
never to return.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He began to grow up,
because he was the only man in the family. Under the tutelage of his
mother and his second matron, he began to work hard. 2
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His mother and his
second matron, in order to ensure that he would receive good tutelage
within the clan, suffered countless hardships.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He swore an oath to
himself…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He would definitely let
his mother and his second mother live a good life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Luo Jun, at the age
of sixteen, you were able to train to the peak of the Houtian level;
you have quite a bit of potential. What you need to do now is
experience life-and-death dangers. If you can break through to the
Xiantian level…then the lives of your mother and your second matron
will be much better.” A middle-aged man smiled at him. “At that
time…you’ll truly become acknowledged as a member of the
Youngflame clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
youth’s eyes were filled with desire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…Ning, whose
soul was riding with the youth, felt increasingly worried and uneasy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as the youth had
finished a dangerous adventure and had returned to his city, a
green-haired Immortal had suddenly appeared in the skies above the
city.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone in the city
is to be evacuated,” the green-haired Immortal ordered, his voice
echoing everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the courtyard,
the youth and his two mothers both raised their heads to look. They
felt puzzled and mystified; evacuated? How?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later, they
could feel space twisting around them…and they then appeared in a
different dimension.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many people?”
The youth felt as though they were surrounded by an endless sea of
people.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Luo Jun, what…what’s
going on?” His two mothers were both panicking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. This
is a technique of Immortals,” the youth said confidently. “There
are countless clansmen here; we’ll know what’s going on soon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not too long later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were once more
teleported away. This time, even more people were here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This time…it must
be when Old Demon Windraiser put everyone together?” Ning could
vaguely sense what was going to happen, and he felt dread in his
heart. After having spent more than ten years alongside the youth,
Ning sympathized with him as he would for himself. He knew how honest
and good this youth was…and he knew how deep the love was between
this youth and his two mothers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He already knew what
was in the youth’s future. He didn’t wish to believe that this
future would come true.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dimension exploded.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 4 - The Third Sinflame Tribulation
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dimension blew
apart, reality shattering into tiny little pieces. The more powerful
Immortal cultivators within the dimension roared with fury, seeking
to charge out from within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heavens above!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Abu!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless mortals were
completely dazed and confused. They watched as the world itself
shattered…and they were completely unable to resist. The cried out
in terror, in pain, in panic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother, second
matron…no…no…” The youth was completely dazed. He watched as
the two most important people in his life, his mother and his second
matron, be ground apart as the walls of reality itself imploded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most important
people in his life!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second matron!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The youth felt
unbearable pain. He was filled with hatred and despair…and then,
his consciousness went dark.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s soul was
riding with the youth, and the emotions which the youth felt slammed
into Ning as well. After riding with the youth for more than ten
years, Ning had feelings for the two women as well. He viewed them
almost as he would his own mother…and when they died, Ning was
filled with boundless anger, regret, and…self-blame! He couldn’t
help but blame himself for what had happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If…if I hadn’t
shattered that Qiankun pearl…how wonderful it would have been…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That poor child.
Those poor mothers…” Ning’s heart had already reached the
iceheart level, and so he was able to quickly suppress that thread of
self-blame. He quickly and completely escaped from being in the
mindset of that youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Listen up! A foolish
idiot like you isn’t worthy of my little sister.” A muscular,
powerful man was standing on the prone body of a youth. The man was
roaring angrily, “If you know what’s good for you, stay away in
the future. Don’t you dare get close to my little sister again.
Otherwise…next time I see you, things won’t end as easily as they
have today. There are plenty of monsters in the deep mountains
outside the city; if I were to throw you into the mountains, before a
single night is over, you’ll have been completely devoured, leaving
behind not even a bone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The muscular man gave
two more kicks before turning and leaving.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt pain
throughout his entire body. He rose to his feet, his face swollen and
his forehead busted open.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Am I now riding with
this youth?” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The youth turned, then
hobbled with difficulty towards his own residence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji.” A maiden
stealthily crept in. Upon seeing the appearance of the bedridden
youth, she felt such pain that her tears came cascading down. “It’s
all my fault. All my fault…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yu Wei?!” Ning
couldn’t help but feel shocked when he saw the maiden.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They looked too
similar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Far too similar! In
fact, she looked utterly identical to his senior apprentice-sister,
Yu Wei. But Ning quickly came to his senses; given that there were
ten billion mortals within the Oldjade mountain range, it made sense
that there was at least one maiden who looked almost identical to Yu
Wei. In addition…after he gave her a closer look, he saw that this
maiden appeared simpler and more guileless than Yu Wei; she didn’t
have the transcendent aura possessed by an Immortal cultivator.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The maiden helped the
youth bind his wounds, applying medicine to him. She had even brought
over a meat soup for him to drink.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We need to be even
more careful in the future. We can’t let my big brother see us
again, or any other members of my family,” the maiden said
hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Believe me,
Lotus…I’m definitely going to train to the Xiantian level, at
which point I will openly woo you and wed you,” the youth said
seriously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know.” The
maiden nodded gently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You little punk…why
don’t you take a good look at yourself? You really don’t know
your own limits. You little bastard, you aren’t even a Xiantian
lifeform! My little sister is so beautiful, she’s like an Immortal
fairy who has descended to the mortal world; she’s one of the most
beautiful women of the entire city of Eastring. Plenty of people wish
to wed my little sister.” The muscular man was roaring at him. “And
you think you can dream of the same? I warned you last time…so
don’t blame me for showing no mercy this time! Servants, tie him up
and send him to the mountains. Feed him to the monsters!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes!” Two servants
hurriedly assented.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The youth was pressed
down against the ground, and his mouth was gagged with a cloth rag.
His hands, arms, and entire body were quickly bound. He let out an
unhappy groan, but the muscular man just stared at him coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The youth was sent
outside the city, deep into the mountains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave him here.
Soon, he’ll be eaten up.” The two servants tossed him down to the
ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bound youth landed
on the ground, covered with rocks and stones. One protruding stone
stabbed deep into his chest. The youth immediately spat out a
mouthful of blood, rolling around in agony on the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Am I going to die?
Die here?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The youth’s heart was
filled with terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed on…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rustle, rustle, rustle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sound rang out. The
youth’s heart clenched; had a monster just arrived? Forget about
monsters; even ordinary animals would be able to effortlessly eat him
right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m absolutely
sure that he’s over here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You led us astray
earlier. If you are wrong again, you can go die with that brat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Earlier, I led you
the wrong way because it was dark. This time, there’s no mistake at
all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alongside the voices…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A muscular man
appeared, leading two servants.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Urrr. Urrr.” The
youth’s mouth remained gagged; he was unable to speak, but he
stared towards the three with surprise and anger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The muscular man was so
angry, he laughed. “You didn’t die. Your luck really isn’t bad!
I really wonder what you did, you little brat, to make my little
sister so besotted that she threatened suicide. Bring him back!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only later did the
youth discover…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lotus, upon learning
that Ji had been sent to the deep mountains to be fed to monsters,
had been stunned. And then…this girl who had always been innocent,
pure, and obedient…went berserk. She threatened suicide: “If I
don’t see Ji before dawn, I’ll go join him.” The girl had
pressed a sharp knife towards her heart. In the past, she had always
been very obedient towards her peak Xiantian father, but this time,
she wasn’t willing to compromise at all. “Father, you might be
able to take away my knife and tie me up, but if I want to die…you
won’t be able to stop me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end…her
strong, domineering father had bowed his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After this, Lotus’
father and elder brother no longer tried to prevent the two from
being together. To the contrary, they began to train Ji, providing
him with good cultivation techniques. Thanks to the help of Ji’s
father-in-law and brother-in-law, he truly did break through to
become a Xiantian lifeform.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” The youth
used his Xiantian energy to probe Lotus’ stomach. He revealed a
look of delight. “This, this is…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lotus laughed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going to be a
father. Hahaha, I’m going to be a father. Wonderful! Ahahahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The youth was wildly
overjoyed. Lotus, however, just quietly smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lotus, I, Youngflame
Ji, swear that I will definitely take good care of you and our son.”
The youth said excitedly, “My son, in the future, shall become a
truly formidable figure. In fact, he’ll be one of the most
formidable figures of our entire Youngflame clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Lotus
nodded gently as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s soul was
riding with the youth. He had a very strange feeling in his heart.
Lotus looked almost identical to Yu Wei. The excitement which
Youngflame Ji had felt when he had discovered that Lotus was
pregnant…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had a strange
feeling. It was as though he had completely become one with
Youngflame Ji, as though he and Yu Wei were about to have a child
together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, Youngflame Ji,
swear that I will definitely take good care of you and our son.”
When Youngflame Ji said these words…Ning felt a powerful sense of
responsibility.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A husband’s…a
father’s…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Responsibility.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that they
are also going to…” Ning could vaguely see their future, a future
that caused Ning’s heart to feel pain. This girl looked identical
to Yu Wei. She was simple and honest, but her heart was
whole-heartedly with her man. Ning truly didn’t wish to see Lotus
die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed, one day
after another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lotus’ belly grew
bigger and bigger. The young Youngflame Ji was working hard to
acquire all sorts of treasured herbs, which he gave to Lotus to eat.
“My child must be born with the best of talent. In the future, he
will definitely become an important person.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each time Youngflame Ji
had that eager, excited look on his face, Lotus would laugh as she
looked at her man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was bliss.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone in the city
is to be evacuated!” An ancient voice echoed throughout the city.
Youngflame Ji, who had been holding his pregnant wife’s hand and
accompanying her on a stroll, was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world around them
changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Youngflame Ji and Lotus
had arrived within a pocket dimension which was filled with countless
people.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lotus, are you
alright?” Youngflame Ji was extremely worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m fine. But…but
where are we?” Lotus, rather worried as well, clutched at
Youngflame Ji’s hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. I’m
here.” Youngflame Ji vigilantly scanned their surroundings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not too long
afterwards…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A second round of
teleportations. This time, they were moved to Old Demon Windraiser’s
pearl, and the population became even denser.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…” Ning’s
heart was filled with regret. He truly didn’t want to see this…this
scene of utter despair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world broke apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Screams of
terror…rage…despair…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless people began
to die within the shattering dimension.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, no, no…” The
youth was completely dazed. He stared in terror at the surrounding
world. He had sworn an oath…he was going to protect his wife! “What
should I do? What should I do?!” He was blaming himself over and
over; he would rather die than let his beloved wife die! He couldn’t
forget how they had met…the countless hardships they had
experienced together before they had finally been able to be
together…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lotus…” The
youth looked towards the girl, his tears falling down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He truly was helpless!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s good that
we’re together…our entire family is together…” Lotus tightly
clutched her man with one hand while gently touching her stomach with
the other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The shattering
dimension showed no mercy at all. As the cracks in reality swept
towards them…the man, the woman, and the child in the woman’s
belly all perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dimension was
completely destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning even ‘saw’
that giant golden palm appear in the outside world. It was this
golden palm that had shattered the Qiankun pearl, causing the three
of them to all perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And that giant golden
palm…was Ning’s palm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why? Why wasn’t I
just a bit more careful…why did I have to destroy it?” Upon
seeing Lotus die, he couldn’t help but feel as though Yu Wei had
just died in front of him. The agony which Youngflame Ji felt was
sent straight to Ning’s own heart, causing him to feel pain as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was my fault.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I shouldn’t have.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shouldn’t have.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had reached the
‘iceheart’ stage. Although he felt regret …in the deepest
recesses of his heart, he was still able to maintain his state of
cold transcendence. He was still able to completely control the
emotions he felt regarding what had happened in the outside world,
causing it to be unable to shake his inner heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One story after
another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s soul rode with
one individual after another. For some, he only spent a few months
with them; for others, he spent more than ten years. Each person was
the type which Ning absolutely wouldn’t have been willing to
kill…and in fact, many of their stories resonated with him. This
sort of soul-riding felt almost like a form of rebirth. However,
because Ning had reached the ‘iceheart’ level, he was able to
separate all those emotions from his inner heart, causing it to
remain unshaken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…the more Ning
saw, the more he felt a certain desire in his heart…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If only I hadn’t
shattered that Qiankun pearl, how wonderful things would be!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning felt this
desire…he also understood that there was no way to change things.
He couldn’t take it back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sorts of feelings
continuously accumulated within his heart. Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother! Second
matron!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lotus!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why, why?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t want to
die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My baby! Aaaaaaaah!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In that instant…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had experienced
all sorts of powerful emotions over the course of riding with a
thousand lives. All sorts of resentment, anger, pain, embarrassment,
agony…they all suddenly gathered together. Before this, although
Ning was deeply impacted by the emotions he felt when riding with one
of the victims, the emotions came in a single, sudden rush. This
time, however…all of the emotions came crashing upon him at the
same time. The self-recrimination he felt came crashing down upon him
like a wave, instantly drowning him within its waters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was all because
of you. You!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why did you break
it? Why?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You should be
damned.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damned!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you die, you’ll
be free.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Free.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A flood of
emotions…countless voices…they completely buried and smothered
Ning. In fact, they were even able to breach Ning’s ‘iceheart’
and completely fill every inch of his inner heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the most
difficult tribulation of the three tribulations of the ‘red dust
tribulations’…the ‘thousand lives heart-tribulation’!
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_5___Ruler"></A>
Chapter 5 - Ruler
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most terrifying
tribulation of the red dust tribulations was this one, the thousand
lives heart-tribulation. It was an experience akin to being reborn a
thousand times. If one’s Dao-heart was weak, one would probably be
lost forever…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all, to Immortal
cultivators, with the passage of countless lifetimes, one would begin
to lose the memories of one’s former lives. With so many
personalities and experiences in one place…the original personality
and person would be lost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Experiencing a thousand
lives, in and of itself, was enough to cause many Loose Immortals to
be lost…at which point, the karmic sinflames would burn their souls
to ashes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thousand lives
heart-tribulation was even worse; it wasn’t as simple as causing
someone to be actually reborn a thousand times! Ji Ning was a classic
example; with each rebirth, he ‘possessed’ the spirit of someone
whose story and personality resonated with his own…and each of
their stories caused him to feel self-recrimination and regret. If
instead he had been randomly ‘reincarnated’ or ‘possessed’
the body of an evildoer, Ning’s iceheart-level mind probably
wouldn’t have been shaken in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But every single time,
Ning’s soul rode with someone whose life experiences and histories
resonated with himself. Slowly…these experiences had penetrated his
iceheart and entered his inner heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then…they had all
merged together!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A flood of emotions
born from a thousand lives suddenly exploded forth, reaching an
inconceivable level of intensity. This was the final strike of the
thousand lives heart-tribulation…and the most terrifying strike of
all! Countless peerless geniuses had perished to this strike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His ‘iceheart’ had
been completely infiltrated and submerged. Ning was no longer able to
maintain that state at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your fault.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die, die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want you dead!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Vengeance for
Lotus.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The figures from a
thousand lifetimes swam before his eyes. They were roaring with rage,
their faces savage and vicious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…It’s all my
fault. It’s my fault. My fault. If I hadn’t shattered that
Qiankun pearl, all of them would still be alive. They had
children…wives…parents…siblings…if it hadn’t been for me,
they would still be living happy lives…” Ning had already been
completely submerged by the endless waves of emotions that were
crashing through him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Death is a form of
escape…I owe them…I can’t face them…only in death…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Nihilum
Zone. Within a vast, seemingly endless black void wave. Ning just
drifted about with the waves, sent flying repeatedly in different
directions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His eyes were shut. He
simply lay there, amidst the waves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Uncle White and
Little Qing were present, they would have immediately noticed that
Ning’s aura was growing increasingly weak at an utterly alarming
rate. This was the exact moment when the final, explosive strike of
the thousand lives heart-tribulation had arrived!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The seven days are
almost up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s almost been
seven days…Master will definitely survive. Definitely.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Uncle White, Little
Qing, and Mu Northson were quietly waiting at Swallow Mountain. Uncle
White was no longer drinking, Northson was no longer repeatedly
sighing and blaming himself, while Little Qing was constantly
mumbling to herself nonstop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were all waiting
and hoping…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seven days ago, the
karmic sinflames had descended.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, seven days
later…Ji Ning would be facing the most dangerous test of all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have to
survive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the void waves
of the Nihilum Zone. Ning’s aura was rapidly weakening in
strength…but when it reached an extremely low level, that tiny
strand of will just wouldn’t die out, no matter what. It was as
though something was forcibly sustaining Ning’s Dao-heart, causing
it to be unable to completely, truly break apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Ning’s soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was completely dark
here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Under the pressure of
that torrent of emotions from a thousand lives, Ning’s Dao-heart
had weakened so much that his soul had been thrust into utter
darkness, the darkness of utter despair. Logically speaking, Ning
should have already succumbed to it…but he had not.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to be
carefree and unbound!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to control my
own destiny, and to not be toyed with by fate!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t want for
those I love to leave me…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the moment when his
Dao-heart sank down to its lowest depths…a voice rang out in the
deepest part of his heart. This was Ji Ning’s own voice, a resolute
voice, the voice he used when he was at his most stubborn, his most
unyielding.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a chant which
Ning had shouted to himself, even back in his previous life on Earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this life, after
seeing his parents perish one by one at Swallow Mountain…this
desire was only reinforced.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he came to
understand his own sword-heart…he realized that his sword-heart
sought true freedom, sought mastery over his own destiny!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the voice that
rang out in the deepest depths of Ning’s soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I ask to be carefree
and unbound, to control my own destiny, and not to be toyed with by
fate.” Ning’s Dao-heart rapidly began to condense and strengthen,
and as it did, the aura of the young body that was floating about
within the Nihilum Zone began to strengthen as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning slowly regained
consciousness. His mind gradually returned to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That faith, that
chant…it had come from his very essence, rather than from his mind
or consciousness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that his mind had
returned, Ning’s Dao-heart began to heal even more rapidly. His
Dao-heart was also growing even firmer and more dense. “It was
indeed my fault that they died…but they are already dead. All that
is in the past. There is no way to reverse the flow of time, and
there is no way to change past history. Punishing one’s self for
something one can no longer alter…that is nothing more than being
made a fool of by fate! The only one who rules over myself…is
myself!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The youth floating
within the dark void waves of the Nihilum Zone suddenly opened his
eyes. His eyes gleamed like the stars, filled with unfathomable
profoundness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I survived. The
karmic sinflames…I endured them,” the youth murmured softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The karmic sinflames
had already turned invisible. It was difficult to see them with the
naked eye; one had to use divine sense or coresense to see them. The
invisible karmic sinflames continued to swirl around Ning, but they
no longer conjured any more illusions. The likes of the ‘soulkiller
tribulation’, the ‘red dust tribulation’, and the ‘thousand
lives heart-tribulation’ would no longer appear. The karmic
sinflames, however, did continue to burn away at Ning’s soul,
causing Ning to feel pain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This pain could not
compare to the pain Ning had felt when undergoing the first
tribulation, the ‘soulkiller tribulation’; the soulkiller
tribulation brought pain into one’s very essence, and thus could
increase without any limit. By contrast, there was a limit to how
much pain the current karmic sinflames could bring.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…the pain one
felt when one’s soul was being burnt was far greater than the pain
one felt when one’s flesh was being burnt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although surviving
karmic sinflames was a form of baptism for the spirit, the agony of
having one’s soul being burned…this, too, was a form of
punishment for sin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder everyone
says that those who can survive karmic sinflames truly are
incomparably demonic figures,” Ning sighed. “If a vile fiend
truly did decide to kill countless innocents and cause karmic
sinflames to descend, and yet was still able to withstand the
thousand lives heart-tribulation…one can imagine what sort of a
heart he has!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After having
survived the karmic sinflames, my heart has reached the ‘iceheart’
level; in fact, I nearly reached the ‘ruler’ level,” Ning
sighed to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the last instant, he
had broken free of his shackles and awoken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because within
his heart, he had a powerful desire sustaining him…and this desire
called him awake, condensed his Dao-heart, and made Ning realize that
he had to be the one who was the ruler of his own destiny. Even if he
was to die…he should only die if he himself chose to die. As for
any others who wished to make him die? They could forget about it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, although he
understood this in principle, Ning also realized that he hadn’t
truly reached the ‘ruler’ level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Houyi’s Archery]
broke heartforce out into multiple levels. The first level was the
basic level, the second level was the iceheart level, and the third
level was the ruler level!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once one reached the
‘ruler’ level…one would be the absolute master of one’s self!
All outside forces could forget about trying to shake one’s heart.
If one truly did reach the ‘ruler’ level, neither the red dust
tribulation nor the thousand lives heart-tribulation would be able to
cause Ning’s aura to weaken in the slightest. This was because Ning
would be able to completely ignore all sorts of foreign, outside
emotions and feelings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the ‘iceheart’
level could be described as completely separating one’s inner heart
from the outside world and maintaining utter cold calmness, then the
‘ruler’ level was a form of supremacy and transcendence. It is
better to channel than to dam; experts who had reached the ‘ruler’
level in heartforce would no longer act to intentionally suppress
their emotions and desires, not even in the innermost depths of their
heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Let any emotions or
feelings come as they may…like Yu the Great taming the floods, no
matter what waves or floods come, one would be the master of them
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not quite
there yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The final
tribulation, the thousand lives heart-tribulation, caused my
‘iceheart’ to be improved, nearing perfection. I’m now very
close to the ‘ruler’ level.” Ning knew this…but although he
knew and could sense that at the end, when he was in the grips of
despair, he even touched what it meant to be at the ‘ruler’
level…actually breaking through to truly reach that level would
take a long time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A breakthrough in the
spirit…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was even more
difficult than a breakthrough in training in a Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For Immortal
cultivators, the most important thing of all was the Dao-heart. Next
came one’s insights into the Dao. Last of all was one’s
cultivation base!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one’s Dao-heart
was insufficient…no matter how high your cultivation base was or
how many Daos you had comprehended, you would still end up deviating
and going berserk. The more powerful you were, the more likely you
would die, in fact!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao-heart had to be
powerful. Only with a powerful Dao-heart and enough insights into the
Dao should a person break through to the next cultivation level. For
many peerless geniuses and reincarnated Immortals who had awakened
their memories, they had strong enough Dao-hearts and enough insights
into the Dao that they could simply use liquefied elemental essence
and spirit-pills to increase their cultivation base to the level they
wanted it to be at. However, no matter what they did, they wouldn’t
raise it to a level which was beyond what their Dao-hearts or
cultivation bases could handle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One could rapidly
increase one’s cultivation base, but there was no shortcut to
strengthening the Dao-heart or comprehending the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Despite all this, I
was still unable to reach the ‘ruler’ level. What a pity. If I
had reached it…I would have become a truly supreme divine archer of
the Three Realms,” Ning sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Houyi’s Archery]
divided heartforce up into five major levels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third level was the
‘ruler’ level; at this level, one could be considered one of the
supreme divine archers of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fourth level was
the level which the absolute best divine archers of the current Three
Realms had reached.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the fifth
level…this was Houyi’s level. However, this divine archer of the
Primordial Era, Houyi, had disappeared for countless years. Some
claimed he was dead, while others said that he had secluded himself
somewhere. However…what was undisputed was that he had gone missing
for far, far too long. It was very rare for an expert to be patient
enough to go into hiding for that long without interacting with any
other major powers, and so quite a few suspected him of being dead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had nearly
perfected the second level of heartforce, ‘iceheart’. His
heartforce was so powerful that he could now be considered one of the
top divine archers of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Before this, Ning had
merely reached the basic level; this had been only enough to let him
be ranked amongst the divine archers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A voidwave swept across
Ning, pushing him thousands of kilometers away and bringing him to
his senses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a powerful
wave. If I hadn’t trained in the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], I
would’ve died long ago.” Only now did Ning leave his state of
pensiveness and come to his senses. He began to inspect his
surroundings. He was within an utterly dark void, and he could
vaguely make out voidwaves and voidwinds rage about. “What is this
place? Uh…why isn’t there any natural energy here at all?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning discovered to his
astonishment that there was no natural energy of Heaven and Earth
here. Immortal cultivators needed to absorb and refine natural energy
in order to replenish their elemental ki, while Immortals needed it
to replenish their Immortal energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And…where is the
Dao?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dao of the
Heavens?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, he could
clearly sense the Grand Dao of the Sword, the Grand Dao of the
Waterdrop, as well as many other Daos…but Ning discovered to his
amazement that now none of them seemed to exist. He couldn’t sense
them at all. The Dao of the Heavens was missing…which meant that no
matter how he infused his swordplay with the profound mysteries of
the Dao, he wouldn’t be able to summon any of the power of the
natural world at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No natural elemental
energy…and not even the Dao of the Heavens exists?” Ning stared
into the black, dark void around him in disbelief. “Where…where
is this place?!”

Chapter 6 - Wandering
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A place like this
actually exists? Not even the Dao of the Heavens is present…then,
this means that all of the mysteries and intricacies of the Dao are
useless here.” Ning waved his hand, instantly producing a Darknorth
sword. He immediately waved the sword out. Swish! Sword-light
flashed…but nothing else happened. It must be understood that at
Ning’s current level, any casual sword blow was capable of
summoning the power and majesty of Heaven and Earth; for example, the
ninth stance of the [Three-Foot Sword] could transform the sword into
a divine black dragon!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But right now…no
matter how Ning swung his sword and no matter what sword-arts he
used, the only thing that accompanied his sword was a flash of
sword-light…and the flash came from light reflecting off the
Darknorth sword!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It doesn’t matter
how deep my insights into the Dao are?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What the hell sort
of a place is this?” Ning was mystified…but then he had a
thought. “Can this be the legendary…Primordial Ruinworld?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had heard of the
Primordial Ruinworld when he had been at Mount Innerheart. It was the
most dangerous place that he knew of, a place that existed within the
Void that was beyond the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to the
legends…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Pangu’s World
shattered, the Three Realms were born…but the ‘skeleton’ of
Pangu’s World remained. These remnants were known as the Primordial
Ruinworld! The Primordial Ruinworld was not a complete world; it was
a shattered world, making it even more terrifying. Space and time
were in a state of chaos here, and dangers abounded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even True Gods and
Daofathers risked death by coming here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait, that’s not
right.” Ning shook his head. “The Primordial Ruinworld should be
akin to a collection of shattered worlds; why is it that I’m within
a region that is surrounded by voidwinds, as though I was within a
completely empty area?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior bear, Rahu
Bow,” Ning suddenly called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! A black-robed
youth appeared next to him; it was the Rahu Bow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior bear?” Ning
called out again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s dangerous in
the outside world; I cannot emerge.” The giant yellow bear’s
voice rang out within Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dangerous? Aren’t
you the spirit of the underwater estate?” Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed youth
said, surprised, “Master, don’t you know? Senior bear, through
cultivation as the spirit of the underwater estate, has long since
transcended being a mere treasure. He is now a true, living being.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning was
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You damned bow…I
haven’t even told him yet, and you went and blurted it out,” the
giant yellow bear sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning called out in
surprise, “Senior bear, you…you’ve already…” Ning had
naturally heard that treasure-spirits could cultivate, and that
spirits of Protocosmic spirit-treasures could even become Immortals,
completely escaping the confines of their treasure-body and existing
on their own!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wasn’t in a rush
to tell you, but I didn’t expect this Rahu Bow to blurt it out.
Yes…Master treated me with tremendous kindness. In the Three
Realms, there have always been Protocosmic spirit-treasures who have
trained to become Celestial Immortals; in fact, some have even become
Daofathers! After forging me, Master taught me cultivation methods
suitable for treasure-spirits. Over the passage of countless years,
I’ve naturally been slowly training in these methods. I’ve long
ago become a true, living creature. However…my level of cultivation
isn’t high enough, and I cannot yet completely escape the
Starseizing Manor,” the giant yellow bear said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?!” Ning was
speechless. Suddenly, he thought back to the first time he had met
with Patriarch Subhuti. Patriarch Subhuti had said something, back
then: “Go back to the Starseizing Manor. You cannot break away from
the Starseizing Manor for now.” Back then, Ning had been confused
by what the Daofather had meant by these words, and had also been
puzzled by why the giant yellow bear was able to shed tears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So this was the reason
behind it all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The outside world is
dangerous and can cause tremendous damage to me. I cannot go out,”
the giant yellow bear sent mentally. “Ji Ning, you have the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art] protecting you, while the Rahu Bow has not
cultivated and thus has nothing to worry about.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior bear, Rahu
Bow…do you know where we are?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of these figures
had existed since the Primordial Era.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where we are…?”
The giant bear was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t know
either…” The Rahu Bow was similarly puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly
remembered that when Pangu’s World had been destroyed, one had been
sealed away within the Crescent world while the other had hidden
within the world of the Grand Xia. Most likely, they knew very little
about the outside worlds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve heard that
the skeletal remnants of the shattered Primordial World, also known
as the Primordial Ruinworld, still exist. Within that place, space
and time are in a state of chaos. In some places, not even the Dao of
the Heavens exist, and even True Gods or Daofathers who go there
might perish,” Ning said. “The Dao of the Heavens does not exist
in this place, so my guess is that this is the Primordial Ruinworld.
However…the only thing around me is an endless void. I can even
sense a voidwind, but there are no continents whatsoever. So what do
you two think? Where are we?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who told you that
the Primordial Ruinworld consists of the skeletal remnants of Pangu’s
World?” The Rahu Bow asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Isn’t this public
knowledge?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning did indeed know
that the destruction of Pangu’s World involved many secrets…but
aside from the skeletal remnants of Pangu’s World, what else could
the Primordial Ruinworld be?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What the public
knows is wrong!” The black-robed youth was disdainful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is indeed wrong,”
the giant yellow bear sent mentally. “In fact, even I’m not too
sure about the true truth behind the birth of the Primordial
Ruinworld.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning was
startled. “Senior bear, what do you know?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ask your master in
the future,” the giant yellow bear said. “The Rahu Bow and I are
merely treasures, and Rahu’s master, Qi, was merely an Empyrean
God. Although the master I followed was more powerful, Master hid me
away long before he went to participate in the final battle, and so I
know very little. Your master’s status is even higher than my
master’s; he definitely knows far more than me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded lightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…I can tell
you with certainty that the Primordial Ruinworld isn’t as simple a
matter as you have described it to be. If it truly was merely the
remnants of Pangu’s World, how could it be such a terrifying place?
You need to understand that Pangu’s World was an extremely normal
world, whereas the Primordial Ruinworld you have described is far too
terrifying. Not even the Dao of the Heavens exists within it…it
truly is bizarre!” The giant yellow bear continued, “As for this
place where you are right now…I’ve given it some thought, and I
believe that it should be the region where the Void meets the
Primordial Ruinworld…the Nihilum Zone!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nihilum Zone?”
Ning’s eyes instantly lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He naturally knew about
nihilum zones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A major world was like
an island that existed within the vast, infinite Void! At the borders
where the Void met the island, stormy voidwaves would emerge and
crash against the world. This region would commonly be referred to as
a nihilum zone. However, because major worlds were ‘tiny’, the
voidwaves around them would be very weak, and so the nihilum zones
around the likes of the Grand Xia world were quite safe. For people
like Ning, at least, they were like tiny little ripples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Everyone says
that the Primordial Ruinworld is comparable to Pangu’s World in
size; it is infinitely vaster than ordinary major worlds,” Ning
immediately said. “Then the place where the Primordial Ruinworld
meets with the Void will naturally have far more powerful
voidstorms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This should indeed
be the Nihilum Zone outside the Primordial Ruinworld,” Ning said.
“Only a place as mysterious as the Primordial Ruinworld can
possibly result in a place where even the Dao of the Heavens cannot
be sensed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, no matter
what, you absolutely must not enter the Primordial Ruinworld. The
Primordial Ruinworld probably still has remnants of dangerous power
within it,” the giant yellow bear sent hurriedly. “A huge number
of True Gods and Daofathers died in the past within this place; even
if it’s no longer as dangerous as it was before, for someone like
you to enter might result in instant disintegration.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, right, right.
Don’t go in!” The Rahu Bow hurriedly agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course not. After
all, according to the legends…not even True Gods or Daofathers are
willing to recklessly enter the Primordial Ruinworld.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An hour later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The voidwaves were
growing increasingly powerful, sending Ning flipping more than ten
thousand kilometers away before he was able to come to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…That’s way too
much power. The harder I press forward, the more powerful the waves
become.” Ning felt helpless. “How am I supposed to get out of
here?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are so stupid.”
The black-robed youth stood next to him, completely ignoring the
voidwaves. He roared with laughter, “The voidwaves will naturally
weaken once they grow close to a major world…but the farther away
they are, the more savage they become, until they reach a certain
limit! If this Primordial Ruinworld is comparable to Pangu’s World
in size, then most likely only a True God or Daofather will be able
to force their way out of the Nihilum Zone. Not even Empyrean Gods or
True Immortals will be able to accomplish it. Given your
power…there’s no way you can possibly force your way out past the
waves.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then am I supposed
to just go along with the waves?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you go with the
waves, you’ll end up in the Primordial Ruinworld. That’s death,”
the Rahu Bow said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then what should I
do?” Ning was helpless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He couldn’t force his
way against the waves, but if he went along with them into the
Primordial Ruinworld, that would be suicide.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What else can you
do? Try your best to stay alive,” the Rahu Bow said. “Just slowly
train within this Nihilum Zone. The power of the Solar Star and Lunar
Star cover this place; you can continue to train in divine power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s my only
choice, I suppose.” Ning couldn’t come up with any ideas, no
matter what he did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So…he might as well
as just wander.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He’d slowly drift
about on the voidwaves. As long as he didn’t go too close to the
Primordial Ruinworld, it didn’t matter where he went.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He would train on his
journey.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning was drifting
about within the Nihilum Zone outside the Primordial Ruinworld.
Within the Youngflame clan’s tower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! A streak of
light flew into the tower; it was the horned, golden-robed man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ancestor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone called out to
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already sent
Windraiser to the mini-Netherworld.” The Youngflame Ancestor
nodded, then said, “The Ten Yama-Kings of Hell of the
mini-Netherworld gave me face, but Windraiser’s sin was simply too
deep; he’s currently being tormented and tortured within the
endless depths of Hell. After his torture ends and his sin has
dissipated, he’ll be reborn into your Youngflame clan. However…that
will be more than eight million years from now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortals
Infatuation, Sunfish, and the others all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tremendous sinners who
entered the Netherworld would indeed suffer mightily; there was
nothing that could be done about this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning and
Windraiser both suffered the descent of karmic sinflames.” The
Youngflame Ancestor’s face turned grim and sinister. “Now that
more than seven days has passed…he is either dead or alive. Come up
with a way to have some of our people go investigate Ji Ning’s
school, the Black-White College. If he is dead, his life-tablet
within the Black-White College will shatter. Investigate in detail;
we absolutely must find out if his life-tablet is intact or not.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Each of
them assented.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll make the
arrangements,” Celestial Immortal Arcanum said. He carried out the
most miscellaneous tasks amongst their group; after all, he was the
weakest of the Celestial Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine. Arcanum, you
can hanldle it. Remember, you have to investigate this in detail; you
have to verify whether or not his life-tablet is intact. You can’t
just listen to some wild rumors or speculations.” The Youngflame
Ancestor’s eyes narrowed. “Until I know for sure that he is
dead…I will find it hard to rest at ease.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All six of them had
solemn looks on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ning didn’t die,
they would feel uneasy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all…it was
incredibly difficult for a Celestial Immortal to be born, but they
had lost two of them to Ji Ning! In addition, if Ning truly had
managed to survive…that calamitous fiend would most likely cause
the Youngflame clan to continue to suffer terrifying losses in the
future.

Chapter 7 - Half A Year Later
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the Youngflame clan
was planning to send people to Stillwater City and come up with a way
to verify Ning’s status…the Xia Emperor, within the imperial
capital of the Grand Xia, was planning to send out his subordinate,
Skyfox.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Skyfox, pay a visit
to the Black-White College. I need to know if Ji Ning is alive or
not.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master,”
Skyfox said, accepting the order immediately.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor cared
deeply about whether or not Ning was alive. He had decided long ago
that Ning had to be a Daofather’s disciple. Could it be that such a
peerless figure had truly perished? Emotionally speaking, the Xia
Emperor truly couldn’t believe this…but after hearing the report
from Youngflame Freak, he had immediately dispatched his Godslayer
Guards to deal with the escaped Fiendgods, then began to use his
Mirror of Omniscience to watch what was happening within the Oldjade
mountain range. He had personally watched the descent of the karmic
sinflames through the Mirror of Omniscience!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s trained for
less than a century, after all. Although he is a genius the likes of
which the entire major world rarely sees…in the face of the descent
of karmic sinflames, he has less than a ten percent chance of
surviving.” The Xia Emperor had watched Ning battle with the
Youngflame clan through his Mirror of Omniscience. He wanted to be
friends with Ning, while the Youngflame clan was his subordinate
tribe…it truly wasn’t appropriate for him to intervene, and so
all he could do was help neither side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stillwater City. The
Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed,
white-haired man was flying towards Immortal Diancai’s residence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? You want to
know if Ji Ning is alive or not?” Immortal Diancai glanced at
Immortal Skyfox, utter confusion on his face. “Fellow Daoist
Skyfox, why would you ask such a thing?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Immortal
Diancai turned his head to glance outwards. As the master of this
place, he had naturally set up a series of simple formations around
his mountain. When the white-robed, white-haired Whitewater Hound
arrived, Immortal Diancai noticed right away. Frowning, he murmured
to himself, “The Whitewater Hound came as well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whitewater Hound?”
Immortal Skyfox smiled. “Since Ji Ning’s spirit-beast is
here…it’s best for you to ask the Whitewater Hound abouto Ji
Ning, fellow Daoist Diancai. He will definitely know more than I do.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother White.”
Immortal Diancai immediately called out to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Uncle White
wasn’t a formal disciple of the Black-White College, he was the
spirit-beast of a formal disciple and was also a Void-level Earth
Immortal. His status within the Black-White College was now far
higher than it had been, and he was allowed to go to almost anywhere
he pleased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Diancai.”
Uncle White walked over. Upon seeing the seated Skyfox, he
immediately said, “My respects to you, Immortal Skyfox.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sit,” Immortal
Diancai immediately urged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Uncle White sat down.
Immortal Diancai immediately asked him, “Fellow Daoist Skyfox came
to my place to ask about whether our Ji Ning is alive or not. What
has happened to him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Uncle White couldn’t
help but look towards Skyfox.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skyfox said, “I have
come on orders from the Xia Emperor to investigate this matter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Xia Emperor sent
out the Godslayer Guards; he must know exactly what happened within
the Oldjade mountain range. Is there really a need for me to spell
everything out?” Uncle White had a rather ugly look on his face; he
felt that given that the Xia Emperor had sent out the Godslayer
Guards, he should’ve been able to rescue Ning…but he had not.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Xia Emperor only
sent out the Godslayer Guards after receiving a report from the
Youngflame clan that many Fiendgods had escaped into the world,”
Skyfox immediately said. “At first, he didn’t know about what had
happened with Ji Ning. Only when the Godslayer Guards returned to
make their report did he learn that Ji Ning was present as well…and
so the Xia Emperor went to query the Youngflame clan, at which point
he learned what had happened. However, by then it was far too late!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Uncle White didn’t
say anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What are you talking
about?!” Immortal Diancai asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My son Ning has an
extremely deep feud with the Youngflame clan,” Uncle White said
plainly. “The Youngflame clan wasn’t willing to let things rest
either, and so Ning charged straight into the Youngflame clan’s
headquarters. They weren’t able to do anything to him, but they
played a dirty trick which caused him to kill more than ten billion
ordinary mortals. Karmic sinflames instantly descended upon him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He accidentally
killed ten billion mortals, causing the descent of karmic sinflames?”
Immortal Diancai’s face immediately changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He viewed Ji Ning as he
might one of his own children. Upon hearing that Ning had
accidentally killed ten billion mortals and caused the descent of
karmic sinflames, he was instantly stupefied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then where is he
now?” Immortal Diancai asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My son Ning was
instantly assaulted and burned by karmic sinflames, but the
Youngflame clan still wouldn’t let it rest. They used some sort of
teleportation technique to send him far beyond the world of the Grand
Xia,” Uncle White said, his face ashen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How long ago did the
karmic sinflames begin to wreath themselves around him?” Immortal
Diancai asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seven days ago,”
Uncle White said. “More than seven days have passed, but I can
sense that he is still alive. He’s survived the karmic sinflames.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai let
out a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Karmic sinflames!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were utterly
terrifying. Even he, Ning’s master, wouldn’t dare claim that he
would definitely be able to withstand them. He felt both worried for
and proud of his disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
felicitations! He overcame the karmic sinflames tribulations.” The
nearby Skyfox laughed, but his heart was still filled with utter
amazement. And not just him…even the Xia Emperor had felt that Ji
Ning was extremely unlikely to have survived the karmic sinflames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He should have
finished with the karmic sinflames tribulations roughly three or four
hours ago.” Uncle White continued in a low voice, “He naturally
has a Greater Teleportation Dao-seal with him…he would’ve
teleported back long ago, unless he was trapped within some sort of
unescapable danger zone. Since he hasn’t come back…he’s clearly
trapped in a place where even a Greater Teleportation Dao-seal does
not work.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai’s
face turned ugly again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skyfox nodded gently.
“That makes sense. The Youngflame clan has an extremely terrifying
clan-protecting treasure, a Protocosmic spirit-treasure that is known
as the Worldhold Pagoda. The Worldhold Pagoda has the power to tear
open space and teleport people through it. Given how much they hate
Ji Ning, they definitely must have sent him into the infinite Void
that lies beyond the Three Realms. They absolutely wouldn’t have
sent him somewhere where he could simply use a Greater Teleportation
Dao-seal to escape and return.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then what should we
do?” Immortal Diancai immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s nothing we
can do. Some of the danger zones within the Void are so deadly that
not even True Immortals or Empyrean Gods can escape from them.”
Skyfox shook his head. “Diancai, although you’ve become a
Celestial Immortal…you are unable to help Ji Ning in this matter.
In addition, no one knows where he is right now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Youngflame
clan…” A look of boundless rage was within Immortal Diancai’s
eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai knew
very well about the feud between Ji Ning and the Youngflame clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all…in the
past, Patriarch Arcanum of the Youngflame clan had actually gone to
the Black-White College to try and force them to hand him over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Also…the
Youngflame clan is extremely wary of Ji Ning,” Skyfox said. “Two
of the Celestial Immortals of the Youngflame clan died by his hand
this time. Most likely, they are going to do everything they can to
investigate as to whether or not he was able to survive the karmic
sinflames. Thus…they will definitely come to the Black-White
College to investigate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He killed two
Celestial Immortals?” Immortal Diancai was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, that is why the
Youngflame clan is wary of him,” Skyfox said. “This disciple of
yours truly is formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai
quickly calmed down. Nodding, he said, “Understood. Don’t
worry…the Youngflame clan can forget about learning any information
regarding Ji Ning’s status from our Black-White College.
Also…fellow Daoist Skyfox, I hope that your side will not leak out
any information regarding his status either.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. When
I return, I will make my report to the Xia Emperor, and him alone.
The Xia Emperor wouldn’t act to leak this news to the Youngflame
clan,” Skyfox said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That very day, Immortal
Diancai issued an order: The Starfire Palace, where all the
life-tablets of the disciples of the Black-White College were
located, was to be completely sealed and locked down! Nobody was
permitted to go anywhere near it! Not even the Loose Immortals of the
Black-White College dared to go there now. Immortal Diancai was now a
Celestial Immortal; naturally, that meant he had the highest rank and
authority within the Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, the
sealing of a palace that contained life-tablets was a minor matter.
No one opposed it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sealed?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Completely sealed?
Why has the Black-White College suddenly and completely sealed away
the Starfire Palace? Can it be that Ji Ning truly has perished?”
Celestial Immortals Arcanum, Deadwood, and the others were all
puzzled upon hearing this news.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed onwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai
personally stood guard over the Starfire Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciple, it has
been more than three months…” Immortal Diancai stared at the
table in front of him, covered with life-tablets. One of the
life-tablets represented Ji Ning. This life-tablet remained unbroken;
clearly, Ji Ning remained alive despite being trapped in a distant
danger zone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At first, Immortal
Diancai, Uncle White, Mu Northson, and the others all waited
hopefully for his return. However, as more and more time passed, they
gradually understood that it truly was hard to say when he would
return, or if he would return at all. All they could do…was quietly
hope.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Nihilum
Zone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was continuing to
drift about within the infinite, dark Void. He didn’t dare to allow
himself to be swept towards the Primordial Ruinworld by the currents
of voidwaves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His wandering days were
filled with boredom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because he
could not sense the Grand Dao of the Sword, the Grand Dao of the
Waterdrop, or any other Daos. There was no way for him to cultivate
in the Dao at all; all he could do was occasionally train in the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. However, there was a
limit to how much divine power he could absorb each day and a limit
to how much time he could spend in training in it. He couldn’t
perpetually train…and so for more than 90% of the time each day,
Ning did just one thing:
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Train in archery!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Rahu Bow was pulled
tight. Nint stared at the distant, impending voidwave, his heartforce
completely merged into the bow and the arrow. Twang! The arrow shot
out through the void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The arrow moved with
lightning speed as it traversed more than a million kilometers,
striking hard against the distant voidwave. In the face of the power
of the voidwave, however, the arrow was sent flying straight
backwards towards Ning’s direction. When shooting an arrow against
the flow of the voidwaves, the arrows would return. But if he shot
towards any other direction…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although these arrows
were Immortal-ranked magic treasures which could be controlled
through elemental ki, they flew too fast and too far; there was no
way Ning would be able to recover them. And so, the only option for
him was to shoot straight towards an impending voidwave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Day after day. Every
single day, he trained in archery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly, Ning began to
get a better handle on the intricacies behind how [Houyi’s Archery]
utilized divine power, especially now that he had all but reached the
peak of the ‘iceheart’ level. With such powerful heartforce
filling each arrow, the power of each arrow was now greater than his
close combat abilities!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartforce…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was indeed a type of
extremely powerful force. It was the reason why the divine archers of
the Three Realms were so terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had spent roughly
half a year drifting about within the Nirvana Zone. He had no idea
exactly how far he had flown.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? What’s that?”
Ning could vaguely make out something in the distance. Because the
Nirvana Zone was filled with voidwaves and voidstorms, he normally
couldn’t see anything else at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Torch Dragon’s
Eye].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s two eyes
instantly began to blaze with torch-fire. He stared far into the
distance. Instantly, his sight range began to increase rapidly,
allowing him to see a few dim strands of light that had appeared far
away within the darkness. Before using this divine ability, Ning was
only able to see to a few thousand kilometers, but after using it…all
the light of the surrounding area began to gather within his corneas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That is…a
continent!!!!” Ning’s face changed slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That continent was
actually tens of millions of kilometers away from Ning. However,
because of how utterly vast it was, Ning was still able to just
barely make it out with eyes. For example, although the Moon was
located very far away from Earth, ordinary mortals on Earth could
still see it from afar. Similarly, due to how enormous that continent
was, Ning was still able to make it out within the darkness of the
void.
</P>

Chapter 8 - First Contact
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can that be part of
the Primordial Ruinworld?” Ji Ning instantly thought of this
possibility. After all, the Primordial Ruinworld wasn’t a perfect
sphere or cube; it had peaks and valleys. It would make sense if he
was able to see part of it bulging out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter what, I
shouldn’t go near it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Primordial
Ruinworld is incomparably dangerous. Not even True Gods or Daofathers
dare to rashly charge into it. It’s best if I stay far away.”
Ning knew his own limits; although he had the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]
protecting him, he still didn’t dare to act rashly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately began
to move away from that land, pulling away from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he was quite
curious about the Primordial Ruinworld, Ning knew very well…that
curiosity killed the cat!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Millions of kilometers
away from Ning, within the distant darkness of the Void. A mysterious
base was located here, one which was completely invisible to the
naked eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the base.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were numerous
tall, muscular, black-scaled warriors with curved, blood-red horns
who were seated on thrones. A total of eighteen thrones were hovering
in the air. They each sat there silently, their golden eyes focused
upon an image within an enormous mirror that hung within the air. The
image displayed within the mirror was of Ji Ning, who was flying
forward on his own. Ning had just used the [Torch Dragon’s Eye] and
had begun to fly farther away, seeking to pull away from the
continent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The alien has begun
to flee.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that the
alien has discovered us investigating him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shouldn’t have;
we’ve never seen this alien before. He doesn’t come from our
neighboring ‘Quchang’ world, nor does he come from the Heptagod
world.” The eighteen mighty warriors chatted calmly with each other
in the Fiendgod tongue as they sat there atop their thrones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This part of the
Void is the dominion of our world, the Snaphorn world. Even if our
neighbors from the Quchang world or the Heptagod world were to send
scouts over…they wouldn’t send them flying towards us in such an
overt fashion. In addition…he looks very peculiar. His skin
actually looks quite soft and tender, and his body is quite tiny.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be a scout
that has been been sent from an unknown world?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were all chatting
amongst themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, the voice of
the highest ranked warrior, the black-caped warrior who was seated at
the very end of the eighteen thrones, rang out. “Without question,
this newly arrived invader is someone we have never encountered
before. He doesn’t belong to any of the neighboring worlds. As to
where he comes from…if we capture him, we will know.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lord Protector, I
trust you yourself also saw that this alien is capable of surviving
within the voidwinds. In addition, he is enduring the voidwinds
through his own physical power, without relying on any outside
support. Although his skin seems soft and although he is small…none
of us have bodies that can compare to his,” a warrior said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But we have our
wisdom.” The highest ranked black-caped warrior said, “Balo, go
and lead a pack of your children to test this alien’s abilities. If
you can capture him alive, do so; if you cannot, get a full sense of
his strengths and weaknesses. This alien is wandering within the part
of the Void under our control; the other bases are undoubtedly
watching us. Don’t let them laugh at us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tall warrior named
Balo rose to his feet, then immediately walked out of the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single one of the
massive warriors were more than three thousand meters in size. They
were like moving mountains, and in their eyes, Ning was like a tiny
little dot. However…they knew quite well that their neighbors in
the Quchang world and the Heptagod world were not easy to deal with,
and that any alien capable of having traversing such a great distance
through the Void was most likely not easy to deal with either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the silent, dark
void. Ning was continuously flying forward, pulling farther and
farther away from that land. He had already moved more than a million
kilometers away from it, but he had no idea at all…that just six
thousand kilometers away from him, an enormous, invisible spaceship
was drawing close to him, a vessel that couldn’t even be seen with
divine sense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This enormous ship was
more than a hundred kilometers long. Within it, the blood-red horned,
black-scaled warrior ‘Balo’ was seated atop his throne. Below him
was a group of similar black-scaled warriors, some of which even had
enormous scaly wings. However, these warriors all had blood-red eyes,
not golden ones. They all just stood there silently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My children,” Balo
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The ten
mighty warriors standing below him all acknowledged his call in
unison. They looked very similar to Balo, but they had a pair of
wings which he did not, while lacking his curved horn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go and capture this
alien alive. If you cannot…then retreat and return. Remember…don’t
kill him!” Balo rubbed his jaw. “He most likely carries many
secrets with him. We have to take him alive. Only then can we
discover his secrets.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The ten
blood-eyed warriors all assented respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Also…the next
voidstorm is still twelve sectors away from us. You have to return
before the voidstorm arrives,” Balo instructed. These minions of
his wouldn’t dare to try and withstand the voidstorms of this
place; they were tens of millions of kilometers away from their land,
and the voidstorms here were still quite powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The doors of the ship
opened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ten blood-eyed
warriors immediately flew out from the cabin, almost all of them at
least three thousand meters tall. Even the shortest was twenty-four
hundred meters tall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning, who had
been flying through the void, suddenly turned his head. The
torch-light blazed within his eyes. When the door to the spaceship
opened, it was revealed. One after the other, the tall, muscular,
black-armored warriors with giant wings and blood-red eyes came
flying out of the ship at an utterly astonishing speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are living
creatures here?” Ning was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past half year,
he had never encountered any other living creatures within the
Nihilum Zone. And now, a large ship had suddenly appeared, as well as
ten seemingly mighty figures that looked like Fiendgods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There shouldn’t be
any living creatures within the Nihilum Zone. Then…” Ning’s
heart clenched. “These living creatures must’ve entered the Void
through the Primordial Ruinworld.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Primordial
Ruinworld was extremely large; it was possible that there were some
creatures which lived close to its margins. Because they lived at the
borders, they were able to enter the infinite Void…but the
terrifying voidwaves were simply too powerful. Based on what the Rahu
Bow and the giant yellow bear had deduced, most likely only True Gods
or Daofathers would be able to fly about within the Nihilum Zone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alien!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ten enormous
figures flew out, and as they did they sent out their divine sense as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Fiendgod
tongue?” Ning immediately realized noticed this. Although the
Fiendgod tongue was complex and hard to learn, Ning had mastered it
long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that you
do not understand us?” The ten massive figures stared at Ning. The
large ship was drawing closer as well; it was now only a thousand
kilometers away from Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t respond.
He just looked back at them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since he doesn’t
understand…then let’s just go ahead and capture him first.”
Instantly, one of the massive, blood-eyed warriors manifested a giant
whip within his hands. He flew straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stay your hands!”
Only now did Ning send out his own divine sense, speaking in the
Fiendgod tongue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The massive, blood-eyed
warrior instantly came to a halt, a hint of amusement in his
blood-red eyes. “So you can understand after all, alien.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I merely do not wish
to fight you,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then why have you
trespassed into the space that belongs to our Snaphorn world?” The
blood-eyed warrior instantly asked. The other nine blood-eyed
warriors simply watched silently. Their assignment was to capture
this alien…it was best to first test him and see what his strengths
were, and so they were quite willing to spend some time chatting with
this alien.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more they spoke,
the more they would learn about him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I trespassed by
accident,” Ning said. “I do not wish to be enemies with you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Trespassed by
accident? If that’s the case, come with us and go see our master,”
the blood-eyed warrior said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no way I
will leave with you.” Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Was this a joke? There
was no way Ning would dare to casually barge into the Primordial
Ruinworld. That was a place filled with dangers that could wipe out
True Gods or Daofathers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If that’s the
case…we’ll have to take you back by force.” The ten blood-eyed
warriors simultaneously made their move. Five of them were more than
three thousand meters tall, while the other five were around
twenty-four hundred meters tall. The shorter, weaker-looking warriors
simultaneously opened their mouths, emitting a soundless roar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An invisible ripple
spread out, instantly washing over Ning’s entire body. Ning didn’t
even have a clue as to how he was supposed to resist this sort of
attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is this some sort of
hypnotic ability?” When the ripple reached him, Ning instantly
understood. However, he was a Fiendgod as well; his divine soul and
the flesh of his divine body had been completely fused together into
an incomparably stable whole. In addition, Ning’s Dao-heart had
withstood even the karmic sinflames; how could this sort of hypnotic
ability possibly control him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re unable to
control him. His spirit is extremely powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take him by force.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five shorter
warriors all sent out mental messages.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five taller
warriors all produced long whips in their hands, each whip more than
nine thousand meters long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack! Crack! Crack!
Crack! Crack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their whips cracked
out, lashing through the void towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Darknorth sword
appeared in Ning’s hand. He didn’t even use the [Starseizing
Hand] as he used the sword to block the attacking whips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang bang bang bang
bang! A series of concussive sounds; Ning simultaneously blocked all
five whips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These warriors look
like Fiendgods. In terms of strength…they are a bit weaker than me
when I’m not using any divine abilities.” Ning nodded to himself.
“They should be considered just barely equivalent to Void-level
Fiendgods.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning made his move. The
divine power within his body began to activate in accordance with the
method contained within the [Obscuring Wind of the Nine Heavens].
Although he was unable to borrow any of the power of Heaven and Earth
to aid him, his physical speed was already quite fast. In addition,
the Darknorth sword in Ning’s hand instantly expanded to become
more than nine hundred meters long. Given how large his foes were, if
his sword wasn’t long enough, it would be quite hard for him to
injure his foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly flashed
past the bodies of the five warriors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five streaks of
sword-light flashed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The heads of all five
of the three thousand meter tall warriors went flying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What tough bodies.
They seem to be even tougher than Void-level Fiendgods who haven’t
trained in any divine abilities.” Ning could sense that his
Darknorth swords met with quite a bit of resistance as it chopped
through their heads. Although he didn’t have the power of the
natural world to aid him, in terms of his sword techniques, he was at
a vastly higher level than his foes. After all, the Dao of the
Sword…was all about how to actually use and apply the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning realized, to his
amazement, that green blood was pouring out from the necks of the
five giant blood-eyed warriors. Their mouths were twitching…and
then they simply floated away through the void, their bodies devoid
of any auras.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dead?” Ning was
completely puzzled. “Seems like they aren’t Fiendgods.”
Generally speaking, humans and monsters would die when their heads
were severed, but killing Fiendgods required much more effort.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The horned warrior
within the distant spaceship chuckled when he saw this. “Blaze, my
children.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the five
shorter blood-eyed warriors in front of Ning all bellowed, “Damn
you, alien!” Their bodies began to glow with blurry green light.
Their auras began to explosively increase in power, and within their
hands appeared slender silver chains. Twirling the chains, they moved
to encircle Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Their auras seem to
have grown more powerful? Can it be that they are going all out?”
Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The chains collided
with Ning’s sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From this first
collision…Ning was knocked flying backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Without using any
divine abilities…I’m actually physically weaker than them.”
Ning immediately used the [Obscuring Wind of the Nine Heavens] to fly
past the five blood-eyed warriors, moving away from them. At the same
time, five enormous streaks of sword-light flashed past their necks.
In terms of sword-arts…Ning was simply at too high a level. With
his utterly astonishing speed, they truly were completely unable to
stop him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These five blood-eyed
warriors also collapsed, their bodies beginning to float about within
the Void, devoid of all life.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The horned warrior,
Balo, nodded lightly to himself from his position within the
spaceship. “His strength is Earth-level, but his speed is
astonishing; it can be considered Heaven-level. He uses the sword,
and his sword-arts are at an extremely high level; they, too, should
be considered Heaven-level. Of course…I can’t exclude the
possibility that he has some ability to increase his power
dramatically. He’s no cannon fodder; he’s definitely an elite. I
wonder which world actually sent him out to explore all by his
lonesome? Still…fortunately, he’s not TOO powerful. If he was
truly powerful, he would’ve been able to annihilate all ten of them
in a single blow. Mmm…time to go back to the base. I lost ten of my
minions this time; I need to raise a new crop!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The spaceship
immediately turned invisible, once more flying back to the base at
high speed.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the starbase.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seventeen horned,
scaled warriors stared at the mirror and the images within it. They
watched as Ji Ning slaughtered his ten opponents.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lord Protector.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Balo suddenly appeared
within the midair mirror. He looked through it, then said, “Lord
Protector, I’ve finished my tests. This alien’s speed and
sword-arts are all Heaven-level, while his power is Earth-level. In
addition, he has yet to display any particularly astonishing
abilities to increase his power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” The horned,
black-caped warrior within the starbase said, “Balo, your mission
is over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone.” The
horned, black-caped warrior swept the room with his gaze. “I plan
to send a report regarding this alien to the Palace of Elders. Any
objections?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No objections.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“None.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” The horned,
black-caped warrior nodded lightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On a continent of the
Primordial Ruinworld. Within the world known as the Snaphorn world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within an enormous
structure that was more than thirty thousand meters high. A series of
thrones hovered in the air within it in the shape of an arc. A total
of nine thrones were present here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One after another,
horned, gold-caped, gold-eyed warriors with scales began to appear.
Their auras were incomparably powerful. After all nine appeared, an
enormous mirror appeared in the air above them, and images began to
display within the mirror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Venerable Elders, I
am Protector Qiwa of Area 1292 of the Third Void Sector.” The
horned, black-caped warrior spoke with great respect through the
mirror. “We have discovered an alien who has entered the Third Void
Sector of our Snaphorn world. Just now, we’ve made first contact
with him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the images
of Balo sending his ten subordinates to fight against Ji Ning
appeared within the mirror as well. In fact, even the conversation
between Ning and the blood-eyed warriors was replayed in its
entirety.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We judge him to have
power close to the Heaven-level. He may also have some other hidden
abilities,” the horned, black-caped warrior said with great
respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, an alien?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s been quite
some time since we’ve seen an alien from beyond the Quchang world
or the Heptagod world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Interesting. He
actually has two arms and two legs? And his body is so tiny…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tan skin…black
eyes…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine Elders watched
with amusement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had incomparably
exalted statuses; most matters wouldn’t be considered important
enough to be directly reported to them. However…an alien invader
was one of the most important matters possible. The appearance of
even a single invader required a report to be made to the Palace of
Elders. After all, once a single alien appeared…it meant that a
planetary war might soon erupt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An alien which we
have never seen before. He flies at a fairly ordinary speed…but
he’s still able to advance against the voidwaves. This means his
body must be quite powerful, at least. Or perhaps he might have a
special method to block the voidstorms?” An Elder smiled. “I
recommend that we sent out a commando squad from the Third Void
Sector to capture the alien. After that, we will dissect and analyze
him. An alien that we’ve never met before, and which is able to
block the voidwaves despite being so small…he’s worthy of
analysis.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I recommend…that
we completely mobilize the Third Void Sector. We absolutely must
ensure that he cannot escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Complete
mobilization? That will use up too much of our strength. This alien
isn’t able to fly that fast; the warriors that we send out can
easily catch up to him. There’s no need whatsoever for us to
completely mobilize the Third Void Sector.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But this is a
completely unknown alien; we can’t let him escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that you
think the commando squads of the Third Void Sector are unable to deal
with him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Elders debated back
and forth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But right at this
moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A terrifying presence
descended.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine mighty Elders
all raised their heads to look, only to see an enormous figure appear
in the skies. This figure consisted of an enormous golden eye…and
this illusory golden eye alone was already more than thirty thousand
meters wide.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Queen Mother.” The
nine Elders all rose to their feet, saluting respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous golden eye
stared intently at the image of Ning, a look of excitement and anger
appearing within it. A rumbling voice boomed forth…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right…there’s no
mistaking it! That’s a human! A HUMAN!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Human?” The nine
Elders were completely puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Queen Mother, what’s
a human?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s a human?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were all
completely baffled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The powerful
humans…the terrifying humans…” The golden eye stared intently
at Ning as the voice continued to echo forth within the entire Palace
of Elders. “They are the masters of the Three Realms. They are the
culprits who pursued us and killed us…the common enemy of our
Snaphorn world, the Heptagod world, the Quchang world, and countless
other worlds.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The masters of the
‘Three Realms’?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where are these
‘Three Realms’?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The common enemy of
countless worlds?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Elders grew more
and more confused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden eye stared
carefully at Ning, continuing to speak. “Long, long, long ago,
there was a great war…a war which truly tore apart even chaos
itself, a war which shattered the Void. The final end to that great
war resulted in the formation of this shattered, chaotic land. As for
the beautiful, stable, all-encompassing Three Realms…they were
taken over by another force, a powerful force! As for us, the
defeated…our only choice was to come here and live with this
unstable, shattered, Infinite Land.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Infinite Land…is
a land of the defeated?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How, how can this
be?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Snaphorn world
is already incomparably powerful, but the Infinite Land has even more
powerful presences within it. It even has many ‘Sacred Ancients’
within it; how could it be a land of the defeated?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine Elders
couldn’t believe it. They didn’t want to believe it. They had
always felt themselves to be extremely powerful, while the combined
powers of the Infinite Land were even more powerful…but they were
actually still inferior to this so-called ‘Three Realms’?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sacred Ancients are
known as ‘Daofathers’ or ‘True Gods’ in the Three Realms!”
The golden eye continued to speak. “The Three Realms have many True
Gods and Daofathers…in fact, they even have powers that are above
True Gods and Daofathers…especially that legendary figure known as
Nuwa. She was truly too terrifying…even Sacred Ancients were
instantly slain before her.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” The nine
Elders were completely stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sacred Ancients?
Instantly slain?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nuwa?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Who was this Nuwa?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine Elders firmly
engraved the name ‘Nuwa’ into their memories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are some
extremely powerful Daofathers in the Three Realms who are capable of
annihilating our Snaphorn world with but the wave of a hand. When
they part their lips, flames will emerge that can engulf the space of
the void, causing even space itself to be set alight. When they
brandish their swords….they can cause multiple Sacred Ancients to
flee without recourse.” A faraway look was in pupil of the golden
eye as it continued to speak slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine Elders all
knew very well that their Queen Mother was the founder and builder of
their world, a figure who had existed ever since the days of the most
ancient of wars.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What the Queen Mother
spoke of, she most likely had personally witnessed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Too terrifying…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This ‘Three Realms’
was far too terrifying!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition, the
Three Realms have many other races within them. The most powerful of
those races, however, are the humans. The humans are the masters of
the Three Realms,” the golden eye said. “Supposedly, it was Nuwa
who created humans, and she doted dearly upon them. In
addition…humans have a terrifying rate of growth as well as
procreation. They gave birth to many powerful individuals, including
many of their ‘Daofathers’. Humans are the most powerful, have
the most potential, and are publicly acknowledged as the masters of
the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And this little
invader…he is human!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden eye stared
death towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Human?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine Elders stared
at Ning as well. Previously, they had looked down upon him as they
might look down upon a bug. They felt themselves to be wise and
powerful; they hadn’t held this puny little figure in any regard.
But now, from what they had just learned…they realized that this
puny little fellow, less than a tenth of a percent of their size…was
actually one of terrifying masters of the Three Realms, a common
enemy to the entire Infinite Land…a human!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this is a
‘human’?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine Elders
couldn’t help but feel a sense of both dread and respect, because
the race behind this alien invader was simply too terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…there is
no need to worry about a little fellow like him,” the Queen
Mother’s voice rang out. “This is the Infinite Land, not the
Three Realms. Those so-called Heavenly Daos of Metal, Wood, Water,
Fire, Earth, and the others…they are useless here. Only the most
supreme of Daos, the Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos, is present
here. The Dao of Primordial Chaos is the most exalted of Daos. Both
the Infinite Land and the Three Realms were born from the primordial
chaos…and anything born from the primordial chaos is subject to the
Dao of Primordial Chaos. However…anyone capable of understanding
the Dao of Primordial Chaos, even just a tiny part of it, would be
considered one of the most supreme figures of the Three Realms. This
little fellow shouldn’t be that strong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The nine
Elders all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao of Primordial
Chaos…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had heard of it
before. It was the most exalted of Daos, the most powerful of Daos!
If one could summon the limitless power of the Dao of Primordial
Chaos, even the killing of Daofathers would be accomplished with
ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hear and obey,”
the Queen Mother’s voice rang out, having grown deeper. “Fully
activate the entire Third Void Sector. This human absolutely must not
escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Send out all of the
commando squads of the Third Void Sector to capture this human.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Send out the entire
First Army of our border armies. This human must be captured!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine Elders all
assented with respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Queen Mother
commands the alien to be captured. We shall fully mobilize.” A
horned, violet-caped warrior let out a bellow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For the Queen
Mother!” The dense cluster of a thousand-plus black-caped warriors
all called out in unison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Queen Mother
commands that our First Army fully mobilize at once to capture this
alien.” A horned warrior with an extremely powerful aura let out a
roar. This horned warrior wore a golden cape which was covered with
black tattoos at the base.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For the Queen
Mother!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The group of horned,
violet-caped warriors below him all called out with respect and
ardor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They immediately began
to summon their squads and units. Soon, the most powerful army of the
border armies, the First Army, flew out from the Infinite Land. They
boarded their enormous spaceships and flew into the Void, towards the
direction of Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the darkness of
the void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three powerful minds
were communicating with each other, one of which was the Queen Mother
who had just given the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder sister, why
have you awoken us?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It isn’t time for
us to wake up yet.” The two other minds each released their own
queries.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the mind of
the Queen Mother said: “In the space around our Snaphorn world, a
human has appeared.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A human?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? A human?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two other
terrifying minds instantly trembled. They would never be able to
forget that terrifying war. The tremendous power of the human race
had been completely engraved into their minds. Even though countless
eras had passed since then…they could never forget. That had been a
true nightmare. That terrifying entity had countless experts, and the
humans were the most powerful of them. Those utterly enormous,
so-called ‘formations’…those blazing infernos that had been
birthed from the Solar Star…those staves, those trees, those
swords, those weapons…they had exterminated countless individuals
that the three of them had venerated. They all felt tremendously
grateful for having been able to survive that great war.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This human is still
very weak, and I’ve already sent out the entire First Army of the
border armies after him. Within the First Army, there are at least a
few ‘Firstborn’. I’ll be able to see everything they experience
and will be able to more closely inspect this human who has arrived,”
the Queen Mother’s mind sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your actions are
correct, elder sister.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Keep a close eye on
this human.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Snaphorn world, in
truth, was ruled over by these three Queen Mothers. They were the
founders of this world; naturally, they vastly outstripped Ji Ning in
power. However, they were wary of the humans which Ning represented,
and so they didn’t dare to be the slightest bit arrogant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These three Queen
Mothers had, long ago, given birth to a group of children.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their children had
continued to give birth to children of their own…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, one generation
after another, this continued…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The original source for
all of the citizens of the Snaphorn world was this trio of Queen
Mothers! Those who had been born from the Queen Mothers were known as
the ‘Firstborn’, and they had the greatest potential. The
children of the Firstborn were the Secondborn, and their potential
was second only to that of the Firstborn. The children of the
Secondborn were the Thirdborn, and so on and so forth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, of the
nine Elders in the Palace of Elders, eight were Firstborn while one
was Thirdborn!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Queen Mothers who
had given birth to the Firstborn were able to know everything they
experienced.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a beautiful
world of flowers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Perhaps fate was indeed
meddling in subtle ways, for just as Ji Ning encountered this new
danger, the day of Yu Wei’s Celestial Tribulation had begun.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciple, you were
very powerful in your past life, and in this life you accepted me as
your master…which means that this Celestial Tribulation will be
incomparably shocking in power. I’m not able to help you too much
in dealing with this tribulation. All I can do is help guard you from
outsiders. As for the tribulation itself…it’ll be up to you.”
Lu Dongbin, his Immortal sword on his back, looked towards the
black-robed Yu Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple
understands,” Yu Wei said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go, then.” Lu
Dongbin nodded lightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei immediately flew
to the peak of a distant island mountain. As for Lu Dongbin, he
continued to watch from his current location atop the peak of a
nearby mountain. Lu Dongbin was in complete control of this minor
world; it was his personal, secret abode. He had even set down layers
of formations, ensuring that even True Gods or Daofathers who wished
to barge in would have to spend a significant amount of effort.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wind tribulation,
the fire tribulation, the thunder tribulation, the demonheart
tribulation…the four great tribulations of the Celestial
Tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei was indeed
extremely powerful. She had been very powerful in her past life, and
with Patriarch Lu’s guidance in this life, she had reached an
extremely high level of insight into the Dao. She was thus able to
smoothly sail through the wind tribulation and the fire tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” The
distant Lu Dongbin frowned slightly as he looked towards her.
“Although the wind tribulation and the fire tribulation have both
ended…both were clearly more formidable than the ones which most of
the disciples under my command experienced. In fact…they were close
in power to the wind tribulation and the fire tribulation which I
myself experienced so long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin had been
Emperor Eastflower in a past life; after he had reincarnated and
become Patriarch Lu, his tribulation had definitely not been a simple
one!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he was a Ki
Refiner, in the face of the thunder tribulation of his Celestial
Tribulation…he inconceivably encountered nine nine-sets of thunder
tribulation! However, Lu Dongbin had the benefit of a solid
foundation provided by his past life. How could the soul of Emperor
Eastflower be so easily dealt with? In addition, his master was a
superb one, one of the truly supreme figures of the entire Three
Realms. Thus…despite being a Ki Refiner, he had managed to force
his way through the nine nine-sets of thunder tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, he had already
reached the absolute peak of power possible for a Pure Yang True
Immortal. He was publicly acclaimed within the Three Realms as the
True Immortal with the highest chance of becoming a Daofather, and in
fact he had already stepped halfway into the realm of becoming a
Daofather.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Judging from that
wind tribulation and that fire tribulation…my disciple’s thunder
tribulation probably won’t stop at six nine-sets.” Lu Dongbin
frowned. “Her experiences in her past life were ordinary, and I’m
the only master she’s taken on in this life. Normally speaking,
most Ki Refiner disciples of Daofathers will only experience six
nine-sets. Why in the world is her Celestial Tribulation this
deadly?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin had always
felt that this disciple of his had been hiding something. However,
although he had even sought out Judge Cui and read her past life’s
history within the Book of Life and Death, he had still been unable
to uncover anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…his
subconscious continued to tell him that something wasn’t quite
right.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of a
Celestial Tribulation was determined by the cosmos themselves;
naturally, there had to be a reason behind all of this!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In an hour, the
thunder tribulation shall arrive.” Lu Dongbin no longer dwelled on
the question, just watching quietly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nihilum Zone,
beyond the Primordial Ruinworld. Ning was currently flying forward at
high speed, continuing to pull away from that distant land. That
earlier, sudden attack had caused him to feel that something was
wrong…especially when those foes had claimed to be from the
Snaphorn world and that this space region belonged to their Snaphorn
world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly
understood that these creatures must have come from the Primordial
Ruinworld…and that he had been discovered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Flee!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Flee at top speed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Primordial
Ruinworld was a place which not even True Gods or Daofathers would
dare trespass. Ning naturally wasn’t willing to interact with the
Primordial Ruinworld in any way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, layers of
light began to appear within the formerly dark emptiness of the Void.
It was a golden light. The Third Void Sector of the Nihilum Zone had
nearly ten thousand bases within it which were connected to each
other like nodes! Every single node was a critical point within an
utterly enormous formation…and in an instant, an enormous net that
spanned tens of millions of kilometers was instantly formed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But, but…” Ning
was stunned by the sight before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His eyes were already
blazing with torch-light. He had immediately used the [Torch Dragon’s
Eye] and hurriedly scanned his surroundings, but no matter where he
looked, he saw the golden light seemingly stretch off to infinity. If
he looked carefully enough, he could see countless patterns and
ripples within the golden web, while the nodes were particularly
eye-catching and brilliant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A grand sealing
formation that covers many tens of millions of kilometers?” Ning
mumbled to himself, “This is crazy. The entire Stillwater
Commandery is only a few million kilometers in size.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A region of many tens
of millions of kilometers in size was comparable to a hundred
ordinary commanderies of the Grand Xia world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An utterly enormous
formation like this truly was astonishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems the power
of this Snaphorn world is far beyond what the likes of myself can
handle. What should I do? What should I do?” Ning instantly began
to consider his next options. Although he was shocked by this
enormous formation, Ning wasn’t an inexperienced bumpkin; for
example, in the Crescent world, Patriarch Subhuti had secretly set up
many enormous formations, some of which were able to cover an entire
continent, which was equivalent to a third of the world of the Grand
Xia. Those formations were far larger than the grand sealing
formation before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And the Celestial
Court!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The formations of the
Celestial Court covered the entirety of the region they controlled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were many
formations within the Three Realms that were far, far larger than
this grand sealing formation! However…generally speaking, only
Daofathers were capable of setting up those titanic formations! Most
likely, not even Pure Yang True Immortals would be able to set them
up, unless they were Pure Yang True Immortals who were extremely
skilled in the art of formations, or supreme True Immortals like Lu
Dongbin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, this
enormous space formation was merely one of the defensive formations
of this Snaphorn world; it probably didn’t represent the complete,
full power of the Snaphorn world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…its appearance
was enough to cause Ning unease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An individual capable
of establishing this sort of enormous formation definitely wasn’t
someone which the likes of Ning, who hadn’t even undergone the
Celestial Tribulation yet, could overcome.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And…aren’t the
Heavenly Daos gone from this place? How, then, can formations be
used?” Ning guessed, puzzled, “It seems I truly do know far, far
too little about the Primordial Ruinworld.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed, Ning truly knew
too little.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the ten Heavenly
Daos, Primordial Chaos was the most supreme. Life and Destruction
were matched, while Yin and Yang were also matched; these four were
preceded only by Primordial Chaos. As for the Five Elements of Metal,
Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth, they served as the foundation for the
entirety of the Three Realms…but they were on the third tier. Ning
had an extremely deep level of insight into the Grand Dao of the
Waterdrop, which was why he could vaguely sense the existence of the
Heavenly Dao of Water, but here within the Nihilum Zone, he was
completely unable to sense it…and so he had believed that the
Heavenly Daos did not exist here!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In reality, however,
only nine of the Heavenly Daos were missing from the Nihilum Zone of
the Primordial Ruinworld. The Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos
continued to exist; any place which was born from the primordial
chaos was a place where the Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos would
exist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter what…I
need to give it a try.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning knew that
it was unlikely that he would be able to break through this
terrifying formation, he couldn’t just give up and wait for death.
He didn’t want to be captured by the Snaphorn world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The part of the net of
light closest to Ning was merely a few million kilometers away. After
using the [Obscuring Wind of the Nine Heavens], Ning’s movement
speed was extremely fast; it was a flying technique, after all, and
once one used it to fly, one could rely on momentum and thusly limit
the amount of divine power that was consumed. It wasn’t like the
[Starseizing Hand] or other divine abilities which consumed an
enormous amount of divine power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here I am.” Ning
stared at the distant net of light, now only a few tens of thousands
of kilometers away. The Rahu Bow appeared within his hands. He
immediately nocked it, pulled it to a nearly full circle, circulated
his divine power, then utilized [Houyi’s Archery].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Light flashed around
him, quickly passing through him to the bow, then condensing within
the arrow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time…Ning
filled all of his heartforce, now nearly at the peak of the
‘iceheart’ level, into the arrow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A brilliant, fiery red
streak of light pierced through the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the arrow flew
forward, the light around it grew more and more dazzling, and its
power grew greater and greater. In the end, it seemed to have
transformed into an enormous, fiery red comet. Generally speaking,
thanks to [Houyi’s Archery], the farther the arrow flew, the more
powerful it would become, until it reached peak power. Within the
Three Realms, the usage of this technique would be even more
incredible, because as the arrow flew it would constantly draw in the
power of the natural world! Right now, since it was unable to do so,
its power wasn’t increasing at too ridiculous a rate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…the power of
this arrow had still surpassed that of Ning’s close combat ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fiery red comet
struck against the net of light…and the net of light just rippled
slightly, then turned calm once more. As for Ning’s arrow, it had
been knocked flying away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As I thought, I
failed.” Ning wasn’t surprised at all. If he truly was able to
pierce this terrifying sealing formation that was tens of millions of
kilometers in size through using just a single arrow…only then
would he be surprised! However…he truly didn’t wish to accept
this!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All space within
this region has been completely locked. There’s no way for me to
flee.” Ning felt frantic inside. “The Youngflame clan really was
quite vicious in sending me here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Primordial
Ruinworld’s Nihilum Zone was indeed an awe-inspiringly famous
danger zone. Not even many Empyrean Gods or True Immortals would be
able to escape from it, much less the likes of Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the even more
deadly Primordial Ruinworld…naturally, the Youngflame clan would’ve
liked to send him to that place, but alas, even the Protocosmic
spirit-treasure, the Worldhold Pagoda, was only able to tear open the
fabric of space to send Ning into the Nihilum Zone. It was unable to
send him to the Primordial Ruinworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning suddenly
turned his head to look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From far away, within
the distant void of space, an enormous ship had suddenly appeared.
This titanic ship was ten thousand kilometers long; it was like one
of the continents of Earth! Earlier, it had been completely
invisible, but now it had materialized out of nowhere. The entrance
to the ship opened, and a series of massive, towering, blood-red
horned, golden-eyed, black-caped warriors came flying out. The many
warriors all radiated utterly astonishing auras.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So the army of the
Snaphorn world of the Primordial Ruinworld have arrived.” Ning’s
pupils contracted.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_11___A_Crisis_of_Divine"></A>
Chapter 11 - A Crisis of Divine Power
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait.” When Ji
Ning saw the steady stream of black-caped warriors pour out from the
distant ship, he couldn’t help but feel surprised. “The warriors
I fought previously had scales, wings, and blood-red eyes. But now,
we have some black-caped warriors in front of me…all of which have
four arms, golden eyes, and blood-red horns. They look completely
different from the earlier enemies; even their auras are far more
powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the ten foes Ning
had previously slaughtered were adorable little kittens, then these
black-caped warriors standing before him were like truly savage
tigers!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A total of over a
thousand black-caped warriors.” After counting more than a thousand
warriors flying out from the distant ship, Ning saw how, after a long
moment passed, yet another warrior emerged from the ship. This one
was dressed in a violet cape, but in all other respects, he looked
identical to the black-caped warriors, save for the fact that there
was an enormous difference in their auras of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a terrifying
force.” Ning suddenly felt as though it was hard to breathe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The violet-caped
warrior took just a single step forward. His body blurred, then
suddenly appeared before the thousand-plus black-caped warriors. This
speed caused Ning’s eyes to twitch; even when he used his
[Obscuring Wind of the Nine Heavens] divine ability, he still wasn’t
as fast as this person.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The invisible aura the
person emanated caused Ning to feel even more pressure. “He’s
definitely more powerful than any Celestial Immortal I’ve faced to
date.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Commander.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thousand-plus
black-caped warriors all looked towards their leader with eagerness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The violet-caped
warrior, however, gave Ning a curious glance. “An alien who looks
like this and who is so small…I’ve never seen or even heard of
someone like him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?
What should I do? What’s my next course of action?” Ning was
feeling extraordinarily nervous right now. The entire region of many
tens of kilometers was encompassed by this grand formation; there was
nowhere for him to flee, and the army squad which the Snaphorn world
had just sent out was terrifyingly strong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The voidwaves are
being completely blocked out by the Third Void Sector’s defenses;
no need to worry, everyone.” The violet-caped warrior smiled.
“Release your children and capture this alien.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a series of
deafening roars rang out, shaking the region of space. At the same
time, the thousand-plus black-caped warriors simultaneously opened
their mouths. Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ten small spheres flew
out from each of their mouths, producing a total of more than ten
thousand small spheres. These small spheres instantly expanded in
size when they entered the space of the Void, and they quickly
transformed into a series of scaled, winged, blood-eyed warriors of
enormous size.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They vomited them
out?” Ning was completely flabbergasted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Children, capture
this alien,” the violet-caped warrior ordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ten thousand-plus
blood-eyed warriors all assented in unison…and then half of them,
the shorter and smaller ones, all opened their own mouths and emitted
soundless roars, causing an invisible ripple of power to instantly
sweep towards Ning. Ning knew what was coming this time; he knew that
these smaller blood-eyed warriors were skilled in hypnotism. Last
time, he had only faced five of them, but this time more than five
thousand of them were simultaneously using the technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The formless ripples
couldn’t be avoided; all he could do was take them head-on!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang! Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could feel booms
ring out from within his soul!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…with his
heartforce at nearly the peak of the iceheart stage, Ning was still
able to survive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a powerful
soul.” The violet-caped warrior nodded lightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This alien really
does have a bit of talent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. Although our
children are merely fairly weak cannon fodder meant to be used up
during a battle…in large numbers, they are still quite dangerous. I
wonder where this alien came from? He’s quite strong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-caped
warriors were stealthily chatting amongst themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since hypnotism had
failed…the ten thousand-plus blood-eyed warriors pulled out their
weapons, then all charged forward, filling the Void with their
massive bodies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These could be
considered as having power that was just barely comparable to
Void-level Fiendgods, but they didn’t have Fiendgod-like
indestructible bodies. If he used all his abilities, such as the
[Starseizing Hand] or [Three Heads, Six Arms], Ning could wipe them
all out in a very short period of time! After all, they didn’t have
regenerating bodies; killing them would be very easy, very simple.
However…Ning didn’t dare to recklessly waste his divine power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Starseizing Hand]
used up a vicious amount of divine power; once his divine power was
exhausted, he would no longer be able to even fight back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll have to rely
on swordplay.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s two hands each
held a Darknorth sword. He made the swords expand to nine hundred
meters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He used the [Obscuring
Wind of the Nine Heavens], instantly charging into the very center of
that mass of blood-eyed warriors. Ning didn’t use any additional
divine abilities after that, relying solely on his sword-arts. Slash,
slash, slash! Sword-light flashed everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword-arts
were unfathomably profound, far beyond what these blood-eyed warriors
were capable of. The pair of nine hundred meter long Darknorth swords
slashed through the air, chopping past the heads of the blood-eyed
warriors, sometimes completely bisecting them in half!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the blood-eyed
warriors died, unable to heal from their wounds, regardless of where
the injuries were, head or waist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? His sword-arts
truly are profound.” The violet-caped warrior was surprised by what
he saw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was born to be a
Sword Immortal. Even though he could no longer sense the Dao of the
Sword or summon the natural energy of the world…his sword-arts
remained unfathomable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blaze, my children,”
the violet-caped warrior called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Roaaaaaar!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alien!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The horde of blood-eyed
warriors bellowed as their bodies began to glow with a blurry green
light. Instantly, their speed and their strength rose dramatically.
They began to assault Ning en masse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning remained very
calm. He didn’t use any divine abilities; instead, he relied on his
sword-arts to continue to slaughter these blood-eyed warriors. In
fact, he even used his own body as a weapon, using it to block the
enemy axes and whips head-on. Due to having trained in the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art], Ning was able to actually conserve power by
using his own body to take on blows as he fought within the mass of
blood-eyed warriors!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wasn’t worried
about them being able to injure him in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Ning
was occasionally sent flying here by an axe or flying there by a
whip…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But each time he was
sent ‘flying’, his sword-light would flash past in a graceful
manner…and many enemy heads would go flying as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the infinite
darkness of the Void, three powerful minds were communicating with
each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This human’s body
is rather strong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. It’s like
one of those ‘magic treasures’ those humans use.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This human is
probably at the Celestial Immortal level of power at most…but his
body is this powerful…he most likely must have trained in an
earth-shatteringly powerful protective divine ability those humans
have.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ideally, we shall
capture him alive, so that we can analyze his body. If we can gain
some insights into some of the profound mysteries behind his divine
ability, then use them to make us sisters grow more physically
powerful, that would be wonderful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By relying on the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art] and his sword-arts, Ning was able to wipe out
all of the blood-eyed warriors in the time needed to boil a kettle of
tea. However, Ning didn’t feel excited at all…because he saw the
amusement on the faces of the distant black-caped warriors, and the
calmness of the violet-caped warrior. He understood from this that to
the Snaphorn world, the forces he had just killed most likely
represented very little.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They really did
represent almost nothing. They were cannon fodder; in fact, they
weren’t even viewed as true members of the same race to which the
horned warriors belonged! To produce a true member of the race
required an extremely high price to be paid! Producing this sort of
cannon fodder, however, was much easier and much cheaper. However,
there was a limit to how many of them each horned warrior could
control; some would have to perish before they could give birth to
more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was able to kill
more than ten thousand of our children; he does have a bit of
talent.” The violet-caped warrior said, “Hellsong, go and test
his abilities.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black-caped warrior
nodded, then manifested four shortswords in his four hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart
clenched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had just seen him
kill more than ten thousand of those blood-eyed warriors…but still
chose to send a single black-caped warrior to fight?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
black-caped warrior suddenly moved, transforming into a blur as he
pounced towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So fast!” Ning was
somewhat caught off-guard. Those earlier red-eyed warriors had been
far slower than him, but this black-caped warrior was so fast that he
was only slightly slower than Ning when using the [Obscuring Wind of
the Nine Heavens]. He could already be considered as being on Ning’s
general level; he was slightly slower, but it wouldn’t make much of
a difference.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Four icy shortswords
came plunging towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Darknorth
swords struck outwards as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang clang clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Consecutive collisions
could be heard. Ning’s advantage lay in the profoundness of his
sword-arts, while the enemy’s advantage was having four arms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, from that
clash…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was sent flying
back!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What great power.”
Ning’s face changed, then his body blurred, transforming into his
three-headed, six-armed form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three heads and six
arms? So is this your true form?” The black-caped warrior was quite
surprised, but he then snickered, “Interesting.” He charged forth
once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now had six divine
swords in his six arms. His sword-arts were profound, but he remained
unwilling to use the [Starseizing Hand]. The [Starseizing Hand]
simply used up far too much divine power, and the strength of this
Snaphorn world was immeasurable. It was better to make himself appear
weak; if he immediately revealed his trump cards, they would probably
prepare even more powerful trump cards to deal with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Ning’s
sword-light sliced through the black-caped warrior’s body. The
black-caped warrior retreated at high speed, but a gaping wound was
still cut through his chest. Green blood spewed outwards, but in the
blink of an eye the wound was healed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Healed?” Ning was
surprised. “So they really are two separate races. Those cannon
fodders were completely unable to heal, but the black-caped warriors
are capable of self-regeneration.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once someone became
capable of self-regeneration, killing them would be much harder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The
violet-caped warrior saw what had just happened. “Hellsong’s
unit, engage.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, nine more
black-caped warriors went flying forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hellsong, can’t
you get it done?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can’t even
capture a single alien, and you even got injured.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine other
black-caped warriors all spoke teasingly, but they showed no mercy in
their movements at all. They soon formed a complete circle around
Ning, attacking him en masse and giving him nowhere to flee at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s body suddenly
increased explosively in size, expanding to three thousand meters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three thousand meters
was Ning’s limit in using the Heavenly Transformation technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” Prior to
this, those ten black-caped warriors were surrounding and assaulting
a tiny little dot, but that tiny little dot had suddenly and
explosively increased in size to become comparable to them; this
caused them to feel completely flabbergasted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this is how tall
you actually are…I imagine this is your true form, right?”
Hellsong sighed in amazement, “Three heads, six arms, and as tall
as us…this alien is quite strong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, just
felt misery; the more divine abilities he used, the faster his divine
power would be used up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…while using
Heavenly Transformation, his speed and strength would both increase
tremendously!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Every single one of
these black-caped warriors are comparable to Celestial Immortal
Goldclock or Deadwood; if any more come, I’ll be forced to use the
[Starseizing Hand]. Once I use it…my end will come shortly
thereafter.” Ning was frantic now; every bit of divine power that
he used up was irreplaceable, at least in the short term. However…he
still had no idea as to how he was supposed to flee from this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could neither ascend
to Heaven nor descend to Hell; there was nowhere to flee!

Chapter 12 - No Way Out
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After using the
Heavenly Transformations technique and [Three Heads, Six Arms], Ji
Ning’s power had increased substantially. He was able to just
barely fend off those ten black-caped warriors, but maintaining this
state resulted in his divine power being continuously depleted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s actually
still able to hold on?” This caused the distant, violet-caped
warrior to frown. He immediately ordered, “The entire squad, go and
capture this alien!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Accompanied by a series
of roars, a total of ninety massive black-caped warriors flew towards
Ji Ning’s direction. This caused Ning’s face to instantly change.
“They really are giving me no chance at all. A hundred Celestial
Immortals…how am I supposed to withstand them?” Although all of
these foes focused on close combat, meaning that only a number of
them were able to engage with him at any given moment, they clearly
had some sort of mysterious combination formation technique; the more
warriors that joined, the more powerful each black-caped warrior
grew.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior bear, what
should I do?” Ning asked frantically, “Are there any options? If
I hide in the underwater estate, can I survive this tribulation?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s useless.”
The giant yellow bear was both frantic and helpless. “If you hide
inside the underwater estate, it will end up being exposed as
well…although Loose Immortals and Celestial Immortals are unable to
forcibly bind me, some truly powerful figures are still capable of
it. I’m only a Protocosmic spirit-treasure, after all; the master
of this so-called Snaphorn world has to be at least at the level of a
Pure Yang True Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt misery in his
heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given that they were
able to send out a squad of soldiers like this, as well as set up an
enormous space formation that spanned tens of millions of
kilometers…it would be bizarre if the Snaphorn world’s strongest
experts were not at the Pure Yang True Immortal level! Anyone who
reached that level could forcibly bind the Starseizing Manor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I hide, I die…but
if I don’t hide, I still die!” Ning had no idea as to what he
should do.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All you can do is
hope and pray that your master, Patriarch Subhuti, can find you,”
the giant yellow bear said. “Your master possesses the [Dream of
the Three Realms]…but this place is outside the Three Realms. In
fact, many of the Heavenly Daos don’t exist here; only the Heavenly
Dao of Primordial Chaos holds sway here. Your master might not be
able to sense things here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His only hope was his
master, Patriarch Subhuti! The Patriarch’s power was utterly
unearthly; at a time like this, only he might be capable of rescuing
Ning. But…the giant yellow bear was right. This was the Nihilum
Zone of the Primordial Ruinworld; even though Patriarch Subhuti was
extremely powerful, if he was unable to find Ning, what could he do?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that I, Ji
Ning, am going to die here?” Ning felt an unwillingness to accept
this within his heart. “Senior apprentice-sister took on Patriarch
Lu as her master…and we agreed that we would meet again! Father,
mother…I haven’t even had a chance to see if their reincarnations
are living happily or not. And Earth…I haven’t gone back to Earth
to take a look…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He didn’t want to
accept this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He truly didn’t!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I had known this
would happen, I would’ve left my Primaltwin at Swallow Mountain.”
Ning was filled with unbearable regret for having brought his
Primaltwin with him as he fought the Youngflame clan. He had felt
that as long as he had the underwater estate and Greater
Teleportation Dao-seals, he would be able to escape without issues.
Who would’ve imagined that the descent of karmic sinflames rendered
him incapable of escaping, resulting in him being sent into this
danger zone?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that my
life truly is going to end here?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ninety black-caped
warriors joined the ten earlier black-caped warriors into a
formation. Instantly, their auras grew even more powerful as they
continued to assault Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After just a few
exchanges, the previously indestructible Ning suddenly blew apart! In
fact, some of his flesh and blood transformed into dust from the
blows of the enemy swords and sabers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What just happened?”
The hundred attacking black-caped warriors were all amazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant commander
shouted, “The Queen Mother commands you! Even if the alien is
transformed into bits of mushmeat, you need to collect every single
piece of flesh and blood; you can’t spare even a single bit of
dust. He won’t die easily!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the group of
black-caped warriors became filled with eagerness. The Queen Mother
had personally given them an order! They felt incomparably honored.
They sent their minds sweeping forth through space. They wouldn’t
let even a hint of dust escape their senses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Far away, a human
rematerialized; it was Ning, his eyes bloodshot. His [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art] wasn’t something these Celestial Immortals could
breach; just now, he had voluntarily caused his divine body to
detonate while focusing all of his divine power within a single piece
of flesh. Through the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], he had then
transformed that piece of flesh into a speck of dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas…it seemed as
though the enemy knew what abilities he had available. They didn’t
want to give him any chance at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He really didn’t
die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was blown up into
tiny bits but didn’t die?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When our cores are
broken, we’ll die…but he was blown into tiny bits and remained
alive? This is too terrifying.” The black-caped warriors quietly
sent messages to each other; clearly, they were all quite stunned.
Whether it was Ning’s unbreakable body or the fact that he stayed
alive even after being blown apart…they were truly stunned and
uneasy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What a terrifying race
this was!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister, your junior apprentice-brother was unable to live
up to his promise!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, mother…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One image after another
flashed through Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That senior
apprentice-sister of his, who had kept everything hidden with her
heart for so long, but who had eventually become his Dao-companion
within the Conclave of Immortal Destiny, under the watchful gazes of
countless people.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That seemingly cold but
actually warm-hearted master of his, Immortal Diancai.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His teacher, Subhuti,
who gazed down upon the Three Realms from his lofty, exalted
position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And his ordinary
parents…they had done everything for him, and had chosen to forget
about revenge, so that their son might have a better chance of living
a good life…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His junior
apprentice-brother…his sister, Autumn Leaf…Uncle White…Little
Qing…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Farewell!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In dying here, not even
reincarnation would be possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Farewell, my loved
ones.” Ning stared at the hundred black-caped warriors charging
towards him, as well as the even more numerous foes in the distance.
His eyes actually turned calm, a calmness that transcended both
blazing rage and freezing coldness. It was a sort of absolute
calmness…a perfect mastery of the self.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this instant…Ning’s
heartforce was actually able to leap from the peak of the ‘iceheart’
level all the way to the third level, the ‘ruler’ level. Even
amongst the divine archers of the Three Realms, he would now be
considered an absolute top-tier expert.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But alas, heartforce
was invisible and formless; it wasn’t able to help out Ning at this
moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want me to die?”
Ning said softly, “Then I’ll make you all die!” These were
words from his homeland; the foes before him were completely unable
to understand it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six divine swords
suddenly vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His swords
vanished?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hundred black-caped
warriors charging towards Ning all halted. They could tell that Ning
was skilled in using the sword, but despite being such a powerful
swordsman, he had…actually put away his swords?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Was he giving himself
up for capture?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s fingers formed
sword-fingers. They suddenly expanded to be more than nine hundred
meters long as the full power of the Fourth Cycle of the [Starseizing
Hand] exploded forth. Ning’s power instantly rose to an utterly
terrifying level; he was actually able to knock an enemy shuttle
aside, then with a slashing sound, pierce straight into the chest of
a black-caped warrior. With a simple flick of his sword-fingers, the
warrior was cut in half.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” The distant
violet-caped warrior’s face completely changed. “How did his
power increase this much?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crunch!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning ignored all enemy
assaults; his body, protected by the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], was
completely capable of withstanding any assaults. The only attacks he
needed to defend against were the ones that were meant to bind him!
In the Three Realms, there were some powerful magic treasures that
had powerful binding forces that were hard to defend against, but
these warriors of the Snaphorn world were only skilled in close
combat; thus, the only tools they had for binding an opponent were
simple ones like chains or whips. Ning was less than two meters tall;
he was able to dodge with incomparable nimbleness through the many
massive black-caped warriors, making it hard for them capture him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-caped
warriors seemed strong, but their bodies were still unable to
withstand Ning’s sword! Thus, they were easily chopped apart in
close combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…He died?” Ning
was suddenly startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Through cutting,
chopping, decapitating, or other strikes, he was able to neutralize
twenty-five of the black-caped warriors within a short period of
time. However, they all healed quite quickly…but the twenty-sixth
actually lost its entire aura. It had completely, truly died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly thought
back to what had just happened. “Right. That green sphere.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the black-caped
warriors had a green sphere within their bodies. Ning had originally
thought that the green spheres were nothing more than organs. They
were very small; the warriors were three thousand meters tall, while
the green sphere was merely three meters long. He hadn’t damaged
the green sphere in killing the first twenty-five warriors, but he
had in the last one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-caped
warriors watched as the tiny little Ji Ning’s sword-fingers
suddenly expanded to become a thousand meters long. The sword-fingers
tore through their bodies, plunging through their chest to snatch at
and claw apart their cores. One black-caped warrior after another
began to fall, and a large amount of baleful auras began to flood
towards Ning, swirling into him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful, he’s
discovered our cores!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He knows about the
cores!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His fingers are
extremely terrifying, far more so than his swords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our weapons are
completely unable to block him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His body is
completely unbreakable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s too tiny;
there’s no way we can use our chains to capture him.” The
black-caped warriors were actually on the losing side now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Immortals
of the Three Realms could’ve joined forces and used various binding
techniques to capture Ning from far away…but these aliens were only
skilled in close combat! Although they had battle formations that
could be used to kill him, the Queen Mother had commanded that they
capture this person alive. Thus, they didn’t dare unleash their
most powerful killing techniques for fear of killing him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The distant
violet-caped warrior’s face sank when he saw this. He could tell
that there were only two methods for dealing with this tiny little
alien.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first method was to
use formation-based killing techniques, like the ones they used in
their planetary wars, to forcibly crush the foe. However, if they did
that, they might accidentally kill this alien, which would be a
violation of the Queen Mother’s command. The Queen Mother’s
decree was very important; in comparison, even the destruction of
their entire army meant nothing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second method was
to fight him personally, or perhaps with several supporters! To
overcome him with absolute strength, then capture him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Out of the way.”
The violet-caped warrior transformed into a violet streak of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s coming.”
This entire time, Ning had kept part of his attention on the
violet-caped warrior, who was the person who truly caused Ning to
feel threatened. Now that the violet-caped warrior was charging
forward at full speed, Ning’s heart instantly clenched. This speed
was even faster than the speed which he had displayed earlier; it was
absolutely superior to Ning when using the [Obscuring Wind of the
Nine Heavens].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is this my final
battle before I die?” Ning didn’t feel any fear; his gaze was
incomparably calm as he stared at the violet-caped warrior. “If I
die…I’ll drag you down into death with me!”

Chapter 13 - Our World
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the violet-caped
warrior attacked, the many black-caped warriors that had been
assaulting Ji Ning all retreated. They were all filled with utter
confidence in their commander.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A silvery-white whip
lashed out, more than thirty thousand meters long. It was like a
giant, silvery-white serpent that was coiling with elegance and poise
as it swept towards Ning. Ning’s sword-fingers struck out like
swords, blocking the whip head-on. WHAP! A clear ringing sound rang
out. Ning could sense a strange energy be transmitted into his body,
including into his organs. Fortunately, the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]
refined the entire body, resulting in no weaknesses at all. However,
Ning was still knocked flying backwards by several kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His speed vastly
outstrips mine, and the power of his whip is on a level higher than
even me using the [Starseizing Hand] at full power. His whip is used
in a way that gives me no way to dodge; it seems he is at an even
higher level with his whip than I am with sword-arts. His power,
without any question, is at the utmost peak of power possible for a
Celestial Immortal,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hard to deal with!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-caped
warriors were merely at the level of Celestial Immortals Deadwood or
Goldclock, but this violet-caped warrior was far more powerful than
even Celestial Immortal Infatuation! Even the [Starseizing Hand],
Ning’s proudest technique, was insufficient in the face of this
foe. As for speed and sword-arts, Ning was clearly inferior in these
regards as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, only close
combat was possible within the Nihilum Zone, which was why his
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art] was able to be used to maximum effect. Within
the Three Realms, Celestial Immortals on the level of this
violet-caped warrior would probably be very close to Pure Yang True
Immortals in power…their magic artifacts and formations alone would
be enough to make Ning feel hopeless. However, in this place, only
close combat was possible; thus, he still had a hint of a chance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang! Clang!
Ning used both the [Three Heads, Six Arms] and the [Starseizing Hand]
simultaneously. As for the violet-caped warrior, his four arms
clutched four silver whips which struck out long long serpents,
wildly assaulting Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s six arms
strove mightily to defend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, every so often
he would borrow the force of the collision to flee and dodge. Ning
had been continuously searching for a way out, for a chance to
counter-attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m being
completely suppressed by him. There’s no way for me to even go
close to him. What should I do?” Ning was frantically pondering
what to do. The foe’s long silver whip was rendering him incapable
of drawing within fifteen thousand meters of the man, much less wound
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He clearly is using
some sort of technique that allows him to increase his strength
dramatically.” The violet-caped warrior, by contrast, was much more
relaxed; he was in complete control of this fight. “Only his arms
are capable of releasing such power; his legs and kicks are far
weaker. I trust that there is a price to this ability; he shouldn’t
be able to maintain it for too long.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All things came at a
cost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a human that was
less than two meters tall to become the size of a three thousand
meter Fiendgod came at a cost, and so too did having three heads and
six arms. The cost of using the [Starseizing Hand] was even higher.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack! Crack! Crack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four long silver
whips danced out like dragons, wildly lashing out at Ning again and
again. Ning had to completely focus on defending them at all times.
If he failed a single time…the whips would probably entangle him
and completely bind him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the whips attacked
quickly, Ning had to block quickly as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His six arms strove to
defend as best they could. The more times they blocked, however, the
more times he had to use the [Starseizing Hand], which meant the more
divine power would be used up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His divine power was
frantically depleting. Even though he had reached the sixteenth stage
of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], the Fourth Cycle
of the [Starseizing Hand] used up so much divine power than in just a
short period of time, more than half of Ning’s divine power had
been used up. He hadn’t used up nearly as much in the earlier
fight, despite it lasting much longer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Less than a third.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Less than a sixth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was faced with the
whip-strikes which came from every direction. Ning seemed to have
become trapped within a net of whip-strikes; he was unable to dodge,
and his only option was to block, resulting in his divine power
depleting further and further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When his divine power
was completely used up…Ning would be completely subdued and
captured.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the underwater
estate. Within an undefined, void-like region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
was here. Next to him were seven figures, including a child with a
necklace, a bald elder, a beautiful woman…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven figures all
emanated incomparably powerful auras, and amongst them was the
red-haired Fiendgod which Ning had previously battled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big bear, the young
master is in a crisis in the outside world. Are we supposed to just
wait here and watch?” The beautiful woman, dressed in black leather
armor, spoke out with a frown. Her eyebrows were snow-white, while
her eyes looked just like a viper’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I watched as this
little kid, Ji Ning, grew up step by step. Do you think I care about
him less than you lot do?” The giant yellow bear said angrily, “I’m
under instructions from Master to find a successor for him. Ji Ning
is the best successor yet; I wouldn’t dare be careless!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But you are letting
him remain trapped in a dire situation!” The black-armored,
beautiful woman said angrily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you seven think
that you can protect him?” The giant yellow bear asked angrily. “Do
you know who he has run afoul of this time? Foes from the Snaphorn
world of the Primordial Ruinworld. The Primordial Ruinworld! They are
one of remnant forces left behind from that ancient war! Anyone
capable of controlling an entire world has most likely survived from
that war, and anyone capable of surviving that war…even if they are
weak, they can’t be too weak. They might be at the level of a
Daofather or a True God! Even if you all go out to rescue him, do you
really think you can block a Daofather or a True God?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-armored woman
turned silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snow Scorpion.”
The red-haired Fiendgod spoke out, “The big bear is right. Even if
we intervene, we might not be able to overcome this Snaphorn world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big bear, you
idiot…why didn’t you notify us when Ji Ning was faced with the
descent of karmic sinflames?” The black-armored woman couldn’t
help but berate him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Am I supposed to
have you intervene whenever he encounters danger?” The giant yellow
bear said angrily, “Per Master’s orders, until he becomes an
Empyrean God, he can’t be truly considered Master’s disciple. No
matter what sort of trials he has to endure, they can only be
considered tests for him…and if he fails and dies, he has no one to
blame but his lack of skills or his bad luck. Although we all like
him and view him as having tremendous potential and a very good
chance of becoming an Empyrean God…how was I supposed to know that
the Youngflame clan had an ability like this, to teleport him
straight into the Nihilum Zone of the Primordial Ruinworld? I thought
that even if things did turn dangerous, we’d still be able to
rescue him, which is why I let him face dangers as needed to temper
him…but how can everything in life go as expected?! Ugh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s take Ji Ning
into the underwater estate and hide him within our world. Even if the
enemy binds the underwater estate, it’ll only be an elementary
binding; they probably won’t be able to find our world,” the
beautiful woman, Snow Scorpion, said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They might not find
it…but it’s also possible that they might find it.” The bald
elder suddenly spoke out in a hoarse voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The underwater estate
did indeed have many secrets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Juhua had
always felt that there were secrets present within it. Ning had also
felt that there were parts of the underwater estate that were not
under his control…but he wasn’t able to find those parts!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But just because Ning
wasn’t able to find them…didn’t mean that the master of the
Snaphorn world wouldn’t be able to find out!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-haired man said
in a gravelly voice, “No matter what…if Ji Ning dies, the
Starseizing Manor will fall into the hands of the master of the
Snaphorn world. If the master of the Snaphorn world is at the level
of a True God or Daofather, he will definitely be able to find our
world through the Starseizing Manor…at which point, our only option
will be to fight with him. If the Snaphorn world’s master is not
yet at the True God or Daofather level, then he won’t be able to
defeat the formation which protects our world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since, no matter
what, we will still have to end up fighting with the master of the
Snaphorn world…we might as well rescue Ji Ning and bring him into
our world. Although the Godking did indeed say that his disciple
could only enter our world after becoming an Empyrean God, we are
left with no other options.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The giant
yellow bear nodded. “Since we can’t escape…we are indeed left
with no other options. Make your preparations. Once we bring Ji Ning
into our world, we’ll need to be ready for the Snaphorn world’s
attack. I hope their master is weak; ideally, he won’t even be able
to find our world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s prepare.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven figures all
had solemn looks on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The child, who had
remained silent this entire time, suddenly spoke out: “Long ago,
Father instructed us to leave him and stay out of that war. We’ve
been waiting long enough…and so let’s have a good fight with the
Snaphorn world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s have a good
fight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s fight!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone present had
flames of war within their eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the emptiness of
the Nihilum Zone. Enormous ships that were ten thousand kilometers
long moved like streaks of light, advancing at high speed. The giant
spaceships were tightly clustered together…and there seemed to be
no end of them. Within the center of those giant ships, there was a
golden warship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the golden
warship.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone present was
standing at solemn attention. Leading them was a horned warrior with
a golden cape with black trimmings, and behind him were eight hundred
violet-caped warriors. These were the most valiant, most capable
commanders of the First Army who often engaged in wars against other
worlds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In front of them
hovered an utterly enormous mirror. The images within the mirror were
images of the commando squad of the Third Void Sector doing battle
against Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Benair is actually
joining the fight in person.” The golden-caped warrior snorted
angrily, “How despicable. Since he’s joining the fight in
person…doesn’t that mean our First Army has made this trip for
nothing?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This alien is quite
tenacious and strong; he might be able to stay alive until we get
there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is on the
orders of the Queen Mother. It should be us, the First Army, who
captures this alien.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The almighty First
Army…how could it possibly hold a small squad of the Third Void
Sector in any regard?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, quick,
quick!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The general couldn’t
help but urge them to move faster. “It has to be us that captures
this alien!” It was rare for the Queen Mother to give an order;
they naturally had to work hard to show their talents.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the void of the
underwater estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning’s divine
power has almost been completely used up. Once it is used up, he’ll
fall into enemy hands. Red-hair, you personally intervene and wipe
them all out, then return to our world and prepare to deal with the
master of the Snaphorn world,” the giant yellow bear said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all nodded in
concurrence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all knew very well
that falling into dire straits would truly temper one’s Dao-heart.
However…they had no idea that Ning’s heartforce had already
advanced from the second level, ‘iceheart’, into the third level,
‘ruler’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the empty space
of the Nihilum Zone. A tight cluster of black-caped warriors watched
from not too far away as their commander, the violet-caped warrior,
was completely dominating this alien.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m almost done. I
have less than a tenth of my divine power now.” Ning didn’t want
to accept this. He truly didn’t. But…the serpentine whips were
striking out against him from every direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Was he truly out of
options?

Chapter 14 - Heartforce Manifests
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
violet-caped commander could sense the alien growing frantic; he
could sense that this was, perhaps, the last throes of his enemy’s
resistance. “It seems…he can no longer hold on.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly let out
an enraged roar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He no longer held back
at all on his divine power. Instead, he wildly poured it all into his
arms at full force! The Void-level elemental ki in his body, through
a secret art, was also immediately pushed into his arms. In this
moment, Ning had only a single thought in his mind…no matter the
cost, he was going to unleash his power to the maximum possible
level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually…even going
all-out like this only resulted in a 30% increase in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“BREAK!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s six arms
struck out as six streaks of sword-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s calm eyes
glowed with light, the light that came in the final instants of one’s
life as it all blazed away. Ning’s heart and soul was completely
poured into his swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Simultaneous explosions
rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s six
sword-fingers stabbed out, four of them striking against the four
silver whips. With explosive sounds, the silver whips…were actually
knocked flying backwards. Ning’s fingers, however, continued to
stab forward!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” The
violet-caped commander’s eyes turned completely round. “How can
this be?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many black-caped
warriors watching from far away were amazed at this sight. They could
all sense that Ning was inches away from death. Previously, he had
been completely suppressed…so how was it that right now, at the
very end, he was actually able to unleash power that surpassed the
power of their commander, knocking his weapon away?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What…how can this
be?” Within the void-like region within the underwater estate, the
giant yellow bear, who had been watching the battle outside this
entire time, was completely surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
was most likely the person with the deepest understanding of Ning’s
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew exactly what
Ning was capable of. What Ning had displayed earlier represented his
utmost limit of power; even if Ning went all out, he would at most be
able to increase his power by 20% or 30%; he would still be
considerably weaker than that violet-caped commander. How was it,
then, that he had suddenly knocked the silver whip away?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It doesn’t make
sense.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It…shouldn’t
have happened.” The giant yellow bear couldn’t understand it.
“This isn’t the Three Realms. There’s no way to sense the Dao
here, so even if he suddenly gained a new insight into the Dao, it
wouldn’t help him increase his power in any way. In addition, he is
currently in a battle, and he’s used up an enormous amount of
divine power. There’s no way he could’ve broken into the
seventeenth level of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]
so soon…he just made it to the sixteenth level a short while ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A breakthrough in his
divine body? Impossible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A breakthrough in the
Dao? It wouldn’t make any difference.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Starseizing Hand]
was already at the Fourth Cycle!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?”
The giant yellow bear didn’t understand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not too far away,
inside the golden warship of the First Army which was ensconced
within those countless warships. The commanders of the First Army
were staring at the images within the levitating mirror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Odd.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What just happened?
What ability did this alien just use?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of them understood
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-caped
general, however, just laughed loudly. “Wonderful. The longer he
can delay, the better; we’re almost there! Haha…it seems that in
the end, it will still be us who captures this alien.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The experts of the
Snaphorn world couldn’t understand it. Not even the giant yellow
bear understood it. Nobody could think of a reason why this had just
happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But within the deep,
dark reaches of the Void…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three minds were
communicating with each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second sister…what
just happened?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder sister, what
happened?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Queen Mothers
had given birth to many children; their children were the Firstborn!
More than half of the commanders of the First Army were Firstborn;
the three Queen Mothers could see and sense everything the Firstborn
could see and sense! Thus, they too saw everything which had just
happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The commander of the
commando squad from the Third Void Sector, Benair, was the child of
the second Queen Mother of the three Queen Mothers. When Benair
fought with Ning, it was as though the second Queen Mother had
personally fought against Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That was…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heartforce?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, heartforce! It
was heartforce!” The second Queen Mother’s powerful mind suddenly
began to tremble with excitement. “This human’s attack just now
was actually filled with heartforce!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? Heartforce?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heartforce?! He’s
actually in control of heartforce?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first and third
Queen Mothers were both excited as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. There’s no
mistaking it; in fact, just now I completely focused a strand of my
mind upon my child Benair.” The second Queen Mother said excitedly,
“They just clashed again. There’s no mistaking it; this human’s
attacks contain heartforce within them. His control over his
heartforce isn’t perfect; it’s clearly quite rough. However, I
can still sense the powerful, mysterious, profound heartforce at
work.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is our chance!”
The second Queen Mother was incomparably excited. “This human is
able to focus his heartforce and knows how to apply it! That means he
understands a heartforce technique! This is a truly supreme form of
power; we can discover and distill the method for producing and
applying heartforce from this human!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Now we can
gain a heartforce technique!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, this is our
chance!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other two Queen
Mothers were incomparably excited as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had experienced
and survived that calamitous war; as survivors, they knew quite well
that ‘heartforce’ was one of the truly supreme forms of power.
Upon mastering heartforce, one could truly embark upon a path that
would lead to them becoming the most supreme of existences within the
primordial chaos! A path that led to surpassing even True Gods and
Daofathers!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is our chance,
but we cannot be rash.” The first Queen Mother’s mind warned the
other two minds, “Heartforce techniques are supreme techniques that
are absolutely not taught to outsiders, even within the Three Realms.
This human youth must have an extraordinary background, which is why
he was able to learn a technique like this. Perhaps there is a
self-destruction mechanism hidden within his soul.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Actually…the
simplest method is to hypnotize him, but he is one of those ‘Fiendgod
Body Refiner’ humans; his soul and his body are completely merged
together and extremely stable. In addition, he’s also a
practitioner of heartforce; his mind must be very powerful. To
hypnotize him…I imagine it will be quite difficult.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have to try.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartforce was far too
alluring to them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartforce…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was an invisible,
formless sort of power. It wasn’t like divine power, elemental ki,
or natural energy; those could be seen with the naked eye.
Heartforce, however, was incredibly powerful, and it was extremely
hard to reach a basic level of skill in it. Back on Mount Innerheart,
Ning had already been at a very high level of insight into the Dao,
but he still had to train archery painstakingly for three years
before finally reaching a basic level of skill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, heartforce
truly was formidable. That mighty divinity of the Primordial Era,
Houyi, had relied the power of his heartforce to become the number
one divine archer of the Three Realms, and even Daofathers and True
Gods had fallen to his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even Ning himself was
surprised; his sword-finger had actually become so powerful as to
suppress the whip of this violet-caped commander?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is this…heartforce?”
Others might have to guess at it, but Ning himself knew very well
that his incredibly berserk attack just now had been launched without
any extraneous thoughts. All of his power had been fully merged into
that blow…and his heartforce had unconsciously leaked into it as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How should heartforce
be applied? This was a mystery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms had a
set of extremely detailed instructions for applying heartforce
through archery; this was the creation of the mighty divinity Houyi!
It was precisely because mighty Houyi had systemized the method of
using heartforce in archery that the Three Realms had so quickly
developed a crop of terrifyingly powerful divine archers…but there
were no systemized tools for teaching one how to apply heartforce
into other weapons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How to apply heartforce
to the sword?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To the saber?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To the spear?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To the staff?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If heartforce was
applied to these weapons, would they increase in power dramatically?
Since it worked for archery, it logically should work for these
weapons…but mighty Houyi was the foremost expert of heartforce
within the Three Realms, and his greatest talent was archery. He had
thus created a systemized method for applying it to archery…but as
for other weapons? Perhaps some other major powers had discovered
ways of applying heartforce to those weapons, but those ways were
crude ways, not systemized ways which others could use.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I actually managed
to apply heartforce through my fingers when I used sword-arts?”
Ning was completely amazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of an
ordinary arrow was quite ordinary…but when heartforce was applied
to it, it would instantly turn into a nightmare for foes! The power
of the arrow would instantly rise to a terrifying level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…just now,
I was only able to truly apply a very tiny amount of heartforce.”
Ning knew this for certain because he had used up only a very small
amount of his heartforce; the rest of his heartforce remained
untouched! As someone who had reached the third level of heartforce,
‘ruler’, Ning’s heartforce was tremendously powerful. Even just
a tiny amount of it was enough to cause the power of his sword-arts
to rise to a level where he could actually now suppress this foe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alien, you actually
still have more tricks up your sleeve? I want to see how powerful you
actually are!” The violet-caped commander let out a loud shout,
then lashed out with a whip once more. As for the mind of the second
Queen Mother, it had completely descended onto the commander by now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Ning
stretched out a single hand as well. His fingers flicked out!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His heartforce once
more rode with his fingers, just as it had last time. Ning could
sense that a small part of his heartforce had indeed become one with
his fingers!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Ning’s fingers,
now many hundreds of meters long, collided with that whip!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The whip was once more
knocked flying back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. That’s the
feeling.” Ning was beginning to vaguely make out the basics to it.
However, he was still far, far away from being able to apply it as
intricately as when he applied it to archery. All Ning could do was
ponder the method of applying heartforce to archery, then try and
come up with a similar way to strengthen his sword-fingers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning suddenly
realized that the distant, violet-caped commander had actually come
to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A powerful ripple
spread out. Ning took a look…and saw, far away in the void, one
enormous spaceship after another coming flying towards him. There
seemed to be no end to the densely clustered spaceships.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…How many ships
just arrived?” Ning was completely shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entrances to the
ships all opened, and countless horned warriors came flooding out
from them. Amongst these countless warriors were many black-caped
warriors as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning swept them with
his gaze. The number of ordinary horned warriors…they had to at
least number in the millions. In addition, at the front of the many
ships was a golden warship, from which one violet-caped warrior after
another came flying out. At the very end, a gold-caped person came
walking out, his aura so powerful and terrifying as to cause Ning to
feel despair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang! Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a series of
thoughts descended upon the region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Queen Mothers
had sent out hundreds of thought-rays to the many violet-caped
warriors, as well as the general.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be in a
hurry to attack.” The Queen Mother’s voice echoed within the
general’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Queen Mother,”
the general replied mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big bear, what’s
going on outside? Can it be that the young master’s divine power
hasn’t been used up yet? I think we should make our move now. Let’s
not waste any time.” Within the underwater estate, the black-haired
beauty, ‘Snow Scorpion’, spoke out.

Chapter 15 - Yu Wei’s Tribulation
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Red-hair, Snow
Scorpion, and the others all looked towards the giant yellow bear.
Only the big bear was able to clearly sense the outside world and
what was going happening there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be
impatient.” The big bear shook his head. “A powerful army has
been dispatched from the Snaphorn world, but the strange thing
is…this powerful army hasn’t acted against Ji Ning yet. In
fact…even the violet-caped warrior that had been previously
fighting against Ning has stopped fighting as fiercely as he had
before. Ji Ning definitely doesn’t have much divine power left; if
they fight for just a bit longer, his divine power will have been
completely used up, but they actually halted. How odd.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Halted?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven mighty
warriors left behind by Daoist Threelives were all puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition…there’s
something else odd. Ji Ning’s power had clearly reached a limit…but
just now, when he used the [Starseizing Hand], his power actually
increased yet again. He was able to knock aside the foe’s
weapon…and I don’t understand why, no matter how hard I try,”
the giant yellow bear said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can one’s
power increase in the Nihilum Zone?” The seven began to ponder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were different
from the giant yellow bear; the bear was, after all, just the spirit
of a magic treasure. Only after the destruction of Pangu’s
Primordial World had the giant yellow bear slowly trained to the
level of becoming a true living creature. By comparison, he wasn’t
that experienced…but the other seven had been quite famous long ago
in Pangu’s World. This fame came through their performances in many
battles; they had much greater experience and knew far more things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be…” The
seven suddenly all thought of the same possibility.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
distant, awe-inspiring army of millions of horned warriors. He had a
feeling…that even the most ordinary of warriors in that army was
far more powerful than the red-eyed warriors he had previously
battled. Most likely, all of them were comparable to Loose Immortals
who had lived for a million years. They could be compared to the
weakest of Celestial Immortals; Ning would be able to kill each of
them with ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But no matter how
ordinary they were in terms of strength…a million of them was an
utterly terrifying prospect!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many warriors…if
they have some sort of combination-formation technique, even Empyrean
Gods or True Immortals would probably feel despair and choose to
flee,” Ning mused to himself. “And this is just part of the total
strength of the Snaphorn world of the Primordial Ruinworld. The
Primordial Ruinworld…it truly is the most terrifying place of all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was actually quite
calm now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enemy held all the
cards in their hands. They were simply too powerful…and more than
eight hundred violet-caped warriors had suddenly appeared just now!
If they were all comparable in strength to the first violet-caped
warrior, that meant they were equivalent to a force of eight hundred
supreme Celestial Immortals. And there was that gold-caped bastard…a
person which caused Ning to feel completely powerless and unable to
fight back when he looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…although I
have no way of fighting back, I can still kill myself,” Ning mused
to himself. “I definitely won’t let them do anything to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alien.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The general smiled as
he moved forward, but even when his black, scale-covered face was
smiling, it still looked absolutely savage. “This space belongs to
our Snaphorn world. Why have you come to our place?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was wandering
through the infinite Void and entered this place by accident,” Ning
said. At the same time, he seized this chance to absorb more power
from the Solar Star and the Lunar Star, converting it into divine
power. He had used up far too much divine power earlier. “I truly
do not wish to be enemies with you. I would like to ask you to please
let me leave; I will be endlessly grateful if you do.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let you leave?
That’s not impossible,” the general suddenly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning looked
at his foes. He knew, however, that the cost of activating such an
enormous space formation that was tens of millions of kilometers in
size was definitely an enormous one. And now, they had sent over so
many Snaphorn warriors as well? There was no way they’d let him
leave so easily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have a request. If
you accept, then I promise to let you leave,” the general said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Might I ask what
this request is?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As long as you allow
us to inspect your soul,” the general said, “And let us know your
true intentions…if you are not a foe to our Snaphorn world, we
shall immediately let you leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Inspect my soul?
Soulscouring?” Ning’s face changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He immediately
understood what they were plotting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was a Fiendgod Body
Refiner; his divine soul and his divine body were completely merged
together, making his soul extremely stable, far more stable than the
souls of many Celestial Immortals! In addition, his heartforce had
reached the ‘ruler’ level…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that it was difficult for Pure Yang True Immortals to forcibly
soulscour even an ordinary Celestial Immortal. Someone like Ning, who
had such powerful heartforce, was rare even amongst True Immortals
and Empyrean Gods. To forcibly soulscour him was incredibly
difficult. Even if a Daofather was to attempt it, Ning would still
probably be able to instantly react and commit suicide by shattering
his own soul!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So they wanted him to
allow them to soulscour him without resisting?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not a chance.”
Ning shook his head in refusal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be in such a
hurry to refuse.” The golden-caped general continued to smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, knew the
truth. Given that his foes had sent out so many warriors and
activated such an enormous space formation, they definitely were
looking for something important. If he didn’t fight back, they
could use some sort of technique to dominate and control his soul,
resulting in him becoming a slave. That would truly be a life worse
than death. After all, the promises these people were making…weren’t
worth a single copper. This place was outside the Three Realms; there
were no such things as oaths to the Dao of the Heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to say
anything further.” Ning laughed coldly. “If push comes to shove,
I’ll die. Soulscour me? In your dreams!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas.” The
gold-caped general let out a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Silently and soundless,
hundreds of mind-strands simultaneously flew out from the gold-caped
general and the hundreds of violet-caped warriors, all assaulting
Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a sensation
of utter exhaustion began to overwhelm Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tired.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So tired.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He felt like he was a
mortal on Earth again, sick and tired and exhausted. He felt a desire
to immediately shut his eyes…a sensation that he had never felt in
this life after he had embarked onto the path of Immortal
cultivation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I…am the only
ruler of myself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of heartforce
filled his entire body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Under the command of
his heartforce, his soul began to resist fiercely; although he felt
extremely tired, he still maintained his clarity of mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We failed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This human’s
heartforce is quite strong. Although the mind-strands we attached to
the Firstborn represent just part of our full power…even when we
joined forces, were were still unable to hypnotize him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is simply too
hard to hypnotize someone with such powerful heartforce.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Queen Mothers
were mentally conferring with each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They didn’t care
about whether Ji Ning died or not; what they cared the most about was
his heartforce technique. Even the set of archery-based heartforce
taught by [Houyi’s Archery] was of use to them; although they
didn’t use bows, this would at least still let them touch upon the
nature of heartforce and let them more thoroughly understand it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ji Ning? If they
could soulscour him, they could just kill him afterwards! There was
no way they would let Ji Ning go back; if he did manage to return to
the Three Realms and informed the most supreme figures of the Three
Realms learn that the Snaphorn world had acquired a heartforce
technique, those figures would probably personally come pay a visit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had been lucky
enough to survive that ancient, calamitous war; they knew exactly how
powerful the Three Realms were. It must be understood that the entire
Primordial Ruinworld had been defeated! A single Snaphorn world would
probably be effortlessly annihilated by the supreme powers of the
Three Realms. Thus, if they could obtain the heartforce, there was no
way they would let Ji Ning live and return to the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No other options.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All we can do is
have our Firstborn fight with this human. When they fight, we’ll
use our mind-strands to watch closely. His current control over his
heartforce is quite weak; we can fully and clearly sense his
heartforce ripples. When we personally fight with him time and time
again, watching his heartforce be applied hundreds or thousands of
times over…I trust that eventually, we’ll discover some of the
secrets of heartforce and be able to develop a heartforce technique
of our own.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This clumsy method
is the only one left to us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Queen Mothers
made their decision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Truly powerful experts
generally always had this sort of clumsy method available to them; to
first watch, then to hypothesize and draw insights from what they
saw. For example, after other major powers personally saw the mighty
divine ability [Wings of the Garuda] many times, they were able to
develop a similar flying divine ability. Perhaps it was a bit weaker
than the [Wings of the Garuda], but it was still able to emulate part
of its power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was what the three
Queen Mothers had settled upon!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to capture
the alien. Let him feel that there is a chance of surviving. The
Firstborn among you…you can go and fight against him one-on-one.
When his energy is almost depleted, let him rest. After he finishes
resting, continue the attacks. Maintain this battle for as long as
possible; if it takes many years, all the better.” The Queen
Mother’s order came to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This caused the general
and the many violet-caped Firstborn to feel puzzled and confused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were clearly
capable of capturing him. Why didn’t they?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And they were supposed
to fight him one-on-one?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, they didn’t
dare violate the orders of the Queen Mother. In fact, there was no
way they could; their loyalty to the Queen Mothers sprang from their
very blood. If the Queen Mother ordered it, they wouldn’t even
hesitate to commit suicide.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tonto, you go,”
the general instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
Instantly, a violet-caped warrior flew out to attack Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s divine power
had only recovered to 10% of maximum. He had been maintaining a
careful watch this entire time on that distant, awe-inspiring army.
Upon seeing a violet-caped warrior charge towards him, he naturally
went forth to fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was being trapped
and assaulted by the Snaphorn world’s army in the Nihilum Zone. As
their commanders went forth to fight him one-on-one, beginning a
long, drawn-out battle within the infinite void of space…in the
distant Three Realms, his Dao-companion, Yu Wei, had reached the most
dangerous moment of her cultivation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a beautiful
world of flowers, but the skies above it had become filled with a
vortex of lightning and clouds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Screeeech!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei stood there,
head raised, staring towards the skies. Around her swirled a series
of white phoenixes and fiery red phoenixes. A total of ninety-nine
phoenixes were surrounding her, wildly resisting the crashing bolts
of thunder coming from up above. With this collision, almost all of
the phoenixes were blasted apart, leaving behind a single white
phoenix by her side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thunder in the
skies finally came to a complete halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The supreme Sword
Immortal, Patriarch Lu, nodded as he watched from his position atop
the nearby mountain peak. “Seven nine-sets of thunder tribulation;
essentially what I thought it would be. My disciple is a Ki
Refiner…even for a reincarnated Immortal, to encounter seven
nine-sets of thunder tribulation is a bit much. It seems my disciple
has indeed been hiding a few things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The demonheart
tribulation is beginning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m afraid that
for my disciple, the most dangerous tribulation is this demonheart
tribulation,” Patriarch Lu mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei, in her past
life, had been a true asura demon; she had been extremely powerful,
and in her past life she had been comparable to Immortal Northwalker.
In this life, under the guidance of Patriarch Lu, she had reached an
even higher level of insight into the Dao; after executing a
forbidden technique, she had been able to overcome the seven
nine-sets of thunder tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the demonheart
tribulation was strange and unfathomable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In her past life,
due to her tragedies, she transformed into an asura demon,”
Patriarch Lu mused to himself. “And in her heart, she is hiding a
major secret that she won’t tell anyone, not even me. The deeper
one hides secrets within the heart…the more terrifying the
demonheart tribulation shall be. In her past life, she failed her
Celestial Tribulation; I wonder how she will do in this one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed, one day
after the other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six days. Seven days.
Eight days…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fifteen days. Sixteen
days…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei still just sat
there. Her demonheart tribulation persisted for an extraordinarily
long period of time…
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 16 - Returning To The Grand Xia
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei’s demonheart
tribulation persisted for an extremely long period of time. Patriarch
Lu, however, just stood there quietly atop the nearby mountain peak,
watching in complete calmness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sound rang out in the
world, a sound which symbolized Heaven and Earth. It was incomparably
profound, majestic, and intoxicating. As this Immortal melody rang
out, rainbow-colored clouds began to appear in the sky, and the
ground became filled with golden lotus flowers. It seemed as though
the very center of the world was this black-robed maiden that sat in
the lotus position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei’s eyes were
already open. A deep, longing love was in her eyes, but a hint of a
smile was on her lips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A flood of natural
energy was gathering around her, and her body was beginning to
emanate with an Immortal, spiritual aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heaven has bestowed
propitious clouds, and Earth has given birth to golden lotuses.”
The distant Patriarch Lu smiled, then clapped his hands lightly.
“From now on, you shall no longer be subject to the Three
Calamities or Nine Tribulations. A fine Celestial Immortal…a fine
Celestial Immortal!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Yu Wei, she flew
towards the distant Patriarch Lu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well done.”
Patriarch Lu was very satisfied. “This tribulation is the greatest
tribulation an Immortal cultivator shall ever face. After having
overcome it…you have now ascended to the skies in a single step.
Your life shall now last as long as the heavens themselves.” Of
course, although one would no longer be bothered by heavenly
tribulations and one had a truly unlimited lifespan, if other, more
powerful Immortals or Fiendgods killed you, there was nothing for it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even True Gods and
Daofathers…even Pangu…would perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If not for your
tutelage, Master, your disciple definitely wouldn’t have overcome
this Celestial Tribulation.” Yu Wei fell to her knees, respectfully
pressing her head downwards and kowtowing in thanks. She had been
very strong in her past life, but she hadn’t even been able to
withstand six nine-sets of thunder tribulation, much less seven
nine-sets. She had advanced at an astonishingly rapid pace while
accompanying Patriarch Lu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Lu nodded
lightly. After Yu Wei rose to her feet, he finally said, “Yu Wei…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei was startled.
Patriarch Lu very rarely referred to her by her name.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There is something
which I have been hiding for you, so as to prevent it from impacting
your Celestial Tribulation. And now…it is time to tell you,”
Patriarch Lu said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, what is it?”
Yu Wei hurriedly asked. In her heart, however, she had a bad feeling.
So as to prevent it from impacting her Celestial Tribulation? Her
Dao-heart was incredibly strong; what sort of matter could possibly
make Patriarch Lu worry about her Celestial Tribulation being
affected? A major matter, for sure…and one which involved something
she truly cared about.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is it…my junior
apprentice-brother, Ji Ning?” Yu Wei looked at Patriarch Lu. Her
parents had died long ago; the only person she truly cared about in
this world was her Dao-companion, Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. It is Ji
Ning.” Patriarch Lu nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei’s face changed
slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Lu continued,
“Just as you were preparing for your tribulation, the Xia Emperor
of your Grand Xia world informed me of something. He said that Ji
Ning fought a battle against nine Celestial Immortals of his hated
foes, the Youngflame clan, in their Oldjade mountain range. That
battle had severe repercussions; in fact, a number of Fiendgods that
had been imprisoned there for countless years were released as well.
However…the main event was still the battle between Ji Ning and the
Celestial Immortals of the Youngflame clan. Two of the Celestial
Immortals of the Youngflame clan perished; Celestial Immortal
Goldclock and Celestial Immortal Flamefish. Ji Ning had the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art] protecting him, and so the Youngflame clan
was completely unable to do anything to him. Thus…they played a
trick. They caused Ji Ning to accidentally kill ten billion mortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei’s face
instantly turned ashen!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She didn’t have any
time to feel astonished by the Youngflame clan having nine Celestial
Immortals, or to feel stunned by the fact that Ning had killed two of
them. She didn’t have any time to feel amazed by the fact that he
possessed the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] either. In her mind, a single
phrase echoed repeatedly: ‘Accidentally kill ten billion mortals’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He accidentally
killed ten billion mortals?” Yu Wei mumbled to herself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao of the Heavens
were without compassion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It judged karmic virtue
and karmic sin according to its own rules. Even if one killed by
accident, one still had to shoulder an appropriate amount of the
karmic blame…and the amount of sin generated by killing that many
mortals was utterly terrifying to even think about.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His sin towered to
the skies, causing karmic sinflames to descend,” Patriarch Lu
continued. “The Ancestor of the Youngflame clan, Immortal
Venomfreak, used the Protocosmic spirit-treasure, ‘Worldhold
Pagoda’, to teleport the still-burning Ji Ning outside of the world
of the Grand Xia, to an undoubtedly dangerous location. The seven
days have long since passed; Ji Ning was able to successfully endure
the karmic sinflames, but he still hasn’t returned to the world of
the Grand Xia. This means he should be trapped in some extremely
dangerous place which he cannot return from.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei’s heart shook,
falling and rising and falling again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing that Ning
had survived the karmic sinflames, she had let out a sigh of
relief…but upon hearing that he had yet to return, she grew nervous
again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master…is there
anything you can do?” Yu Wei immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing.”
Patriarch Lu shook his head. “The Worldhold Pagoda is a Protocosmic
spirit-treasure with unfathomable power; it is even capable of
sending someone to the infinite Void outside of the Three Realms. The
Void outside the Three Realms contains many danger zones, and Greater
Teleportation is useless within many of those danger zones. In
fact…there are some places where even I would die if I were trapped
there. Since Ji Ning has not yet returned, he definitely must be
trapped there. The longer he stays there, the more dangerous it will
be…and perhaps one day, he shall die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei’s body shook.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s nothing I
can do. There’s nothing you can do either.” Patriarch Lu shook
his head. “The danger zones of the infinite Void…most likely,
only True Gods or Daofathers would dare to enter those places.
However…those danger zones are far too vast! Even if a Daofather
was to personally go out and investigate them, some danger zones
would take tens of thousands of years, or even millions of years, to
search through.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nihilum Zone of the
Primordial Ruinworld, for example, surrounded and covered the entire
Primordial Ruinworld. If a Daofather wanted to search it…he would
have to spend an extremely long period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then…then…” Yu
Wei found it hard to accept this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can only wait.”
Patriarch Lu continued, “Ji Ning has trained in the [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art]; his master is definitely a Daofather. Only a Daofather
has even a hint of a chance of finding him within the infinite Void.
However…it’s hard to say how long that would take. I hope that
his master will find him while he is still alive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei bit her lips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What are your plans
now?” Patriarch Lu looked at Yu Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wish to return to
the Grand Xia,” Yu Wei said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Patriarch Lu
nodded slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world of the Grand
Xia. Black clouds filled the skies above Stillwater City. Thunder and
lightning were flashing within the dark clouds, occasionally striking
downwards. Thunderclaps rang out incessantly, and an enormous amount
of rain was falling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the lightning
and the rain, a black-robed woman exited from a spatial tear that she
had created above Stillwater city.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, I’ve returned…so why aren’t you here?”
The black-robed woman looked downwards at Stillwater City, but only
felt pulses of sadness and worry. In her past life, her heart had
been encased in ice; after her parents died in this life, her heart
had only grown even colder. The only person she truly cared about in
her heart was Ji Ning; for Ning’s sake, she would even be willing
to annihilate the heavens themselves without any hesitation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact…when she had
faced the demonheart tribulation of the Celestial Tribulation, she
had relied on the love and affection she felt for Ning to help her
endure that extremely long tribulation. This had caused the love she
bore for Ning to grow even deeper. Within the illusions of the
demonheart tribulation, she and Ning had experienced three thousand
years of life together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei flew downwards
into Stillwater City, into the Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She scanned the
Black-White College with her coresense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another strand of
coresense touched hers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai
instantly appeared in the air above his residence. Raising his head,
he saw the distant black-robed maiden who was flying in his
direction. He couldn’t help but call out with surprise and delight,
“Yu Wei, you overcame the Celestial Tribulation?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai could
hardly believe it; he wouldn’t have been surprised by Ning overcome
the Celestial Tribulation, but Yu Wei?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei had failed at
the Conclave of Immortal Destiny, during the trials within the
Brightmoon Diagram of the Mountains and Rivers. There was no way her
talent compared in any way to Ning’s. It had only been a few short
decades; Ning hadn’t undergone his tribulation yet, so how was it
that she had overcome hers? Could it be that Yu Wei’s Celestial
Tribulation had been extremely weak? Or perhaps that Patriarch Lu was
so formidable at teaching disciples that Yu Wei had been successful
in overcoming her tribulation?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Yu Wei
nodded gently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai nodded
repeatedly in excitement. “Good. This is a chaotic era; for our
Black-White College to now give birth to another Celestial Immortal
is wonderful. Wonderful!” But suddenly, Immortal Diancai thought of
Ji Ning, and the fact that he had become Dao-companions with Yu Wei.
His smile instantly vanished; in fact, a hesitant look appeared on
his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Should he tell her?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle-master
Diancai…” Yu Wei said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to call me
‘uncle-master’,” Immortal Diancai immediately said. Given Yu
Wei’s current level of power, the two could converse as equals;
after all, for Immortal cultivators, age didn’t really matter. For
example, Yu Wei had reawakened her former memories, and if one
counted her past life, she was much older than Immortal Diancai.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are Ji Ning’s
master; I naturally need to address you as ‘uncle-master’,” Yu
Wei said. “Are you about to tell me about Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai was
startled. “You…you already know?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Before I returned to
the Grand Xia, my master informed me,” Yu Wei said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Will Patriarch Lu be
able to do anything?” Immortal Diancai asked frantically, “Does
he know where Ji Ning was exiled to?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He doesn’t know.”
Yu Wei shook her head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then we should…?”
Immortal Diancai had been worrying about Ning this entire time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait,” Yu Wei
replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai
suddenly thought of something. He hurriedly instructed, “Ji Ning
killed two of the Youngflame clan’s Celestial Immortals; they are
utterly enraged by this. Although they’ve exiled Ji NIng, they
aren’t going to let it rest! Any members of the Ji clan who dared
to leave Swallow Mountain have all been killed by the Youngflame
clan. You are Ji Ning’s Dao-companion; once they learn that you are
back, they’ll probably act against you. You just became a Celestial
Immortal; it’s unwise for you to fight against the Youngflame clan
head-on for now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Act against me?” A
hint of a cold, murderous look flashed past Yu Wei’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nihilum Zone of the
Primordial Ruinworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was knocked flying
backwards. After stabilizing himself, he looked at his surroundings,
then suddenly began to laugh. His laughter was filled with madness,
but it was also filled with a hint of longing and apology; longing
for his loved ones, and an apology for leaving them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I won’t be able to
accompany you any further,” Ning murmured to himself. His divine
power had been almost completely used up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the distant
violet-caped warrior who had been battling Ning actually retreated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The group of horned,
violet-caped warriors began arguing amongst themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tonto finished his
contest; let me go next.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, let me go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why should you be
the one to go?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s rare for us
to encounter an alien that can’t be killed, no matter how hard we
hit him. This is a perfect chance for some training and tempering.
Let’s take it slow. Don’t be in a rush!” The golden-caped
general added, “And it looks to me like the alien is pretty much
exhausted. Let him rest for a bit. After he recovers, you can go
challenge him one-by-one. As long as he doesn’t die, you’ll all
have a chance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had thought that he
was definitely going to die…but they were going to let him recover?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The warriors of the
Snaphorn world…really like to fight. Are they…are they treating
me as a training dummy?” Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The general and his
violet-caped warriors, however, were quite resigned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Liked to fight?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yes, they liked to
fight. However, their innate nature was such that they would
generally slaughter their foes; why would they let a fight drag on
like this? However, this was the order of the Queen Mother, and in
fact the Queen Mother’s mind was riding with them, ordering them to
fight against Ji Ning one by one. How could they possibly dare to
disobey?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forget them. Every
extra day alive counts.” Ning stood there within the vacuum of
space, immediately beginning to attune himself to those two supreme
stellar bodies in the deepest reaches of the Void, the Solar Star and
the Lunar Star. He began to draw energy from them, converting it into
divine power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the underwater
estate. A black-robed Ning sat there in the lotus position. Suddenly,
the giant yellow bear appeared, then hurriedly said, “Ji Ning, Ji
Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior bear.” The
black-robed Ning looked at the giant yellow bear.
</P>

Chapter 17 - The Seventeenth Stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of
the Nine Heavens]
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What happened just
now?” The giant yellow bear immediately asked, “I clearly sensed
that you were at your limit, but were still unable to defeat that
violet-caped fellow. How is it that suddenly…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ji Ning
knew what the big bear was asking. He didn’t seek to hide anything
from the big bear; after all, there were a good number of individuals
in the Three Realms who used heartforce. He immediately replied,
“Senior bear, previously, when my divine power was almost used up,
I felt as though things were hopeless. Ignoring all else, I poured
everything into executing my most powerful sword-arts…but who
would’ve thought that the power of my sword-arts would exceed even
my own expectations? Only then did I realize that my heartforce had
actually flowed into my sword-arts and had been slightly depleted.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heartforce?” The
giant yellow bear was surprised. “You were able to use your
heartforce through your sword-fingers?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But but but…”
The giant yellow bear didn’t dare believe it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, the giant
yellow bear actually knew less about heartforce than Ning himself
did. Ning, after all, had trained in [Houyi’s Archery], and had
read a good number of books at Mount Innerheart regarding the Three
Realms. As for the giant yellow bear, all he knew, he had learned
while accompanying Daoist Threelives.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…you were able
to use your heartforce through your sword-fingers…but you haven’t
even undergone your tribulation, right…?” The giant yellow bear
was still in a stunned state. Within the Three Realms, those who
could control heartforce were all quite famous; every single one of
them was a terrifying force, generally at the True God or Daofather
level. Even the weakest of them were generally at least Empyrean Gods
or True Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It has nothing to do
with the tribulation.” The black-robed Ning shook his head. “It
has everything to do with your level of insight into heartforce.
According to the system which mighty Houyi established, heartforce
can be divided into five levels. Thanks to the descent of the karmic
sinflames, as well as the experiences I have undergone here in the
Nihilum Zone…my heartforce actually ended up reaching the third
level, ‘ruler’. Given that I’ve been training in [Houyi’s
Archery] almost every day for the past half year while floating about
in the Nihilum Zone, my mastery over my heartforce has been improved.
Perhaps because I established a foundation through training [Houyi’s
Archery], as well as due to my heartforce reaching the third level…I
was lucky enough to execute the technique successfully.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The third stage?”
The giant yellow bear didn’t really understand; he didn’t have
any insight into Houyi’s systemized levels for heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…what’s
the usage?” The black-robed Ning shook his head. “Even if I do
understand how to apply heartforce to my sword-fingers…I still
haven’t undergone my tribulation. I’m completely unable to defeat
this Snaphorn world of the Primordial Ruinworld, much less escape the
Nihilum Zone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be
discouraged,” the giant yellow bear said. “You’ve gained quite
a lot, learning how to apply heartforce through your sword-fingers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not
depressed.” The black-robed Ning was actually quite calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right; that massive
army of the Snaphorn world has arrived, and they can easily capture
you. Why aren’t they attacking? Why are they letting you recover?”
The giant yellow bear was puzzled by this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
shook his head. “I don’t know the answer either. From the sound
of it…they seem to want to use me as a target dummy for training.
Perhaps there is another reason as well…but who cares? As long as I
have a chance to stay alive, I’ll take it. The longer I can stay
alive, the better a chance Master might have to find me. This is a
chance to survive…I naturally have to seize it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The giant
yellow bear nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the misty,
void-like region within the underwater estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
had just returned here. He looked at the seven powerful experts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well?” The
beautiful, black-armored woman asked impatiently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning says that
the reason why the army of the Snaphorn world has only trapped him
rather than killed him is because they apparently want to use him as
a training dummy to temper and train some of their more powerful
warriors.” The giant yellow bear continued, “However…the reason
really isn’t worth over-analyzing. What matters is that Ji Ning is
currently not in a life-or-death situation. There’s no need for you
to reveal your presences for now; let’s just wait patiently. The
longer this drags out, the better; if Patriarch Subhuti is able to
find Ji Ning, then everything will be well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven Fiendgods all
nodded in agreement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s one other
important matter. Ning said that he’s been able to develop a way
for him to apply his heartforce through his fingers,” the giant
yellow bear suddenly said. “That’s why his power increased so
dramatically.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A way for him to
apply heartforce?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All seven of the
Fiendgods simultaneously cried out in shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Red-hair said in
disbelief, “He…he…you said heartforce…heartforce!!! How could
he have developed…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning trained in
[Houyi’s Archery], and so he had a set of heartforce techniques to
begin with. Perhaps this helped inspire him? In addition, his
heartforce has reached the third level,” the giant yellow bear
said. “He said something about the third level of heartforce, with
Houyi having divided it up into five levels, but I didn’t really
understand it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The third level?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a monster.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s absolutely…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven of them were
all stunned. The giant yellow bear had never needed to participate in
any of the battles of Pangu’s World, but the seven of them had
followed Daoist Threelives in one battle after another. They
naturally knew a great deal of information regarding the most
powerful figures of the Three Realms. If you knew yourself well and
your foes well, you would live longer; they naturally knew that
heartforce was divided into five levels, and that reaching the third
level was considered a very high accomplishment, even in Pangu’s
World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Humans truly live up
to their reputation.” Of the seven figures, the child suddenly let
out a sigh. “The comprehension ability of humans…they truly are
the champion of the myriad races! I wonder how in the world Maiden
Nuwa was able to develop a race with such comprehension abilities.
Compared to humans, we Fiendgods have an all but non-existent level
of comprehension abilities.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Humans rose up from
a weak starting point to become the masters of Pangu’s Primordial
World. Even amongst the ranks of the Daofathers, humans are the most
numerous race! In fact, the power of humans as a race is capable of
equaling the combined power of all the other myriad races. This young
master of ours…he is a peerless monster, even amongst humans.
There’s no way we can compare to him. No way!” The elder sighed
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All seven of them were
true Fiendgods. The youngest of them had been born when Pangu’s
World had just been created.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How long had they lived
for?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had watched with
their own eyes as humanity became powerful. When the human race had
first been created, they were an extremely weak race; most likely,
any random, powerful Fiendgod would have been able to annihilate the
entire race. But humans had been created by Maiden Nuwa, and after
Pangu perished, Nuwa became the most powerful figure of the
Primordial Era. Naturally, no one would go and wipe out her human
race for no good reason. Humans bred at a very fast rate, had
incredible comprehension abilities, and grew up very quickly. They
gave birth to Celestial Immortals…Pure Yang True Immortals…and
even even Daofathers of the Great Firmament! They grew nonstop, and
their status became higher and higher. And now…their single race
was capable of withstanding all of the myriad other races combined!
Even the Fiendgods of Primordial Chaos had to acknowledge humans and
their status.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If anyone dared to act
against humanity…the major powers of the human race would wipe them
out!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He lives up to being
our young master, the successor to the Godking.” A friendly,
amiable-looking youth said with a sigh, “He was actually able to
come up with a way to apply heartforce, even though he hasn’t even
undergone his Celestial Tribulation. Combined with the [Starseizing
Hand]…our young master has most likely become the most powerful
figure amongst all Void-level Fiendgods. In fact, he’s extremely
close to being as powerful as an Empyrean God!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not just yet,
but…still, he does indeed have a chance at becoming nearly as
powerful as an Empyrean God.” Snow Scorpion nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was naturally an
enormous difference between Void-level Fiendgods and Empyrean Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…how many
Empyrean Gods had a monstrously powerful divine ability like the
[Starseizing Hand]?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And how many were in
control of heartforce?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These two points alone
were able to make up for many weaknesses. Still…despite that, it
could only be said that Ning stood a a ‘chance at becoming nearly
as powerful as an Empyrean God’; one couldn’t actually say that
he truly already had the combat power of an Empyrean God. This was
because when Fiendgods underwent their Empyrean Tribulation and
become an Empyrean God, their divine bodies would undergo an
earth-shaking change. In addition, their divine power would also
skyrocket in quality and quantity. The difference in divine body and
divine power was simply too great! The [Starseizing Hand] alone was
not enough to make up for a difference of this magnitude; even if one
added heartforce into the mix, it would be hard to say.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And in addition…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean Gods also had
very high levels of insight into the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, ever since the
creation of Pangu’s World, there had never been anyone who, as a
Void-level Fiendgod, could be said to have truly reached the power of
an Empyrean God. Of course…Ning was a monster the likes of which
had never been seen, even in Pangu’s World. First of all, he was
the only person who knew the [Starseizing Hand], with the other
practitioner, Daoist Threelives, having died long ago. And secondly,
although there were a few who knew how to apply heartforce, there
were almost none at the Void-level; after all, even Ning had only
developed this technique after first training in [Houyi’s Archery],
then undergoing karmic sinflames, then suffering in the Void and
reaching the third level of heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To be able to possess
both the [Starseizing Hand] and be able to apply heartforce…Ning
truly was an absolute monster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, even these seven
Fiendgods who had been alive since the days when Pangu had
established the universe had to sigh at the fact that Ning was
extremely close to the level of Empyrean Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is this alien
doing?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He seems to be
training.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The general and the 801
violet-caped warriors stared at the distant human youth. At this
moment, above Ning’s head had appeared two miniature stars; they
were a miniature Solar Star and a miniature Lunar Star. Above the
miniature Solar Star, flames blazed and a tiny Golden Crow flew
about, while above the Lunar Star, an osmanthus tree was growing.
Both the miniature Solar Star and the miniature Lunar Star were quite
detailed; they seemed to truly be identical to the true Solar Star
and Lunar Star, albeit countless times smaller.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His divine power was
continuing to recover.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was training quite
calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long time later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After his divine power
had completely recovered, Ning was once more at peak power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning opened his
eyes, sweeping the warriors of the Snaphorn world with his gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He stopped. It seems
he’s recovered.” The general smiled. “Baloni, you go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” A desire for
battle blazed in the eyes of a violet-caped warrior. He was so
excited, he let out a hiss with his slender little tongue. “Alien
brat, I’m not as useless as the likes of Tonto and the others.
Ahaha…” His ear-piercing laughter rang out as he transformed into
a black streak of light, charging straight for Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One massive battle
after another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each time, a
violet-caped warrior would fight against Ning by himself. Some had
lower attack power than Ning, but were superior in speed and so could
still give him a good fight. The violet-caped warriors also had
particularly superb warriors who were superior to Ning in every
aspect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each time, Ning fought
until his divine power was completely exhausted, then would stop
fighting and calmly focus on recovering through the [Crimsonbright
Diagram of the Nine Heavens]! The aliens, in turn, permitted Ning to
recover.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fight! Train!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fight! Train!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The aliens came in a
steady stream, forcing Ning to squeeze out every bit of potential he
had. The three Queen Mothers, through these constant engagements,
were able to sense Ning’s heartforce rippling. They, in turn, were
working hard to hypothesize how heartforce was to be used.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on…and in
the blink of an eye, more than twelve years had gone past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had completely
forgotten the flow of time, losing himself in battle. During the past
twelve years, he had completely focused all of his attention on the
application of heartforce; every single battle was a test for him,
and he constantly tried and tested new methods. His method of
applying heartforce to his fingers became more and more exquisite; by
now, Ning was actually able to use up nearly 3% of his total
heartforce through a single sword-finger. This was quite
astonishing…but clearly, he hadn’t reached his maximum potential
yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two miniature versions
of the Solar Star and the Lunar Star were hovering above Ning’s
head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A large amount of
divine power was circulating through his body. During the past twelve
years, Ning’s divine power had grown nonstop, becoming thicker,
denser, and more perfect. And today…Ning had truly reached the peak
of power possible for the sixteenth stage of the [Crimsonbright
Diagram of the Nine Heavens].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His divine power
finally began to transform.

Chapter 18 - Eighteen Stormy Years
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s
breakthrough to the seventeenth stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram
of the Nine Heavens] didn’t cause too much of a disturbance; in
fact, the nearby soldiers of the First Army of the Snaphorn world
didn’t even realize that he had made a breakthrough. This was how
the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] worked; only when one
made a major breakthrough to a new level would the Solar Star and the
Lunar Star transmit Solar Truefire and Lunar Truewater. Lesser
breakthroughs caused a much smaller disturbance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh. Within
Ning’s divine body, the increasingly pure Crimsonbright divine
power began to transform into tiny little rivers that flowed through
his veins, causing his divine body to grow even stronger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seventeenth stage!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the limit of
power for his true body, before it underwent the Celestial
Tribulation; if he dared to raise himself to the eighteenth stage,
then the tribulation would descend at a moment’s notice afterwards.
Although he now controlled heartforce and felt more confident in his
chances…he was still surrounded by karmic sinflames and was a
tremendous sinner. Most likely, the power of his Celestial
Tribulation would be even more terrifying. If he could survive here
and leave this place, the Nihilum Zone…Ning couldn’t even imagine
what the scene of his tribulation would be like.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m the sole heir
of the [Starseizing Hand], the disciple of Patriarch Subhuti, a
Fiendgod Body Refiner, and surrounded by karmic sinflames.” Ning
truly couldn’t imagine it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was quite common for
ordinary Fiendgod Body Refiners to undergo nine nine-sets of thunder
tribulation. Upon overcoming the Celestial Tribulation, they would
have become Empyrean Gods!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And he…he was no
ordinary Fiendgod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard that some
particularly monstrous geniuses amongst Ki Refiners will also
encounter nine nine-sets of thunder tribulation,” Ning mused to
himself. “I, on the other hand, am a Fiendgod Body Refiner. My
Celestial Tribulation…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To this very day, no
one had ever fully understood which elements were taken into account
in determining the power of the Celestial Tribulation. However, there
were many past precedences; for example, Lu Dongbin was a Ki Refiner
who had undergone nine nine-sets as a Ki Refiner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ordinary Fiendgods
would often have to undergo nine complete nine-sets of thunder
tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for some truly
monstrous geniuses, the most elite of the Fiendgods of the entire
Three Realms…their backgrounds were so extraordinary that their
tribulations were not like ordinary tribulations. Ning had the
feeling…that he would probably be treated as one of the most
peerless of Fiendgods of the Three Realms in this regard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forget about that
for now…I have so many enemies to battle, and I don’t have to
hold anything back as I train in heartforce. I can’t waste this
opportunity.” Ning opened his eyes, halting his cultivation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems he’s
recovered. It’s my turn this time!” A muscular, violet-caped
warrior roared with laughter, four giant warhammers in his four arms.
Leaping through space, he charged towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he was in a
dire situation…since there was nowhere to run, Ning didn’t think
about anything, completely focusing on battle. As he gained more
experience with the application of heartforce, Ning’s power began
to rise continuously. The more heartforce his sword-fingers were able
to unleash, the more powerful his blows would become. This caused the
violet-caped warriors to feel unspeakable misery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the twelfth year,
which is to say after Ning broke through to the seventeenth stage,
more than half the violet-caped warriors were at a disadvantage when
fighting Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As his control over
heartforce grew increasingly powerful, Ning began to be able to
suppress one violet-caped warrior after another. However, the
difference in power wasn’t that great; they were more than capable
of staying alive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By the fifteenth year,
Ning was confident in being able to kill in battle some of the
enemies who matched up poorly against him, but he did not kill them.
He was afraid that if he did kill the violet-caped warriors, they
would be enraged; that wouldn’t be worth it! The most important
thing for him right now was to delay; ideally, he would delay for a
few decades or a century. The more time passed, the better the
chances that his master, Patriarch Subhuti, would be able to find
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By the sixteenth year,
Ning was able to use up nearly a twentieth of his heartforce in a
single blow of his sword-fingers. This was him using full power in a
single hand; there was no way he could reach this level when using
all six arms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By the seventeenth
year, Ning was able to use up a sixteenth of his heartforce in one
stroke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By the eighteenth year,
Ning was able to use up a fifteenth of his heartforce in one stroke!
By now, his application of heartforce was perfect, in that not a
single bit of his heartforce was wasted or leaked out to the outside
world. Ning could no longer come up with any way to further improve
it. Although it was still a bit inferior compared to the amount of
heartforce he could use when using [Houyi’s Archery]…there
naturally were some differences between close combat and archery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aside from mastering
the application of heartforce, Ning had also grown even more
formidable in sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Nihilum
Zone, there were no Daos to disturb him, allowing Ning to focus even
more purely attuning with his sword-arts, causing him to just barely
touch upon the true essence of the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been fighting
this entire time within the Nihilum Zone. His life was a very calm
one…but within the distant Three Realms, the world of the Grand Xia
was no longer calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stillwater City. The
Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a mountain of
the Black-White College, a black-robed maiden was seated opposite a
black-haired, black-robed man. Both were quietly, pensively drinking
wine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate
has grow more and more bold.” Immortal Diancai’s eyes were filled
with anger…but he then shook his head and sighed. “However, they
are indeed formidable. They were actually able to cause the Northmont
clan of Stillwater to fracture internally. So many high-level members
of the Northmont clan actually desired to throw their support to the
Seamless Gate…but fortunately senior Unity was enraged and moved to
slaughter them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just two hours ago,
this very day, Celestial Immortal Unity had struck out in rage,
wiping out more than half of the Void-level experts of the Northmont
clan! All the traitors were killed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After senior Unity
made his move, the Seamless Gate sent a diplomatic note; if he
doesn’t throw his support to the Seamless Gate, then they shall
become mortal enemies.” Immortal Diancai looked at Yu Wei. “Yu
Wei, what do you think we should do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It doesn’t really
matter what we think; the one which the Seamless Gate truly cares
about is senior Unity. According to the stories, senior Unity has
power comparable to that of a Pure Yang True Immortal,” Yu Wei
said. “And this is precisely the reason why the Seamless Gate has
spent so much effort on our Stillwater Commandery; they want to pull
senior Unity over to their side.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate
truly has spent quite a bit of effort on us. The other commanderies
might be in a state of chaos, but they aren’t nearly as bad as our
Stillwater Commandery is. Still…senior Unity truly is resolute and
decisive. The Northmont clan had fractured to the point where nearly
half wanted to surrender to the Seamless Gate; even Celestial
Immortal Hunchmont ended up being abducted by the Seamless Gate! He
actually slaughtered more than half of his Void-level kinsmen. Even
if it meant Hunchmont’s death, he still insisted on standing by the
side of the Xia Emperor.” Diancai sighed. “Now that the Seamless
Gate has sent that diplomatic note…a disaster is about to befall
Stillwater Commandery.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he thought about
this disaster…Immortal Diancai thought of Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That disciple of his
who had wrought so many miracles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That peerless disciple
of his who had assaulted the headquarters of the Youngflame clan,
slaughtered two mighty Celestial Immortals, and was capable of
resisting karmic sinflames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder how Ji Ning
is doing. It has been eighteen years, but he still hasn’t
returned.” A hint of urgency was in Immortal Diancai’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eighteen years.”
Yu Wei looked at the bright moon in the night sky, her heart filled
with countless thoughts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Junior
apprentice-brother…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When will you return?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s better for
him to return later; he might be able to dodge this storm.”
Immortal Diancai was still angry. “The Seamless Gate is acting with
such wild abandon, and senior Unity continues to stand by the side of
the Xia Emperor, but the Xia Emperor hasn’t even come to help out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The entirety of the
Grand Xia is in a state of chaos. Every area is asking for his help.
How is he supposed to accomplish it all?” Yu Wei sighed. “In
addition..how do you know, uncle-master, that the Xia Emperor hasn’t
been helping out in secret?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had only been
eighteen years…but the situation of the Grand Xia was more than a
hundred times worse than it had been when Ning was present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning had been
present, although the various commanderies throughout the Grand Xia
all saw some disturbances, on the whole things were still fairly
calm. But soon after Ning slaughtered the two Celestial Immortals of
the Youngflame clan, a series of Celestial Immortals began to perish
throughout the world of the Grand Xia. It was either done by the
Seamless Gate, or by the Xia Emperor in his furious reprisals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All sorts of battles
were carried out in secret!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One Celestial Immortal
after another perished!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Grand Xia’s
various marquisdoms, supreme clans, and major sects also began to
engage in reprisal killings!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The storm was growing
more and more violent. Even the number one assassin’s guild of the
Grand Xia, ‘Bloodcloud Hall’, had revealed its true face. It
struck out time and time again, assaulting and killing some of the
tougher foes of the Seamless Gate!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nine years ago…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A dangerous situation
had appeared within one of the headquarters of the Northmont clan;
even Loose Immortals who went to investigate would perish. Celestial
Immortal Hunchmont and Yu Wei had gone together to investigate;
logically speaking, if they joined forces, the two of them should be
able to escape from any danger without problems. However…the
Seamless Gate had actually paid an enormous price to trap them there.
Yu Wei, by using an escape technique which Patriarch Lu had
bequeathed unto her, had been lucky enough to escape…but Celestial
Immortal Hunchmont had been captured alive!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By the time Sword
Immortal Unity learned of this, it was too late; Celestial Immortal
Hunchmont had been sent off to the ‘Fifth World.’
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, it was the
capture of Celestial Immortal Hunchmont that truly caused the
Seamless Gate and Stillwater Commandery to begin fighting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone in the
Three Realms believes me to be dead, but the Seamless Gate actually
knew that I am alive.” Sword Immortal Unity had a bad feeling as
well; the Seamless Gate was even harder to deal with than he had
expected. They used all sorts of methods to try and influence Sword
Immortal Unity, be it through tribes, territory, or other methods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…given that
Sword Immortal Unity had the mental fortitude to hide himself away
for so many years, how could the Seamless Gate possibly change his
mind so easily as this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You want to seduce the
kinsmen that I favor?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seduce away the
Void-level Earth Immortals that I wanted to teach?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fine. All traitors…die!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hunchmont? If you want
to kill him, then kill him, Seamless Gate!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal Unity
seemed to be without any weaknesses whatsoever. Over the course of
nine years, they had engaged in several major battles, and even Yu
Wei and Immortal Diancai had encountered grave danger. At the same
time…the news that Yu Wei had become a Celestial Immortal finally
began to spread out, and her strength became publicly acknowledged.
However…when assaulted by the Seamless Gate, Yu Wei and Immortal
Diancai received aid from Sword Immortal Unity as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unity was indeed
incredibly powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He, all by himself…had
forced thirty-six Celestial Immortals of the Seamless Gate to flee in
disarray! This was what it meant to have power close to a Pure Yang
True Immortal’s!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since Sword
Immortal Unity had revealed his sharpness, not even the Youngflame
clan had dared to cause trouble in Stillwater Commandery any longer.
Although Immortal Venomfreak was also quite famous for his power…his
strength lay in his cunning, in subertfuge, and in his many clones.
As for Unity, known as the Supreme Sword Immortal, he had truly
astonishing close combat power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Nihilum
Zone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The sword…so it is
as simple and pure as this.” Ning was currently battling against
one of the violet-caped warriors. His sword-fingers dimly glowed with
a sharp, silvery-white shine. Clang! Clang! Clang! Ning’s
sword-fingers collided with the foe’s greataxe, but actually
knocked it flying back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His sword-fingers now
glowed with that sharp, silvery-white light…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the other
thing Ning had gained during these eighteen years of battle, aside
from learning how to use heartforce!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These eighteen years
had resulted in hundreds of more battles than Ning had experienced in
all his previous decades of life combined! This was because all of
his time was spent either replenishing his divine power or fighting.
Repeated battles. Endless battles! And there were no Daos present; in
fact, not even the Dao of the Sword was present to influence him.
Ning didn’t have to think about what was the best way to summon the
most amount of natural energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He didn’t have to
consider these things; all he had to think about was honing his
instincts and using them to apply his sword-arts in battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so…Ning’s
sword-arts had become more and more pure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They guided to the very
essence of swordplay itself!

Chapter 19 - At The Scroll’s End, The Dagger Appears
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Note - This chapter’s
title comes from a Chinese idiom which essentially means ‘true
intentions revealed in the end’; it comes from a famous historical
story where an assassin attempted to assassinate the Qin Emperor by
hiding a dagger within a scroll that the Qin Emperor wanted. The Qin
Emperor accepted the scroll and and began to unfurl it, and at the
the very bottom/end of the scroll, the dagger appeared; the assassin
immediately grabbed the dagger and used it to make the assassination
attempt. Thus, the saying ‘at the scroll’s end, the dagger
appears’ refers to true intentions being revealed]
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His swordplay became so
pure that one day, the tips of Ji Ning’s sword-fingers began to
glow with that sharp, silvery-white aura. This silvery-white aura
caused his sword-fingers to become even sharper and fiercer! They
were now sharper and more penetrating than even actual swords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the underwater
estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
was currenty asking the giant yellow bear some questions. “Senior
bear, do you know what the sharp lights surrounding my fingers are?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You don’t know?”
The giant bear was puzzled. “You know about heartforce, so how can
you not know about…oh, right. Most likely, Patriarch Subhuti was
worried that you would set your sights too high, and so he didn’t
tell you right away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you mean?”
Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant bear
explained, “For Sword Immortals, fully mastering the Grand Dao of
the Sword isn’t the end of the road. After you completely master
the entire Grand Dao of the Sword…you’ll begin to focus on
understanding the essence of the sword itself. When using sword-arts,
your blade will naturally emit this sort of sharp light. This sort of
sharp light is also referred to as ‘swordforce’; generally
speaking, peerless Sword Immortals who have thoroughly mastered the
Grand Dao of the Sword will begin to slowly discover and cultivate
this power. You’ve just barely touched upon it; I imagine you are
at the lowest, most basic level of swordforce.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swordforce?” Ning
now understood. “So that’s how it is. When I was in Mount
Innerheart, I saw some books which made note of the fact that when
one completely mastered the Grand Dao of Taiji, one would begin to
attune to the very essence of the Taiji itself, at which point a
strange type of power would slowly be developed; taiji-force! It
seems my swordforce is quite similar to this taiji-force in nature.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The giant
bear smiled and nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now completely
understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Taiji-force,
swordforce…generally speaking, those who completely mastered the
Grand Daos of Taiji or the Sword would be able to slowly work on
controlling this type of power. It could be considered an additional
supplement, making one a bit more powerful in battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One of the greatest
dangers for Immortal cultivators is being overly ambitious.” Ning
let out a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, when he
first entered the Black-White College, the Primal Daoists, Loose
Immortals, and Earth Immortals wouldn’t even tell him that the Dao
was divided up into Heavenly Daos, Grand Daos, and ordinary Daos.
This was precisely because they were worried about their disciples
being excessively ambitious, resulting in them accomplishing nothing
whatsoever! The same was true for Patriarch Subhuti; if he had told
Ning about swordforce all along, it might’ve caused Ning to deviate
when attuning to the Dao of the Sword, which would actually
negatively impact his insights.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I haven’t even
fully mastered the Dao of the Sword yet, but I’ve actually begun to
be able to use a slight amount of swordforce already.” Ning laughed
in a gratified manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The number of
battles you have engaged in during the past ten-plus years was far
more than the total number of battles you engaged in before you
arrived here in the Nihilum Zone. The Dao of the Sword is an
attacking Dao to begin with; if the Dao of the Sword or the Heavenly
Daos were present here, I imagine that you would’ve advanced quite
astonishingly fast in the Dao of the Sword.” The giant bear added,
“Since this place does not have the Dao of the Sword, you haven’t
been able to advance in the Dao of the Sword at all…which means you
accidentally focused on attuning to the essence of the sword and
ended up controlling a tiny thread of swordforce. This can be
considered an unexpected benefit for you. I trust that in the future,
the fact that you have started your quest for the essence of the
sword will be of tremendous help to you in comprehending the Dao of
the Sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded lightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Monster. A true
monster.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder Lu Dongbin
felt so certain that he was born to be a peerless Sword Immortal, and
even Patriarch Subhuti felt that he was extremely talented in this
regard. Even before mastering the Dao of the Sword, he’s already
taken control of a tiny amount of swordforce. Clearly, he has an
incredibly, unbelievably high level of aptitude towards the sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the blurry,
void-like region within the underwater estate. The giant yellow bear
had told them about his conversation, and the seven Fiendgods all
signed in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…Ning had only
mastered the most basic, elementary level of swordforce at present;
there was a limit as to how much it could help him. By comparison,
his ruler-level heartforce had helped Ning increase his power much
more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…that tiny bit
of mastery over swordforce was a testament to the fact that Ning
truly was an unbelievable talent as a Sword Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter how
talented he is, it won’t matter unless he can escape this Nihilum
Zone.” A muscular man whose entire body was red in color let out a
sigh. “To date, the Snaphorn world hasn’t truly gone all out
against our young master…but if push comes to shove, then we will
be forced to intervene. By then, we will have to deal with the master
of the Snaphorn world…and we have no idea as to if we can beat him
or not.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The real question
is, has the master of the Snaphorn world reached the Daofather level
yet?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If not, he won’t
pose a threat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But if he is at the
Daofather level…we’ll probably be doomed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have nowhere to
run. Even if we don’t move to rescue our young master, the master
of the Snaphorn world will eventually discover the Starseizing Manor.
After discovering the Starseizing Manor…if he is at the Daofather
level, he’ll definitely be able to find our world. By then…we’d
still have to fight him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Technically speaking,
Ning had yet to become an Empyrean God, and per the orders of Daoist
Threelives, they weren’t supposed to save him; they were supposed
to leave Ning’s fate up to himself, and if he died they were to go
find another successor. Alas…they were now trapped within the
Nihilum Zone and unable to depart from it, much less find another
successor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This day, Ning engaged
in dozens of battles before coming to a halt, acting as though he
needed to replenish his divine power. In reality, Ning still had half
of it left; after all, now that he had reached the seventeenth stage
of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], his divine power
was much thicker than it had been in the past. For the sake of being
prepared for all eventualities, he always came to a halt when he only
had half of his divine power left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In turn, the
violet-caped warriors always let him replenish his divine power as
needed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he replenished his
energy…three mighty minds were conversing within the darkness of
the Void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ever since this
human began fighting against our Firstborn, he’s continuously
improved his mastery over his heartforce. Less and less of it leaks
out, and the ripples it causes are harder and harder to discern.
Recently…he’s leaked out no heartforce in his battles whatsoever.
Although we can vaguely sense that he is using it, we are unable to
sense any of the heartforce ripples now. This poses no use to us in
our attempts to develop a heartforce technique at all.” The first
Queen Mother’s thoughts held a hint of resentment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two elder sisters,
what should we do?” The third Queen Mother asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“During this period
of time, tens of thousands of battles have been carried out. We’ve
developed a few ideas, while you, little sister, have actually
managed to coalesce some heartforce. You’ve developed a basic level
of skill in heartforce; this can be described as a merit for this
human.” The second Queen Mother continued, “However, our elder
sister and I have yet to be able to coalesce heartforce, much less
figure out a way to apply it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although I’ve
managed to coalesce heartforce, I still need to slowly work away at a
method for applying it.” The third Queen Mother’s thoughts held a
hint of resentment as well. “If he continues to leak heartforce…a
few more centuries of battle should be enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hundred years, a
thousand years…these were very short periods of time for them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas, Ning had only
given them eighteen years of ‘bliss’. By now, Ning had very
perfect control over his heartforce. When using his sword-arts, his
heartforce didn’t leak outwards at all; the Queen Mothers knew that
Ning was using heartforce, but there was no way for them to analyze
it. After all, the more that leaked out, the more easy it was to
analyze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But we aren’t able
to hypnotize him…and he’d rather die than let us search his
memories. Let’s kill him,” the second Queen Mother said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third Queen Mother
opposed this. “Let’s capture him alive first, then imprison him
within our bodies. Let us slowly torment him, slowly torture him…and
perhaps one day we’ll be able to search his memories.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Capture him and
imprison him within third sister’s body.” The first Queen Mother
agreed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” The second
Queen Mother accepted this outcome.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They gave the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nihilum Zone. The
golden-caped general and violet-caped warriors of the Snaphorn world
were all relaxing and chatting amongst themselves. Although they had
always felt that letting this alien stay alive wasn’t really in
keeping with their nature, and they truly wanted to slaughter him…how
could they dare disobey the orders of their Queen Mothers?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The mind-strands that
had been attached to the golden-caped general and the hundreds of
violet-caped Firstborn warriors began to transmit orders from the
Queen Mother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Children, capture
this alien right away and send him to our sacred palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the bored,
golden-caped general and his many violet-caped warriors grew excited,
their eyes lighting up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Perfect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were finally going
to be allowed to make their act. For the entire First Army to be idle
here…the millions of Snaphorn warriors were utterly bored
senseless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Queen Mother
commands that the alien is to be captured alive and sent to the
sacred palace.” The general sent mental messages to each and every
one of the violet-caped warriors; after all, the Queen Mothers had
only been able to send direct messages to the Firstborn. There were
many violet-caped warriors who didn’t know the news yet. “This
time…there’s no need for the rest of you to intervene. I’ll
handle him myself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” No one would
disobey.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because the
general hadn’t fought a single time yet!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning was in
the middle of replenishing his divine power, with a miniature Solar
Star and Lunar Star floating above his head, transmitting energy to
him to be converted into divine power…Ning was still keeping a very
close watch on his surroundings. However, he didn’t realize that
the distant general was about to make his move…but the giant yellow
bear did, and immediately warned him: “Ji Ning, that alien general
is about to make his move.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning was
startled awake, instantly opening his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Torch-light blazed
within his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He immediately saw the
golden-caped general charge towards him from ten thousand kilometers
away. The golden-caped general had always been Ning’s greatest
source of fear…but he had never fought against Ning, not even once.
In the past, he had always just watched from far away. In addition,
during the past eighteen years, as long as Ning was in the process of
replenishing his divine power, the enemy would not act against him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“General.” Ning
sent his divine sense out in a ripple. “After waiting for so many
years…it seems you are finally going to make your move.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our warriors have
been tempered enough, given how many times they’ve fought you.”
The general strode through the void as he spoke. His appearance was
identical to that of the other horned warriors, but his eyes were
older and wiser, and his invisible aura of power was far more
menacing. “Alien…you should forget about resisting. If you do so,
you might be able to stay alive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You won’t kill
me?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he could stay alive
somehow, then he would do so, trying to buy as much time as he could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Follow me to the
Snaphorn world. I won’t kill you,” the general said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart
trembled. To the Snaphorn world? It must be understood that this
region of space was simply a part of the Void that was under the
control of the Snaphorn world. The true territory of the Snaphorn
world was within the Primordial Ruinworld. By comparison, the Nihilum
Zone was safer; the Primordial Ruinworld was truly the main
headquarters of the enemy. If he entered there…his chances of
escape would be even lower. How could Ning possibly go in?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible.” Ning
shook his head, staring at the general.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heh heh heh…”
The general laughed, but four long whips suddenly appeared in his
hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your resistance is
futile.” The general was very calm. His self-confidence came from
his overwhelming power. Instantly, his four arms lashed out
simultaneously, and the four long black whips lashed out many tens of
thousands of meters like four enormous black serpents. They reached
Ning in almost an instant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning used two arms to
guard in front of him, while the fingers of his other four arms
transformed to become three thousand meters long, using sword-arts to
block the attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was already doing
his utmost, siumultaneously using 3% of his heartforce with each
strikes of his four sword-fingers. In fact, he was clearly able to
block the long black whips…but the whips trembled and somehow
arrived in front of Ning’s head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning hurriedly
moved to block, those four black whips had completely entangled Ning.
If the violet-caped warriors could be described as supreme Celestial
Immortals, then this golden-caped warrior had already reached the
Empyrean God level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the misty,
void-like region inside the underwater estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That golden-caped
general has made his move.” The giant yellow bear had a serious
look on his face as he watched what was happening in the outside
world. “Ji Ning is fighting back…but he’s already become
trapped by the whips.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Move.” The
red-haired Empyrean God gave the order to their group of seven
Fiendgods. “Completely wipe out the entire First Army.”

Chapter 20 - Seven Mighty Empyrean Gods Emerge
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black whips snaked
out in circles, completely entangling Ji Ning. Ning gritted his teeth
and struggled, but was unable to break free. This caused Ning to feel
both rage as well as a hint of sorrow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am a practitioner
of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], and am incomparably close to the
Empyrean God level in power. I don’t even hold those violet-caped
warriors, each of which is comparable to a supreme Celestial
Immortal, in any regard. Who would’ve thought that in just a single
exchange, I would be captured?” Ning gave a cold look towards the
golden-caped general and the group of violet-caped warriors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, look at the
alien! He still seems untamed and unruly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He thought that just
because he gave us a good fight, that he could overcome our general?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The general has
completely transcended the Heaven-level long and has truly reached
the Saint-level. In addition, as the general of the First Army, he’s
one of the most powerful of Saint-level experts; how could this alien
possibly overcome him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The violet-caped
warriors were all chatting amongst themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Saint-level; this
was equivalent to the Empyrean God level of the Three Realms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had extremely high
statuses within the Snaphorn world, and were qualified to bear the
golden cape. The Elders of the Palace of Elders and the generals of
the armies were generally all at this level! In addition, a general
who commanded the First Army, the border army that often engaged in
wars, was definitely a god of war amongst the Snaphorn world, someone
venerated by countless kinsmen!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Imprison him and
take him back to the sacred palace,” the general ordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The group of
violet-caped warriors all assented. They glanced towards the captured
Ning with looks of disdain and pity. After countless ages of war, the
only thing the warriors of the Snaphorn world felt towards all aliens
was enmity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our entire First
Army has been dawdling here for so long. It’s been boring.” The
countless horned warriors were all dancing in joy. These past
eighteen years truly had been extremely boring for these warriors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A golden warship flew
over from the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The general was holding
a whip with but a single hand, and was dragging the entangled, bound
human youth, Ji Ning, behind him. He looked back at Ning. “You are
fairly strong; your sword-arts, at least, are close to the
Saint-level in power. A pity for you that you met me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced at the
general, then ignored him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew himself that
with the Fourth Cycle of the [Starseizing Hand], his ruler-level
heartforce supporting him, his swordforce, and his seventeenth stage
of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], that he should
have in theory reached the threshold of Empyrean Gods! However, the
mere ‘threshold’ represented a weak Empyrean God…and this
golden-caped general was a very strong one!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Without any warning,
four figures suddenly appeared out of nowhere around Ji Ning. Their
explosively powerful auras caused Ning’s face to instantly change.
He couldn’t help but turn his to look, and when he did, he saw ten
figures with utterly astonishing auras. There was a bald elder with
narrowed eyes, an amiable-looking youth, a bewitchingly beautiful
woman with snow-white eyebrows, and…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Redsnow?”
Ning was amazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven figures
included a tall, muscular man with red hair and golden armor. It was
the red-haired Empyrean God who Ning had met in the past!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These seven figures had
equally powerful auras; they were all on the same level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” The
general, who had been pulling Ning behind him with the whip, turned
his head and saw those seven figures as well. His face also changed.
“Who are you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Danger!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The general suddenly
felt a powerful sense of danger in his heart. At the same time…he
couldn’t figure out how these seven powerful figures could’ve
suddenly arrived within the space territory controlled by his
Snaphorn world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” Of the
seven figures that had appeared around Ning, one was the child who
was wearing a neck-circlet. The child suddenly let out a laugh as his
body began to rapidly grow in size. Just before, he had been smaller
than even Ning, but now he transformed to become thirty thousand
meters tall, becoming even larger and more muscular than the warriors
of the Snaphorn world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The massive child
roared with laughter…and suddenly, a pillar of golden light shot
out from his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“DIVINE GOLDBLAZE
LIGHT!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The child let out a
loud shout.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eye-beams of light
swept out in every direction. Whoosh…the pillars of light shot out
from his eyes expanded to cover an area of a hundred thousand
kilometers. All the horned warriors and black-caped warriors touched
by the pillars of light all let out agonized cries. They all began to
melt, like snowmen under the sun…with the only difference being
that they melted far faster!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It hurts!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is this?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wherever those
eye-beams swept past, the horned warriors and black-caped warriors
died, melting into death without being able to resist at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
more than ten thousand Snaphorn warriors had perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But, but, but…”
The general was stunned for a moment, but he then immediately gave an
order. “Quick, assemble the formation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes!” The 801
violet-caped warriors were shocked awake by this order. If they were
going to join into a powerful formation, the 801 of them had to take
the lead! A small war-formation needed a single black-caped warrior
and ten ordinary Snaphorn warriors, while a medium war-formation
needed a violet-caped warrior, a hundred black-caped warriors, and a
thousand ordinary warriors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The largest formations,
however…required a general, a hundred commanders, ten thousand
black-caped warriors, and a hundred thousand ordinary warriors
joining forces! Thus, these violet-caped warriors had to lead the
way; otherwise, the unorganized masses would be completely unable to
resist that terrifying divine light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gaze-attack of the
child had stretched out to a hundred thousand kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You want to flee?”
The beautiful woman with the snow-white eyebrows transformed into a
streak of white light…and then in her stead, an enormous, snowy
white scorpion appeared within the Void. This snowy white scorpion
was like an enormous island, a full ten thousand kilometers in size.
Its face, however, was the face of a human woman, and it also had
those strange-looking white eyebrows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This titanic snow-white
scorpion almost instantly charged into the group of those 801
violet-caped warriors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The snowy white
eyebrows of the scorpion were even longer than its tail. They
fluttered forward, one of them transforming into countless white
strands of silk that wrapped around those violet-caped warriors.
Luckily enough, they had been fleeing in many different directions,
and so when the snowy white scorpion had appeared, they had already
begun pulling away from each other, and so part of them were able to
escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the 801 violet-caped
warriors, over six hundred were instantly entangled by those
eyebrows!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ssssssss….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the same instant
that they were entangled by the eyebrows, a layer of frost began to
appear on their bodies. And then…like ice cracking, they were
completely chopped and broken apart by the white eyebrow-strands.
Even their cores were destroyed, causing them all to perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This took time to
describe…but in reality, as soon as the seven figures had appeared,
the child and the black-armored beauty had immediately struck with
utterly devasting power. This completely enraged the general.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn you, aliens!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The general no longer
paid Ning any mind. He transformed into a streak of light, charging
towards the now-titanic child.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The titanic child
looked down at the general, letting out a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The child held his
neck-circlet in his hands, smashing it downwards towards the general.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The long whips in the
general’s four arms expanded to become more than thirty thousand
meters long, furiously seeking to entangle the neck-circlet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, so you have
quite a bit of strength.” The child gave it a tug, but wasn’t
able to tug it free.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-armored,
red-haired Empyrean God watched this all happen. He immediately let
out a cold snort, then stabbed forward with the longspear in his
hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the spear stabbed
out, an enormous whirlpool appeared within the Void, with the center
of the whirlpool being the tip of the spear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” The
general immediately had a tremendous feeling of danger. He had the
feeling that this red-haired fellow…was far more powerful than the
child and the scorpion lady. In fact, the red-haired fellow might be
strong enough to kill him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee.” The general
no longer thought of fighting back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That red-haired man
alone was enough to make him feel helpless…and the general had six
other foes at his level of power to worry about as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Space suddenly seemed
to have been thrown into chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The general was
stunned. He lowered his head, looking at his chest…and there was
the tip of an enormous spear sticking out it. His core had been
completely shattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I…I just died?”
The general couldn’t believe it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But how could he know
that this Fiendgod, Redsnow, had been the number one general under
the command of Daoist Threelives? He had been awe-inspiringly famous,
even back in Pangu’s Primordial World, and was truly one of the
most utterly supreme of Empyrean Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Red-hair, how could
that little alien bastard have been a match for you? You didn’t
even give us a chance to act!” The gentle-looking youth complained
with resignation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was preparing to
have a nice, big fight with him, but you killed him right away!”
The child complained helplessly as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just stared
blankly at all this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Good heavens…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just now, he had felt
utter despair…but these seven figures had suddenly appeared, and
they were ridiculously powerful. Was this the power of a true
Empyrean God? It was on a completely different level from the
Celestial Immortals; most likely hundreds of Celestial Immortals
would have to join together into a formation to be able to resist
such power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Redsnow,”
Ning hurriedly called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Redsnow glanced at
Ning, then smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because he had a full
head of red hair, his closest friends often simply referred to him as
‘red-hair’, but his name was indeed Redsnow. Thus, the spear-art
he developed had also been named [Redsnow].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up. This isn’t
the time to play around,” Empyrean God Redsnow said. “Wipe them
out as soon as you can; we need to come up with a way to escape this
Nihilum Zone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The leader of these
seven was Empyrean God Redsnow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Redsnow had been very
steady and reliable when they had followed Daoist Threelives, and he
was also extremely powerful; everyone acknowledged his leadership!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Snaphorn world. The
Palace of Elders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where did those
aliens come from?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine mighty Elders
who had been lazily watching the mirror were all shocked. The general
of the First Army had easily captured that alien…but who would’ve
imagined that seven mysterious figures would suddenly arrive? The
seven had massacred their warriors with utterly overwhelming power,
and even one of the top generals of the Snaphorn world, the general
of the First Army, had actually been killed by that red-haired foe in
their first exchange of blows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This caused them to
feel enraged…and also horrified!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they were
Elders and were also at the Saint-level like the general…their
responsibilities lay in the governance of the Snaphorn world. By
comparison, their combat abilities were inferior. In an actual
battle, they probably would be weaker than the general.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the infinite
darkness of the Void, three minds were conversing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Fiendgods of the
Three Realms have arrived as well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That region of space
was locked long ago; there’s no way they could’ve gone straight
there. There’s only one possibility; those Fiendgods of the Three
Realm have been accompanying that human this entire time in some sort
of portable dimensional treasure. They hadn’t attacked because they
were waiting for us to capture the human; only then could they no
longer hold back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These seven
Fiendgods should all be at the Empyrean God level…only, that
red-haired Empyrean God is a bit too ridiculously strong. Even my
child, Habul, was instantly killed. Even in that ancient war, there
were very few Empyrean Gods who were so terrifyingly strong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let us personally
intervene to annihilate them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All three Queen Mothers
began to emit a terrifying, killing intent…

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nihilum Zone.
Millions of horned warriors were fleeing in terror and despair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That enemy with the
neck-circlet…all the warriors in the locations he looks at die.
He’s too terrifying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The general was
killed on one blow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had completely
collapsed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In a short instant,
more than six hundred of the eight hundred commanders of the First
Army had been wiped out, along with their general. The horned
warriors were unable to assume their formations; naturally, they no
longer even thought about fighting back. All they felt was utter
terror and panic as they frantically fled in every which way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But right at this
moment, the exact same voice rang out from the deepest, innermost
parts of every warrior’s heart, a voice that came from their very
essence, their bloodline.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Queen Mother’s
Incarnation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Queen Mother’s
Incarnation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Queen Mother’s
Incarnation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The voice echoed
repeatedly. The millions of fleeing horned warriors came to a halt at
the same moment. The voice that rang out in their heart had been
planted there on the day they were born! Every single warrior of the
Snaphorn world, in the moment of their birth, was prepared for
welcome the Queen Mother’s Incarnation. In fact, it could be said
that the ultimate purpose for them being born was to welcome the
Queen Mother’s Incarnation. This was the absolute most terrifying
ability available to the Snaphorn world when fighting against other
worlds!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Queen Mother.”
The millions of horned warriors all raised their heads upwards, their
foreheads splitting open as a streak of green light shot upwards from
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Millions of streaks of
light shot into the sky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a moment, a large
section of the infinite emptiness of the Void had actually
transformed into a field of green.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven mighty
Empyrean Gods stared at this in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…” Ning felt
something was off as well. The millions of horned warriors who had
been fleeing in panic had suddenly stopped? What were they doing?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The murmurs of the
millions of horned warriors could be heard everywhere. Underneath the
green light, their bodies began to dissolve, as though they were
providing nourishment for the green light. The green light grew even
brighter, and just like that…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The millions of horned
warriors all completely vanished, leaving behind nothing within the
Void save that enormous green glow. Within the green light, countless
murmurs could still be heard, the murmurs of the horned warriors…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Queen Mother.”
“Queen Mother.” “Queen Mother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was their most
glorious moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their murmurs were
filled with pride and veneration. They willingly sacrificed
everything for their Queen Mother and welcomed her Incarnation…and
so they died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The awe-inspiringly
enormous green glow in space split apart into three parts. The light
of these three enormous green glows began to condense, transforming
into three utterly enormous warriors with jade-green armor, curved
blood-red horns, and an appearance that was extremely close to that
of an ordinary Snaphorn warrior’s. However…their bodies were like
mountain ranges in size, and their auras were completely different.
Their auras were of chaos and utter savagery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the three titanic
warriors took form…the seven Empyrean Gods had a bad feeling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack. Join forces
to kill the closest one,” Empyrean God Redsnow ordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The millions of horned
warriors had been quite scattered, as some had fled very far away by
now. Thus, there was nearly a million kilometers of distance between
each of the three enormous horned warriors; the seven had more than
enough time to defeat them one by one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seven streaks of light
charged towards the closest titan warrior.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fiendgods of the
Three Realms…you seven Empyrean Gods, you actually dare to
challenge ME?” The titanic warrior let out a loud laugh, a laugh
which caused the Void itself to shudder. This was the Incarnation of
the first Queen Mother; it could be considered her clone or avatar!
There was an enormous price that had to be paid for the creation of
this sort of clone, a price of many hundreds of thousands of horned
warriors. In addition, this clone could only be maintained for a
short period of time. The Queen Mothers rarely chose this option.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And yet…though the
price was high, the combat power was utterly astonishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” The first
Queen Mother raised her four arms high. The arms were as thick as the
pillars that supported the heavens, and she slammed them down towards
the seven mighty Empyrean Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“WAAAAGH!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An ear-splitting scream
suddenly assaulted the first Queen Mother. The bald elder of the
seven had transformed into a giant, winged black crow. The crow let
out an ear-piercing screech, and the first Queen Mother’s clone
movements turned slow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“GO!” The child let
out an angry roar, hurling forth the neck-circlet he had been
holding. The neck-circlet transformed into a streak of golden light,
expanding at an explosive pace until it became thirty thousand meters
thick. It coiled itself around the first Queen Mother’s clone,
seeking to bind it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Battle had instantly
exploded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just watched as
the enormous black crow attacked and the child threw out his
neck-circlet. Next, a seemingly infinite amount of water and fire
descended which was no weaker than Solar Truefire or Lunar Truewater.
The fire and the water intermingled as they swirled around the first
Queen Mother, completely blocking off Ning’s field of vision,
making it so that he could no longer see what was happening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this is the might
of an Empyrean God?” Ning was completely stunned by what he saw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Void itself was
shaking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven Empyrean Gods
continued to battle viciously and savagely with the first Queen
Mother’s clone. Although Ning could no longer see the battle
clearly with his eyes, the powerful ripples that emanated from this
battle were enough to cause any and all Celestial Immortals to
perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seven Planets
Empyrean God Formation!” Suddenly, an angry roar rang out. Ning
could tell that this was senior Redsnow’s voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble the
formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“KILL!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hoarse voice, a
sinister voice, a crisp voice…several voices called out the word
‘kill’ at the same time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A streak of blinding
light appeared in the field of battle in the distant space of the
Void. The streak of light instantly pierced through this entire
region of space, then slowly dimmed. The fire and water had also
completely dissipated, allowing Ning to see what was happening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were two enormous
figures in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One was the Queen
Mother’s clone, many tens of thousands of meters tall, with
jade-green scales and a savage, brutal aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other was also many
tens of thousands of meters tall. He was dressed in rainbow-colored
armor, and he wielded a spear that was even taller than him. His
appearance looked rather similar to Empyrean God Redsnow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seven Planets
Empyrean God Formation?” Ning nodded when he saw this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This formation was an
ancient Fiendgod formation that could only be executed when seven
Empyrean Gods were joining forces! It merged the full power of all
seven Empyrean Gods together into a single Empyrean God who served as
the focus, resulting in an ‘Empyrean God of the Seven Planets’.
The Seven Planets Empyrean God who wielded the longstaff looked quite
similar to Empyrean God Redsnow; clearly, the core of this particular
formation was Redsnow, and everything was under his control.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are actually
able to injure me?” An enormous hole had appeared in the chest of
the first Queen Mother’s clone. It had been created by an earlier
thrust of the spear. The clone let out a loud laugh. “However…this
is nothing more than a clone created by my countless children’s
bodies. It’s useless; I have no weaknesses.” The hole in the
clone’s body almost completely healed over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big sister, it seems
like we have to help out, eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These Fiendgods of
the Three Realms aren’t easy to deal with.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other two Queen
Mother clones were charging over at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! The
Empyrean God of the Seven Planets continued to battle wildly against
the first Queen Mother’s clone. Although the clone was injured, the
injury was negligible. By now, the other two clones had also arrived,
and instantly all three began to assault the Empyrean God of the
Seven Planets in unison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Redhair, what should
we do? The clones of these three we are fighting are already so
strong; their true bodies are most likely at the Daofather level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The seven of us
joined together to transform into the Empyrean God of the Seven
Planets, but we still aren’t able to kill even their clones; in
fact, we aren’t even able to hold the upper hand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve never
encountered this sort of enemy before.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven Empyrean Gods
felt uneasy as well, because they were inexperienced in that they had
never encountered foes like this before. Although these foes had
appeared in that great, calamitous war all those eons ago, the seven
of them had been sent off by Daoist Threelives well in advance, and
so they didn’t participate in that war at all. Naturally, this
meant that they had no experience in that regard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Queen Mother
clones jointly assaulted the Empyrean God of the Seven Planets, which
used its longspear in unfathomably profound ways to defend. In fact,
within the surrounding voice, countless white snowflakes actually
began to appear, and even time itself began to grow disordered.
Within this region of fractured time, the spear-arts of the Empyrean
God of the Seven Planets grew even more terrifyingly powerful as they
completely blocked the assaults of the three Queen Mother clones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where did this
fellow come from?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s merely an
Empyrean God! Although there are seven of them fighting together…the
three of us, joined forces, are unable to kill him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems we need to
summon even more warriors.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have the Second Army
of the border armies come as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Queen Mothers
were growing frantic as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although their three
clones held the upper hand, their advantage wasn’t that huge. In
addition, the defensive power of that spear was simply too great;
although they were able to suppress their foe, they weren’t able to
actually injure him. In fact, it was the first Queen Mother who had
initially sustained some injuries!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can’t kill
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This probably isn’t
even the full power of the Snaphorn world. We can’t fight for too
long; we have to break out of this grand sealing formation and leave
this place immediately.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After battling for a
few moments, the seven Empyrean Gods immediately came to this
conclusion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rainbow-armored
Empyrean God of the Seven Planets suddenly lashed forward with his
spear, slamming it against the chest of one of the Queen Mother
clones, causing the Queen Mother to be knocked backwards by several
hundred meters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean God of the
Seven Planets sought to fly away!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fleeing?” One of
the other Queen Mother clones stretched out her four arms,
transforming them into countless streaks of formless green light that
instantly wrapped around the Empyrean God of the Seven Planets,
preventing them from taking even a single step further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, you seven
Empyrean Gods, you’ve already arrived at our Snaphorn world’s
territory…if we were to let you flee, just like that, how would I,
Woeslay, have any face left in the Primordial Ruinworld?” The first
Queen Mother clone, which had just trapped the Empyrean God of the
Seven Planets, let out a loud laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two other Queen
Mother clones came over to attack as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean God of the
Seven Planets spun its spear about to defend. Although it was
surrounded by green light, the green light would at most make it
slower; it was still more than capable of continuing to defend
itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Redhair, these three
old bastards of the Snaphorn world are clearly trying to buy time. I
trust that they are summoning even more forces from their Snaphorn
world so as to deal with us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can’t waste any
more time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have to leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not just the seven
Empyrean Gods; even Ning could tell that these three Queen Mother
clones of the Snaphorn world were intentionally trying to delay and
buy time. They all knew what was going on…but they were helpless to
stop it! The Empyrean God of the Seven Planets was capable of
protecting itself, but not of escaping. Ning, in turn, was completely
unqualified to participate in a battle of this level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior bear, where
did these seven seniors come from? They are in a dangerous situation
right now; do you have any method for saving them?” Ning was
frantic; his Primaltwin was currently querying the giant yellow bear,
but all the bear did was sigh. What could he possibly do?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But just as Ning was
panicking and as the Empyrean God of the Seven Planets was battling
against the three Queen Mother clones…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the distant Void, a
grayish-white vortex suddenly appeared, causing Ning to turn his head
to look at it. The battling Empyrean Gods and the three Queen Mother
clones also couldn’t help but notice the grayish-white vortex which
had suddenly appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A figure suddenly
emerged from the grayish-white vortex of the Void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was an old man with
a pristine white beard who was dressed in loose Daoist robes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“MASTER!” Ning
stared, wide-eyed.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_22___Subhuti"></A>
Chapter 22 - Subhuti
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who are you?” The
three Queen Mother clones all called out in unison. Looks of
vigilance were in their eyes. The way in which the old man dressed in
Daoist robes had appeared was simply too frightening! It must be
understood that most people would use special methods to tear through
space to teleport, but this old man had formed a spatial vortex
instead, creating a corridor for himself to easily pass through.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There had been nothing
flashy at all about it…this was something which the three Queen
Mothers wouldn’t be able to do, no matter how hard they tried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean God of the
Seven Planets looked towards the old man, but in its eyes was a look
of wild joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Subhuti came.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I knew it. With a
disciple as monstrously talented as this, Subhuti HAD to come rescue
him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, we’re
saved!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the calmest of the
seven Empyrean Gods, Empyrean God Redsnow, let out a sigh of relief.
None of them felt any doubt whatsoever as to whether or not Subhuti
was capable of rescuing them. After all…Subhuti stood at the very,
very top of the Three Realms, and was the most mysterious of
Daofathers. Even Daoist Threelives was quite lacking compared to him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the
territory of our Snaphorn world. We three sisters don’t wish to
become enemies with you.” The three Queen Mother clones stared
fixedly at the old man in the Daoist robes, paying no attention to
the Empyrean Gods next to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old man gave them a
glance, then said calmly, “Vile creatures!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the two words,
‘vile creatures’ came out, an invisible ripple instantly pierced
through the surrounding space, almost instantly arriving at the three
Queen Mother clones. In the area where the three Queen Mothers were
present, space and time began to twist, curve, and break apart. The
three Queen Mother clones let out enraged roars within that field of
shattered spacetime, and all the green light from their bodies surged
forth, attempting to break out. However…they were completely unable
to resist the field of shattered spacetime. Their three mighty clones
were completely shattered and destroyed along with the local
spacetime itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everything turned
silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only ones left in
the Void were Patriarch Subhuti, Ji Ning, and the Empyrean God of the
Seven Planets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…” Ning
couldn’t believe what he had just seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this is the power
of Patriarch Subhuti?” The seven Empyrean Gods were terrified as
well. It must be understood that Empyrean God Redsnow stood at the
very pinnacle of power amongst Empyrean Gods; in fact, he was
extremely close in power to an ordinary Daofather. When the seven of
them joined together into their Seven Planets Empyrean God Formation,
they could be considered to have just barely reached the Daofather
level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those three Queen
Mother clones had been comparable to them in strength…but all that
Patriarch Subhuti had done was say the words ‘vile creatures’,
and an invisible ripple of power had instantly slaughtered those
three clones without damaging the seven Empyrean Gods in the
slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An ability like this,
finesse like this…they felt utterly amazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Subhuti truly is
Subhuti, the most mysterious Daofather of the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He really is
powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Utterly terrifying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven mighty
Empyrean Gods were completely stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Subhuti was
too mysterious a figure; he rarely showed his power within the Three
Realms, and these seven Empyrean Gods had never seen him strike! They
had only heard from their former Godking, ‘Daoist Threelives’,
that Patriarch Subhuti was very strong, even stronger than Daoist
Threelives himself. As for how much stronger…very few in the Three
Realms knew the answer to that question. The number one impression
which the countless experts of the Three Realms had of Patriarch
Subhuti could be summarized in one word; ‘mysterious’!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just look at the
Crescent major world he had created! Without Patriarch Subhuti’s
permission, nobody could even find it! This ability alone was utterly
inconceivable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, the person
who had undergone the greatest emotional turmoil just now was
actually Subhuti’s disciple, Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had felt despair
upon being trapped, had quietly waited and fought for eighteen years,
felt utter despair again upon being captured alive, felt shocked and
overjoyed at the appearance of the seven Empyrean Gods, once more
felt despair upon seeing how powerful the three Queen Mother clones
were…and now, his master had appeared, said the words ‘vile
creatures’, and completely killed all three Queen Mother clones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact…in his heart,
Ning felt as though the entire universe had suddenly changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Void remained the
Void…but Ning now felt that the Void was a beautiful, beautiful
place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Respectful greetings
to you, Old Patriarch.” The Empyrean God of the Seven Planets broke
apart into seven Empyrean Gods, all of whom spoke out respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not bad.”
Patriarch Subhuti lightly nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven Empyrean Gods
felt a joyful feeling in their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They understood the
true meaning behind Patriarch Subhuti saying the words, ‘not bad’.
Per Daoist Threelives’ orders, if his heir had not reached the
Empyrean God level, the seven of them didn’t have to care about
whether or not his heir lived or died. However, as Patriarch Subhuti
saw it, Ji Ning was his own disciple as well as Threelives’; thus,
Subhuti felt quite pleased that the seven of them had chosen to come
out and protect Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciple.”
Patriarch Subhuti looked towards Ning. He took a single step forward,
displacing himself through space and appearing before Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Ning
hurriedly called out to him with respect, tears having appeared in
his eyes. “Thank you, Master…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” Subhuti
laughed. “Come. It’s time to go back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded heavily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why haven’t the
seven of you returned yet?” Subhuti glanced backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven Empyrean Gods
hurriedly flew over. They first saluted towards Subhuti respectfully,
and then they disappeared into nowhere. Clearly, they had returned to
the Starseizing Manor…but the ‘master’ of the manor, Ji Ning,
didn’t feel a thing. Clearly…he had yet to fully master this
Starseizing Manor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised his head,
giving the infinite Void a final glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This Nihilum Zone…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had proven to be a
testing ground for him. In this place, he had first overcome the
karmic sinflames, had reached the ‘ruler’ level in heartforce,
had come up with a way to apply heartforce to his sword-fingers, and
had mastered a tiny amount of swordforce…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortune and disaster
often came hand-in-hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. That spatial
vortex once more appeared next to Patriarch Subhuti, looking just
like an oceanic whirlpool. Patriarch Subhuti guided Ning into the
spatial vortex…and then it all completely disappeared from the
Nihilum Zone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Primordial
Ruinworld. The Snaphorn world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a field of
endless darkness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three minds were
conversing with each other…and their thoughts were full of terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who was that old
man?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve never seen
him before. We didn’t even see him in that great war, all those
years ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we had
encountered him in that war, we probably would’ve died long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“By the looks of him,
he appears to be one of the humans of the Three Realms. From the fact
that he attacked us, we can tell that he should belong to the side of
the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Logically speaking,
it should be impossible to teleport through the space of the Nihilum
Zone…but he was able to do it! And in addition, he was able to
annihilate our three clones simply through his mastery over
spacetime. Abilities like these are utterly inconceivable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Queen Mothers
were all restless and uneasy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had been too
powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His power had
completely eclipsed theirs. In that great war, the three of them had
been small-time players; they had only survived due to luck. Any one
of the truly powerful figures of that great war could’ve crushed
them to death with ease. Clearly, this old man was comparable to one
of those truly powerful figures! A supreme power who was capable of
impacting the entire course of that war!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder if that old
man of the Three Realms has left or not.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope he leaves
right away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope he never
comes to our Snaphorn world again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Queen Mothers
conversed hopefully to each other, their courage having been
completely shattered by the two words ‘vile creatures’. All they
wanted right now was to never encounter that old man again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What the…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh no!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s here!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Queen Mothers
had covered the entire Snaphorn world with their minds long ago. They
kept an extremely tight level of control over the world, and so if
any powerful figure intruded within it, they would immediately
notice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Snaphorn world was
located at the margins of the infinitely vast Primordial Ruinworld.
It was a world in its own right and was extremely vast. There were
countless horned warriors who lived in this place….but at this
moment, all of them could sense their entire world shaking. The
ground itself was trembling, and the mountains were beginning to
collapse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is going on?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless horned
warriors raised their heads to stare towards the skies. Some of these
Snaphorn citizens were merely youths, not yet qualified to join the
army; they had to reach at least the most basic level, the
Earth-level, before they could become warriors. At this moment, every
single person in the entire world, including the Elders of the Palace
of Elders as well as every single army squad were staring at the
skies with raised heads.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From beyond the
Snaphorn world…a single, utterly gigantic palm had appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This palm was nearly
half as large as the entire Snaphorn world itself. When it slapped
downwards through the Void of space towards the Snaphorn world…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crackle, crackle,
crackle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The protective
formations covering the Snaphorn world began to crack apart, and even
spacetime itself was compressed so tightly that it began to shatter.
And the strangest thing was…spacetime within the Snaphorn world
began to compress into multiple layers of density, and the layers of
spacetime came crashing downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the palm came
slamming down, the layers of spacetime began to split apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“FLEE!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three utterly enormous
creatures had suddenly charged out from deep within the Snaphorn
world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They, too, had
incomparably massive bodies with pitch-black scales, but compared to
the ordinary horned warriors, they were were much, much fatter. At
first glance…one would see that their bellies took up nearly half
the size of their entire bodies. Their ugly little eyes emitted rays
of dark light that attempted to tear a hole through space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That enormous palm
continued to descend, causing spacetime to continue to compress and
shatter apart, layer by layer. The spacetime at the very bottom had
become incredibly dense, making it so that the three mighty Queen
Mothers were completely unable to tear a rift through space and flee,
no matter how they tried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spare us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spare us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spare us!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All three Queen Mothers
called out loudly, their voices reverberating through the entire
Snaphorn world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But that massive palm
continued to coldly, emotionlessly continue its downward smash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…” The
countless horned warriors were all completely stunned. They felt
terror, a terror that came from their very souls. This was all
completely beyond their expectations. That giant palm which they
could see with the naked eye…it was a palm of infinite size, a palm
that was more than half as large as their entire world itself. Even
if Ning were to use his [Torch-Dragon’s Eye], he still would find
it hard to see the complete palm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They could see the
massive, canyon-like fingerprints and palm-print of that mighty palm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG! BANG! BANG! An
incredible amount of pressure had already been brought down to bear.
The countless horned warriors of the Snaphorn world began to explode
into green-colored bits of blood and gore. Only a very small number
of violet-caped warriors and golden-caped warriors were able to just
barely stay alive…but their bodies were also slowly beginning to
crack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old bastard…are
you trying to start another war?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn you, you old
bastard!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Asking for mercy was
useless. The three Queen Mothers went mad, beginning to curse in
utter despair, using every imprecation in the book. They weren’t
even able to flee…all they could do was face this terrifying palm
as it came down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG! BANG! BANG! The
palm had yet to make contact, but the pressured, fractured spacetime
that came before it had caused the bodies of even the golden-caped
warriors to completely blow apart. The only ones left within the
Snaphorn world were those three mighty Queen Mothers. Their hideous
bodies began to crack as well. Slowly, the cracks grew larger and
larger, and the three Queen Mothers began to curse and scream in an
even louder manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally…it all came
to an end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Queen Mothers
had been completely blown apart, having transformed into dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant palm finally
came to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An ancient voice rang
out. “Start another war? Nothing more than three little worms!”
And then…the enormous palm completely vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everything turned
silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire Snaphorn
world…had become transformed into a massive planetary basin with a
giant, palm-shaped impression caved into it.1

Chapter 23 - The Return
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were white clouds
in the skies. A spatial vortex suddenly appeared within them,
followed by an old man in Daoist robes emerging alongside a youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning looked
downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He immediately saw
Mount Innerheart…and he was even able to see the many disciples of
the Mount Innerheart League, living their peaceful lives there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
Subhuti led Ning in flying downwards. They quickly arrived at the
most central area of Mount Innerheart - the Tristar Crescent Abode,
that seemingly ordinary-looking Daoist monastery. This was the place
where Patriarch Subhuti normally trained in; disciples like Ning and
the others wouldn’t dare to go disturb him without cause.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Daoist
monastery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti landed, then
took a high seat in the lotus position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning respectfully
bowed. “If it hadn’t been for your aid, Master, your disciple
would have most likely never been able to return to the Three Realms.
Your disciple feels ashamed for having forced you to exert yourself,
Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti laughed. “Sit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning selected a prayer
mat and sat down beneath him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How did the karmic
sinflames taste?” Subhuti asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t wish to
experience them again,” Ning said. “The karmic sinflames are now
ever-present around me. Although the burning sensation is agonizing…I
can endure it. The descent of the karmic sinflames…although it was
a tribulation for me, I gained quite a bit from it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fortune and calamity
ride together,” Subhuti said with a laugh. “What level has your
heartforce reached?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The third level,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti nodded and
smiled. “I noticed that when you were fighting those aliens, your
application of heartforce through your sword-fingers had reached a
level where none of it leaked out whatsoever. It seems you’ve also
developed an actual technique for applying heartforce through your
fingers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I did indeed learn a
few things from my eighteen years of battle,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you know why
those aliens did not kill you, and instead chose to battle with you
for eighteen years?” Subhuti asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled. He
shook his head. “Those aliens said that they were going to use me
for target practice to train their warriors, but…I keep on having
the feeling that this was perhaps not the actual reason.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti nodded gently.
“Your feelings were correct. You are in control of heartforce, and
also know a way to apply it. Heartforce…it is an extremely
mysterious type of power, one which even True Gods and Daofathers
ponder on. There are five levels of heartforce. Although it is very
weak in the early stages, as you go farther along this path and rise
in levels, it will undergo an utterly earth-shaking transformation!
The third level of heartforce is already quite astonishing. By using
your third level heartforce, you have already reached the minimum
threshold of an Empyrean God in power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood this to
be true.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first level was
fairly weak; the amount of benefit it brought was almost negligible.
The second level represented a clear, explosive increase in power…and
the third level allowed one’s previous level of power to
skyrocketed. The fourth level was the level of the most powerful
divine archers of the Three Realms, and as for the fifth level…it
was the level of the long-vanished Houyi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heartforce is very
powerful. If you can reach the fifth level, then even as a mere
Empyrean God, you would have the combat power of a Daofather or a
True God.” Subhuti looked at Ning. “The peak power of heartforce
is far greater than your [Starseizing Hand]. You must not be lazy in
making use of your talent for heartforce.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple
understands.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But how could the fifth
level of heartforce be so easily accomplished?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only one who was
publicly known within the Three Realms to have reached this level was
Houyi. Perhaps some supreme Daofathers or True Gods might have
secretly reached this level without telling anyone or using it…but
still, one could clearly tell that reaching the fifth level was
unbelievably hard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The reason why the
aliens of the Snaphorn world did not kill you was precisely because
the mind and thought-strands of the masters of the Snaphorn world had
descended upon the bodies of those warriors. Through battling with
you repeatedly, they would be able to sense the ripples of your
application of heartforce in detail, and thus be able to develop a
heartforce technique,” Subhuti said. “I imagine that the past
eighteen years have brought insights to the owner of the Snaphorn
world! Heartforce…it is a technique which is unique to our Three
Realms. It absolutely cannot be taught to outsiders.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They have insights
into it? It can’t be taught to outsiders?” Ning was shocked. “I…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already
annihilated the entire Snaphorn world, and the masters of the
Snaphorn world are dead. Even if they did come up with a bit of
information on heartforce, it is of no use now,” Subhuti said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a sigh of
relief…and then stared in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Snaphorn world had
been annihilated?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This entire time, from
rescuing him to bringing him back to Mount Innerheart, his master had
been by his side. Somehow, without Ning even having the faintest clue
about it, he had annihilated the entire Snaphorn world, including
even its masters? Ning had been able to tell from the battle between
the seven Empyrean Gods and the three Queen Mother clones that the
masters of the Snaphorn world had to be very strong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My master truly is
unfathomable,” Ning secretly mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. That
Dao-companion of yours, that Yu Wei,” Subhuti said, “She’s
already overcome her tribulation and become a Celestial Immortal. Did
you know about this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister became a Celestial Immortal?” Ning was both
delighted and surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was surprised
because his senior apprentice-sister had actually become a Celestial
Immortal before him. Before she had left to go accompany Patriarch
Lu, her power as displayed within the Conclave of Immortal Destiny
hadn’t been particularly eye-catching. Who would’ve thought that
in just a few short decades, she would’ve become a Celestial
Immortal, even before Ning himself had?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When is your
Primaltwin going to undergo the Celestial Tribulation?” Subhuti
asked. The questions which any master cared the most about were
naturally the ones related to the disciple’s tribulation. This was
the most difficult calamity for any Immortal cultivator to face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very soon,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You need to ponder
on the application of heartforce to your Immortal swords,” Subhuti
said. “Your experiences and background are all quite extraordinary.
Even though your Primaltwin is a Ki Refiner…the power of this
tribulation will definitely be significant. If you can completely
apply your heartforce to your Immortal swords, your power shall be
greatly improved. I trust that your chances of overcoming your
tribulation shall thus be much greater. The technique you’ve
developed during the past eighteen years is for applying heartforce
to your sword-fingers. There isn’t a huge difference between your
sword-fingers and your swords…I trust you can make it work.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning
understood that his master was expressing concern and care for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And indeed…his
Primaltwin could also use heartforce when executing the [Greater
Thousand Swords Formation], at which point his power would rise by a
shocking amount. This would indeed give him a much better chance at
overcoming his tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple shall
definitely first develop a way to apply heartforce through physical
swords before attempting the tribulation,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for your true
body…ideally, you should only attempt the tribulation to become an
Empyrean God after you have completely mastered the Grand Dao of the
Sword,” Subhuti added.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Complete mastery?”
Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he was at a
very high level in the Dao of the Sword, he was still quite a ways
off from completely mastering it. In addition…generally speaking,
the closer one was to mastery, the harder it would be to break
through the next bottleneck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are capable of
wielding swordforce; it can be said that you have already touched
upon what the essence of the sword is. You should be completely
capable of mastering the Dao of the Sword at the void-level, which
will give you a decent chance.” Subhuti looked solemnly at Ning.
“I’m not too worried about your Primaltwin’s tribulation. But
your true body’s tribulation…you have to be careful, careful,
careful!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt pressure as
well. He nodded lightly. Right…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon returning to the
Three Realms, Ning’s subconscious premonitions had grown strong
once again. Just discussing his true body’s tribulation instantly
caused Ning to feel nervousness in his heart. He knew that this was
Fate’s way of warning him in secret. The Three Realms occasionally
gave birth to truly peerless, monstrous geniuses who were blessed by
the distilled virtues of the universe, but the more of a genius one
was, the more terrifying one’s Celestial Tribulation would be. If
he could overcome it, he would soar to the heavens in a single leap,
becoming a mover and shaker of the Three Realms. But…the vast
majority would end up perishing to the Celestial Tribulation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little bear!”
Subhuti suddenly called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
suddenly appeared next to Ning. The giant yellow bear respectfully
fell to his knees and said, “This little bear greets you,
Daofather.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let the other seven
come out,” Subhuti instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The giant
yellow bear didn’t dare to disobey.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart
clenched. Ning was extremely curious about those seven Empyrean Gods;
after all, back in the Wargod Hall of the underwater estate, it had
been a clone of Empyrean God Redsnow, formed from a drop of Redsnow’s
blood, who had served to test Ning. In addition, when he encountered
danger just now, it had been the seven of them who had intervened to
rescue him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seven figures appeared
out of nowhere, all in human form. In truth…they had all changed
their appearances; after all, as Fiendgods, their true forms were
quite enormous. They all looked quite odd, but Pangu, Nuwa, and many
other supreme powers all looked quite humanoid, which was why
Fiendgods like to take on the appearance of humans. In fact…in
secret, many Fiendgods speculated that the reason why humans had such
astonishing potential was because Nuwa had used ‘Pangu’ as the
blueprint for creating humanity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings to you,
Old Patriarch.” All seven Empyrean Gods saluted reverently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Old
Patriarch, for saving our lives.” Empyrean God Redsnow was the
first to respectfully offer his thanks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if I hadn’t
gone, you would’ve been able to stay alive,” Subhuti said with a
laugh. “You could’ve simply returned to the Starseizing Manor and
your own world within it, bringing Ji Ning inside and hiding him
within it. In a true battle, you wouldn’t be able to defeat the
Snaphorn world, but if you were to rely on the formations protecting
your own world, you would’ve been able to withstand them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But the three of
them were Daofathers…” Empyrean God Redsnow was amazed. The other
six Empyrean Gods were amazed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Returning to the world
of Threelives and relying on its formations to resist the foes; this
was their final option. However…Daofathers had utterly astonishing
levels of power. In addition, there were three of them this time!
They didn’t believe they had the power to fight back against such a
force.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…given who
Patriarch Subhuti was, if he said they could do it, he definitely had
a reason for saying so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three Daofathers?
You give too much credit to those three little worms.” Subhuti
shook his head. “Those creatures are not of the Three Realms, and
you know nothing at all about them; they simply cannot be judged so
easily, just by using the power levels of the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All seven Empyrean Gods
were now curious, as was Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the Snaphorn
world, there were a total of eighteen golden-caped warriors; in your
eyes, you viewed them as being eighteen Empyrean Gods, yes?”
Patriarch Subhuti explained, “But in reality, all of the horned
warriors of that race have a weakness; once the cores in their body
are destroyed, they will die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Consider the
Immortals of our Three Realms. Although their physical bodies are
fairly weak, they can control magic treasures at a long distance.
There’s no need for them to fight in close combat as well. As for
the Empyrean Gods and True Gods who do fight in close combat…they
have no weaknesses at all,” Subhuti said. “These aliens, however,
are only capable of close combat, and they all have a weakness; the
core.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for those three
little worms…their true combat power wasn’t that formidable. They
were merely at the peak of the Empyrean God level. Their strength
lies in giving birth; their childbearing abilities are quite
astonishing.” Subhuti sighed. “During that great, calamitous
war…there were more than ten thousand of those little worms. They
gave birth to countless warriors, all of whom were able to fuse
together into one body…you’d kill one batch and another would
come. Under the control of their master, those myriad little worms
caused the Three Realms to suffer heavy casualties.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said, stunned,
“More than ten thousand? Master…did you just say they have a
‘master’?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What in the world had
happened during that great war?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These little worms
shared a common master,” Subhuti sighed. “A person who was far
more powerful than even myself. Only Maiden Nuwa was able to suppress
him. Fortunately…that demon has long since perished.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Redsnow…you are
just one step away from becoming a True God and having a Daofather’s
power. Train hard and reach that level as soon as you can.” Subhuti
looked towards Empyrean God Redsnow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Redsnow
understands,” the Empyrean God said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine you and
Ning have some things to say to each other.” Subhuti chuckled.
“Alright…you can all go back to the world of the Grand Xia now.
If you want to chat, go ahead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti waved his hand,
and yet another spatial vortex appeared in front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning bowed
respectfully, as did the seven Empyrean Gods, and then they all
entered the spatial vortex. They departed from Mount Innerheart,
heading back to the world of the Grand Xia.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Golden Crow hung

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A youth appeared in the

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A depressed-looking
gray-robed youth, an azure-robed maiden, and a giant, snowy-white dog
all suddenly appeared out of nowhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother?” The gray-robed youth, Mu northson, stared at
the distant Ji Ning in disbelief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I told you that
Master was back, but you didn’t believe it. I’m Master’s
spirit-beast; how could my senses be off?” Little Qing charged
towards Ning excitedly, transforming into an azure serpent
mid-flight, then wrapping herself around Ning’s arm. The little
azure serpentine head nuzzled Ning’s arm in a very friendly manner.
“Master, I nearly died of worry for you over these recent years.
You finally came back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s right hand
gently patted the little azure serpent’s head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s good that you
are back.” Uncle White didn’t say much, but his eyes were filled
with joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, it was all my…” Northson stared at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, over the past
eighteen years, Ning had been deeply worried about Northson’s
situation. This was because, prior to Ning’s battle with the
Youngflame clan, Northson had been tormented for decades, followed by
the loss of his Dao-companion. With Ning himself being exiled to a
danger zone while covered by karmic sinflames…he was afraid that
his junior apprentice-brother Northson would be filled with
self-recrimination. Given his junior apprentice-brother’s current
state…Ning was worried about what so many years of self-blame would
result in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although his junior
apprentice-brother had more white hair than he had in the past, he
was still alive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It isn’t your
fault. If I have to blame someone, I’d blame myself for being too
arrogant and underestimating the Youngflame clan.” Ning walked over
through the air, gently patting his junior apprentice-brother on the
shoulder. “In addition…the feud between myself and the Youngflame
clan is a huge one. There’s no need for you to shoulder all the
blame in such a narcissistic way.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northson couldn’t
help but chuckle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, where have
you been? We were worried to death!” Little Qing raised her head,
looking towards Ning. Northson and Uncle White looked at him as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That year…I was
exiled by the Youngflame clan into a dangerous area in the infinite
Void outside of the Three Realms,” Ning said. “I was trapped
there for the past eighteen years, and was only able to return
today.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So you were were
just trapped in a danger zone this entire time. I was worried that
you must’ve been undergoing countless dangers and trials,” Little
Qing said with a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who else have you
spoken to about me?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Uncle White responded,
“We’ve only informed Immortal Diancai. However, because all of us
live here on Brightheart Island, and because Little Qing and Mu
Northson found it hard to hide their grief and the worry they felt
for you…Autumn Leaf eventually found out as well. Also…your
Dao-companion, Yu Wei; when she came back to the world of the Grand
Xia, she was already aware of what had happened to you. It should’ve
been her master, Patriarch Lu, who told her.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned. In truth,
he hadn’t wanted Autumn Leaf or Yu Wei to know about this affair;
after all, if they had found out, they would’ve been extremely
worried for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me go see Autumn
Leaf,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go,” Uncle White
said. “In recent years, Autumn Leaf will go to your bedroom, your
study, and your training room every single day and spend some time
there. I can tell that this little girl’s mind is completely
preoccupied with you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded gently. His
eyes began to blaze with torch-light as he glanced towards
Brightheart Island…and thus he saw Autumn Leaf.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a study.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf was
carefully wiping the table clean with her hands. Actually, because of
a formation present, there was no dust on the table whatsoever.
However, whenever she touched the table, she couldn’t help but
think back to those scenes from long ago, when she would grind ink
for Ning as he wrote calligraphy within this study.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, when
will you come back?” Autumn Leaf’s eyes shimmered with tears. She
stared at the chair, the chair which Ning normally sat in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had been so long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She had waited so, so
long. Even the young master had disappeared for thirty-plus years
last time when he had gone to study the Dao with his master, she
hadn’t felt the years as keenly as she did this time. After all,
last time she knew in her heart that he had gone to study the Dao.
This time, however, she knew that her young master was actually in
some sort of danger zone which he could die in at any moment. In this
sort of an environment, every day felt as long as a year. It had been
very hard to endure this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a child, she had
been sold off as a slave. In the end, she had entered the Ji clan and
became a maidservant that was assigned to wait upon Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since she was
young, that tiny little boy had become her everything, her heaven and
her earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Spring Grass had her
father to worry about, but Autumn Leaf had lost her kinsmen long ago.
She had only one loved one left…her young master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She had watched as her
young master, that tiny little baby, had grown up step by step. She
had followed him in roaming the Eastmount Marsh, had followed him
until he had embarked upon the Immortal path and headed to Stillwater
City. By then…she no longer had the power to help take care of her
young master. If she accompanied him, she would only slow him down.
She didn’t complain at all; she willingly stayed here at
Brightheart Island, quietly awaiting her young master’s return.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The days when he
returned were her happiest days.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The days when he didn’t
return, she would wait quietly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But this time…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her young master might
never again return.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Creaaaak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, the door to
the study swung open. Autumn Leaf’s body trembled, and she
hurriedly turned her head to look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a youth
standing in the doorway. He was still dressed in those furs, and he
still had that familiar, warm smile on his face. “Elder sister
Autumn Leaf!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master!”
Autumn Leaf charged forward excitedly, but when she reached Ning, she
hesitated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, reached
out to take her into his arms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only after hugging for
a long, long moment did Autumn Leaf finally calm down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder sister Autumn
Leaf, the snow is beautiful outside. Let’s go look at the snow,”
Ning said. Towards Autumn Leaf…Ning felt very special, unique
feelings. She had taken care of him since he was a child, and they
had grown up together. In his heart, Autumn Leaf was family, just
like his parents or a true sibling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His parents had
perished. The only family he had left was Autumn Leaf and Uncle
White.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf, in his
heart, was his older sister, his most beloved older sister.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Uncle White was a
senior, a senior who had always quietly watched out for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning would be reserved
with his affections when he was with other women, but with Autumn
Leaf…even if they hugged, it was the hug of siblings. It was a
warm, wonderful feeling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The snow?” Autumn
Leaf nodded repeatedly. “Okay. Let’s go look at the snow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Brightheart Island was
Ning’s home. Autumn Leaf had naturally taken wonderful care of it.
Brightheart Island was a beautifully scenic place to begin with; now,
with so much snow on the ground, it was a place of truly incredible
beauty, the likes of which were rarely seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, it wasn’t
until the sun was starting to go down that Ning finally said, “Elder
sister Autumn Leaf, I need to make a trip to Stillwater City. I
haven’t told my master that I’m back yet, nor have I told my
senior apprentice-sister.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Autumn Leaf
smiled. “Your master and your Dao-companion have probably been
worried sick about you as well, all these years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Only now
did Ning ascend into the clouds, flying off into the sky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf raised her
head, watching as Ning left, a look of satisfaction in her eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her young master was
safe. Even if he wasn’t by her side…she still felt at peace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The underwater estate.
The main palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
looked at the giant yellow bear and the seven Empyrean Gods before
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior bear, it’s
time to tell me some things, yes?” The black-robed Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine you
must’ve guessed some of it.” The giant bear nodded. “Let me
make some introductions first. These seven…are seven Empyrean Gods
that had been under the command of my master, Daoist Threelives.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seven Empyrean Gods?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning had
suspected it all along, he still couldn’t help but feel stunned
upon hearing it. These weren’t like those many warriors of the
Snaphorn world, each of whom had obvious weaknesses; these were true
Fiendgods, born of Heaven and Earth, each of whom had utterly
astonishing power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is Empyrean God
Ninefang.” The giant bear pointed towards the bald elder, who
cracked his lips in a smile towards Ning. “Young master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be deceived
by this old bastard; he’s the most sinister of us all,” the
white-eyebrowed beauty next to him said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Did you just call me
an ‘old bastard’? What, are you saying you are younger than me?”
The bald elder snapped at her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant bear laughed,
then pointed at the woman. “This is Empyrean God Snow Scorpion;
she’s the straightforward type.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
Snow Scorpion smiled merrily as she looked at Ning. “Hurry up and
train hard. Overcome your tribulation, and become an Empyrean God; by
then, we’ll be able to accompany you in roaming the universe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next, the giant bear
pointed towards the harmless, amiable-looking youth. “This is
Empyrean God Dovesnake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empyrean God
Dovesnake?” Ning was amazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dovesnake was a true
Godbeast that had been born in the primordial Pangu’s World. He was
a truly venomous Godbeast! For such a venomous Godbeast to actually
look so gentle in human form…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And these two…”
The giant bear pointed at the two most muscular men, one
savage-looking and red-skinned, the other icy-looking and
black-skinned. “Long ago, in Pangu’s World, a pair of Fiendgods
were born. These Fiendgods were twins that were born at the same
time, one from the blazing truefire of the Sun and one from the dark
truewater of the Moon. No matter who they fight against, they always
fight together. They are known as Empyrean God Sunblaze and Empyrean
God Darkmoon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
Both looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning secretly sighed to
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These Fiendgods had
been alive since the Primordial Era. Clearly, they were born in the
era of Pangu’s World, and they each had extraordinary backgrounds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This one,” the
giant bear said, pointing at the child wearing a neck-circlet, “Was
the first to accompany Master, back in the most early, desolate days
of the primordial Pangu’s World. He is Master’s adopted son, and
his name is Empyrean God Primelight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Long ago, I wished
to learn the [Starseizing Hand] from Father, but alas…I was born as
a Void-level Fiendgod; there was no way for me to learn it.” The
child laughed as he looked at Ning. “Father’s [Starseizing Hand]
finally has an heir. You need to train hard. Become an Empyrean God
as soon as you can!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant bear finally
pointed at the last man, Redsnow. “You already know Empyrean God
Redsnow. He was the most valiant Empyrean God under Master’s
command, and the most powerful of them all. Amongst Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals…there are few who are stronger than him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard Master say
earlier that senior Redsnow is just a single step away from becoming
a True God,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas, that step
isn’t so easily taken.” Empyrean God Redsnow smiled as he looked
at Ning. “However, Ji Ning…last time I saw you, I was worried
about whether or not you’d be able to convince everyone to follow
you. Don’t be fooled by how courteous they are all behaving; in
reality, they are all incredibly proud figures. However, in the
Nihilum Zone…you survived karmic sinflames and advanced your
heartforce to the third level. You even developed a way to apply
heartforce and, despite not reaching mastery in the Dao of the Sword,
managed to take control over a sliver of swordforce. Even I have to
feel admiration for you. The other six are convinced by you; they are
simply waiting for you to become an Empyrean God. You heard it
yourself; just now, they all addressed you as ‘young master’.”

Chapter 25 - A Promise
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our young master is
a Void-level Fiendgod who is extremely close to the Empyrean God
level.” Snow Scorpion let out an emotional sigh. “If the Godking
was here and knew that he had a disciple like this…he would
probably be very happy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Godking…”
Redsnow’s gaze grew distant and dreamy. The others fell silent as
well. They were the most loyal followers of Daoist Threelives; if
they weren’t, they wouldn’t have waited here silently within the
underwater estate despite the passage of countless years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
said, puzzled, “Seniors…you said ‘young master’? I don’t
really understand. Also…can it be that you’ve been within the
underwater estate this entire time, which is why you were able to
emerge even when I was in the Nihilum Zone?” Although Ning had been
able to guess a bit from their words and knew himself to be Daoist
Threelives’ successor, he was still quite mystified about all the
rest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me explain.” A
clear voice rang out; it was the child, who looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empyrean God
Primelight,” Ning addressed him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can just call me
Primelight.” The child laughed, “I know that you have many
questions in your heart. Let me explain it all as simply as I can.
Father was born a True God of Primordial Chaos, from within the
primordial chaos of the universe itself. He was born with tremendous
power. After Pangu established the universe, many Fiendgods were
born. Fiendgods innately love to fight, and so their wars stretched
throughout the entire Primordial World.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Supreme powers like
Patriarch Subhuti are transcendent. They secluded themselves, rarely
taking part in these wars. Father, however, loved to do battle; he
naturally collected a large number of Fiendgods into his fold, within
the Starseizing Manor. In the primordial Pangu’s World, the
Starseizing Manor was quite famous!” The child continued, “The
forces held within the Starseizing Manor included many Fiendgods, all
of whom submitted to Father’s command. The seven of us also
belonged to the Starseizing Manor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded lightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The primordial
Pangu’s World underwent countless storms and many tribulations, but
it passed through all of them safely. But that final war…the war
that shattered the primordial world…the war in which Father passed
away…was completely different from all the ones that came before.”
A sharp look was in the child’s eyes, a killing look. He was a
Fiendgod who had been born of Heaven and Earth…but Threelives, he
had been a True God who had been born from the primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This pair of father and
son…they were closer to each other than many biological pairs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For so many years, he
had no idea that Threelives had perished…it wasn’t until the
giant yellow bear had received this information from Patriarch
Subhuti that these Empyrean Gods had learned of it. For countless
years, he had hoped that he would be able to see his father again,
alive and well…but word of his father’s death had caused him to
feel despair. It had also filled with fiery rage. He wanted to go do
battle. He wanted to take revenge! But he realized that for now…he
wasn’t strong enough yet!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We aren’t sure
either what exactly happened during that war; after all, we didn’t
take part in it. All we know is that Father was firm in his decision
to follow Maiden Nuwa, and that he stood by her side in that war,”
the child said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He followed Maiden
Nuwa?” Ning quietly memorized this fact.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nuwa was the number one
figure of the entire Three Realms. She had reached Pangu’s level!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Could it be that this
war was a factional war?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Maiden Nuwa was of one
faction…were there other factions? Ning knew very well that
sometimes a civil war could be far more savage and deadly than a war
against an outside invader.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Maiden Nuwa was
unable to protect us. Father followed her lead, and so prior to that
battle, Maiden Nuwa helped us plot a path of retreat,” the child
said. “Father expended an enormous amount of effort into this
estate-treasure that you’ve acquired. In addition, Maiden Nuwa
transferred into and established a wide world within this estate.
This world, we refer to as the ‘Starseizer’ major world. This is
the place where we live.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? The underwater
estate has a major world inside it?!” Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But although he was
stunned…he quickly recovered and understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It made sense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the precious
Protocosmic spirit-treasures of the Three Realms innately contained a
major world within them! As for treasures that were forged to contain
a major world within them…most True Gods or Daofathers weren’t
capable of creating them, but Maiden Nuwa was. In fact, she had done
created more than one! The major worlds that were contained within
magic treasures were generally referred to as ‘caveworlds’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We all knew that
Father was going to search for a successor; he was unwilling to allow
his divine ability, the [Starseizing Hand], be lost,” the child
said. “Father was powerful enough to be able to command all the
forces of the Starseizing Manor…but would his successor be able to?
Nobody could say, and so Father didn’t force all of those Fiendgods
to stay here to accompany the next master. Those who were willing to
stay could stay; those who were unwilling could leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Some of the
Fiendgods left, but we continued to stay here at the Starseizer
world,” the child said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve been
waiting. Waiting for Father’s successor. Waiting for the new master
of our Starseizing Manor.” The child looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other Empyrean Gods
also looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In their hearts…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was the perfect
candidate! The best candidate!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning’s blood
was pumping, he quickly calmed down. “Can you tell me about the
Starseizer major world? Can anyone enter it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” The nearby
Snow Scorpion smiled merrily. “The Starseizer major world was
established by Maiden Nuwa, and she was the one to set up the
formations around it. Even True Gods or Daofathers would have to
resort to brute force to enter it! When we left the Starseizing
Manor, we used the formations we controlled to allow us out, but once
we left it, we would be unable to locate the Starseizer world again
right away; after all, the Starseizer world is inside the Starseizing
Manor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is in control of
the formations?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Myself, Primelight,
and Snow Scorpion,” Empyrean God Redsnow said. “Primelight was
the first to follow the Godking and the Godking’s son; the Godking
trusted him! Snow Scorpion and myself, in the past, had followed the
Godking in his campaigns throughout the world, and we were two of the
most powerful Empyrean Gods under his command; the others would
submit to us. Thus, the three of us took control over the formations
that protect the entire world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know that my
master, Daoist Threelives, had ordered that before I became an
Empyrean God, there was no need for you to worry about my life,
right?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Empyrean
God Redsnow nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…you saved me
in the Nihilum Zone,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if we didn’t
save you, the Starseizing Manor would’ve fallen into the hands of
the masters of the Snaphorn world. They probably would’ve been able
to forcibly bind it and discover the Starseizer major world, at which
point we would still have to fight them. Since that was the case…the
seven of us came out,” Redsnow explained. “It wasn’t all
because of you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “But
since you’ve come out…seniors, the Three Realms are currently on
the precipice of a major storm, one which isn’t any weaker than the
storm which destroyed the Primordial World. Even my master said that
he might perish in this storm; that goes without saying for a young
fellow like me as well! Thus, to tell the truth…I really need your
help. But of course, if you aren’t willing to help, that’s fine
as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three Realms
truly are in a state of chaos right now,” Snow Scorpion sent
mentally to the others. “Since we’ve come out, we might as well
follow the young master for now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father’s orders
remain standing,” the child sent back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Godking gave us
instructions, but he still left it up to us as to how to carry them
out. The Three Realms are quite chaotic; to experience these storms
ourselves will be of benefit to us in increasing our power as well,”
the bald elder sent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother Redsnow,
I’ll follow your lead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sunblaze and Darkmoon
both looked towards Redsnow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them turned to
look towards Redsnow. Redsnow was their true leader. First of all, he
was very strong; secondly, the way in which he handled matters was
quite convincing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Redsnow was silent,
pondering as he looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked back at
Redsnow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning,” Empyrean
God Redsnow said, “An enormous storm truly is about to sweep the
Three Realms. To strictly follow the Godking’s orders to the letter
is rather unsuitable for present condition. But if we were to follow
you…this wouldn’t be of the slightest bit of help for you in
terms of tempering yourself. I’ll give you a promise! Prior to you
becoming an Empyrean God, you have one opportunity to ask us to
assist you. The seven of us will use all our might to help you out,
but…we’ll do it just once! Once you use it up, we definitely
won’t help you again. Even if you die, we’ll just simply stand
back and watch. If you die, you have only yourself and your own
weakness to blame, as well as your poor luck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other six Empyrean
Gods looked towards Ning as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “Alright.
This promise of assistance from the seven of you is enough, seniors!
It is like a protective talisman that will save my life; if I still
end up dying before becoming an Empyrean God, then I really will have
no one else to blame.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Empyrean God
Redsnow nodded
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The child, however,
urged Ning, “Ji Ning, hurry up and become an Empyrean God.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t make us wait
too long,” the beautiful woman added.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Starseizing
Manor needs a manor-master.” The amiable-looking youth looked
towards Ning as well. Their eyes were all filled with hope.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All seven of them
disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a sigh of
relief. In truth, he hadn’t truly expected that these seven
Empyrean Gods would agree to follow him around the entire time; this
promise of helping out once was already enough. After all, in
dangerous times like this…the invisible pressure from the upcoming
storm was causing Ning to feel constant pressure and danger. He
naturally wanted to use everything he had available to give himself a
better chance at surviving it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He wanted to stay alive
within this storm. Even more than that, he wanted his loved ones and
his lover to survive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was dark.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stillwater City. Within
the Black-White College. Yu Wei was currently in her own residence,
quietly pondering by herself. A single candle was lit by her side,
flickering with light. Yu Wei had a very complicated look in her
eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to stop
obsessing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll do what I
need to do.” Yu Wei walked out of the room by herself, raising her
head to stare at theh skies. It was already dark. The crescent moon
could vaguely be seen in the darkening sky. She murmured softly,
“Junior apprentice-brother, come back…you have to come back…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, Yu Wei felt a
strange feeling in her heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She instantly flew into
the air like a gust of wind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There, in the air…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A youth had appeared in
the dark skies. He stared at someone far away…the distant Yu Wei.
Yu Wei’s eyes were filled with surprise and joy. Her eyes couldn’t
help but to fill with tears. She had a strange premonition just now,
which was why she had soared into the skies. It was as though Fate
had whispered silently to her soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just looked at Yu
Wei. The look in her eyes instantly caused Ning to think of his big
sister, Autumn Leaf.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both Yu Wei and Autumn
Leaf shared a commonality; they both viewed Ji Ning as the most
important person in their lives. For Ji Ning’s sake, both of them
could even give up their own lives! Ning could sense it from Autumn
Leaf…and he could also sense it from Yu Wei. He sensed it all the
way back during the Conclave of Immortal Destiny. And now…that
feeling was even stronger than before. What Ning didn’t realize was
that during Yu Wei’s demonheart tribulation, she had lived with him
for over three thousand years in the illusory demonheart world…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister.” Ning finally called out to her.
