Chapter 1 – Spacetime Disc
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A streak of sword-light
was flying through the transversal conduit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning flew incredibly
fast when using the Blood Drop evasion skill, but the transversal
conduit was simply too long. It had taken their group over three
years to fly from the Brightshore Kingdom to the alternate universe.
Still, by now Ning flew twice as fast as he had in the past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here I am.” When
Ning saw the light up ahead, he couldn’t help but reveal a look of
delight as he darted towards it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the instant that he
flew through, Ning could sense… Su Youji! He could also sense his
other true body clone! He could also sense the Primaltwin which was
safeguarding the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m back.” Ning
laughed. He was home.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Endless
Territories. The Badlands Territory. An unremarkable chaos planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A figure suddenly
appeared on the surface of this chaos planet. It was yet another
white-robed Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve benefited
tremendously from this trip to the alternate universe. I’ve now
perfectly joined five Supreme Daos together! Although I can sense
that this isn’t the true apex of the Dao of the Sword, I trust I’ll
soon be able to break through to that level.” Ning had the feeling
for some time now that he was very, very close to the true apex.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had spent over six
million accelerated years in the Trileaf Realm, and during that
period of time this feeling had only grown stronger and stronger. It
looked as though he hadn’t improved at all, but in reality he had
been slowly accumulating experience in his Sword Dao. When it reached
a certain level, it would burst forth!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I wish to become
a Daolord, I must become one with my clone first. It is time for my
clone to head off to Vastheaven Palace.” Ning smiled, then strode
forwards. Whoosh! He instantly tore a hole in the space around him.
By now, Ning’s sword-intent alone was completely capable of tearing
a spatial tunnel open for him, allowing him to enter a different
spatial continuum and move even faster through space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His true body and its
clone would reunite at Vastheaven Palace!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Brightshore
Kingdom. The Sword Palace of the Twelve Palaces. Within an estate
located at the very peak of one of the many awe-inspiring mountains
in the Sword Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This estate belonged to
Ji Ning. Because Ning had yet to return, the gates to the estate
remained barred firmly shut. Next to the estate there was a wooden
house, with Flamefairy Su Youji having taken up temporary residence
here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since she had
returned from the alternate universe she had lived here, waiting for
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master!” Su Youji
had been meditating in the lotus position, but she suddenly opened
her eyes, revealing a look of joy with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She could sense that Ji
Ning had returned!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lofty peak of a
mountain. This was the other end of the transversal conduit. When
Ning exited the conduit, he appeared here. Moments later, a
snow-robed old man with six horns and a white beard suddenly appeared
out of nowhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hegemon.” Ning was
in an extremely good mood due to having returned. When he saw the
Hegemon suddenly appear, he couldn’t help but be badly startled and
hurriedly bow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are back.” The
white-bearded elder had a smile on his face. “It is good that you
are back. You were the last one to return from the alternate
universe.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned. So
Greatjoy, Solewind, and the others both returned as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First, return the
Archaeus medallion to me,” the white-bearded elder said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning
hurriedly produced the Archaeus medallion. It was now of no use to
him, but the almighty Hegemon would be able to use it to allow other
World-level cultivators to venture through the alternate universe in
the future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greatjoy, Solewind,
and the others have already narrated what happened in the alternate
universe to me. You once saved their lives, which is no small thing.
As I said long ago, the better you perform, the heavier I shall
reward you.” The white-bearded man smiled. “And I heard that you
even managed to enter the inner reaches of the Genesis Lands…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was luck,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It wasn’t luck.
Solewind, you, and Greatjoy all managed to make it inside. In the
future, I imagine that the three of you will be every bit the equal
of Eastcult and Bertulu,” the white-bearded elder said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
surprised. So Greatjoy had made it into the inner reaches as well?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a spacetime
disc I created myself.” The white-bearded elder produced a strange
disc of mixed white and black colors. “Through using this spacetime
disk, you can flee through spacetime in a dangerous situation. It
contains the power of a secret art which I personally infused into
it. However, it can only be used once. After you use it the energy
within will be consumed, making it unusable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he spoke, he sent
the strange disc towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was rather
excited. Before going to the alternate universe, the almighty Hegemon
had indeed said that if he provided assistance to Skyfire
Brightshore, he would be richly rewarded upon his return. Still, he
hadn’t expected the reward to be so ample.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given my mastery
over the Dao of Spacetime, there won’t be many who can chase after
you once you activate this spacetime disc.” The almighty Hegemon
was completely confident in his abilities. “Still, you have to be
careful. Major powers have countless abilities at their disposal, and
some are so strong that you won’t even have a chance to use the
disc. Thus, you still have to be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,” Ning
said respectfully. Given how much Emperor Maniseal had doted on his
disciple, he had most certainly provided his disciple with
life-saving treasures. And yet, his disciple had still died by the
hands of Emperor Trisilk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hegemon, I wish to
leave the Brightshore Kingdom for a time, but…” Ning said. Per
the rules of the Brightshore Kingdom, one was generally permitted to
leave only upon becoming a Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Permission granted.
Just go speak with Woodflower of your Sword Palace.” The
white-robed elder nodded. “Be careful when voyaging through the
outside world. You can easily die, given how weak you still are.
Enough. You can go now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Acknowledged.”
Ning bowed respectfully, then used the nearby spacetime tunnel to
first travel back to the imperial palace, then head to the Sword
Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-bearded old
man nodded slightly as he watched Ning leave. “These young fellows
have all benefited quite a bit, and Darknorth has undergone a truly
earthshaking transformation. Now, even I can only barely sense what
his destiny will be like.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Brightshore
Kingdom’s grand strategy lay in the production of elites! The
Daolords of the Brightshore Kingdom were, on average, much stronger
than those of the Dao Alliance. However, they were also much fewer in
number! As for Ji Ning, Bertulu, Greatjoy, and the others, they were
the elites of the elites, the cream of the crop! The Brightshore
Kingdom would naturally protect them carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Giving Ning a spacetime
disc as a form of ‘thanks’ was just an excuse! Even if he didn’t
have this excuse, the Hegemon would’ve come up with another excuse
to give this monstrously talented kid a protective treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there at the
front entrance to the Sword Palace, staring at the beautiful,
fiery-robed woman who stood at the other side of the entrance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youji.” Ning
smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Su
Youji’s eyes were brimming with tears. She had actually benefited
greatly from her visit to the Genesis Lands, and she had improved
significantly as well. She was at the point where she could become a
Daolord whenever she wished. However, she was too worried about Ning.
When she returned to the Sword Palace, she simply couldn’t calm
down and so she didn’t make her breakthrough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, at least, she saw
Ji Ning once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look at yourself!
Your master won’t die that easily, you know.” Ning grinned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I knew you had to
believe. Firesurge and those other bastards said that you…” Su
Youji revealed a brilliant smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s gaze suddenly
turned to someone who stood behind Su Youji.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah. It seems I’ve
disturbed the two of you.” A figure emerged from behind Su Youji, a
smile on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Woodflower,” Ning immediately called out. The
newcomer was indeed Lord Woodflower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Woodflower smiled
as he looked at Ning. “I just learned from the Hegemon that you’ve
returned. Solewind, Greatjoy, and the others all returned some time
ago. You were the only one left. You really gave me a bad scare.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning hadn’t
returned with the others, Woodflower really had been worried for
quite some time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m back now,
right?” Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine this trip
was quite fruitful for you,” Lord Woodflower said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not bad.” Ning
grinned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As far as treasures
went, the deceased Hegemon had bestowed upon him a pair of Dao-seals,
a suit of armor, and chaos nectar. The most precious treasures, of
course, were those six lifeblood swords which Emperor Gonflame had
labored over. Still… weapons and treasures, upon being bound, could
have their auras restrained, making it so that outsiders couldn’t
tell how powerful they were. Not even the almighty Hegemon had
noticed how extraordinary Ning’s six swords and suit of armor were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As long as you
benefited from it. When are you planning to become a Daolord?” Lord
Woodflower asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Soon. I need to make
some further preparations,” Ning said. “Right. Senior
apprentice-brother, I’m planning to leave the Brightshore Kingdom
on a trip.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No problem.” Lord
Woodflower nodded. “If you are going to leave, follow me. We’ll
go light a heartlamp first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartlamps were lit
through one’s own truesoul. Generally speaking, one would be able
to sense right away when its master perished. Once its master
perished, the heartlamp would be extinguished as well. But of course,
if you entered an alternate universe or some particularly dangerous
ruins, it was possible that the connection to the heartlamp would be
severed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, heartlamps and
truesoul towers were amongst the best of life-sensing equipment. The
connection was almost as perfect as the connection between a true
body and a clone. The more casually created items like life-tablets
had a much smaller area of effectiveness.

Chapter 2 – Star Map
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning led Su Youji to
follow Lord Woodflower into the Sword Palace. The Sword Palace had
quite a few cultivators within it, but of course most were
black-armored Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swordlord Darknorth
has arrived.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s Swordlord
Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s Flamefairy
Su Youji standing next to him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s been gone for
roughly eighty thousand years, right? I’m surprised that Lord
Woodflower is actually welcoming him back personally.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eighty thousand
years ago, all of the World-level geniuses of the Twelve Palaces who
were acknowledged by the ancient pagodas were ordered to return, then
challenged the Daolord Cloudworld. After that, Swordlord Darknorth,
Prince Greatjoy, Heartlord Solewind, and Waterlord Firesurge all
suddenly disappeared. I heard that they had all gained an incredible
stroke of good fortune. Prince Greatjoy, Heartlord Solewind, and the
others all returned together tens of thousands of years ago, as did
Flamefairy Su Youji. I thought that Swordlord Darknorth must’ve
died.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-armored
Daolords all chatted amongst themselves, while the ones closer to
Ning all called out in very modest manners, “Swordlord Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Virtually all of the
black-armored Daolords had reached that level through using Pseudo
Samsara Pills. It was all but guaranteed that they would forever
remain Daolords of the First Step. They thus didn’t spend much time
or effort on cultivation, and instead were filled with curiosity
about the latest news and going ons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the almighty
Hegemon had chosen Ning and the others, they were quickly able to
deduce what was really happening. In truth, the Hegemon didn’t
really care that they knew some of the details; so long as the secret
of the alternate universe was kept hidden, that was enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come on.” Lord
Woodflower led Ning towards an ancient pagoda. “Su Youji, you can
wait outside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Su
Youji obediently stood outside the pagoda, while Ji Ning entered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The interior of the
pagoda was simple and unadorned. Deep within it, atop a stone dais,
there were a series of heartlamps that were lit. Heartlamps looked
quite similar to lotus flowers in shape, and they contained sparks of
truesoul flames. So long as the master remained alive, these flames
would never die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were five levels
to the stone dais. There were many heartlamps on the first level,
well over two thousand. The second level had far fewer lamps, just
sixteen in total. The third level only had eighty-two heartlamps, the
fourth level had merely thirty-five heartlamps, and the fifth level
only had two heartlamps.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This stone dais has
five levels. The first level is for Daolords of the First Step, the
second is for Daolords of the Second Step, and so on and so forth.
The fifth level is reserved for Eternal Emperors.” Lord Woodflower
looked at the two heartlamps on the fifth level, then let out a sigh.
“Our Sword Palace has only given birth to a total of three Eternal
Emperors. One has perished, while the other two are out adventuring…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. The Sword
Palace only had around a hundred ‘real’ Daolords. The reason why
there were so many on the first level, with over two thousand
heartlamps present, was because almost all of them were black-armored
Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, our Sword Palace actually has thirty-five
Daolords of the Fourth Step?” Ning asked. The fourth step
represented Verge-level Daolords; they definitely would be considered
incredibly strong major powers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Think about Daolord
Everstarter, who has been missing for countless chaos cycles. Do you
think he is alive, or do you think he is dead?” Lord Woodflower
looked at Ning. “The heartlamp remains lit because it cannot sense
him, but whether or not he is actually still alive is hard to say.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. For
example, if he had died in an alternate universe, there would’ve
been no way to sense it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for Daolords of
the Fourth Step who we are certain are still alive, there are
twenty-two of them,” Lord Woodflower said. “The others, we simply
cannot tell. Daolords of the Fourth Step are all searching for
opportunities and fortunes that will assist them in their Daomerge.
For the sake of their Daomerge, they will risk their lives and plunge
into some truly deadly regions… and some of them will never
return.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but sigh as well. Daolord Solesky was another example; for the sake
of his Daomerge, he had chosen to brave the dangers of the Waveshift
Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. Come, set a
heartlamp alight,” Lord Woodflower said. “The normal rule is that
only Daolords can leave. However, you are capable of becoming a
Daolord whenever you choose, and so we won’t force things. For now,
we’ll temporarily keep your heartlamp on the first level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A dark, gloomy
lotus-shaped heartlamp hovered before Ning. Ning stretched out a
finger, sending out a stream of his soul into the heartlamp. Poof!
The wick within the flower petals of the heartlamp instantly lit up.
Ning could sense the strong connection which now existed between his
truesoul and the blazing flames. It almost felt like one of his
clones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With but a thought,
Ning sent the heartlamp flying to the borders of the first level of
the stone dais, then set it down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After you become a
Daolord, training will speed up significantly at first. It shouldn’t
take you too long to reach the second step! Reaching the third step
will take a bit more time, while reaching the fourth step will be the
most difficult of all.” Lord Woodflower had a complicated look on
his face as he said softly, “As for the Daomerge… it’ll be up
to luck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless monstrously
powerful Daolords had perished. Only a miniscule number became
Eternal Emperors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However… failing
in the Daomerge doesn’t mean that much. To be able to roam the
universe freely for 108,000 chaos cycles is enough.” Lord
Woodflower laughed. “If you stifle yourself and choose a weak Dao…
even if you are lucky enough to become an Eternal Emperor, you’ll
live in perpetual fear of being killed by one of the powerful
Daolords. Even if you live forever, that just means you’ll be
pitiful bug forever!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
ancient, dispirited Lord Woodflower. Suddenly, he could sense a
terrifying sword-intent emanate from the man’s body. Ning couldn’t
help but nod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To mortals, cultivators
seemed to have unlimited lifespans; upon becoming a Celestial
Immortal, it was said that your lifespan would be as long as that of
the heavens themselves. However, in reality there was still a limit!
Even entire chaosworlds and the heavens within them would eventually
perish and be born anew. As for World-level cultivators and Daolords,
they could at most live for 108,000 chaos cycles! They had to succeed
in the Daomerge within this allotted time span.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If they did not
complete their Daomerge, then when the time came they would perish.
Thus… even the most powerful of Daolords could only live for
108,000 chaos cycles. This was why the Sword Palace had more than
80,000 powerful Daolords in its records, but only a hundred who were
still alive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only by succeeding in
the Daomerge would they gain true eternity. For the most powerful,
such as the Hegemon, time flowed on in an endless stream but they
remained at the very apex of the universe. The almighty Brightshore
Hegemon had been alive for far longer than even the Twelve Palaces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the heartlamp lit,
Ning left the pagoda.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji was waiting
for him outside. There was actually a green-robed creature with
hundreds of tentacles that served as hair and a pair of golden eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, Master.”
The green-robed creature immediately knelt down and called out with
respect when he saw Ning emerge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And you are…?”
Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is your
servant,” Lord Woodflower said. “A servant which the Brightshore
Kingdom has prepared for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Brightshore
Kingdom is giving me a servant? A World-level servant?” Ning was
puzzled. What was the point of giving him a World-level servant?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lord Woodflower said,
“Don’t underestimate his usefulness. He will be extremely
important to you! Normally, only real Daolords of the Twelve Palaces
will be given access to servants like him. Those black-armored
Daolords never will. Every one of them is raised here within the
Brightshore Kingdom and possesses both self-cloning abilities as well
as incredibly powerful souls. Just one of his clones will accompany
you, with another one remaining in the Brightshore Kingdom.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, are you saying…?” Ning was starting to
understand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Exactly so. He’ll
be used to send messages.” Lord Woodflower looked at Ning. “If
you you run into trouble and need to ask for rescue, you can tell him
and his clone in the Brightshore Kingdom will be able to immediately
report it to us! The Brightshore Kingdom will immediately spread the
word to all of the Daolords and Eternal Emperors of the kingom who
are in the Endless Territories. The ones closest to you will head to
you as quickly as possible!” Lord Woodflower laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes lit up.
Absolutely incredible. To use a messenger relay of clones to ensure
that the Daolords and Eternal Emperors of the Brightshore Kingdom
were in constant contact was an effective way of maintaining
communication.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, given how
truly vast the Endless Territories are, generally speaking it would
be difficult for an ordinary World God’s clone to be able to sense
past a thousand or so territories. Thus, the Brightshore Kingdom has
arranged for this one to work with you. His soul is incredibly
powerful,” Lord Woodflower said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded in
understanding. There was a limit to the distance at which a clone
would be able to sense the presence of another clone. Elder God and
Ancestral Immortal clones could only sense each other up to ten
territories apart, whereas World-level clones would only function up
to a thousand territories apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The so-called ‘sensing’
method was actually a type of soul resonance. Thus, the stronger the
soul, the greater the distance at which the connection could be
maintained! Take Ning as an example. Although he was merely at the
World level, his soul was comparable to a Daolord’s! As for these
World-level cultivators who had been trained by the Brightshore
Kingdom, they all had clones and souls which were far more powerful
than that of ordinary World-level cultivators, allowing them to sense
at a great distance as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is quite rare for
World-level cultivators to have clones.” Ning sighed with emotion.
“Ones with such powerful souls are even more rare.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Brightshore
Kingdom doesn’t have that many Daolords. That’s why we can afford
to do this,” Lord Woodflower said. “There’s no way the Dao
Alliance, for example, could do such a thing. Still, they have
methods of their own… but of course, those methods are far slower
than ours.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. The
Brightshore Kingdom was able to transmit information at truly
shocking speeds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When you wander
through the outside world, the Brightshore Kingdom shall be the
strongest shield available to you.” Lord Woodflower smiled at Ning.
“And all of the Daolords of the Brightshore Kingdom have sworn
oaths from the day they joined to never engage in battle against each
other.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled. When he
had received the Sword Palace’s medallion, he had also sworn a
lifeblood oath. No members of any of the Twelve Palaces could kill
each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The major powers of
the Brightshore Kingdom are extremely unified when wandering the
outside world. If you encounter other Daolords of the Brightshore
Kingdom who are in danger, you should help them as well.” Lord
Woodflower looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. This is the
star map of all territories which are known to the Brightshore
Kingdom.” Lord Woodflower handed a rolled-up golden star map scroll
to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning accepted it. Upon
opening it, a look of shock instantly filled his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Amazed, right? The
Endless Territories are truly vast, and some of its danger zones are
also truly massive. Many cannot even be fully mapped out.” Lord
Woodflower let out a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared, stunned,
at the star map. Good heavens. This… this was far larger than the
entire star map of the alternate universe!

Chapter 3 – The Journey
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The territories
occupied by cultivators in the Endless Territories roughly made up
around sixty to seventy percent the size of the alternate universe.
However, there were many ‘danger zones’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, the region
marked down as the ‘Terror Starsea’ was considered the most
dangerous location in all the Endless Territories. It had yet to be
fully mapped out, but its known area alone already surpassed the
entirety of the rest of the Endless Territories. It was incredibly
dangerous, and less than one in ten thousand Daolords would survive a
trip into it! Generally speaking, only incredibly powerful Daolords
would be lucky enough to survive, and even the majority of Eternal
Emperors who entered that place would perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Terror Starsea, in
and of itself, was nearly comparable to the entire alternate universe
in size. It was without a doubt the most dangerous place in the
Endless Territories. The Endless Territories also had some other
similar danger zones which were quite terrifying. Chances of entering
and surviving were very slim.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we factor in
those danger zones, the Endless Territories is far larger than the
alternate universe.” Ji Ning was rather stunned as he carefully
read through the information the star map contained regarding the
Endless Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that…” Ning’s
eyes narrowed as he saw an explanation of the six major forces within
the Endless Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao Alliance was
comprised of virtually all cultivators. It was an enormous behemoth
that was also far-flung and dispersed. It had the most Daolords and
Eternal Emperors, but it also had so many internecine disputes and
took up so much territory that it had always operated under the
principle of non-governance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Brightshore Kingdom
was created by the almighty Hegemon Brightshore, one of the three
mighty Hegemons of the Endless Territories!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Aeonians consumed
cultivators, using them as food. They were extremely unified and were
incredibly powerful after being Awakened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ‘Aberrants’.
They were the hundreds and thousands of strange, unique creatures who
had been birthed by the primordial chaos. After Hegemon Windrain rose
to power and established the Windrain Kingdom, it became a holy land
for all Aberrants and countless Aberrants congregated there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ancient cultivators
comprised the most mysterious, secretive organization in all the
Endless Territories. They were extremely few in number, but each and
every one of them possessed incredible power. Their divine abilities
and secret arts were powerful beyond measure, and they were led by
Hegemon Netherlily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dark Kingdom was
comprised of cultivators who had migrated from outside the Endless
Territories, and they ruled over the border territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Much more complex
than the alternate universe,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.” Lord Woodflower smiled as he looked at Ning.
“Surprised?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I never realized our
many danger zones our Endless Territories possess, or that we
actually have six major forces here,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no need
for most World-level cultivators to know such things. The Endless
Territories are simply too vast and filled with so many dangers that
they would never make it far enough to find out,” Lord Woodflower
said. “You, however, are different. This is all information you’ll
need to know after you become a Daolord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for the danger
zones… some are almost infinitely large, especially the Terror
Starsea. Not even the almighty Hegemon has been able to fully explore
them,” Lord Woodflower said. “Honestly, the main things you need
to keep in mind are those six major powers. The Brightshore Kingdom
is rather aloof, and we are on fairly good terms with the Dao
Alliance, the Aeonians, and the Aberrants. We can be considered
enemies of the Dark Kingdom, as they are foreigners, after all. But
remember… we are mortal foes of the Ancient cultivators!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mortal foes?” Ning
was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Lord
Woodflower nodded somberly. “Thus, you need to be wary of them! But
of course, you need to keep an eye out for the other organizations as
well. The Dao Alliance, for example. It is so large and filled with
so much internal struggles that it wouldn’t surprise me if some of
their major powers suddenly assaulted you. Same with the Aeonians;
you are a cultivator, after all! Aeonians love eating Samsara Daolord
cultivators.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. You know
everything you need to know.” Lord Woodflower looked at Ning. “In
short… have a safe trip.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded heavily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After accepting the
servant, Ning led Su Youji in leaving the Sword Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Brightshore Kingdom
was quite similar to the Trileaf Realm, in that it also had three
spacetime tunnels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These three
spacetime tunnels lead to three different parts of the Endless
Territories, allowing our cultivators to waste as little time as
possible when travelling.” A black-lord Daolord guard who stood
outside the tunnel smiled as he explained to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning led Su
Youji straight into the spacetime tunnel. In his heart, he couldn’t
help but muse that the Paragon of Pills and Hegemon Brightshore
apparently were quite similar in their mastery over spacetime.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Badlands Territory
and Vastheaven Palace had originally seemed quite distant from one
another, but if you looked at the star map of the Endless Territories
you would realize that they actually belonged to the same general
neighborhood! Given Ning’s strength, a few hundred years would
suffice for his clone to go from the Badlands Territory to Vastheaven
Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We should be able to
make it in around three or so centuries.” Ning’s true body would
be able to move even faster; the spacetime tunnel would save him
quite some time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A flying shuttle was
hurtling through the void, with Ning, Su Youji, and World God
Pillsaint within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, what sort of
a place is Vastheaven Palace?” Pillsaint asked curiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A place I have to
go. In fact, I’m technically a member of Vastheaven Palace as
well,” Ning said with a smile. Indeed. He had to reach that place
before he could fulfill his lifeblood oath and return to the Three
Realms. His Primaltwin had been protecting the Three Realms for quite
some time now, but it had to remain physically outside within the
primordial chaos just beyond it, unable to actually re-enter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youji, Pillsaint,
both of you have made tremendous gains. I imagine both of you can
become Daolords now,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Su Youji
nodded. “After I received the legacy of Feixian the Exalted but
prior to visiting the Genesis Lands, I was already comparable to a
supreme Chaos Immortal. Thanks to the opportunities the Genesis Lands
gave me… even if I don’t use any treasures at all, I am a
transcendent Chaos Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. To reach
that level only through the usage of Eternal weapons wasn’t that
impressive. If you were able to reach a transcendent level of power
without needing to rely on magic treasures, you would probably be
able to break through to the Daolord level whenever you wished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Master,
for that Archaeus medallion. Otherwise, I have no idea how long it
would take for me to break through.” Su Youji felt rather excited.
She had never imagined that she would become a Daolord as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to thank you
as well, Master. If it wasn’t for you, I can’t even imagine how
long it would take before my Dao of Alchemy would have reached its
current level.” Pillsaint was quite excited. “Flamefairy, I can
become a Daolord whenever I wish as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. His two
most worthy retainers were both able to become Daolords. This was
truly pleasing to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Have
Solewind, Greatjoy, and the others made their breakthroughs yet?”
Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah! I was so happy
to see you back that I forgot to tell you,” Su Youji said. “Prince
Greatjoy broke through to become a Daolord roughly three thousand
years after our return! Just two years after that, Waterlord
Firesurge became a Daolord as well! Another twelve thousand years
after that, Solewind also become a Daolord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled. All
of them became Daolords?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Makes sense. They
had reached their bottlenecks long ago; the only reason they held
back was because they had made some gains in the Genesis Lands. Any
further improvements would be incredibly difficult. I’m not
surprised they broke through to become Daolords,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, when will
you become a Daolord?” Su Youji asked curiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right!” Pillsaint
was curious as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It won’t take too
long,” Ning said. No matter what, he had to reunite with his clone
first. In addition… he could also dimly sense that there was still
a slight flaw with his Sword Dao. He had the feeling that he was
close to breaking through, but just needed one final stimulus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since the two of you
are both ready to become Daolords… how about this. Let’s find a
quiet, secluded place and have you two break through there,” Ning
said. “Or would you prefer to train for a bit longer and further
solidify your foundations?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I solidified my
foundation long ago. I was just waiting for you to come back, Master.
I can break through whenever I wish; there’s no need to wait any
further.” The Flamefairy smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I solidified my
foundation back in the Trileaf Realm. I’ve been waiting to make my
breakthrough,” Pillsaint said. After acquiring the first six
chapters of the [Seven Leafpill Chapters], he had spent roughly a
million years in accelerated time training. That was how long it had
taken for Ning to acquire thise six lifeblood weapons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If that’s the
case… hm. Let’s just go over there.” Ning willed it, and the
flying ship quickly shifted into a different dimensional continuum,
then landed on a quiet, desolate chaos planet. This chaos planet had
no life on it at all, and its surface was a rocky one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
causing an Immortal estate to descend upon the surface of this
planet. With another thought, Ning activated the various layers of
restrictive seals and spells on the estate, causing an aura of
enormous yet subdued power to cover the entire planet. Anyone off in
the distance would never be able to detect any hint of an aura from
this chaos planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Breaking through to
become a Daolord would cause an enormous disturbance. They had to do
their best to dampen their auras and prevent themselves from being
discovered, which would cause unnecessary trouble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Make your
breakthroughs here. I’ll stand guard for you,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.” Both
Pillsaint and Su Youji were rather excited and nervous. Although they
were confident in their chances, breaking through to become a Daolord
was an incredibly important event in the life of any cultivator.

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_4___The_Brothers_of_Vast"></A>
Chapter 4 – The Brothers of Vastheaven Palace
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning stood before
the railings of the Immortal estate on this chaos planet, staring off
into the starry void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a roiling
aura of power rocketed into the skies, an aura which was powerful,
vast, and utterly exalted. This was not an aura which a World-level
cultivator could produce. Even for Ning, only the azureflower mist
energy in his body could compare to this aura in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Daolord’s aura.”
Ning smiled. “Pillsaint was the first to break through.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Breaking through from
the World level to become a Daolord required the complete rebuilding
of the body, which meant that there was naturally no way to keep
one’s aura hidden during the process. It would erupt with abandon.
But of course, Ning had long ago set wards on this planet to prevent
the Daolord ripples from spreading out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A dense whirlpool of
chaos energy began to form in the void above the planet. The enormous
vortex of chaos energy centered around the planet, gathering in large
amounts of chaos energy and then continuously transmitting it
directly into Pillsaint and letting him make use of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
yet another Daolord aura erupted towards the heavens as the
Flamefairy began to make her breakthrough as well. Soon, yet another
vortex of chaos energy began to fill the void outside the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous chaos
vortexes swirled around this chaos planet. As for Ning, he just
quietly stood guard in front of the estate. A disruption in the flow
of chaos energy alone generally wouldn’t attract the attention of
major powers, because True Gods, True Immortals, Elder Gods, and
Ancestral Immortals would cause similar phenomena when they made
their breakthroughs. As a result, fluctuations in the flow of chaos
energy was fairly common, and the ripples were also quite weak from a
distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The breakthrough
process took more than an entire day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. A chubby form
suddenly rocketed into the skies, then landed before Ning. It was the
chubby-face, white-teethed Pillsaint. Pillsaint’s aura was now more
natural but also more majestic. Just judging from auras alone, one
would believe that he was significantly more powerful than Ning. He
had already reached the Daolord level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
Daolord Pillsaint.” Ning smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I must thank you,
Master. If it wasn’t for you, I truly do not know how long it
would’ve taken for me to become a Daolord. Or perhaps I might’ve
never reached this level.” Pillsaint was rather moved as well. He
was far more talented in alchemy than he was in combat, but to become
a true grandmaster alchemist was incredibly difficult. This time,
thanks to Ning, he had been lucky enough to attract the attention of
the Paragon of Pills in the alternate universe and be bestowed with
her techniques, allowing him to find his own path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Paragon of Pills
had given him the first six chapters, which could guide one directly
to becoming an Eternal Emperor. Not even the Brightshore Kingdom had
a comparable alchemical technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only after being guided
by an eminent master did Pillsaint know what path he should take.
Without an eminent master, only a man of utterly dazzling talent,
such as Ji Ning, Solewind, and the others, would be able to rely on
his own thoughts and ideas to enter the Daolord level. But of course,
this would still be much easier if you had many other legacies and
techniques to learn from. If you were able to benefit from the wisdom
and experience of your predecessors, you would be able to avoid some
of their mistakes. If you wished to see far, you had to stand on the
shoulders of giants.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Moments later,
yet another figured flew into the heavens, her form ephemeral and
bewitchingly beautiful. Dressed in fiery red robes, it was indeed Su
Youji, and her beauty and aura of seduction was only even more
intoxicating than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As someone who trained
in the Dao of Charm and control, Su Youji’s natural grace and charm
was becoming increasingly amazing. A single glance from her would be
enough to drive most World-level cultivators insane with love,
causing them to be willing to sacrifice themselves for her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Su Youji
smiled as she looked at Ning, but she felt a bit disappointed when
she saw how Ning’s eyes still remained very calm and tranquil. She
said with a hint of resignation, “I thought I’d be able to affect
you a little bit. It seems your ability to resist mesmerization is
extraordinarily powerful. As expected, given that you were able to go
through the primessence chains.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you used your
secret arts, I might be affected,” Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I would never do
that to you,” Su Youji said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Ning wasn’t
sure if he would be able to withstand her. She was now a Daolord,
after all. If she used her mesmerization secret arts with her
Daolord-level energy… she might not be able to take control over
him, but it was likely that she would be able to affect him. She
wasn’t an ordinary Daolord, after all; she had trained in the
legacy of Feixian the Exalted, a terrifyingly powerful Daolord. But
of course, even if she was able to affect Ning, Ning would be able to
summon his quadressence lightning and water with a thought, using
them to easily extinguish Su Youji. The main problem was that the
difference in power between them remained too vast!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao of Charm was
not a Dao suited to close combat; it was meant to control and beguile
foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now that you are
Daolords, everything has changed for you,” Ning said. “With each
step they take, Samsara Daolords walk between life and death. You
have only taken the first step on your path! In the future, you must
be even more careful and meticulous in your cultivation. I won’t
make any unreasonable requests of you, but I do expect the two of you
to at least survive to reach the fourth step.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Pillsaint
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Failing in the
Daomerge is one thing, but if I was to fail and die when breaking
through to the second, third, or fourth steps… that would be a
joke!” Su Youji was quite confident as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For Samsara Daolords,
every single step they took was akin to groping for a path through
the darkness!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals, as well as World-level cultivators, would be
able to sense the prime essences of the universe. The prime essence
of the Dao of the Sword, for example, would emanate an aura with
extremely detailed information regarding the Dao which would allow
cultivators to safely train all the way up to the master-class as a
World-level cultivator.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After that… you would
be searching through the darkness. A single misplaced step would
result in death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daomerge at the end
would prove to be the greatest trial. If your Dao held even the
slightest of imperfections, there was no way it could gain true
eternity. The only result would be you dying and your Dao vanishing.
Not even the likes of Su Youji, Pillsaint, or Ning were confident in
being able to succeed in the Daomerge. Their goal was to first do
their best to become Daolords of the Fourth Step. If they couldn’t
even reach that level, they really would become the laughingstocks of
the Brightshore Kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Daomerge?
They’d worry about that after actually reaching the fourth step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that Su Youji and
Pillsaint were Daolords, the journey before the trio would be even
smoother sailing than before. Daolords were naturally a powerful
deterrent to any would-be attackers, allowing them to easily travel
for nearly three centuries in complete peace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slumberlake Star was a
place with a spacetime transfer array.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The array
suddenly lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The array was
activated just a short while ago. Why is it being activated again so
soon?” The Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals who were responsible
for overseeing this spacetime transfer array were all puzzled and
mumbled to each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
three figures suddenly emerged from the spacetime transfer array. The
trio consisted of Ji Ning, Pillsaint, and Su Youji.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the three of them
appeared and the Daolord auras of the latter two wafted outwards, the
Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals were so terrified that they didn’t
dare say another word.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, there was no
way Ning would choose to waste time in order to save a bit of travel
expenses. They naturally chose to independently activate the arrays
each time!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re fairly close
to Vastheaven Palace by now. We should arrive in about half a year,”
Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
Master.” Su Youji smiled. “You’ve been waiting far too long for
this day.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. It has been far
too long.” Ning nodded slowly. The reason he cared so much about
going to Vastheaven Palace… was because he truly missed his mother
and father.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A flying vessel
appeared out of nowhere. Ning and the others entered the vessel,
which then speedily departed. They needed to fly for roughly half a
month, then go through a natural spatial vortex to reach a more
distant location. This was how travelling through the primordial
chaos was. In truth, very little of the time was spent going through
spacetime transfer arrays; the vast majority of the time was spent
going through some rather problematic locations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a chaos
planet located within a region of primordial chaos that was fairly
close to Slumberlake Star. A fierce fight was going on upon the
surface of the planet, causing quite a significant disturbance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning suddenly
had a strange feeling. At his level of power, these feelings were
generally quite accurate. “Stop!” Ning immediately brought his
flying vessel to a halt and put it away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master?” Pillsaint
and Su Youji were both puzzled. Why had they suddenly come to a halt?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s take a look
up ahead,” Ning said. “A battle seems to be occurring upon that
chaos planet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pillsaint and Su Youji
were both puzzled. A battle? So what? What was the point of watching?
Still, neither would go against Ning’s wishes. They immediately
followed Ning in flying over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three World-level
cultivators and a number of Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals were
watching this battle from afar. This place was fairly close to
Slumberlake Star, a spacetime transfer array, and so quite a few
cultivators had come over to watch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gentlemen, what is
happening on that planet?” Ning walked over to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The watching
cultivators all turned their heads, puzzled, towards Ning’s group.
They saw the white-robed youth, then saw the two figures behind him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolords?!?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings,
Daolords.” The three World-level cultivators were badly shocked.
They hastily bowed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolords.” The
Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals were quivering with fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instructed, “Tell
me about the battle going on upon that chaos planet.” For him to
feel an affinity for it meant there had to be some sort of a
connection to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the World-level
cultivators, an elderly man, immediately said, “Right away,
senior.” He didn’t dare act negligently towards this white-robed
youth. The youth looked like a World-level cultivator, but the two
Daolords were standing behind him. Clearly, this youth’s background
was extraordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That planet has a
total of six World-level cultivators who are split up into two
groups,” the old man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can tell that
there are two sides.” Ning frowned. He was able to see from ten
billion kilometers away that atop that chaos planet, there was a
single World-level cultivator who was being assaulted by five others.
He was just barely able to hold his own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“On one side is the
Clearwind Temple. The five of them are working together to kill a
common foe, a World-level cultivator of their mortal enemy,
‘Vastheaven Palace’.” The old man hurriedly sped up his
explanation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face
tightened. Vastheaven Palace? No wonder he sensed a connection!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning took a
step forward, transforming into a streak of sword-light that tore
through space. Through the Blood Drop evasion skill, he entered a
different dimensional continuum as he charged towards that chaos
planet at maximum speed. If one of the brothers of Vastheaven Palace
ended up being bullied by others before his very eyes, what a joke
that would be!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, t-that’s
Clearwind Temple!” The old man cried out in alarm. He could sense
the killing intent radiating off Ning. Clearwind Temple was a force
every bit the equal of Vastheaven Palace. For World-level
cultivators, such organizations were unfathomably vast and powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master!” Su Youji
transformed into a streak of light as well. The nearby cultivators
were all dazed when they heard her address him as ‘Master’. What
was going on? Why would a Daolord address a World-level cultivator as
‘master’?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So what if they
belong to Clearwind Temple? Our master belongs to Vastheaven Palace!”
Pillsaint emanated a killing aura as well as he too transformed into
a streak of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old man and the
nearby World-level cultivators, Elder Gods, and Ancestral Immortals
were all completely stunned.
</P>

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_5___Darknorth_of_Vasthea"></A>
Chapter 5 – Darknorth of Vastheaven Palace
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By the time Ji Ning
emerged from the different dimensional continuum, he had already
emerged directly outside that chaos planet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five World-level
cultivators of Clearwind Temple who were surrounding and attacking
that lone figure on the surface of the chaos planet immediately
noticed the intruder. Their leader, a muscular and tall World-level
cultivator, immediately barked out, “Clearwind Temple is in pursuit
of a thief. Fellow Daoist, leave immediately!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning let
out a cold snort, immediately transforming into a streak of
sword-light. He moved at four times the speed of light as he charged
over at maximum speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as Ning began
to move, the World-level cultivators on the chaos planet were all
shocked. Four times the speed of light? It must be understood that
most World-level cultivators weren’t even able to move at twice the
speed of light, unless they specialized in certain speed-based secret
arts. Daolords of the First Step could generally move at double the
speed of light, Daolords of the Second Step could move at triple the
speed of light, Daolords of the Third Step could move at quadruple
the speed of light, and Daolords of the Fourth Step could move at
quintuple the speed of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course, this was
just the ‘normal’ speed. If you were skilled in evasive
techniques or had a good evasion-type treasure, things would be
completely different. Both, however, were extremely rare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can a
World-level cultivator move that fast? He must specialize in a
movement art.” The five World-level cultivators of Clearwind Temple
immediately came to this conclusion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am Darknorth of
Vastheaven Palace!” Ning’s cold, baleful voice instantly rang out
within the air above the chaos planet, and it struck against the
hearts of those five World-level cultivators like thunder, causing
their faces to turn pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Vastheaven Palace? Not
good!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that brother
Darknorth?” The belabored and surrounded azure-robed figure
immediately called out loudly, “Careful, brother Darknorth! The
five of them are not easy to deal with.” He had heard of Darknorth
before. Daolord Solesky’s incarnation in Vastheaven Palace had told
everyone of Darknorth, letting them know that they had gained a new
brother whose name was Darknorth and who was just an Elder God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to what
big brother Solesky said, Darknorth is just an Elder God. But that
doesn’t seem to be right,” the azure-robed man mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He belongs to
Vastheaven Palace? Capture him as well and imprison them both into
Blackwind Prison!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five cultivators of
Clearwind Temple, upon realizing that Ning was from Vastheaven
Palace, immediately launched their attacks against him as well. Two
of them continued their assaults on the azure-robed figure while the
other three began to charge towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning flew
forwards like a streak of sword-light, not even drawing his black
swords. He just gave them a cold look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was as though the
heavens themselves were collapsing! A terrifying, awesome
sword-intent suddenly appeared on the surface of the chaos planet,
crystallizing into streaks of sword-light. Countless streaks of
sword-light descended upon the world as the five World-level
cultivators stared upwards in terror. In the face of this boundless
rain of sword-intent, the five were like nothing more than ants.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can he be this
strong?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This sword-intent…”
The five World-level cultivators were completely stunned. For the
sword-intent alone to be this strong… this man could wipe them out
as easily as if they were ants. Utterly terrified, the five all
produced white jade seals in their hands, then crushed them to beg
for rescue. They didn’t even think about fighting back; all they
wanted to do was beg for aid.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The endless
sword-intent crashed upon them like a wave, smothering and drowning
all five of the World-level cultivators. The sword-intent was as soft
as cotton, quickly wrapping around all five World-level cultivators.
Ning then took out a gourd and opened it, allowing its opening to
exert a tremendous sucking power. Swoosh! All five cultivators were
instantly drawn inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With but a thought,
Ning dismissed the sword-intent from the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As far as Ning was
concerned, these five World-level cultivators truly were like ants.
The difference in power between him and them was simply enormous.
Ning, however, didn’t wish to be rash. He’d first capture them,
then decide later whether or not to kill them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth?”
The azure-robed man stared blankly at Ning. He was rather dazed right
now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Big brother Solesky,
didn’t you say that brother Darknorth was just an Elder God? For
him to have reached the World level was one thing. How did he become
this powerful?! He didn’t even have to attack; his sword-intent
alone was enough to capture all five of those World-level
cultivators. Two of them were supreme World Gods!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My name is
Eastherd.” The azure-robed man suppressed his puzzlement as Ning
walked towards him, then said, “Brother Darknorth, thank you for
saving my life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Eastherd, I
just so happened to move past this area on my way to Vastheaven
Palace.” Ning smiled. “What, you’ve heard of me before?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have.” The
azure-robed man nodded immediately. “Big brother Solesky told us
about you long ago. He said that you are an Elder God who has close
to a World God’s level of power, and that you’d be making a
breakthrough quite soon. But now… it seems that you have not only
reached the World level, you are so powerful as to render me
speechless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled. Indeed.
When he met Daolord Solesky, he was just an Elder God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Has big brother
Solesky returned from the Waveshift Realm yet?” Ning immediately
asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not yet.” Eastherd
shook his head and sighed. “He’s still trapped in the Waveshift
Realm, with his incarnation standing guard over Vastheaven Palace.
His incarnation has mentioned you to us before. Ugh… the Waveshift
Realm is an estate-world left behind by an Eternal Emperor, and
Eternal Emperor Waveshift was no ordinary Eternal Emperor at that!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Waveshift Realm was
one of the many danger zones of the Endless Territories. Quite a few
Daolords of the Fourth Step had perished in that place, but a steady
stream of them continued to enter it. This was because Emperor
Waveshift had left behind certain incredible treasures within that
place. Emperor Waveshift was no ordinary Emperor; he was incredibly
skilled in the art of Numerancy, to the point of being acclaimed as
the number one Numerancy diviner in all the Endless Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Later, he had left to
go out adventuring. His estate had become an ownerless item, with
generations of Daolords venturing into it to seek out their fortunes.
Daolord Badlands was also very skilled in Numerancy. He had even
erected his own school within the Waveshift Everworld. There were
many other major powers who felt certain that he must’ve received
one of Emperor Waveshift’s legacies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two figures flew in
from afar. They were Pillsaint and Su Youji. Although they were both
Daolords, they were slower than Ning in both teleporting as well as
raw flying speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two Daolords.”
Eastherd was badly shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, what
happened to those people from Clearwind Temple?” Pillsaint asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, you move too
fast.” Su Youji laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, then
looked at Eastherd. “Eastherd, let’s leave immediately. This
place is very close to Clearwind Temple’s territory; it’ll be
dangerous for us to stay here too long.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eastherd was stunned
upon hearing these two Daolords address Ning as ‘master’. Upon
hearing Ning’s words, he immediately nodded. “Right, right,
right! Let’s hurry up and leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning produced his
flying vessel, and all four of them immediately boarded it. The
vessel quickly disappeared into the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aboard the flying
vessel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eastherd stared at
Pillsaint and Su Youji, then looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolords?”
Eastherd looked at Ning. “Brother Darknorth, these two Daolords are
your retainers?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that really so
surprising? My master can become a Daolord whenever he wishes. Even
now, he’s still much more powerful than the two of us,” Pillsaint
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You haven’t seen
our master’s true power yet,” Su Youji said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eastherd was secretly
speechless. But it was true; he really had seen nothing at all. Just
now, Ning had merely exerted a bit of his sword-intent in order to
capture the five foes. That couldn’t even be considered a real
attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Eastherd.”
Ning immediately asked, “How did you end up in a fight against
Clearwind Temple, and on their territory?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clearwind Temple was
located extremely close to the territory that battle had just taken
place in. Vastheaven Palace, however, was still another eleven
territories away. It’d still take them another half year to reach
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Half a year wasn’t a
long period of time, given how long most cultivators lived for, but
it wasn’t exactly short either. Half a year was enough for you to
die countless times in a life-and-death battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These two mighty sects
were twelve territories away from each other. They had their own
territories and nursed old grudges against each other; they could be
considered mortal enemies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for this matter,
it has to do with one of my disciples.” Eastherd shook his head.
“Twenty thousand years ago, when I was wandering the outside world,
I encountered a young fellow who was incredibly talented and also
very kind-hearted. I took him on as my disciple and watched him grow,
providing some occasional guidance in secret. Who would’ve thought
that he would end up harvesting a treasure that would attract the
attention and pursuit of Clearwind Temple? Of course I had to rescue
him! But Clearwind Temple is very close to this place, and many
World-level cultivators quickly came to aid their forces. That’s
why I ended up being surrounded and attacked by five of them at once.
If it wasn’t for you, brother Darknorth, I probably…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning slowly nodded.
“When I captured those five from Clearwind Temple, they all
shattered jade talismans. Most likely, they were sending out a
distress call.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 6 – Love Will Find a Way
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. They had to
have been calling for reinforcements.” Eastherd’s face turned
solemn. “Our return to Vastheaven Palace will probably be a
difficult one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Difficult?” Ji
Ning looked at Eastherd.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What difficulties
are there?” Pillsaint asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The feud between
Clearwind Temple and our Vastheaven Palace is an old one. Both sides
have accumulated countless grievances over the course of many years.
You could call us ‘mortal enemies’, I suppose. They aren’t any
weaker than us,” Eastherd said. “Clearwind Temple has four
Daolords, one of which is a Daolord of the Fourth Step. Two are at
the third step, while one is a Daolord of the First Step who only
broke through thanks to a Pseudo Samsara Pill. Just now, when you
attacked, those five World-level cultivators all shattered their jade
medallions to send out distress calls. When Clearwind Temple notices
so many of its cultivators sending out distress signals
simultaneously, they’ll send at least a Daolord of the Third Step.
They might even send out their Daolord of the Fourth Step, Patriarch
Clearwind himself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Daolord of the
Fourth Step,” Pillsaint murmured softly. The nearby Su Youji looked
rather solemn as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, then
smiled. “No need to worry. Use generals to deal with soldiers, use
earth to defend against floods.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He felt quite
confident. He had five mighty golems by his side; he truly wasn’t
worried about most Daolords of the Third Step. In addition, the
Brightshore Kingdom’s star map was so incredibly detailed that it
even included information regarding the Daolords of Clearwind Temple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clearwind Temple only
had a single member who would pose a threat to Ning. That person was
the temple’s founder, Patriarch Clearwind. He was extremely
formidable, on par with Daolord Solesky! Even amongst Daolords of the
Fourth Step, he was extremely formidable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we really are so
unlucky as to encounter Patriarch Clearwind, I’ll have no choice
but to use up one of my Dao-seals,” Ning mused to himself. “If
that really does end up happening… I’ll just chalk it up to
helping Vastheaven Palace get rid of a mortal enemy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The deceased Hegemon’s
Dao-seals possessed unfathomable power and could easily slay Daolords
of the Fourth Step. Alas, Ning only had two such Dao-seals. He wasn’t
willing to use them unless absolutely necessary. These items couldn’t
simply be purchased anywhere!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying vessel
continued to advance at high speed. Aboard the vessel, Eastherd said
with worry, “The Daolords of Clearwind Temple can move much faster
than us. It’ll take us half a year to reach Vastheaven Palace, but
that’ll be more than enough time for them to catch up to us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning nodded.
He was roughly comparable to ordinary Daolords of the Third Step in
speed, but if they elected to pursue him they would send Daolords who
were skilled in movement techniques or in the manipulation of space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why don’t we take
a roundabout path?” Ning suggested.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s a good
idea,” Pillsaint said immediately. “Vastheaven Palace isn’t
that far off anyhow. I’d rather we take a long detour and spend an
extra year or two. That way, we can avoid some trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Eastherd
revealed a slightly embarrassed look on his face. “There’s…
something else I need to disclose.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please feel free to
say anything,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eastherd waved his
hand, causing another figure to appear on the armored deck of the
flying vessel. It was a very muscular youth whose skin was tinged
with red. Flames were brimming in his eyes, while his head was
completely bald. He actually looked like a Fiendgod who had been
birthed from flames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The youth
immediately fell to his knees.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This gentleman over
here is your uncle-master, Darknorth.” Eastherd introduced the
nearby Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My respects,
Uncle-Master.” The youth was extremely respectful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eastherd continued,
“This is the young disciple I spoke to you about earlier. His name
is Sparrow and he’s quite talented.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To become an Elder
God within twenty thousand years of cultivation… he is indeed quite
talented,” Ning praised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This disciple of
mine offended Clearwind Temple because he sought to harvest a certain
treasure to rescue his Dao-companion,” Eastherd said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Save his
Dao-companion?” Ning’s heart suddenly shook. He once more glanced
at the flame-wreathed youth before him, his gaze much softer than
before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just now, he begged
me to send him back to his homeland and let him save his
Dao-companion.” Eastherd looked at Ning rather awkwardly. “But my
disciple’s homeland is within a territory that’s close to
Clearwind Temple. It’s entirely possible that we’ll run into one
of their Daolords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “Haha,
I imagine Clearwind Temple wouldn’t expect us to actually dare to
double back! And, based on what I understand, none of those four are
skilled in Numerancy. We’ve already chosen to take a roundabout
path; we might as well first pay a visit to young Sparrow’s
homeland.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you,
uncle-master Darknorth.” Sparrow felt tremendously grateful. He
actually knew that this request of his was rather excessive. This had
started out as a rather minor matter, but things only grew worse and
worse, causing the World-level cultivators of both sides to get
involved. However, he truly was worried about his Dao-companion. He
was afraid that if he took too much time, his Dao-companion’s
truesoul would disperse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A silver flying shuttle
gleamed with light as it hurtled through the emptiness of space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within this flying
shuttle sat a Daolord who was dressed in handsome silver robes.
Behind him stood two World-level cultivators who awaited his
commands. The rules of Clearwind Temple were actually quite strict.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth of
Vastheaven Palace?” The silver-robed Daolord sat there, murmuring
softly to himself. “Such audacity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This ‘Darknorth’
actually dared to attack within the territory under our control. He
really is courting death,” one of the World-level disciples below
him said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t
underestimate him.” The silver-robed Daolord said calmly, “Based
on what I saw when I inverted the flows of spacetime, Darknorth was
actually able to defeat the five of them with just his sword-intent
alone. He even has two Daolords of the First Step as his retainers.
He most likely has reached incredible heights in the Dao of the
Sword. He may have even mastered a Supreme Dao!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But… no matter
what, he’s still just a World-level cultivator. When facing me, the
only result will be his death.” The silver-robed Daolord was quite
confident. He was a Daolord of the Third Step. Not even the likes of
Bertulu or Eastcult would be able to match him unless they first
broke through to become Daolords of the First Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given what a high
level of enlightenment he has reached, he must have had many strange
encounters.” The silver-robed Daolord silently calculated what he
should do. “I’ll capture him first. By then, his treasures will
be mine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A flying vessel landed
atop an ice-locked, ice-covered region. The cultivators who emerged
from the vessel where Ji Ning, Pillsaint, Su Youji, Eastherd, and
Elder God Sparrow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is one of the
dangerous areas in my homeland,” Sparrow said. “This entire
region is completely ice-locked, up to a distance of eight hundred
million kilometers. Below it is an essence of utter cold. I sent my
Dao-companion deep into that essence, relying on its power to seal
her away into ice and ensure that the poison in her body slows its
spread.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning swept out his
godsense, only to discover that there was indeed a cave hidden
extremely deep within the ice. Within lay a woman who was sealed in
ice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go. Hurry up and
save your Dao-companion,” Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dumb kid, why didn’t
you just ask me to come save your Dao-companion? Why did you have to
take the risk of harvesting the antidote?” Eastherd shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I couldn’t find
you, Master,” Sparrow said in a low voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eastherd was
speechless. Although he had been occasionally watching his disciple
in secret, he had spent the majority of the past twenty thousand
years in secluded meditation. As his disciple grew increasingly
powerful, Eastherd spent less and less time watching over him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Sparrow’s
Dao-companion had been in danger, Sparrow had wanted to ask his
master for assistance. However, he couldn’t even locate his master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and go,”
Eastherd barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Sparrow
didn’t dare to say anything else. He immediately used an evasion
skill to delve deep into the icy ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Enough time passed for
a kettle of tea to be boiled. Two figures suddenly appeared out of
nowhere atop the ice, one tall and muscular, the other slender and
petite. The tall one was naturally Sparrow, while the slender one was
a green-robed woman. The affection and love between the two was
clearly quite deep, and it would only grow stronger after sharing
this tribulation together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Master.
Thank you, Uncle-Master. Thank you for saving our lives.” Sparrow
fell to his knees, as did the green-robed woman next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Eastherd
accepted the obeisance in a calm manner. He had nearly died this
time, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled and nodded,
but he had a complicated look in his eyes. These two Dao-companions
had been reunited… but how long would it be before him and Yu Wei
would be?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji glanced at
Ning, a hint of a blissful smile on her face. “Although the person
in Master’s heart is not me, at least I’m the only one who
follows him and am the one by his side from dawn til dusk. It is
enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Because of you, I
ended up fighting multiple World-level cultivators of Clearwind
Temple. In fact, I’m afraid that even their Daolords might be
getting involved now.” Eastherd continued, “Sparrow, my disciple,
I’m afraid that Clearwind Temple isn’t going to just give up on
chasing you. They are now chasing after both me and your
uncle-master, and they’ll probably take revenge upon you as well.
But… it’s for the best, I suppose. Come with me to Vastheaven
Palace. As for your homeland, take what you can with you. The
Vastheaven Territory is quite vast indeed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.”
Sparrow and his Dao-companion both understood. That very day, the two
of them teleported away some large continents, mountains, and rivers,
then joined Ning and Eastherd in leaving this land and heading forth
towards Vastheaven Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
more than four years went past since Ning’s clash against Clearwind
Temple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A silver shuttle was
halted in midair within the emptiness of space.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, if we
advance any further we’ll be in the Vastheaven Territory.” Two of
the World-level disciples were rather uneasy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Vastheaven
Territory.” The silver-robed Daolord, Daolord Blesswind, stared off
into the distance. Indeed, the territory up ahead was the Vastheaven
Territory!

Chapter 7 – Blame Your Own Poor Luck
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, what should
we do? Should we charge into Vastheaven Territory?” The two
World-level disciples both looked towards the silver-robed Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-robed
Daolord smiled coldly. “I have two ideas. Listen to them and tell
me which one you would choose. The first is for us to enter the
Vastheaven Territory, then wait for them at the spacetime transfer
array at the Vastheaven Everworld! That way, it doesn’t matter
which territory Eastherd and Darknorth travel from; in the end, they
still have to go through the array to go to the Vastheaven
Everworld.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Vastheaven
Everworld was Vastheaven Palace’s base.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we just wait for
them by that spacetime transfer array, we are guaranteed to catch
them,” the silver-robed Daolord said. “Vastheaven Palace is some
distance away from the spacetime transfer array. Even if we were to
be discovered, we’d be able to flee in time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of the two
World-level disciples turned pale. They were essentially going to
enter the enemy base? That was suicide!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But of course,
Daolord Battlemaster of Vastheaven Palace is skilled in Numerancy. If
and when he discovers that we are within the Vastheaven Everworld,
he’ll begin to plot against us. His plots are quite terrifying.”
The silver-robed Daolord continued, “Even if we escape, he’d
probably catch us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“R-r-right. If
Daolord Battlemaster plots against us, we might not be able to
escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, entering the
Vastheaven Everworld is too risky.” Both of the World-level
disciples urged him to reconsider.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second method.”
The silver-robed Daolord waved his hand, causing a furled star map to
appear by his side in the air. The star map slowly opened up, and the
silver-robed Daolord stared at it. “No matter what path they take,
they still have to return to the Vastheaven Everworld. Although there
are four possible routes back to the Vastheaven Everworld, there’s
two main nodes which they have to travel past.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One node is right
here, at the dimensional storms which we went past. The other is over
here, through this vortex tunnel. If they wish to return to the
Vastheaven Everworld, they’ll either have to go through either the
dimensional storms or pass through this vortex,” the silver-robed
Daolord said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His two disciples both
nodded. This was how travel through the vast territories worked.
There were many areas you could avoid, but some critical junctures
were unavoidable. Your only option was to slowly fly through them or
possibly teleport through them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But there are two
possible places. There’s no way we can stop them.” The two
disciples looked at their master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So choose one,”
the silver-robed Daolord said. “The rest is up to luck.” He
chuckled. “If they are lucky and chose the other route, there’s
nothing we can do. If they just so happen to choose the place which
we are guarding, then we’ll be in a position to block their path.
Both of these places are fairly far away from Vastheaven Palace.
We’ll be in a position of much greater security.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-robed
Daolord looked at his two disciples. “Shall we go to the Vastheaven
Everworld, or shall we go to one of the two nodes on the star map?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The nodes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s choose the
nodes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of his disciples
immediately chose the nodes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even an idiot would
know that if they chose the Vastheaven Everworld, they would most
likely be forced to wait at the spacetime transfer array for quite
some time! Given their master’s power as a Daolord of the Third
Step, he’d be able to immediately capture Eastherd and Darknorth
once they emerged within the formation, then immediately flee. This
solution had a high chance of success, true… but it was simply too
dangerous to spend that much time at Vastheaven Palace’s base.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then we’ll
choose…” The silver-robed Daolord gently tapped at a point on the
unfurled star map. “This place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two disciples
immediately looked at where he pointed. Their master’s finger was
tapping against the vortex tunnel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s group had
taken a very roundabout path, making a journey of half a year become
a journey of nearly two years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Up ahead is the
vortex tunnel.” Eastherd was standing at the ship’s prow, staring
at the emptiness of space before them. He pointed at an enormous,
pitch-black vortex off in the distance. “Once we go through the
vortex, we’ll be able to reach Vastheaven Palace in roughly half a
month.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Almost there.”
Ning revealed a smile. Vastheaven Palace! He had waited far too long
for this day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the vessel, Sparrow
and his Dao-companion had been behaving in a very low-key manner.
There were four others on this flying vessel, after all. One was
Sparrow’s master, the second was his uncle-master, and the other
two were Daolords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciple.”
Eastherd looked at Sparrow as he spoke. “There are no generational
hierarchies in Vastheaven Palace. We are all brothers, which is why
we are very cautious when accepting new brothers into our fold!
Formal members are only given a single talisman of welcome, and mine
was given to my first disciple long ago. For now, just stay with me
within Vastheaven Palace. This can be considered a new, tempering
experience for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” Sparrow and
his Dao-companion immediately said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But of course, the
two of you could also beg brother Darknorth for a chance,” Eastherd
said with a laugh. “Your uncle-master Darknorth is probably going
to become a Daolord soon! Once he does, he’ll be the fourth Palace
Lord of Vastheaven Palace. Our Palace Lords have much more authority
than the rest of us; they have the authority to directly welcome new
cultivators into our ranks.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sparrow and his
Dao-companion both immediately looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled. Once he
became a Palace Lord, he’d have a bit more authority, true… but
he still couldn’t just randomly accept in new members. They had to
be cautious with every new recruit. Otherwise, Vastheaven Palace
might end up like some other organizations which were filled with
problems and strife. That would be terrible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle-master
Darknorth…” Sparrow couldn’t help but call out to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This disciple of
mind has a kind disp-…” Eastherd spoke out as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know what type of
a person he is.” Ning nodded. Sparrow was indeed a person who
deeply valued his relationships. He was willing to risk his own life
in order to save his Dao-companion, something which Ning rather
admired. Ning nodded. “I’ll handle Sparrow’s entry into
Vastheaven Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you,
uncle-master!” Sparrow immediately expressed his gratitude.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for his
Dao-companion, Eastherd didn’t say anything on her behalf.
Recruiting people to join Vastheaven Palace wasn’t something to be
done casually.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Ning was only
willing to help out because he approved of Sparrow’s disposition.
As for his Dao-companion? For now, Ning didn’t know what she was
like. He naturally wouldn’t promise anything rashly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying vessel flew
straight into the howling vortex tunnel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the vortex,
space flowed like streams of water which the flying vessel advanced
through at high speeds. Ning couldn’t help but sigh. The vortex
tunnel linking the Three Realms to the Badlands Territory was riddled
with dimensional cracks and tears that would appear at random. It was
an incredibly unstable vortex tunnel. Even World-level cultivators,
if they were unlucky, might be trapped within one of the dimensional
tears and be teleported to a completely unknown location.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This vortex tunnel,
however, was an extremely stable one! The vast territories held both
stable and unstable vortexes; generally speaking, only the stable
ones would be used by cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The exit is up
ahead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying vessel spent
three days flying through the vortex tunnel. Ning stood at the prow
of the vessel, and he was dimly able to see a chaos planet up ahead
in the void of space beyond the exit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying vessel
surged out from the vortex tunnel. But right at this moment… boom!
It was like it had rammed into some sort of barrier which crackled
with dim light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” Ning
was in control of the vessel, and his face instantly turned pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Freeze!” A
sonorous voice rang out, instantly filling the entire region and
causing space itself to be frozen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A silver flying shuttle
flew out from a distant pocket of chaotic space. Ning was able to
clearly make out that there was a silver-robed man standing within
that silver shuttle. He had a grand, imposing aura and was staring
straight at Ning with cold eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s Daolord
Blesswind of Clearwind Temple!” Eastherd was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Blesswind?”
Pillsaint and Su Youji’s faces tightened a bit as well. The two of
them had learned quite a bit about Clearwind Temple on this journey,
and they knew Daolord Blesswind to be one of the temple’s Daolords
of the Third Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At least it isn’t
Patriarch Clearwind.” Ning wasn’t worried at all. The only member
of Clearwind Temple who could pose a threat to him was Patriarch
Clearwind. But of course, if he appeared Ning would simply have to
use up one of his precious Dao-seals to wipe the man out. As for this
Daolord Blesswind? No need to use one of the seals at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth of
Vastheaven Palace and Eastherd of Vastheaven Palace, I believe?” A
silver-robed man emerged from the distant flying shuttle. He slowly
strode through the primordial chaos, his manner grand and imposing.
“Darknorth of Vastheaven. You actually have two Daolords of the
First Step serving you. Impressive, impressive. But since you’ve
chosen to make an enemy out of Clearwind Temple, I’ll have to do
what I have to do. I do want to confirm with you, though… are you
truly a member of Vastheaven Palace?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to Clearwind
Temple’s information, there was no one named ‘Darknorth’
amongst the fairly few formal members of Vastheaven Palace. Given
that Darknorth had two Daolords of the First Step serving as his
retainers, and given that his sword-intent alone was enough to
capture five powerful World-level cultivators, he definitely was far
too strong to be a irrelevant and nameless figure. Logically
speaking, if he was an actual member of Vastheaven Palace, Clearwind
Temple would’ve found out about him long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is our first
time meeting each other. It can be said that we were brought together
by karma.” The white-robed Ning just stood there at the prow of his
flying vessel, his black scabbard on his back. “I, Darknorth, am
indeed a member of Vastheaven Palace. In the future, Clearwind Temple
will remember my name well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the future? I’m
afraid you won’t have a future.” The silver-robed Daolord shook
his head and sighed. “I just randomly chose a place to wait for
you. Who would’ve thought I’d end up actually catching a genius
such as yourself? If you have to blame anything, blame your own bad
luck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, no. You are the
one with bad luck.” Ning smiled, but his smile was as cold as ice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s flying vessel
instantly charged towards the silver-robed Daolord at high speeds.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 8 – Inside Vastheaven Palace
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impudence.” The
silver-robed Daolord laughed coldly. “You really don’t know your
own limits.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he spoke, he waved
his right hand casually through the void of space. His sleeves
instantly began to flutter as a black wind flew out from within it,
instantly filling the surrounding area for a million kilometers
around then sweeping straight towards Ji Ning’s charging vessel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aboard the vessel, Su
Youji and Pillsaint both had solemn looks on their faces. As for
Eastherd, he was panicking. Sparrow and his wife simply watched.
Elder Gods weren’t even qualified to take part in a battle at this
level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just let out a
cold snort. Rumble… lightning and water suddenly surged out of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden lightning
and the jade-green water instantly burst out into the void, and they
actually seemed to twine around each other in a complementary manner
as they almost instantly transformed into sword-light! Endless
amounts of sword-light furiously merged together, coalescing into the
Yin-Yang Sword Domain. At his current level, Ning’s Yin-Yang Sword
Domain was now more brutal, savage, and terrifying than ever before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Yin-Yang Sword Domain
formed from quadressence lightning and quadressence water was more
than enough to annihilate a Daolord of the Second Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although there was a
big difference in power between a Daolord of the Second Step and a
Daolord of the Third Step, it would still be quite difficult for the
latter to slay the former with ease. Daolord Blesswind was skilled in
the Dao of Wind, and he was able to easily slay Daolords of the
Second Step in close combat. He would not, however, be able to wipe
them out from a distance merely by using a few secret arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, Daolord
Blesswind was nothing more than a Daolord of Clearwind Temple. He
simply didn’t have any earth-shatteringly powerful secret arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword domain
of lightning and water was capable of slaying Daolords of the Second
Step, but this black tempest was not. When these two surges of power
clashed against each other…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooooosh. The
dominating sword domain of water and lightning forcibly ripped the
black tempest into shreds, then continued to surge towards Daolord
Blesswind in a savage manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Daolord
Blesswind’s face instantly turned pale. “Impossible. How could my
secret art be defeated by a World-level cultivator’s secret art?”
This was an absolute joke!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“B-but…” The two
World-level disciples of Daolord Blesswind were completely stupefied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s vessel.
Eastherd, Sparrow, and his Dao-companion had been extremely nervous.
Now, they were just as stupefied as Daolord Blesswind’s disciples.
The secret arts of a Daolord of the Third Step had been broken, just
like that?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pillsaint and Su Youji
glanced at Ning, their eyes filled with veneration and awe. This was
a Daolord of the Third Step! Their own master had actually won in a
competition of secret arts against this figure!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems you must’ve
had some truly lucky encounters. Your Dao-seal was quite powerful…
but it won’t be able to do anything to me.” The silver-robed
Daolord Blesswind quickly regained his calm. He had immediately
decided that Ning must have used a Dao-seal, as he still refused to
believe that a World-level cultivator could possess a secret art of
such unearthly power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And in truth, it made
sense. This sword-intent domain of lightning and water was a product
of many factors. It was created by Daolord Allgod, utilized in
accordance with the [Seven Leafpill Chapters] of the Paragon of
Pills, and controlled by Ning’s powerful azureflower mist energy.
This was why it has such tremendous might!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then die beneath my
blade.” Daolord Blesswind suddenly produced an enormous long saber
in his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! His silver
robes fluttered as he instantly charged through the skies, holding
the long saber in a double-handed grip. Although Ning’s sword
domain furiously assaulted him, Daolord Blesswind charged forwards
with incredible valor, his divine power flaring outwards and
completely resisting the attacks. Clearly, the sword domain wasn’t
nearly strong enough to deal with Daolords of the Third Step; all it
was able to do was have a bit of constrictive power over him. He
moved straight through the sword domain, and his icy gaze was filled
with a murderous intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon seeing this, Ning
couldn’t help but sigh. This Yin-Yang Sword Domain was already his
most powerful attack, on a slightly higher level than even his close
combat abilities. Alas, he still wasn’t able to do anything to his
opponent. In the end, he was still just a World-level cultivator, and
his attacks weren’t enough against a Daolord of the Third Step. He
had no choice but to rely on an outside form of assistance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” Daolord
Blesswind’s saber-light flashed like the wind, tearing apart
everything in its path as he continued to soar towards the vessel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Suddenly, a
figure appeared out of nowhere in front of the flying vessel. It was
a white-haired, icy-eyed man who held an ordinary-looking longsword
in his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go capture him,
swordsman,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The
white-haired man nodded, his face quite calm. He was the strongest of
the four golem servants Ning had acquired from Emperor Mirrorsnow’s
legacy! Ning had chosen to summon him out of an abundance of caution,
wishing to have a higher chance of success.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A golem?” As
Daolord Blesswind continued his charge, his gaze fell upon the
white-haired man’s body. He was able to immediately tell that this
was a golem, and a flash of avarice appeared in his eyes. “Not only
did he have that incredibly powerful lightning-water Dao-seal, he
also has a seemingly strong golem. This World God named Darknorth
truly must have had some special experiences. I’ll wager he has
quite a few treasures on him. He might even have more than me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, golem! You
should accept me as your master instead.” Daolord Blesswind’s
aura expanded even further. He refused to believe he would encounter
a golem comparable to a Daolord of the Fourth Step, as those were far
too valuable. He wasn’t worried about this golem at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
swordsman charged towards Daolord Blesswind as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Space tore apart as
Daolord Blesswind and the swordsman golem began an utterly
earth-shaking battle, even as Ning’s sword domain continuously
launched attacks against the Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The swordsman had the
power of a peak Daolord of the Third Step, and he was skilled in both
unpredictable attacks and assassination techniques. His technique was
completely based off of Emperor Mirrorsnow’s [Heartseal] sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Blesswind was
truly quite formidable in close combat. Although he wasn’t exactly
a genius, he still had the power of a peak Daolord of the Third Step.
He might’ve been weaker than the swordsman in close combat, making
the battle rather difficult, but his secret arts allowed him to hold
his own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a powerful
golem. How can it be this powerful? I feel as though he’s a bit
more powerful than even me!” Daolord Blesswind was stunned to
discover that the golem actually had the upper hand. “However… he
just barely holds an advantage over me. This golem is using up the
chaos jewels inside of him. Once his energy is used up, he’ll
lose.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning frowned
when he saw this from atop his distant vessel. “The swordsman is
already the strongest of my four golems, but he still can’t capture
Daolord Blesswind? It seems I’ll have to have the fisherman and the
emperor emerge as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But right at this
moment, Su Youji suddenly clenched her teeth. She was standing right
next to Ning, and her face instantly turned red as a streak of
crimson light flickered in her eyes. An invisible ripple of power
instantly surged through the skies and shot towards the distant
Daolord Blesswind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Daolord
Blesswind, who was still engaged in a battle against the swordsman,
suddenly moved sluggishly for a brief moment, as though he had been
distracted for a moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! The swordsman
already held the upper hand. In this moment, his longsword suddenly
coiled outwards like a whip, instantly wrapping itself around Daolord
Blesswind’s body. Daolord Blesswind struggled furiously to break
free, but that was no easy feat upon already being bound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come in.” The
swordsman produced a gourd in his hand, then caused it to emit a
powerful attractive force that drew Daolord Blesswind into it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The swordsman turned
his head to glance at Ning, then was drawn back into the estate-world
within the Mirrorsnow Painting once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two World-level
disciples in the silver shuttle were completely stunned. They were
also completely surrounded by that sword domain of lightning and
water. They knew exactly how powerful this sword domain was, and so
they didn’t dare to fight back at all, allowing Ning to capture
them as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We won.” A look of
completely disbelief was on Eastherd’s face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“T-that was…”
Sparrow and his wife were both stunned as well. They felt that this
uncle-master was simply far too powerful. He was a World-level
cultivator who not only had two Daolord retainers, he had even been
able to capture a Daolord of the Third Step. They had never even
heard of such power before!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled. “I had
to rely on the power of my golem. I myself wouldn’t have been able
to defeat a Daolord of the Third Step.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Golems are part of
your total power as well,” Eastherd said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning then glanced at
the nearby Flamefairy Su Youji. She gave him a very smug wink.
Eastherd and the others might not have noticed anything, but Ning was
in control of the sword domain that covered this entire region; he
was able to sense that ripple of invisible power surge outwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quite impressive,”
Ning congratulated mentally. “You were able to shake a Daolord of
the Third Step.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just now, I used the
ninth art of Feixian. I’m confident in my abilities to shake
Daolords of the Second Step. As for those of the third step, it
depends on their mental strength and their heartforce. If I
encountered someone formidable in this regard, there would be nothing
I could do. From the looks of things, this Daolord Blesswind didn’t
have a particularly impressive Dao-heart,” Su Youji sent back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but sigh. The legacy of Feixian the Exalted truly was incredible. It
allowed the user to actually dominate and control those on the same
level of power! Even if the target was on a higher level of power, it
would still have an effect on that person. But of course, if you
encountered someone with a particularly powerful heart, there would
be nothing you could do. Heartlord Solewind, for instance, would’ve
been far more impressive against such secret arts than Daolord
Blesswind, even when he was merely at the World level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After capturing Daolord
Blesswind, Ning continued to advance. Half a month later, he arrived
at the Vastheaven Everworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That right there is
Vastheaven Palace.” Eastherd pointed at the peaks of a distant
mountain range. One could see a cluster of palaces through the many
clouds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Vastheaven Palace?”
Ning stared at the distant Vastheaven Palace, his breathing rather
irregular. Some tears had appeared in his eyes as well. Ever since he
had left the Three Realms, he had been hoping he would be able to
make it to Vastheaven Palace. And now… he had finally made it! His
Primaltwin was finally going to be able to make it back to the Three
Realms and search for the souls of his parents within the River of
Destiny.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Father. Mother…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this moment, Ning’s
mind was not present here in Vastheaven Palace. It was completely
focused upon his deceased mother and father.

Chapter 9 – Within Vastheaven Palace
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ji Ning’s
group soared through the void as they flew towards Vastheaven Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already sent
a mental message to the other brothers of Vastheaven Palace,”
Eastherd said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
stared towards the direction of the distant palace. As for Pillsaint
and Su Youji, both were quite curious as well. What was it like, this
place which their master had been planning to go to for so long?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sparrow and his wife
were the most nervous. To them, Vastheaven Palace was absolutely a
sacred place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that…” As
they flew closer and closer, Ning realized that there were quite a
few figures congregating around the palace gates of Vastheaven
Palace. Three of the ones standing at the very front radiated
Daolord-level auras.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother
Solesky?” Ning immediately recognized Daolord Solesky, who stood at
the very front of the group. “But the aura seems a bit different.
Ah, this must be his avatar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning!” Daolord
Solesky laughed heartily, his laughter echoing within the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother
Solesky.” Ning was filled with delight as he led Pillsaint and Su
Youji to descend towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Long time no see.
And you’ve already reached the World level!” Daolord Solesky
nodded in a satisfied manner as he looked at Ning, then turned his
gaze to Pillsaint and Su Youji. The two were standing behind Ning,
but there was no way he could ignore their presence. The two were
already Daolords, after all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky said,
“Youji, it’s only been a short while since we last met. Who
would’ve thought you’d train even faster than Ji Ning? You’ve
already become a Daolord!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky and Su
Youji were old friends by now. When he had taught Ning, he had also
provided Su Youji with guidance on occasion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was all thanks to
Master’s aid that I reached this level,” Su Youji said. “And
Master has always been stronger than me. Even though I am now a
Daolord, I’m still inferior to Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth
truly is formidable,” the nearby Eastherd hastily interjected. “I
didn’t have a chance to let you know, since I just returned, but I
was beset upon by five World-level cultivators of Clearwind Temple.
Thankfully, brother Darknorth intervened and helped me out, allowing
me to escape that predicament. Just by using his sword-intent alone,
he was able to easily capture the five of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clearwind Temple?”
A white-robed, blue-haired man standing next to Daolord Solesky
suddenly frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Battlemaster, we can
discuss these minor matters later,” Solesky interrupted. “The
most important thing for us to do today is to formally welcome
brother Ji Ning into our ranks.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt quite moved.
Although he hadn’t spent much time alongside Solesky, the latter
truly had treated him in a sincere manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, it wasn’t
easy for you to travel all the way here from the Badlands Territory.
Back then, Su Youji was an Elder God, but now even she has become a
Daolord. I imagine you must have experienced many things,” Solesky
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too true.” Ning
shook his head, rather wistful. “Shortly after I found out that you
were trapped in the Waveshift Realm, I elected to leave the Badlands
Territory. Logically speaking, I should’ve reached Vastheaven
Palace a long time ago, but midway through I was suddenly abducted by
the almighty Hegemon of the Brightshore Kingdom and taken there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t hide
anything. Given how strong he had become, there was no way to hide
such information. Take Lord Dawnstar as an example. Anyone in the
Endless Territories who was even slightly well-informed knew who he
was. Who could possibly be unaware that he was the Palace Lord of the
Saber Palace of the Twelve Palaces of Brightshore?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Brightshore
Kingdom?” Daolord Solesky was completely shocked. The Brightshore
Kingdom was one of the six major powers of the Endless Territories,
and the almighty Brightshore Hegemon was publicly acknowledged as
being the leader of the three Hegemons! For mighty figures such as
Verge-level Daolords, the fact that the Brightshore Kingdom would
occasionally abduct a few cultivators wasn’t exactly a secret.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Being abducted by
the Brightshore Kingdom can be incredibly dangerous, but… judging
from the looks of things, it turned into quite a blessing for you, Ji
Ning.” Solesky looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha. It was indeed.
I encountered Pillsaint in the Brightshore Kingdom.” Ning glanced
at the nearby Pillsaint.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pillsaint felt a bit
embarrassed. He immediately said, “I, uh, was probably the first
person to fight against Master in the Brightshore Kingdom.
Unfortunately, he beat me with ease. To be honest, the Flamefairy and
I only gained our freedom thanks to Master’s assistance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While Ning and Solesky
were chatting, the other brothers of Vastheaven Palace were carefully
inspecting this new brother of theirs. When they heard the two
Daolords address him as ‘master’, they were quite stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Monsters like this only
existed in legends. Who would’ve thought that they’d encounter
one in the flesh?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Ji Ning is
incredibly talented, but he’s never had a good master.” Solesky
chuckled. “In Brightshore Kingdom, you truly would’ve had the
chance to soar into the heavens. Hahaha… I’ve been so busy
chatting with you that I forgot to make the introductions. Come,
come! This gentleman here is our Daolord Battlemaster, and he is also
a Daolord of the Fourth Step.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned to look at
the long blue-haired man dressed in white robes. The man had a warm
smile on his face and an extraordinary demeanor. Ning immediately
bowed and said, “Darknorth greets you, big brother Battlemaster.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Daolord of the Fourth
Step had essentially reached the apex of a certain Dao. After that
was the Eternal Emperor level. Daolords of the Fourth Step were never
easy to deal with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I once tried to use
Numerancy to divine your future, brother Darknorth, only to find that
everything was clouded and far beyond my abilities to see.” Daolord
Battlemaster smiled. “Now that I see you have two Daolord
retainers, I understand how truly extraordinary you are. If my
calculations are correct, these two Daolords should have broken
through naturally, rather than relying on Pseudo Samsara Pills.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They broke through
on their own?” The other brothers of Vastheaven Palace were all
rather speechless. When they had seen two Daolords of the First Step,
they had assumed that both had relied on Pseudo Samsara Pills.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The stronger Ji Ning
is, the better. Vastheaven Palace has gained yet another powerful
brother!” Solesky introduced the next person. “This gentleman
next to me is our newly ascended Daolord, Daolord Brightfish. He is
now a Daolord of the Second Step.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.”
Daolord Brightfish smiled at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt quite
startled, but on the surface he responded in a very calm manner, “Big
brother Brightfish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Brightfish was
absolutely gorgeous! In terms of appearance, he was every bit the
equal of Su Youji. It must be remembered that Su Youji trained in the
techniques of Feixian the Exalted, and possessed such great charm
that her smiles alone were incredibly alluring. Although Daolord
Brightfish wasn’t that charming, he truly was shockingly handsome,
and he was also had a willowy, elegant form. And yet… judging from
his aura, Ning was certain that he was male!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His face and his body
was comparable to that of a peerless beauty, but he was a man? No
wonder Ning was so flabbergasted!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is Brightfish’s
avatar,” Solesky said. “Brightfish himself is adventuring in the
outside world. He’s far more talented than both myself and
Battlemaster.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You praise me too
much, big brother,” Daolord Brightfish hurriedly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Solesky laughed loudly.
“Not at all, not at all. Ji Ning, as for our other brothers… I’ll
introduce you to them later, over some drinks and conversation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded but
couldn’t help but ask, “What about the three Wujiao Godbeasts?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone fell silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky let out
a sigh. “Northrest… ugh. Those three Wujiao Godbeasts caused
Northrest’s death. Vastheaven Palace would never let them off for
that. Although they fled long ago, Battlemaster was able to use his
Numerancy to divine their location. The three of them were wiped out
by us long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so a question that
had plagued Ning for quite some time was answered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next was the welcoming
banquet, where all the brothers of Vastheaven Palace gathered
together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all drank wine and
chatted happily. Vastheaven Palace had no hierarchies; every single
member was a good brother to the others. Even Daolords would merely
be respectfully addressed as ‘big brother’ due to their power.
This was just the type of atmosphere Ning liked, and he could sense
that everyone treated him with sincerity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Over the course of the
banquet, Ning got to know more than half of the brothers of
Vastheaven Palace, as well as some who were still adventuring in the
outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the banquet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, Vastheaven
Palace is quite a large place. We have many residences within it,
most of which are empty. This one, this one, that one, and that one…
all of them are free for the choosing. Just pick whichever one you
like.” After the banquet, Solesky personally guided Ning off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then I’ll choose
this one.” Ning made his choice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. When do you
wish for us to hold the formal welcoming ceremony?” Solesky looked
at Ning. Technically, Ning simply had the talisman of welcome; he
hadn’t actually joined Vastheaven Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A month from now,”
Ning said. Right now, the most important task before him was
resurrecting his parents.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Solesky
was in no rush. To cultivators, a month truly was nothing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Vastheaven Palace.
Within the Darknorth estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pillsaint, Youji, I
need to go into secluded meditation for a period of time. If there’s
nothing important, do not disturb me,” Ning instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.”
Pillsaint and Su Youji both acknowledged the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, then
entered his meditation chambers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… the doors to
the meditation chambers swung shut. Ning sat down in the lotus
position, then closed his eyes. His mind was completely focused on
the distant Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The primordial chaos
outside the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black-robed Ji Ning
was striding through the dimensions. He quickly emerged from his own
estate and arrived in the void of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
stepped into yet another dimension as he stood there within the Three
Realms, sensing the fluctuations rippling through it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had been far, far
too long since he had entered the Three Realms and the area of
influence its essences held sway over. For many years now, this had
been a forbidden area for him. If he dared to take so much as a
single step into it, he would’ve died and his Dao would’ve
vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three Realms.”
The black-robed Ning swept his gaze across the three thousand major
worlds and the trillions of minor worlds. Even everything within the
Celestial Realm and the Netherworld Kingdom was contained within his
gaze.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 10 – The Three Realms
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ji
Ning’s gaze was focused upon a river that flowed through the void.
This river… was the River of Destiny.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Destiny was
omnipresent. All living beings had their own destiny. Even powerful
cultivators like Ning or mighty Eternal Emperors had their own
destinies as well. So long as you were alive, you would have a
destiny all your own! These countless destinies came together to form
an endless Sea of Destiny, with the destiny of the living beings of
the Three Realms being merely a small rivulet of that endless sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This void river was all
but indetectible to ordinary living creatures, but Ning was able to
see countless truesouls flowing through that great river.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning swept the
river searchingly with his gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father. Mother!”
Ning suddenly revealed a look of excitement on his face. He had
discovered two truesouls which were located right next to each other,
rising and falling through the ‘waves’ of the river together.
Ning was very familiar with the auras given off by those two
truesouls. He would never be able to forget them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those truesouls were
the truesouls belonging to his father and his mother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only major powers who
had personally seen Yuchi Snow and Ji Yichuan would be able to locate
their truesouls within the endless flow of truesouls in the River of
Destiny.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Freeze!” Ning sent
out his will. Rumble… an invisible, powerful stream of sword-intent
that was as gentle as water instantly encompassed the entire River of
Destiny, causing it to come to a complete halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Merely seeing the River
of Destiny was easy, but to draw truesouls out from within it and
then revive them was incredibly difficult. This was because such an
action represented going against the will of the heavens and changing
the flows of destiny; it went against the very laws of the Three
Realms themselves. However, Ning was now powerful enough to
annihilate the Three Realms with ease; he was naturally able to
easily accomplish a task like this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still… if Ning’s
parents had perished in an Everworld, there would be no way for Ning
to retrieve their truesouls from that Everworld’s River of Destiny!
This was because the repercussions of breaking an Everworld’s laws
were far greater. Most likely, only Eternal Emperors and outlandishly
strong Daolords would be able to resist those repercussions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The River of Destiny
had been frozen in place. None of the countless mortal denizens in
the Three Realms could sense the laws of the Three Realms trying to
fight back, but the more powerful Immortals and Fiendgods of the
Three Realms could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Crescent world.
Mount Innerheart. Two figures were seated opposite of each other,
holding a casual conversation regarding the world and the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? The River of
Destiny just came to a halt?” The bearded, azure-haired man
suddenly let out a surprised call.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Most likely, only my
disciple Ji Ning is capable of forcing the River of Destiny to come
to a halt.” Opposite the first man was a white-haired,
white-bearded old man – Subhuti.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These two were
currently the two strongest members of the Three Realms. One was
Ning’s master, Subhuti, who had been ranked the top master of the
Dao of Spacetime in all the Three Realms. Ever since Fuxi, Shennong,
Suiren, Daoist Three Purities, Lord Tathagata, Houyi, and the others
had all sacrificed themselves in the Endwar, Subhuti had become the
number one expert of the entire Nuwa Alliance. But of course, that
was excluding Ji Ning, who had long ago reached the World level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other man was the
Lord of All Fiends of the Seamless Gate. He was now their sole
leader, ‘Windfiend’… and he had long ago surpassed the limits
of the Heavenly Daos in movement speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both were at extremely
high levels of enlightenment and were far superior to most Elder Gods
and Ancestral Immortals in this regard. Ever since Ning had reached
the World level, he began to transmit many techniques back to the
Three Realms! With those techniques guiding them, they instantly
became far more powerful than they had been in the past. At present,
they had reached such a high level of insight that they were able to
break through to the World level whenever they wished. This was why
they often sat together to discuss the Dao with each other. When all
of their arrangements and preparations were complete, they would
break through to the World level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It really is Ji
Ning.” Windfiend’s divine sense instantly spread out across all
the Three Realms, discovering the black-robed Ning standing in the
void of the Three Realms. He could sense that stately, awe-inspiring
aura of majesty radiating out from Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
Subhuti waved a finger, causing a spatial vortex to appear next to
them. Whoosh! The two both entered the spatial vortex, then hastened
towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The River of Destiny
froze?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mt. Ling, in the
eastern lands of the Celestial Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Buddha Maitreya sat
above all others. He was now the new Lord Buddha of the Buddhist
Sangha. He had always had a very high level of enlightenment, being
just slightly inferior to Lord Tathagata himself. Ever since Ji Ning
had transmitted many new techniques to the Three Realms, he had grown
much more powerful and was second only to the likes of Subhuti and
Windfiend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fruit-Flower Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heeeey, it’s my
junior apprentice-brother!” The Monkey King had been munching away
at his food when he suddenly froze, then revealed a look of delight.
“Time to go take a look!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sun Wukong was an
incredibly talented figure, and he was now one of the top ten figures
of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Jade Cauldron,
Kuafu, Holyflame, Bloodswan, Amitabha, and the other experts of the
Three Realms all sensed the ripples and immediately hastened over
there as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
stood there amidst the void of the Three Realms. He could sense space
rippling in the area around him as one figure after another began to
emerge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His master, Subhuti.
His senior apprentice-brothers Sun Wukong and Silvermoon. Buddha
Maitreya. Buddha Amitabha. Jade Cauldron. Bloodswan. They all began
to appear, one after another, and Ning nodded in their direction. As
for these Immortals and Fiendgods, they just watched afar, not moving
to intervene. Ever since Ning had broken through to the World level,
he had continuously transmitted techniques back to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Ning was
quite amazed. The cultivators of the Three Realms weren’t
necessarily all monstrous geniuses, but on the whole they were
clearly far more talented than cultivators from other chaosworlds!
The Three Sovereigns of Mankind, Daoist Three Purities, Tathagata,
Houyi… without any guidance or legacies, they had reached such
astonishingly great heights in enlightenment that they were able to
battle against Elder Gods despite merely being at the True God level!
This meant they were at a far higher level of enlightenment than most
Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If they were given good
techniques or good teachers… the Three Sovereigns of Mankind,
Daoist Three Purities, Lord Tathagata, Houyi, and the others all
could’ve become World-level cultivators! It must be understood that
Buddha Jueming originally hadn’t been a particularly impressive
member of the Buddhist Sangha; his innate talent was far inferior to
the likes of Daoist Three Purities, Tathagata, and the others. It had
been very hard for him to even reach the True God level! However,
after spending many arduous years in Undermoon Lake as an Empyrean
God, he had received the legacy techniques of World God Northrest and
had thus been able to reach the Elder God level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a testament to
how important good techniques and good teachers were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It wasn’t just the
Three Realms; even the experts of the Seamless Chaosworld, such as
Everwood, Demonheart, Devilhand, and Windfiend were also extremely
spectacular figures who were comparable to Daoist Three Purities and
Lord Tathagata.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Pangu Chaosworld
and the Seamless Chaosworld… the cultivators who arose from it are
all far more talented and impressive than the cultivators in other
chaosworlds.” Ning was secretly amazed. “There has to be a reason
behind it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The endless primordial
chaos was filled with mysteries and secrets. No one would ever dare
claim that he or she fully understand it. Not even the almighty
Hegemon could make that claim, and so Ning didn’t spend too much
time on this question.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve now perfectly
joined five Supreme Daos together. After I become a Daolord, I’ll
become much more powerful. By then, I should be able to buy some
truly precious legacies and techniques, then transmit them to the
Three Realms and strengthen it,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The techniques he had
previously transmitted were all fairly ordinary. He had also
transmitted a few ordinary techniques left behind by Northrest. As
for the more valuable legacies? Ning had learned quite a few! He had
learned from Emperor Mirrorsnow, had viewed the eighty thousand-plus
sword-arts in the sword pagodas of the Sword Palace, and had acquired
the legacy of a deceased Hegemon as well as the [Seven Leafpill
Chapters]. However, he had sworn lifeblood oaths to never divulge any
of them to others. Even though he was able to teach the first chapter
of the [Seven Leafpill Chapters] to others, that chapter only
pertained to the Dao of Alchemy. How many cultivators truly focused
in this Dao? Too few!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you wished to truly
strengthen an organization, you needed all types of techniques and
legacies, especially powerful ones. This was no easy task.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prior to today, I’ve
only been able to transmit fairly ordinary techniques back, but the
Three Realms has already strengthened dramatically. Master and
Windfiend are about to break through to the World level at any
moment, while Maitreya and the others might succeed as well. If I was
able to transmit better techniques to them… my homeland might give
birth to an entire crop of World-level cultivators.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning eagerly awaited
such a day, the day when the Three Realms truly skyrocketed in
prominence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to focus
upon the River of Destiny. His gentle sword-intent moved with
incredible softness, but it contained unbelievable power! The gentle
sword-intent carefully embraced those two truesouls within its grip.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire River of
Destiny began to roil about in protest as a backlash began.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was incredibly
careful. He obviously didn’t care about the backlash, but he was
worried that it might cause collateral damage to his parents’
truesouls. Even the slightest bit of damage might cause those frail
truesouls to instantly disintegrate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning’s
sword-intent wrapped those two truesouls in protective layers as it
slowly drew them both from the depths of the River of Destiny.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… the backlash
from the River of Destiny grew increasingly powerful. Towards the
end, the entire river began to writhe about as it fought to hold onto
those two truesouls. Ning’s sword-intent, however continuously
protected the truesouls with layers of barriers, taking on the full
force of the backlash head-on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Finally, the
mass of sword-light flew out from within the River of Destiny. The
River of Destiny had failed, and so it quickly regained its normal
calm and continued to function stably as it had in the past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success.” Subhuti,
Windfiend, Sun Wukong, Jade Cauldron, and the others all revealed
looks of delight when they saw this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth,
congratulations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning,
congratulations.” They all called out to express their
congratulations. Now that the truesouls had been drawn out, the next
step of restoring their souls and manifesting bodies would be easy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t
disguise his own excitement either.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning suppressed his
excitement, then gently waved a finger and sent two streaks of chaos
nectar outwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His Primaltwin didn’t
have much chaos nectar, as it had been here defending the Three
Realms this entire time. It did, however, have at least a few drops.
Since Yuchi Snow and Ji Yichuan’s souls and bodies weren’t
particularly powerful, a single drop of chaos nectar each was more
than enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. The two
drops of chaos nectar flew towards the two different truesouls. The
two drops quickly encompassed the two souls, then immediately and
naturally began to build a soul around each truesoul. Although it was
also possible to use the Six Paths of Reincarnation to form souls and
bodies, those bodies and souls would be of fairly low quality; at
most, they would allow the reincarnated individuals to at most be
equivalent to natural-born Xiantian lifeforms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But if one directly
used chaos nectar to rebuild a body and soul, it would result in the
creation of a completely perfect body!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The souls were now
fully formed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the two
souls rose up to stand there within the emptiness of the void. One
soul was of Yuchi Snow, the other was of Ji Yichuan. The two had
completely regained consciousness, and Ning was using his Immortal
energy to help them awaken the memories locked within their souls. At
his current level of power, Ning was able to help them reawaken their
memories with nothing more than a thought, even though Yuchi Snow and
Ji Yichuan had actually died two lives ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning. Son.” The
two stared at Ning in disbelief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was rather
excited. He immediately said, “Father. Mother. Don’t worry about
me right now. Let your fleshly bodies be remade first. All you need
to do is wish for it to happen. The chaos nectar around you has
marvelous properties and is capable of forming all things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Flesh and even clothes
were beginning to form in the empty area around their souls; there
was of course no way Ning would leave them unclad. Gradually, Ji
Yichuan and Yuchi Snow were able to see many figures off in the
distance. Soon, the two had fully materialized. Clad in snowy white
furs, the two stood there in the emptiness of the void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thing was, Ji
Yichuan and Yuchi Snow actually had an additional set of memories.
This set came from the life they had spent as Willowriver Chuan and
Eastflow Snow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snow.” Ji Yichuan
looked at his wife.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yichuan.” Yuchi
Snow stared back at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had been together
in both the past life and the present life. During her life in
Swallow Mountain, Yuchi Snow had died due to illness. Ji Yichuan had
suffered heavy wounds as well. In the end, he felt he had nothing
else to live for and so had perished as well. The next life had been
an even sadder one; in the end, the curs of the Seamless Gate had
captured everyone in their city and used them to refine magic
treasures, resulting in their souls being shattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Yichun and Yuchi
Snow held each other’s hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning. Son.” They
turned their gazes towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“W-what’s going
on?” Yichuan was completely puzzled. The area around them was
filled with empty space, and they were even able to see figures who
radiated auras of incredible power off in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow was both excited
and puzzled. She had died, as had Yichuan, right? And how was it that
they were able to stand there within the emptiness of space as easily
as standing on flat land? What was supporting them? But they felt
certain that this all had to do with their son.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, Mother. All
those bad things have come to an end. Nothing will be able to
separate us ever again.” Ning’s voice was trembling slightly as
he spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow’s eyes
immediately reddened and she walked straight forwards to embrace
Ning. Ning hugged his mother back as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His mother’s embrace…
it was as warm as it had been in his memories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly raised
his head. His father, Yichuan, had walked over as well, and Ning
reached out to include his father in their joint embrace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their family of three
was together again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Subhuti,
Windfiend, and the other nearby figures, they all sighed as they
watched with looks of envy. Many of them had been born from the
primordial chaos or from Heaven and Earth; they had never had parents
before. However, they could sense how deep the relationship between
Ning and his parents were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he embraced his
father and his mother, the tension which had been within his soul for
so many years was able to finally be released. And in this moment…
Ning’s heartforce broke through to the fifth stage and began to
rapidly expand in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Endwar of the Three
Realms had resulted in Ning finally understanding the Heartsword
Realm and using it to slay Old Man Yuan. Logically speaking, he
should’ve been able to step into the fifth stage of heartforce at
that time. However, he had too many things weighing down his heart,
causing him to be stuck at that bottleneck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After leaving the Three
Realms, he had entered the Endless Territories. He had experienced
many things in the Brightshore Kingdom and the alternate universe,
eventually linking five Supreme Daos together in a perfect manner.
His mind and his heart had both been strengthened tremendously, but
he still remained stuck at that bottleneck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His heart had never
been able to see through to the ‘truth’ of life. Now, after
reaching Vastheaven Palace and rescuing his parents truesouls from
the River of Destiny, Ning was finally able to truly relax. As a
result, he naturally reached the ‘truth’ level of heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning did have another
firm desire in the deepest parts of his heart… reviving Yu Wei!
However, he knew exactly how difficult that would be. Even the number
one expert in the Dao of Seals in the alternate universe, Emperor
Maniseal, had been unable to revive his own disciple. Ning had never
heard of someone successfully doing such a thing, which was a
testament to how difficult it would be. But precisely because it was
so difficult, Ning was able to face it fairly calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! His heartforce
massively expanded. The many things he had experienced in recent
years caused Ning’s heartforce to instantly skyrocket and reach the
apex of the fifth stage. His heartforce and his sea of consciousness
joined together, causing certain changes to arise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If his heartforce was a
bit stronger, the fusion between his heartforce and his sea of
consciousness would’ve allowed him to establish a heartworld. Only
by establishing a heartworld would one be truly considered a
Heartforce Cultivator, and those were truly, incredibly frightening
figures. Heartforce Cultivators who had reached the Verge as Daolords
would have heartworlds that were as vast as an entire territory. At
this point, the descent of their heartworld projection alone would
benough to easily crush to death an ordinary Verge-level Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But using a heartworld
projection was merely the crudest way of fighting with heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Heartforce
Cultivators had certain mysterious secret arts which were truly
formidable. Bertulu, Eastcult, and Greatjoy had all mastered and
joined multiple Supreme Daos together, but Bertulu was a Heartforce
Cultivator! In an actual battle, he would’ve been stronger than
both of the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Bertulu had managed
to fully learn the [Heartsword] sword-art and learned how to
perfectly mesh his heartforce with his close combat abilities, his
powers would’ve skyrocketed even further. Alas, the [Heartsword]
sword-art was extremely difficult. Ning himself was a sword
cultivator who was also skilled in heartforce, which was why he had
been able to reach a basic level of skill in it, but Bertulu was not!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The void above the
Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan and Snow both
released their son, then smiled as they gazed at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son. Tell us
what in the world is going on. Your mother and I are both completely
confused,” Yichuan said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The story is a long
one. I trust both of you know about the Seamless Gate,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate.”
Yichuan and Snow both turned very solemn. “We’ve heard of them.
The stories say that they are the ones causing chaos throughout the
Three Realms.” The two of them had died due to the machination of
the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. That had been
a true tribulation, and many of our seniors perished during it,”
Ning said softly. He couldn’t help but think back to that grand
final battle and those figures who had calmly sacrificed their own
lives. “But that war ended long ago. The Three Realms is now
peaceful once more. I was bound by a lifeblood oath and so I wasn’t
able to retrieve your truesouls from the River of Destiny until
today. Only then could I bring you back to life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“River of Souls?
Truesoul?” Both Yichuan and Snow were a bit dazed. Neither of them
had reached high levels of cultivation in either of their two lives.
They had no idea that someone whose soul had been shattered could be
brought back to life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, Mother. We
can discuss these things later in the privacy of our home.” Ning
smiled, then turned and looked at the nearby figures. He called out,
“Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti flew over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Yichuan and Yuchi
Snow. The two of you certainly gave birth to a wonderful son,”
Daofather Subhuti said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, Mother, this
person here is my master, Patriarch Subhuti,” Ning said. “If it
hadn’t been for Master’s guidance, I never would’ve reached my
current heights.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha! Ji Ning, your
accomplishments were due to you and you alone. I didn’t help much,”
Subhuti immediately said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued, “And
that gentleman over there is the leader of the Seamless Gate, the
Lord of All Fiends.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Windfiend
nodded towards Ning’s parents. With a flicker, he appeared next to
Patriarch Subhuti as well. “I was wracked by guilt when I learned
that Ji Ning’s parents died due to the actions of my Seamless Gate!
Although it was Demonheart who instigated that calamity, I’m
ashamed to say that I didn’t act to stop him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The leader of the
Seamless Gate?” Yichuan and Snow were both stunned. The Seamless
Gate was the major force behind the chaos that had swept the Three
Realms. Supposedly, not even the leaders of the Daoist Path or the
Buddhist Sangha were able to do anything to them. How was it that
their son knew people like this? How powerful had their son become,
exactly?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the two of them
had first perished, Ning hadn’t even gone to the Black-White
College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This person is
Buddha Maitreiya of the Buddhist Sangha. This person is Daoist Jade
Cauldron of the Daoist Path…” Ning began to introduce the nearby
Immortals and Fiendgods to his parents.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan and Snow were
growing increasingly confused. Although they hadn’t heard of most
of these figures, they had heard of a few of them and knew them to be
figures whose reputations shook the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are now the
most elite Immortals and Fiendgods of the Three Realms,” Ning
explained to his parents, then turned and said in a sonorous voice,
“Friends, I’m going to accompany my parents and leave for a time.
In a few days, I’ll invite you all to a grand feast that I will
hold.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are far too
kind, Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, this is the
first time that Darknorth is hosting an Immortal banquet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll definitely
attend!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled, said a few
words to his master Subhuti, then led his parents away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father. Mother. Come
with me.” An aura of incredible sword-intent covered the three of
them, then hurtled them through the void to the home where Autumn
Leaf, Brightmoon, Uncle White, Little Qing, and Bluecliff Xiaoyu were
residing.

Chapter 12 – A Foundation for the Three Realms
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms. The
Grand Xia world. Swallow Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Long ago, Ji Ning had
removed the entire Swallow Mountain area from the Grand Xia for the
sake of protecting it from the great war. Now that the calamity had
come to an end, Ning had established his own major world, the
Darknorth world, and had planted the Ji clan into that world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Swallow Mountain
of the Grand Xia? This was where Ning had grown up, and so he had
rebuilt it. Autumn Leaf, Uncle White, Little Qing, and Brightmoon
normally lived here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing Lake.
Brightheart Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Ji Yichuan,
and Yuchi Snow all appeared in the air above Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It looks just like
it did all those years ago.” Yichuan and his wife Snow stood there
in the air, staring at the lake. “Serpentwing Lake hasn’t changed
at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One thing that did
change was that the Serpentwing monster died long ago,” Ning joked
by their side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son, what on
earth has happened in recent years?” Snow looked at her son.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll tell you
later. Mom, Dad, look over there. Your granddaughter is coming.”
Ning pointed off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black-robed maiden
was flying towards them from afar, her face covered with joy. Behind
her were Autumn Leaf, Uncle White, Little Qing, Bluecliff Xiaoyu, Mu
Northson, and Immortal Diancai.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” They each
called out joyfully towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As they flew closer,
Autumn Leaf and Uncle White were stunned, especially Uncle White. He
stared blankly at the two figures standing by Ning’s side, and his
tears suddenly came cascading downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan stared back at
Uncle White, then revealed a smile. “Little White.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother.”
Uncle White stared at Yichuan. The two were like brothers, and they
had ventured through life and death by each other’s sides many
times. They were extremely close to each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big sister Snow.”
Uncle White then looked at Snow. “You… you all…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Autumn
Leaf was extremely excited as well, and she hurriedly curtsied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Autumn Leaf?” Snow
smiled and nodded. Ning had two attendants by his side when he was
young. Spring Grass had died long ago, but Autumn Leaf had been by
his side this entire time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he stared
at the black-robed maiden and barked, “Brightmoon, get over here
and pay your respects to your grandmother and grandfather!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Brightmoon was rather
stunned. She had heard of her grandparents, but had never met them
before. Upon hearing Ning’s orders, she immediately fell to her
knees and said, “Brightmoon greets you, Grandfather and
Grandmother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother… big
sister Snow… this is Brightmoon. She’s the daughter of Ji Ning
and Yu Wei,” Uncle White immediately said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our granddaughter?”
Yichuan and Snow were both overjoyed. When they died, Ning had still
been quite young. Who would’ve thought that they’d suddenly have
a grandchild?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rise, rise!” Snow
immediately lifted her granddaughter up. The more she looked at
Brightmoon, the happier she felt. Brightmoon’s appearance was
similar to that of both Ning and Yu Wei. Although she looked more
like Yu Wei, she did have some of Ning’s traits as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a beautiful
girl. I have such a beautiful granddaughter! Your mother must be a
beauty as well. Ning, son, where’s your wife? Didn’t Little White
say that your wife’s name is Yu Wei?” Snow smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone suddenly fell
silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow and Yuchi didn’t
know what was going on, but everyone else knew what had happened.
Years ago, Yu Wei had been publicly killed during the wars by the
black-robed Godking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning responded with
perfect calm, “She’s gone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichu and Snow
immediately understood. It seemed as though many things had happened
over the years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grandpa, Grandma,
there seems to be many things you aren’t aware of. Let me tell
you.” Brightmoon immediately began to warmly narrate the story to
Yichuan and Snow. “Shortly after you passed away, but before my
father had joined the Black-White College; that’s where I’ll
start the story. Haha. The two of you are going to be stunned by
this…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing this, Ning just
stood there and watched with a smile on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no need to
hide any of his past history. Yichuan and Snow listened to their
daughter, Brightmoon, narrate Ning’s story. Every so often, Uncle
White, Little Qing, or Xiaoyu would add in a few words as well. Even
Ning’s junior apprentice-brother, Mu Northson, would jump in to
explain at some parts, as did Ning’s master Immortal Diancai.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan and his wife
Snow were completely stunned by this story. This wasn’t a story; it
was an absolute legend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they knew that
their son was a genius, how could they have imagined that their
talented sword-wielding son of Swallow Mountain would become such a
dazzling figure? He not only had reached parity with the
highest-level Immortals and Fiendgods of the Three Realms, he had
played a decisive role in ending the war! As for his current level of
power, it was completely unfathomable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They also learned about
Yu Wei’s death. Unfortunately, when her soul was destroyed ever her
truesoul was torn apart. There was no way to revive her at present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A few days later, Ning
held a Three Realms Banquet at Brightheart Island of Swallow
Mountain. All of the top-level Immortals and Fiendgods of the Three
Realms came to take part.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course, many of
Ning’s old friends came as well, such as the other members of Mount
Innerheart, including Crazy Ji, Sun Wukong, and Redsnow. Even the
likes of Northmont Baiwei and the Sloppy Daoist, who had been their
eldest apprentice-brother at the Black-White College, had arrived.
This was Ning’s first time hosting such a sumptuous banquet, and at
the end he even expounded upon the Dao, bringing great enlightenment
to many of the Immortals and Fiendgods of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the other side of
the primordial chaos. Vastheaven Territory. Vastheaven Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
more than a month passed after Ning’s arrival at Vastheaven Palace.
This was the day of Ning’s formal welcoming banquet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning! JI NING!”
Daolord Solesky was hollering towards him from far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother?” Ning
emerged from his estate, Su Youji and Pillsaint by his side. Ning
smiled. “I could hear you screaming at me from far away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wanted to see you
a few days ago, but Pillsaint told me that you were in secluded
meditation,” Daolord Solesky said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My big brother
wished to see me?” Ning turned to glance at Pillsaint. Pillsaint
hurriedly explained, “Daolord Solesky said that it was nothing
important and told me not to disturb you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky nodded
as well. “There is no rush, but… Ji Ning, you really did me wrong
this time. You captured Daolord Blesswing, a Daolord of the Third
Step of Clearwind Temple! A Daolord of the Third Step! And you
captured him! How could you hide such an incredible feat from me and
not tell me? If it hadn’t been for brother Eastherd giving us a
detailed narration a while ago, I would have had no idea whatsoever.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled. He
immediately said, “Alright, that was definitely my fault.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To be honest, Ning
truly hadn’t considered the capture to be a big deal. In his eyes,
Clearwind Temple wasn’t a threat at all. Even if Patriarch
Clearwind himself came, he wouldn’t be able to do anything to
Vastheaven Palace itself. If things really did go south, Ning could
simply use one of the deceased Hegemon’s Dao-seals to just kill the
man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s complete lack
of concern regarding this matter was why he hadn’t considered it to
be relevant. With his mind completely occupied with reviving his
parents, he truly had forgotten to tell Vastheaven Palace about this
matter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It won’t be much
of a problem. With my avatar here, we won’t need to fear Clearwind
at all.” Daolord Solesky was rather excited. “But for you to have
captured a Daolord of the Third Step… hah! I feel giddy just
imagining the look on Clearwind’s face.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already
subdued the Daolord. Big brother Solesky, you are free to deal with
him as you see fit,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You were the one to
capture him. How can I be the one to decide?” Daolord Solesky
immediately said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be so
courteous, big brother. If you want to use this situation to squeeze
and extort Clearwind Temple, feel entirely free to do so.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky shook
his head. “You don’t understand what type of a man Patriarch
Clearwind is. He won’t be easy to blackmail. Ah, forget it. There’s
no way Clearwind will just ignore something like this. We’ll wait
and see.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “Right.
Big brother, there’s something I need to ask you to help me out
with.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?”
Daolord Solesky asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to collect
some techniques, secret arts, and divine abilities,” Ning said. “I
need all types of techniques.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky looked
at Ning. “Are you planning to set up your own school?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head.
“No, it’s for the sake of my homeland. My homeland doesn’t have
any good techniques. I want to procure some good ones for them,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Vastheaven Palace
has some basic techniques which can be transmitted to others without
any issues,” Daolord Solesky said, “But the more powerful ones…
we have our own rules about their disposition.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said, “We’ll
do everything in accordance with the rules! I need all types of
divine abilities, techniques, and secret arts below the Daolord
level, and I’ll pay as much chaos nectar as the rules require.”
Even the Dao Alliance was willing to sell its many secret arts and
divine abilities, to say nothing of Vastheaven Palace. Even Daolord
Allgod’s [Novessence Water] and other such techniques had ended up
being sold to the Brightshore Kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning only needed
techniques that were below the Daolord level; more profound
techniques were not necessary for now. Vastheaven Palace didn’t
really have that many powerful legacies either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, below the
Daolord level? That’ll be easy.” Daolord Solesky nodded.
“However… over the course of countless years, Vastheaven Palace
has accumulated quite a few techniques. If we were to give you
everything we have, it’d cost you three million cubes of chaos
nectar! I don’t want to take advantage of you; the rules are the
rules. These techniques were accumulated by countless brothers over
the course of countless years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded. “Three million it is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Vastheaven Palace was
an ancient school which dominated the nearby territories and had been
around for countless chaos cycles. As a result, it had an ample
supply of techniques which were below the Daolord level. This was why
this place was considered a holy land for cultivation to many. Now
that Ning had purchased all of its techniques, the Three Realms’
foundation had been established. Most of the cultivators in the Three
Realms were merely at the Elder God or Ancestral Immortal level,
after all. To reach the World level and then become a Daolord was far
too difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, if he
couldn’t buy what he needed from Vastheaven Palace, he would’ve
done so from the Dao Alliance. Only, that would be more troublesome
and likely more expensive as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for legacies which
Daolords could use? Even Vastheaven Palace only had a very few such
legacies, and they had either been left behind by its Daolords or had
been acquired by them due to luck; they wouldn’t be casually taught
to others. They were not casually taught to others. What Ning was
planning to do was to create a few legacies of his own and leave them
to the Three Realms! For example, his [Brightmoon] sword-art was
definitely one of the most supreme of legacies! But of course, not
just anyone would be permitted to study it. The interested parties
would have to go through many layers of trials before they could
learn the Sword Dao which Ning had so painstakingly created.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Using Vastheaven
Palace’s repository, built up over the course of countless years,
to serve as the foundation of the Three Realms shall be enough.”
Ning felt a surge of joy in his heart.

Chapter 13 – Omega Sword Dao
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hah! You were able
to agree to three million cubes with such ease.” Daolord Solesky
laughed. “As expected for someone capable of capturing a Daolord of
the Third Step. Your resources truly are extraordinary, eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I just had better
luck than most,” Ji Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother Solesky,
all of our brothers have arrived and are waiting. Are you done
chatting?” The Daolord Brightfish’s laughter could be heard from
afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patience, my brother
Brightfish! We’ll be there shortly.” Daolord Solesky looked at
Ning. “Come, come! Let us make haste. The welcoming banquet is
about to commence.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The formal welcoming
ceremony took place. After the ceremony ended, Ning was now
considered a formal member of Vastheaven Palace. This caused Daolord
Solesky, Daolord Battlemaster, and Daolord Brightfish to all feel
slightly relieved. They could tell that Ning was guaranteed to be an
extraordinary Daolord. Although he had a talisman of welcome, it was
entirely permissible for him to change his mind prior to actually
joining Vastheaven Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that he had joined,
he truly would be a lifelong friend and brother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the darkness of
space. A shrine which was emanating ripples of strange azure power
was flying at high speeds. As the energy streams surged and flowed
around it, it was able to hurtle through space at astonishing speeds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An old man dressed in
handsome black robes stood within the shrine, staring silently into
space. His eyes were as calm as the depths of the sea. Beneath him
stood seven respectful World-level cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He managed to
capture Blesswind. This young fellow named Darknorth really is quite
daring.” The black-robed elder said calmly, “He’s even more
daring than Solesky.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the World-level
disciples said immediately, “Patriarch, Darknorth must’ve
acquired some special treasures thanks to a stroke of great luck.
Daolord Blesswind said it himself, right? He was beaten by a golem
which had the power of an apex Daolord of the Third Step, then
captured due to a nasty trick they pulled on him. No matter what,
this Darknorth is merely a World-level cultivator. He won’t be able
to fight back against you at all, Patriarch.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can’t be too
complacent,” Patriarch Clearwind said calmly. “These strokes of
great luck can sometimes involve truly earth-shattering treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was a Daolord of the
Fourth Step. Daolords of the Fourth Step were completely different
from Daolords of the Third Step. To reach the fourth step meant
reaching the Verge of the Daomerge, which meant that you had reached
terrifying heights in a certain Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why he was
able to feud against Daolord Solesky for so long was because he was
at a similar level of power. Both Patriarch Clearwind and Daolord
Solesky were extremely powerful, even amongst other Daolords of the
Fourth Step. They had both experienced many dangers as well. They
naturally were quite skilled in keeping themselves alive and would
never underestimate any opponent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Heartlord Solewind
had shattered that Dao-seal, he had been able to easily slay a
Daolord of the Third Step. But if he had encountered Patriarch
Clearwind? Forget about a Dao-seal; even if the Palace Lord of the
Heart Palace struck out, if he wasn’t careful Patriarch Clearwind
would probably be able to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Solesky. It’s been
quite some time since I’ve sparred with him.” Azure light
flickered through Patriarch Clearwind’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Vastheaven Palace had
two Daolords of the Fourth Step, while Clearwind Temple merely had
one. However, these two organizations were equivalent in power. This
was a testament to how formidable Patriarch Clearwind was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms.
Brightheart Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Ning’s study.
The study was filled with rolls of jade slips. Ning casually picked
up a jade slip, then infused the set of sword-arts he had developed
into the jade slip.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For Elder Gods and
Ancestral Immortals, less abstruse sword-arts are more appropriate.”
Ning’s left hand was casually demonstrating one sword-art after
another. He had perfectly joined together five Supreme Daos; in terms
of creating sword-art techniques for Elder Gods or World Gods, not
even the Brightshore Hegemon would necessarily be a match for Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“3600 low-level
techniques, 108 decent techniques, and 5 high-level sword-arts; the
Yin-Yang stance, the Soleheart stance, the Blood Drop stance, the
Shadowless stance, and the Heavenbreaker stance. The coremost
technique shall be the perfect junction of these five types of
sword-intent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-arts which
Ning had created included all types of sword-arts, including
sword-arts that were more suited for women, sword-arts that were
meant to be used with just one arm, sword-arts that suited those who
were a bit foolish… all types of sword-arts had been created, and
the creation process was actually another way for Ning to analyze and
better understand the nature of the Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every so often, he’d
raise his head and stare off into the distance. He was able to see to
the distant lakeshore, where Ji Yichuan was training in sword-arts
himself. Next to him watched Yuchi Snow, while their granddaughter Ji
Brightmoon continuously called out words of advice and guidance.
Brightmoon had indeed reached a much more impressive level of
expertise in the Dao of the Sword than her grandfather Yichuan, and
Yichuan actually enjoyed having his granddaughter teach him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…” As Ning
watched, he couldn’t help but grin. His father, his mother, and his
daughter Brightmoon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everything was so
wonderful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning then turned his
attention to his sword-arts, putting more sword-arts on display then
recording them into jade slips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning came to
a sudden halt. Although his gaze was focused on the distant
lakeshore, his heart felt like the rising sun that was appearing
above the watery horizon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Sword Dao.
That’s all there is to it. The Sword Dao is simply the Sword Dao.”
Ning started to laugh. “Why divide it up into so many different
‘types’? Yin-Yang sword-intent, Blood Drop sword-intent,
Shadowless sword-intent, Soleheart sword-intent, Heavenbreaker
sword-intent… what difference does it make? They all belong to the
Sword Dao. So that’s how it is. The question which has puzzled me
for millions of years…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the saying went, one
who suddenly understood the Dao in the morning would be content even
if he died in the evening. This was the sort of satisfaction Ning was
feeling right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was excitement. It
was a sense of contentment. This question had bedeviled him for
millions of years in the Trileaf Realm, when he first sensed that his
Sword Dao had yet to reach the limit. Now, with his parents and his
daughter by his side, he suddenly had a moment of epiphany as he
collated all these different sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A wave of strange power
was surging forth, resonating with the innermost depths of Ning’s
soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised his head
and stared into the skies. He could trace the sensation back to its
origins. He could immediately sense that it was coming from
incredibly far off within the primordial chaos. This place was so
unfathomably distant that it was many times farther away than the
entire size of the Endless Territories or the alternate universe.
This was the place where the true prime essences of this universe
lay.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That place was the
place where the prime essence of the Dao of the Sword, one of the
prime essences of this universe, resided.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the prime
essences responsible for stabilizing this entire universe, the prime
essence of the Dao of the Sword, was resonating with Ji Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Three
Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was still within
his study, but a terrifying aura of the Dao of the Sword suddenly
erupted from his body. He himself was like a terrifying sword, and
his every movement and motion contained the aura of the Dao of the
Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Am I now the master
of the Dao of the Sword?” Ning could sense that the unfathomably
distant prime essence of the Dao of the Sword was resonating in tune
with him. In this instant, he finally understood that this was the
truly ‘supreme’ Dao of the Sword, the true apex of the Sword Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This ultimate Sword
Dao, this… this Omega Dao of the Sword… it didn’t have
‘multiple’ versions of itself, such as Supreme Daos did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao of the Sword,
in and of itself, was a complete Dao. It could simply transform into
many different things, much like how the single supreme Taiji gave
birth to the duality of Yin and Yang, which gave birth to the
trigrams that then gave birth to all things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five perfectly
joined Supreme Daos which Ning had previously developed were like the
trigrams; although the three lines of the trigrams were joined
together perfectly, they didn’t truly represent the ultimate
expression of the Dao of the Sword. Only by truly understanding the
‘single’ source would you be able to truly, completely, and
perfectly understand and master the Dao of the Sword!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Omega Sword Dao
is the true ultimate Sword Dao! Only now can I be considered a master
of the Dao of the Sword.” Ning felt as though he had just undergone
a complete transformation. Finally, he understood why the difference
in power between those who had joined two Supreme Daos, three Supreme
Daos, or even five Supreme Daos was fairly small.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It didn’t really
matter how many Supreme Daos you were able to come up with… because
above them was the complete and full Dao of the Sword. All types of
sword-arts and all of the so-called branches… they were nothing
more than parts of this true and complete Sword Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come forth.” Ning
stepped forwards. Whoosh! He instantly transformed into a streak of
light which then completely disappeared as he used the Shadowless
evasion skill. In an instant, he appeared in the empty space above
the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Solar Star.”
Ning stood there in space, staring at the enormous and scorchingly
hot Solar Star off in the distance. He looked very ordinary, with his
Sword Dao aura completely restrained, but that was what made him so
terrifying. He was now fundamentally different from how he had been
before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How terrifying. I’m
able to tear through space without causing any disturbances at all,
and I’m actually able to move ten times faster than the speed of
light. Most Verge-level Daolords can only move at five times the
speed of light!” Even Ning was frightened by how strong he had
become. Previously, his most powerful attack had been his
quadressence thunder and quadressence water, but the power of his
Sword Dao now completely eclipsed both of those quadressence attacks
combined.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now that I have
comprehended my Omega Sword Dao, it is time for me to break through
to become a Daolord.” Ning’s eyes were filled with blazing
eagerness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had once felt that
his chances of reviving Yu Wei were miniscule; not even Emperor
Maniseal, an Eternal Emperor who had reached incredible heights in
the Dao of Seals, was able to accomplish such a thing. But in the
instant that he discovered and comprehended his Omega Sword Dao, he
knew that his chances had just increased dramatically!

Chapter 14 – Patriarch Clearwind
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Vastheaven Palace. The
Darknorth Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ji Ning was
holding a tankard of wine, and the wine within it was flowing out
from the opening and into his glass.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, you’ve
been really relaxed lately. A while ago you were training in the
sword every day. Why have you stopped?” Su Youji walked towards
them from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who says I stopped?”
Ning asked. “So long as my heart holds my sword-intent within it, I
am still training in swordplay. If my heart is void of sword-intent,
all the physical training in the world would be useless. To you, it
might look like I’m just relaxing and drinking wine, but I’m
actually training right now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sophistry,” Su
Youji muttered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckle. He really
did hold his sword-intent within his heart. The awesome Sword Dao
that filled his heart and his complete control over it made Ning feel
intoxicated. At his current level, the World level, Ning had already
advanced as far as he could. Now, what he needed to do was to become
a Daolord! Only then would he be able to advance further in his Omega
Sword Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Omega Sword Dao
represented that the path which Ning had chosen was truly the most
ultimate of paths, but he had just barely began to trod this path.
Even so, just starting on this path meant that his insights were
already comparable to those of many Daolords of the Fourth Step; in
some areas, he actually surpassed them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, the fact that
Ning could move ten times faster than the speed of light was a
testament to his skills. He didn’t have to rely on lightning-type
skills or light-type skills to accomplish this; he was flying at ten
times the speed of light solely through his mastery of the Sword Dao.
This proved how profound a level of insight he had truly reached.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It will be another
thirty-plus years before my main body’s clone reaches this place,”
Ning mused. “I suppose I’ll have to just wait.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the next
thirty-plus years, Ning would spend his free time drinking wine and
strolling about Vastheaven Palace. He would also memorize various new
techniques and secret arts, so that his Primaltwin in the Three
Realms would also gain access to them. Ning had spent three million
cubes of chaos nectar to purchase all of Vastheaven Palace’s
techniques, divine abilities, and secret arts that were below the
Daolord level. This was a truly massive amount of techniques, and it
would take even Ning an extremely long period of time to memorize it
all! Right now, Ning was just spending some of his free time working
on memorizing the stockpile; he was planning to become a Daolord
before truly memorizing them on a large scale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolords were able to
memorize things much more quickly than World-level cultivators were.
They were on completely different levels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s face
suddenly tightened slightly as he lifted up a cup of wine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s wrong,
Master?” Su Youji was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a powerful
sense of danger,” Ning murmured softly. “An enemy has come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A powerful sense of
danger? An enemy?” Su Youji was very puzzled. She was a Daolord,
but she sensed nothing at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning rose to his feet.
“Come. Let’s take a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is there really an
enemy?” Su Youji followed behind Ning, confused. However, after
taking just a few steps she suddenly raised her head to stare towards
the skies, stunned. “What a terrifyingly strong aura.” She
couldn’t help but give a shocked glance to her master, Ji Ning. Ji
Ning was merely at the World level, but he was actually able to
discover this newcomer before she, a Daolord, did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What she didn’t
realize was that ever since Ning had mastered his Omega Sword Dao, a
natural Sword Dao domain was around him at all times, and he was the
master of this domain! So long as they were still within the reach of
the ripples generated by the prime essence of the Dao of the Sword,
Ning would be able to sense things around him with ease. The closer
anyone moved towards him, the more powerful those sensations would
be. Given Ning’s accomplishments in the Sword Dao, his sensory
powers were already comparable to those of Daolords of the Fourth
Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later,
Pillsaint came charging over as well. Ning, Su Youji, and Pillsaint
quickly made their way to the main hall of Vastheaven Palace. By now,
Daolord Solesky and Daolord Battlemaster had both arrived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.”
Daolord Solesky and Daolord Battlemaster both called out to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Did something just
happen?” Ning asked as he turned to stare intently towards the
skies. Vastheaven Palace’s main hall was the tallest building in
the entire palace, and from this location they were able to see the
limitless skies above them. Right now, a gray mass was moving towards
them from the horizon, blotting out the sun and carrying an aura of
such power that simply glancing at it was terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s Patriarch
Clearwind,” Daolord Battlemaster said. “A few days ago, I
calculated through Numerancy that he would be coming. However… all
we can do is sense his presence. There’s nothing else we can do.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky was
quite calm. He snickered coldly, “I knew that old bastard wouldn’t
just let things slide like that.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So he really did
arrive.” Ning had a solemn look on his face as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. At
most, he’ll just rant and rave from outside. There’s no way he
would dare enter Vastheaven Palace.” Daolord Solesky snickered,
“Although I merely have an avatar here and do not have the full
power of my true self, the formations that we’ve established here
over the course of countless years will ensure that I have nothing to
fear. Given that Battlemaster is also here to help out… there’s
no way he would dare enter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Daolord
Battlemaster nodded. “In the outside world, I might not be a match
for Patriarch Clearwind, but there’s nothing to fear here in
Vastheaven Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That gray mass
continued to expand and reach out from the distant horizon. The other
brothers of Vastheaven Palace were beginning to notice it as well,
and they all made haste to the main hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“W-what’s that?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother Solesky,
who is invading Vastheaven Palace?” All of them were shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“None of our brothers
in Vastheaven Palace are permitted to leave this place. Wait here for
my orders,” Daolord Solesky said calmly, his voice echoing within
the ears of every single member of Vastheaven Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” They all
assented, knowing that this wasn’t the time to be careless in their
actions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, a wild gray wind
with earth-shaking savagery completely covered the skies above
Vastheaven Palace, blotting out the sun and making it so that there
was almost no light left in the world. Vastheaven Palace became
shadowed in darkness, but some of the formations covering it began to
activate. Areas of light began to emerge within various parts of
Vastheaven Palace, giving it a rather beautiful glow to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old man Solesky.”
A shrine suddenly emerged within the endless gray wind in the skies,
and an old man dressed in gaudy black robes stood in front of the
main entrance to it. His voice echoed within this entire world. “You
really are quite bold. You actually dared to permit those young
subordinates of yours to abduct Daolord Blesswind of my Clearwind
Temple. If you know what’s good for you, you shall hand him over
along with those five World-level cultivators of his! If you do that,
I’ll just let this matter come to an end. Otherwise… hmph!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His cold snort echoed
throughout the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In Vastheaven palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The rest of you
should wait here,” Daolord Solesky instructed. “Battlemaster,
let’s go chat with that madman.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Daolord
Battlemaster nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky and
Daolord Battlemaster instantly soared high into the skies. Thanks to
the barriers formations protecting Vastheaven Palace, someone outside
wouldn’t be able to see what was going on behind the formations,
but those inside Vastheaven Palace were able to clearly make out what
was happening outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only when Daolord
Solesky and Daolord Battlemaster flew into the skies were the members
of Clearwind Temple able to see them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clearwind.”
Daolord Solesky let out a little snicker. “Daolord Blesswind of
your temple ended up being defeated by one of my World-level
brothers. Neither Battlemaster nor I had anything to do with it! I’m
actually quite amazed that you have the gall to come here, after one
of your Daolords lost in such a pitiful fashion.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He did lose, but
that was only because that puny little World-level cultivator relied
on rare treasures and golems.” Patriarch Clearwind said angrily,
“Solesky, hand over Daolord Blesswind and the others or-”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Or what?” Daolord
Solesky interrupted him, then said angrily, “Daolord Blesswind’s
life is in the hands of Vastheaven Palace. I can kill him whenever I
want.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you want to kill
him, kill him.” Patriarch Clearwind said coldly, “I’ll make
sure that Vastheaven Palace pays the price for it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he wasn’t able to
bring Daolord Blesswind back, then it didn’t matter whether
Blesswind stayed alive or not.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a nasty,
vicious man.” Daolord Solesky snickered. “You know my true body
isn’t here, which is the only reason why you had the courage to run
here and show off. Hmph! If you are feeling bold, try entering
Vastheaven Palace! I’ve already opened up the sealing formation;
you are free to come in whenever you wish. Battlemaster, let’s go
back and keep drinking our wine. Forget about this madman.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed, big brother.
Let’s go back and have some wine.” Battlemaster laughed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Both flew back
downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Clearwind had
an even uglier look on his face now. Vastheaven Palace had just
completely ignored him… but he truly wouldn’t dare to actually
barge into Vastheaven Palace! In the outside world, he would hold an
advantage over Daolord Battlemaster and Daolord Solesky’s clone. In
Vastheaven Palace, however, he would be completely dominated.
</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Vastheaven
Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother Solesky,
are we just going to let him wait there?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forget about that
madman. Let all of our brothers just drink here. Come, come! Let’s
drink our wine and just wait to see what that madman will do,”
Daolord Solesky said loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone present let
out shouts of approval. The brothers of Vastheaven Palace were all
quite bold figures, but they also kept a close eye on the outside.
They had heard of Patriarch Clearwind’s mighty reputation for
countless years, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent.
Excellent!” The skies echoed with Patriarch Clearwind’s enraged
voice. “From this day forth, all of the cultivators of Vastheaven
Palace can just forget about leaving it! I’ll kill anyone and
everyone who exits it! None of the cultivators of Vastheaven Palace
shall be able to re-enter this place either. I shall execute anyone
who tries to enter Vastheaven Palace! If you refuse to hand over
Daolord Blesswind, I’ll stay here and keep everyone trapped within
Vastheaven Palace. One chaos cycle… ten chaos cycles… we’ll
take it slowly!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s wait for my
true body to return. I want to see if you would dare try and surround
Vastheaven Palace once that happens.” Daolord Solesky’s cold
voice rang out in reply as well.

Chapter 15 – The Clone’s Return
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Vastheaven
Everworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A fur-clad youth was
flying through the skies of this place. He stared at the distant gray
storm that was blotting out the sun in the distance. That was the
direction of Vastheaven Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve finally made
it,” Ji Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fur-clad youth was
Ning’s clone, which had travelled all the way here from the
Badlands Territory. Now that he knew that Patriarch Clearwind was
besieging Vastheaven Palace, he changed his appearance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even though
Patriarch Clearwind has never seen me, he probably knows what I look
like,” Ning mused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! The fur-clad
Ning flew towards Vastheaven Palace at high speeds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist.
Fellow Daoist!” A black-robed figure suddenly appeared in the
distant skies, and he used his Immortal energy to transmit his voice
to Ning from afar. “The Daolords of Clearwind Temple have already
surrounded Vastheaven Palace for thirty years. From the looks of
things, they’ll probably be here for a very long period of time.
You must not travel any further, fellow Daoist. Ugh… I personally
witnessed a weak little Elder God who was instantly slain once he
moved in that direction.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even Elder Gods are
slain?” Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Anyone who dares to
travel there will be slain. Not even animals or birds are permitted
to enter that region.” The Chaos Immortal shook his head. “Be
careful, fellow Daoist.” After speaking, he flew away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fur-clad Ji Ning
considered this matter, then immediately began to charge downwards.
As soon as he touched the ground, he instantly disappeared into thin
air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Using the Shadowless
evasion skill, he began to move towards Vastheaven Palace at high
speeds. For the sake of hiding his true abilities, Ning merely moved
stealthily at just two times the normal speed of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Vastheaven
Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Daolord
Solesky, and Daolord Battlemaster were standing before their barrier
formations, staring off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother, that
clone of mine is about to arrive,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In order to break
through to the Daolord level, you have to merge all of your clones
together to form a complete body.” Daolord Solesky shook his head
and sighed. “But that madman Patriarch Clearwind has surrounded our
palace. It’ll be extremely difficult for your clone to make it
inside. As I see it, you should just give up that body. You’ll
still be able to become a Daolord, and your strength will only be
minimally impacted.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head.
That clone was one of the eighteen clones that had been created
thanks to his [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods]. His ‘main body’ was
actually created from the merging of seventeen of those clones! If it
died, his spare clone would be able to recreate the main body by
remaking the other seventeen clones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the spare clone
died, there was no way his main body would be able to rebuild it.
Still… once the spare clone died, the main body would become
independent and ‘complete’, but it would have an eighteenth less
divine power than its maximum potential. It was true that this
wouldn’t have a significant impact.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just wait a bit, big
brother,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Daolord
Solesky laughed. “I’ll eagerly await your display of power, Ji
Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was flying low,
very close to the ground. The sky-blotting tempest of gray wind
blanketed all of Vastheaven Palace, with the shrine having descended
upon the peak of a nearby mountain. Patriarch Clearwind’s Immortal
energy filled the entire region, with the area around Vastheaven
Palace under his complete control. Any cultivator who wished to enter
or exit Vastheaven Palace would not be able to escape his detection.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Patriarch
Clearwind opened his eyes. His gaze pierced through the walls of the
shrine as he stared towards a distant region. He let out a cold
smile. “Ah, a young World-level cultivator. He thinks to evade my
surveillance through using an evasion skill?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You may perish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Clearwind
coldly waved a single finger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A terrifying amount of
natural energy instantly began to manifest, transforming into a
blurry gray hand that was three million kilometers in size and which
clawed downwards towards the cultivator.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh. The swiping
motion of that giant gray blurry hand caused the entire area beneath
it to be reduced to dust as an enormous gouge was torn into the
earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Ning, however,
continued to skirt across the surface of the ground. His speed had
suddenly increased to four times the speed of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Patriarch
Clearwind’s face tightened. “How can a World-level cultivator
have such a fast evasion skill? He’s comparable to a Daolord of the
Third Step.” When he had swiped out at the ground, Ning had
suddenly sped up from twice the speed of light to four times the
speed of light, avoiding his blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Patriarch
Clearwind had a dark look on his face as he once more launched an
attack, a second claw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That giant blurry gray
hand carried even more power than before, and it also moved even
faster as it swept out towards the ground. The earth trembled as mud
and dirt was reduced to dust as an even larger gouge appeared within
the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And yet… Ning’s
speed skyrocketed yet again. He now was able to move at six times the
speed of light, and as a result he dodged even this second attack. By
now, he was very close to Vastheaven Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Patriarch
Clearwind didn’t even have a chance to unleash a third strike. Ning
almost instantly charged within the protective perimeter of
Vastheaven Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Patriarch
Clearwind shot to his feet, causing his seven World-level cultivators
under his command to all be shocked. None of them even knew that a
World-level cultivator was using an evasion skill; all they knew was
that their Patriarch Clearwind had just clawed twice at the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually escaped,
and that final burst of speed brought him to move at six times the
speed of light? That’s faster than many Verge-level Daolords!”
Patriarch Clearwind had a look of disbelief on his face. “How could
a World-level cultivator be that fast? What sort of special
encounters has he had!?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ning was riding
Chaos lightning , he would be able to move at ten times the speed of
light. There were actually quite a few similar evasion skills, but
they were all extremely difficult to train in. Many Verge-level
Daolords didn’t have access to such evasion skills.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given his speed…
could that have been the Darknorth fellow which Blesswind spoke of?”
Patriarch Clearwind mused to himself, “But logically speaking, that
World God named Darknorth should’ve reached Vastheaven Palace long
ago. Could it be that Vastheaven Palace has a second World-level
cultivator who moves at those speeds?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Clearwind was
truly mystified.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Vastheaven Palace,
however, was a hubbub of celebration.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fur-clad Ning
charged past the barriers of Vastheaven Palace; in doing so, he had
reached a position of perfect safety. He flew straight towards the
white-robed Ning, returning to his usual appearance while doing so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impressive,
impressive.” Daolord Solesky let out an amazed sigh. “Patriarch
Clearwind struck out twice but still wasn’t able to halt your
clone. That evasion skill you used at the very end… it let you move
at six times the limits of the Heavenly Daos, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was
overconfident. He didn’t know about my true abilities.” Ning
chuckled. He had actually been quite relaxed this entire time, and he
had only been forced to move at six times the speed of light. His
current limit was actually ten! However, he only needed to move as
fast as was necessary to escape and safely enter Vastheaven Palace.
There was no need for him to let the enemy know everything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you move that
fast, it won’t be an easy thing for him to kill you,” Daolord
Battlemaster said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately said,
“Big brother Solesky, big brother Battlemaster, now that my clone’s
arrived I’m going to merge my clone with my main body and break
through to become a Daolord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Solesky
and Battlemaster both turned solemn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You must be
careful,” Solesky instructed. “Breaking through to become a
Daolord of the First Step might be easy for you, but given how
formidable your sword-intent is you’ll definitely become at least a
Daolord of the Fourth Step. That makes it even more important for you
to solidify your foundation. The Dao you develop must be sufficiently
solid and stable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolords. With each
step they took, they trod the line between life and death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like building a
tall building. Becoming a Daolord of the First Step was establishing
the foundation for that building! Daolords of the second, third, and
fourth steps were like adding more and more floors to that building.
If the foundation wasn’t stable, the entire building might
collapse! The same was true for Samsara Daolords. Each step they took
they risked their lives, and quite a few Daolords ended up dying upon
taking their third step. Not every Daolord would be able to reach the
fourth step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In order to build a
tall tower, the most important thing of all was to have a sturdy
base. As for gaining eternity? Not even the slightest error was
permissible. Even the smallest of flaws would ensure that you would
never be able to gain eternity!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If your foundation was
small, you’d only be able to build a small wooden cabin, which was
to say you would become an ordinary Daolord. Each step they took
would be easier, and it would be easier for them to become Eternal
Emperors. However, they would be weak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you had an
incredibly deep foundation, you would be ready to build a massive
palace atop it. Every floor would be quite difficult to construct,
and to gain eternity would be even harder. However, if you succeeded
you would be unfathomably stronger than your peers. This was true for
Bertulu, Eastcult, Greatjoy, and the others. As for Ning, his
foundation was the deepest of them all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry at
all, big brother.” Ning smiled, then both he and his clone both
transformed into streaks of light that flew towards his distant
estate as Daolord Battlemaster and Daolord Solesky both watched from
behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Ji Ning
truly has improved by an astonishing amount.” Daolord Solesky
sighed. “When I first met him… I thought he was quite talented,
but I never would’ve imagined that he would become as powerful as
he is today. The evasion skill he used just now was very fast, but it
didn’t seem to include any of his lightning or water. I have no
idea what evasion skill he used, but just by relying on his
sword-intent he was able to capture five World-level cultivators.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Battlemaster
nodded as well. “I tried to use Numerancy to divine his future, but
I wasn’t able to divine anything at all. He’s too monstrously
talented, even more talented than Brightfish. Calculating his future
is far too difficult.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Forget about him; even
the Paragon of Pills was only able to use Numerancy to get the
vaguest of ideas as to how long it would be before they met again.

Chapter 16 – Becoming A Daolord
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Vastheaven Palace. The
Darknorth Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ji Ning
and the fur-clad Ning were travelling side-by-side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Su Youji
and Pillsaint stared in astonishment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My clone has already
returned from the Badlands Territory. It is now time for me to break
through to become a Daolord as well,” Ning said. “Starting right
now, do not disturb me unless something very important happens.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both Su Youji and
Pillsaint immediately acknowledged the order. They were unable to
prevent looks of excitement from appearing on their faces. As they
saw it, Ji Ning truly was an incredible figure; once he broke through
to become a Daolord, his status would truly skyrocket even more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. The
white-robed Ning and the fur-clad Ning both moved into a private room
deep within the estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the secluded
room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Formations began to
actiate, causing barriers of light to begin to appear around the
entire Darknorth estate, preventing any outsiders from looking into
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ning
and the fur-clad Ning both sat in the lotus position. Both shut their
eyes, then began to use the [One True Body] technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Both bodies
began to emanate an aura of blurry light from their bodies, their
Jindans, and their souls. They began to draw closer and closer to
each other, before finally the fur-clad Ning flew straight into the
white-robed Ning’s body, causing the light to expand dramatically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two came from the
same source. They were identical in soul, truesoul, and body. This
was why they were able to rejoin each other and merge into one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now, all eighteen of
my clones have been brought together into one.” The white-robed
Ning opened his eyes, revealing a smile. He still remembered how he
had first acquired the [Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods] and used it to
create eighteen separate clones. Now, he had managed to once more
merge all eighteen clones into one! A sense of perfection and
contentment came from his very truesoul, causing him to feel a bit
intoxicated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal energy and
divine power flooded into the azureflower mist region within his
body, and it actually began to transform into more of that mist
energy. For eighteen of those bodies to come together meant that his
divine body had only become more powerful than it had been in the
past! His divine power was also slightly purer than before as well,
allowing him to endure and hold a bit more of that mist energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A hundred and twenty
drops.” He had accumulated a total of 120 drops of ‘water’
within the azureflower mist region. This was quite a bit more than
the 108 drops he had accumulated previously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within an estate
located in the primordial chaos directly outside the distant Three
Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
was seated there, next to another black-robed Ning. They
simultaneously used the [One True Body] technique as well and merged
to become one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
there was only one seated black-robed Ning. His aura, however, was a
bit stronger than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From this day forth, he
would only have one true body and one Primaltwin, with no clones of
either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let it begin.”
Both the white-robed Ning in Vastheaven Palace and the black-robed
Ning in his chaos estate nodded, their eyes filled with resolve.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The true body and the
Primaltwin, though located extremely far away from each other, made
their breakthroughs simultaneously. They could even sense a strange
resonance between them, and in this moment they both established a
Dao that belonged to them and them alone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Samsara Daolords walked
a path of their own devising, and with each step on their Dao they
trod the line between life and death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each time he made a
breakthrough, both his true body and his Primaltwin would have to
make the breakthrough at the same time! Trying to break through with
just one would result in being stifled by the other; there was no way
for it to succeed. Consider the ‘Daomerge’; even a Daolord of the
Fourth Step who had a Primaltwin would only have one shot at the
Daomerge. There was no way to simply allow the true body to fail the
Daomerge, then allow the Primaltwin to use that experience to
succeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The true body and the
Primaltwin would have to face it all together, and with each step
they would risk death together. This was how things worked. If you
weren’t extremely determined, you would never be able to succeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The primordial chaos
outside the Three Realms began to rumble and churn with unearthly
power, forming a chaos whirlpool of terrifying power and
inconceivable size. The ripples caused by it actually affected even
the insides of the Three Realms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“W-what…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What in the world?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What are these
terrifying ripples?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Subhuti,
Windfiend, and the other elites of the Three Realms all flew to the
void above the Three Realms. They stared towards the distant place
where the ripples were coming from. They could sense that the
normally calm and tranquil primordial chaos was now rumbling and
roaring like a dragon in flight, churning with such power that they
were all utterly amazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Vastheaven Palace. The
Darknorth Estate was completely calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although a Daolord’s
aura was bursting forth from this place, the barriers which Ning had
activated earlier made it so that the aura was completely blocked
from escaping. As for the energy which he needed to break through
from the World level to the Daolord level, Ning was able to simply
generate it from the chaos jewels which he carried with him. This was
a decision he had made ever since he comprehended his Omega Sword
Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Jindan chaos region
within his body. The Dao-tree which had been 108,000 meters tall
began to draw nourishment from Ning’s insights into his Sword Dao.
It quickly began to grow, and with a rumbling sound it started to
expand. Although it was very slow in growing ‘taller’, it was
beginning to thicken at an absolutely incredible speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao-tree was
growing thicker and thicker, but it was growing taller quite slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The deeper a Samsara
Daolord’s foundation is, the thicker his Dao-tree will be. Thanks
to my Omega Sword Dao, there should be very few Daolords of the First
Step who are a match for me,” Ning mused. There was a fixed limit
to how tall a Dao-tree could be. For example, if a Daolord of the
Fourth Step trained for many years and reached the Verge, his
Dao-tree would grow to become 540,000 meters tall. This was true for
all Verge-level Daolords. The thickness, however, was different for
each person.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the Dao-tree grew
thicker and taller, the roots would also extend deeper and deeper
into the Jindan chaos region, allowing it to become more and more
stable and expand even further in size.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao-tree continued
to grow until it reached a height of 156,000 meters tall, then
finally came to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Jindan chaos
region, however, was still furiously expanding. Its aura was
expanding as well, and the Jindan core at the very heart of the
region was becoming increasingly mysterious and profound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to rebuild the
divine body.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ning
sat there in the lotus position. His bones, his flesh, his sinews…
they all began to be fundamentally remade and rebuilt, using the
Omega Sword Dao as their core. They drew in the chaos energy, using
it to remake his divine power itself. His awesome Daolord aura burst
forth from his room, and the many chaos jewels in Ning’s possession
were being continuously used up and replenished. In truth, not even a
Daolord of the Fourth Step would really use up that many chaos jewel
in replenishing his divine power. To Ning, such a small amount of
chaos jewels was negligible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Daolord’s aura.
Master is making his breakthrough.” Pillsaint was nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, but the aura
is so powerful… it is far greater than the aura we had when we made
our breakthroughs.” Su Youji was quite moved, but a puzzled look
appeared in her eyes as she raised her head skywards. “Odd. Why
isn’t there any disturbance in the local primordial chaos?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pillsaint revealed a
puzzled look as well. “Right. Is Master not using the chaos energy
of the outside world?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only when breaking
through would you be able to absorb an enormous amount of chaos
energy in a very short period of time for ‘free’. When you
normally broke through to become a Daolord, you would make use of
that free chaos energy from the outside world. Ning, however, was so
filthy rich that he didn’t care about that at all, and he had his
own reasons for not wishing to draw upon the chaos energy of the
outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master probably has
other things on his mind,” Su Youji suggested.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just two hours later,
the true body had completed its breakthrough. Given that he had an
unlimited supply of chaos jewels, the breakthrough was naturally
incredibly fast. As for the Primaltwin, its breakthrough would take
significantly more time, as it was still furiously drawing upon the
energy of the primordial chaos outside of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this is what it
is like to become a Daolord?” The white-robed Ning sat there, a
smile on his face. His aura was noticeably much more powerful than it
had been in the past, and it was actually on par with that of Daolord
Brightfish, a Daolord of the Second Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anyone who saw Ning and
sensed his aura would judge him to be a Daolord of the Second Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, this actually
wasn’t that impressive. All Ancient cultivators and members of the
Brightshore Imperials were comparable to Daolords of the First Step
when they were actually at the World level. Once they broke through,
their divine bodies would be comparable to Daolords of the Third
Step, and their auras would be far stronger than Ning’s! As for
Kilostar, who had trained in the [Thousand Bodies Sutra], he would be
every bit a match for those Ancient cultivators and the Brightshore
Imperials.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, there were
very, very few Ancient cultivators and Brightshore Imperials. As for
cultivators who both trained in the [Thousand Bodies Sutra] and were
able to break through to become Daolords? They were probably even
rarer than Brightshore Imperials!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, in the outside
world people usually judged a person’s power based on his aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning used his Omega
Sword Dao to serve as the basis and core of his divine power, and had
combined eighteen bodies into one; this was why he had a body
comparable to a Daolord of the Second Step after making his
breakthrough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the future, I’ll
just pretend to be a Daolord of the Second Step. In the end, my Omega
Sword Dao is simply too powerful, far more powerful than the Daos of
Eastcult, Greatjoy, or the others. Based on what I know, not even
figures like the almighty Brightshore Hegemon or the Paragon of Pills
have encountered World-level cultivators who had as unearthly a Dao
as I do.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew that in
everyone’s eyes, being able to master and then join together
multiple Supreme Daos meant that you were the most supreme of
geniuses. And yet… he was even more powerful than the ‘most
supreme of geniuses’?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If others found out
about this, there might be some benefits for him, but… it would
also bring quite a deal of trouble! It was better to be cautious; on
the surface, being just one of those other ‘supreme geniuses’ was
enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After making his
breakthrough, Ning could sense that he had undergone an earthshaking
transformation. He felt certain that thanks to his Omega Sword Dao,
even as a Daolord of the First Step he would be comparable to the
likes of Greatjoy and Eastcult once they became Daolords of the
Second Step. There were very few Daolords of the Fourth Step who
could do anything to him! This made Ning feel a sense of
uncontrollable heroism and valor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, any
powerful Daolord could pose a threat to him. Now… he would pose a
threat to them instead!

Chapter 17 – Leaving Seclusion
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The secluded room was
completely silent. Ji Ning simply sat there, visualizing the insides
of his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His reserves of
Immortal energy and divine power were as deep as those of a Daolord
of the Second Step. Ning’s focus, however, was on the azureflower
region within his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The azureflower mist
energy.” This was what Ning was looking at. The azureflower region
was a mist of haze. Droplets of golden water were slowly rolling
together as the area emanated an aura of fog and mist. There was a
total of 1111 of those golden drops! Every single drop contained far
more energy than Ning’s divine power and Immortal energy combined.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It actually evolved
once again. My azureflower mist energy is far stronger than my own
divine power or Immortal energy. How could it be this much stronger?
This should be the power of a Daolord of the Fourth Step!” Ning was
truly stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nine Chaos Seals
seemed like a very ordinary technique, but it was actually
inconceivably strong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For it to be able to
convert the energy of Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals was one
thing. Even the conversion of World-level energy… fine. But it was
actually able to convert even Daolord-level energy?! To this very
day, Ning still wasn’t able to grasp some of the mysteries behind
the conversion process.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who? Who created
this technique, this ridiculously powerful technique? The deceased
Hegemon bestowed numerous techniques, divine abilities, and secret
arts upon me as well, but none of them can compare to it!” Ning was
secretly stunned. Aside from his Hegemon-level sword-arts, the
deceased Sword Hegemon also had numerous divine abilities and secret
arts which he had passed on to Ning, and some of them were even
stronger than the [Novessence Thunder]. And yet… they were all
vastly inferior compared to the Nine Chaos Seals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The legends say that
the most powerful bodies are those of the Brightshore Imperials,
certain top-tier Aberrants, Ancient cultivators, and cultivators who
trained in the [Thousand Bodies Sutra],” Ning mused. “But my Nine
Chaos Seals allows me to be on par with them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Brightshore Imperials,
Ancient cultivators, elite Aberrants, and practitioners of the
[Thousand Bodies Sutra] were all incredibly talented figures; even at
the World level, their bodies were comparable to the bodies of
Daolords. Once they broke through to become Daolords of the First
Step, their bodies would be comparable to those of Daolords of the
Third Step!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most importantly of
all, they were able to execute divine abilities and unleash utterly
ruinous amounts of force that were probably stronger than even Ning’s
azureflower mist energy. There was no way for Ning to use his
azureflower mist energy to use any divine abilities at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The problem was there
were pitifully few Brightshore Imperials. This was why they needed
the Twelve Palaces to protect them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ancient cultivators,
top-tier Aberrants, practitioners of the [Thousand Bodies Sutra]…
all of them were pitifully few in number.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky,
Daolord Battlemaster, Daolord Brightfish, Pillsaint, Su Youji… when
they were at the first step, they would have auras of Daolords of the
First Step. Once they took their second step, they would have auras
of Daolords of the Second Step. This was normal! People like Ning,
who had an Omega Sword Dao and eighteen clones, were incredibly rare
even amongst Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ancient cultivators
and Brightshore Imperials who are Daolords of the First Step might be
able to surpass me in power when they fully unleash all of their
abilities, but I’m capable of lasting much longer in combat. In
addition, the higher a level you reach, the more important the
strength of the Dao you have created is.” Ning nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For Samsara Daolords,
their Dao was their foundation. It mattered most of all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, for example, was
in control of an Omega Sword Dao. Even without using any divine
abilities or techniques, his sword-intent alone would be enough to
easily suppress Daolords of the third Step. Thanks to this Omega Dao,
he would be able to move ten times the speed of light. His Omega Dao
allowed him to enter higher dimensions and move through them at truly
astonishing speeds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the nature of
the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you simply relied on
brute force and strength, the end result would be that you would be
trampled. This was why certain incredibly powerful Daolords were able
to easily slay Brightshore Imperials, Ancient cultivators, and even
Eternal Emperors, even though they were nothing more than ‘ordinary’
cultivators without any particularly special bodies!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dao of the
Sword…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was using his
Omega Sword Dao to serve as the template for remaking his divine
body. Once his Dao-tree stabilized, he was immediately able to
vaguely visualize the upcoming path for his Omega Sword Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The higher you stood,
the farther you would be able to see.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many different Sword
Daos filled his mind, as did his Heavenbreaker sword-intent, his
Soleheart sword-intent, his Yin-Yang sword-intent, his Blood Drop
sword-intent, and his Shadowless sword-intent. Ning was beginning to
get some insights and ideas into the mysteries they would hold in the
future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder they all
say that going from the first step to the second step as a Daolord is
the easiest step.” Ning revealed a smile. “If I was merely in
control a single Supreme Dao, I’d probably break through to become
a Daolord of the Second Step in just a few hundred years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was very quick for
Daolords to go from the first step to the second step. Even the
absolute slowest of Daolords would at most take a few chaos cycles,
and this would already be considered an incredibly long period of
time. According to the stories, there were some who would be able to
much move faster, breaking through within a thousand years. However,
the later steps would be much more difficult and breaking through
would be much slower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, I need to
first make further breakthroughs in my five Supreme Daos. Only then
will I be able to develop an even more profound Omega Sword Dao.”
Ning understood that his path would be a more difficult one. Others,
however, would have no idea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll stay in
seclusion for ten years. Ten years from now I’ll say that I broke
through to become a Daolord of the Second Step,” Ning mused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ten years. Under
temporal acceleration, this would translate into over a thousand
years. Given Ning’s level of talent, for him to break through to
become a Daolord of the Second Step in roughly a thousand years
wouldn’t be that surprising to others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a Daolord of the
Second Step, for him to possess a Dao on the level of his Omega Sword
Dao would make sense. If others knew that a Daolord of the First Step
possessed such a terrifyingly powerful Sword Dao, news would quickly
spread throughout the Endless Territories. Ning truly didn’t want
to see this happen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the next ten
years, I need to finish mastering the [Novessence Thunder] and the
[Novessence Water], as well as the protective divine ability the
deceased Hegemon gave me, the [Sword Dao Body].” Ning came to his
decision. Of the various divine abilities and secret arts which the
deceased Hegemon had given him, the only one he could use for now was
the protective divine ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because Ning
had already reached the apex of power in the [Golden Idol] technique,
and his body was comparable to a supreme Dao weapon. That was the
highest limit possible for World-level cultivators. Only now, after
becoming a Daolord, was he able to use the deceased Hegemon’s
[Sword Dao Body]. When trained to the apex, it would make his divine
body comparable to a supreme Eternal treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given his life would be
a life surrounded by battle, if he wished to live a long life he had
to be able to take a beating!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The primordial chaos
was filled with all types of dangers, and one’s enemies were
capable of all sorts of insidious attacks. If your divine body was
able to take a beating, your chances of staying alive would improve
dramatically. All Daolords of the Fourth Step had extremely powerful
and unfathomable techniques. These were terrifying powers gained
after your personal Dao had reached an extremely high level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time continued to flow
on, and twelve years passed in the blink of an eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Darknorth Estate.
Although Pillsaint and Su Youji continued to train with their main
bodies, both left incarnations there to await Ning’s return.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s been quite
some time since Master became a Daolord. Why hasn’t he come out?”
Pillsaint was quite puzzled. “It’s been twelve years. Even
Daolord Solesky has come to ask about this, but all the two of us can
do is wait here like fools. Twelve years!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Twelve years is
nothing. Your true body is using the temporal acceleration treasure
inside the estate to train, right?” Su Youji said, “Even if it
takes a thousand years or ten thousand years, you have no choice but
to wait.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know, I know. I’m
just mumbling to myself,” Pillsaint said hurriedly. “Generally
speaking, people will quickly emerge from secluded meditation after
becoming Daolords. Our master has been in seclusion for far too
long.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“True.” Su Youji
nodded. “It has been quite a while.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An utterly terrifying
Sword Dao aura suddenly surged outwards. However, the restrictive
spells surrounding the Darknorth Estate prevented it from leaving the
estate, making it impossible for anyone outside to notice what was
going on. This Sword Dao aura was so lofty, exalted, and fierce, both
Su Youji and Pillsaint couldn’t help but quiver upon sensing it.
Faced with this aura, they couldn’t even think about resisting it;
the only thing they felt was fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Sword Dao…
this Sword Dao…” Both of them were completely shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A period of time went
past, but they remained unable to calm down. Rumble… the doors to
the room swung open, and a white-robed youth who carried a black
sword scabbard on his back emerged from within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Both
immediately rose to their feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, you…” Su
Youji stared at Ning and the aura around him. It seemed rather
different from that of most Daolords of the First Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After I became a
Daolord, I suddenly gained many new insights and so I chose to train
for a period of time. Who would’ve thought that I’d break through
and become a Daolord of the Second Step?” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Daolord of the
Second Step?” Both Su Youji and Pillsaint were quite astonished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, felt a
bit ashamed. Since he chose to hide his true power, he had to hide it
from everyone; only then would he be secure. Ning’s subconscious
had whispered to him repeatedly that pretending to be a Daolord of
the Second Step was the best choice; only then would his path of
cultivation be a safe one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master… I’ve
heard many say that advancing from the first step to the second step
is quite fast, with some succeeding in just a thousand years, but I
didn’t imagine you would be that fast as well.” Su Youji said
excitedly, “Master, you truly are incredible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. No need to
tell others about this,” Ning said. He then raised his head to
stare towards the skies. With but a thought, he dispelled the
formation spells surrounding the Darknorth Estate. As soon as he did
so, both Daolord Solesky and Daolord Battlemaster sensed it right
away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah, Ji Ning!
Congratulations on making your breakthrough.” A wave of godsense
swept towards him, bringing a mental chuckle with it. “Oho, this
aura of yours… have you become a Daolord of the Second Step?”

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just a short while
later, Daolords Solesky, Battlemaster, and Brightfish all arrived at
the Darknorth Estate. They stared at Ji Ning in astonishment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s with the
looks on your faces?” Ning immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To advance from
being a Daolord of the First Step to a Daolord of the Second Step
within a thousand years… we’ve only heard of such things in
legends.” Daolord Solesky beamed merrily as he looked at Ning. “But
today, I’ve witnessed it myself. See that, Brightfish? That’s
what a true ‘genius’ is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Brightfish
looked at Ning, then nodded and grunted in assent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised his head
staring at the dark gray wind which was blotting out the skies above
them. “Big brother Solesky, what are Patriarch Clearwind’s
strengths and weaknesses? You’ve been feuding against him for ages;
you should know better than anyone else. Please tell me everything
you know.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His strengths and
weaknesses?” Daolord Solesky looked at Ning, puzzled. “What are
you planning to do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s copy of the
Brightshore Kingdom’s star map had information regarding the
Daolords in each territory, and it also had fairly detailed
information on Patriarch Clearwind. Based on that information, Ning
felt confident that he could give Patriarch Clearwind a run for his
money! However, Daolord Solesky had been battling Patriarch Clearwind
for so long that he probably had far more information than the star
map did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was going to be a
big battle. He had to prepare for it as best as he could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…” The nearby
Daolord Battlemaster first frowned, then stared towards Ning in
shock. “You are preparing to give Patriarch Clearwind a fight?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
Brightfish, Solesky, and even Pillsaint and Su Youji were both
shocked as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gave Daolord
Battlemaster a surprised glance, then nodded. “Big brother
Battlemaster’s Numerancy skills truly are formidable. Indeed. I’ve
become much more powerful and wish to test myself against Patriarch
Clearwind.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“B-but you are just a
new Daolord of the Second Step.” Daolord Solesky grew nervous. “How
could you be so rash as to challenge Clearwind? He’s every bit a
match for me. Even though Battlemaster is also at the fourth step,
he’s still a level weaker than Patriarch Clearwind. Do you think
you are invincible, now that you have broken through from the World
level to become a Daolord of the Second Step? Ji Ning, I don’t want
to criticize you, but you have to be cautious when roaming the
Endless Territories. If you act this rashly, you will probably die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky really
was panicking. Had his brother gone mad?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother.” Ning
didn’t try to argue with him. “Receive a blow from me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Daolord
Solesky looked at Ning, then nodded. “Very well. Strike with your
full power. I want to see how strong you are.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning suddenly
disappeared into thin air. Daolord Solesky had been quite calm, but
now his face turned pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Swish! Swish! Swish! Sword-shadows formed from finger-strikes
suddenly appeared everywhere and stabbed towards Daolord Solesky,
every single one of them moving with incomprehensible speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fast. Too fast!
H-how…” Daolord Solesky’s hands instantly transformed into two
streams of water that swirled around each other, completely covering
the area around him as they strove to defend against Ning’s
sword-shadows. Despite that, Daolord Solesky was rendered completely
off-balance and forced to take on the attacks head-on, causing waves
and splashes of water to explode around him. This caused the nearby
Daolord Battlemaster and Daolord Brightfish to both feel tremendous
shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s form appeared
once more standing off in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How was it, big
brother?” Ning looked at Daolord Solesky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well done, my
brother!” Daolord Solesky revealed a look of delight, his eyes
radiating excitement as he stared at Ning. He roared with laughter,
“Well done, my brother! With this stance alone, you have the power
to roam the Endless Territories unimpeded. How could you be this
fast? In fact, you seem to be even faster in battle!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is due to the Dao
which I comprehended,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was able to move
at ten times the speed of light. Other Daolords who used flying
treasures or rode on lightning or light would also be able to move at
ten times the speed of light, but there was a critical difference;
for them, that speed could only be obtained when they were fleeing at
high speed! The speed at which they could move and dodge in confined
spaces in close quarters combat was much slower. Ning, however, had
launched more than sixty thousand frenzied attacks within this region
in that brief moment… and he was actually able to move and dodge at
the incredible speed of ten times the speed of light in battle!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This wasn’t a speed
one could reach thanks to treasures or external resources. It
depended on the Dao you had comprehended.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some who trained in the
Dao of Lightning, the Dao of Wind, or the Dao of Light would be able
to move dozens of times faster than the speed of light once they
became Daolords of the Fourth Step! This was what made them so
incredibly formidable in battle. But of course, people like them were
incredibly rare; less than one in a hundred Daolords of the Fourth
Step would have such skills. But of course, the other Daolords might
be skilled in other areas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formidable.”
Daolord Solesky was extremely impressed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our big brother is
right. By relying on this Sword Dao, Darknorth, you do indeed have
the power to roam the Endless Territories.” Daolord Battlemaster
nodded in praise as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Incredible.”
Daolord Brightfish sighed in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Solesky immediately
asked, “Right, Ji Ning. When you were in the Sword Palace of the
Brightshore Kingdom, you should’ve been given the title of
‘Swordlord’, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My master became a
Swordlord shortly after he entered the Sword Palace. He was one of
the top-ranking ones in the Twelve Palaces, at that.” Pillsaint
immediately spoke up proudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hah! The Brightshore
Kingdom is one of the six major powers. You’ve only been training
for a short period of time, yet you managed to rank amongst the top
World-level cultivators of the Brightshore Kingdom? No wonder you are
such a monster despite having just reached the second step.”
Daolord Solesky nodded. “You might be a bit weaker than Patriarch
Clearwind, but your speed alone guarantees that he won’t be able to
take you down.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he spoke, he
produced a jade slip and immediately sent it towards Ning. “Clearwind
and I have battling for ages, and I know the ins and outs of
virtually all his techniques. I’ve recorded them all down within
this jade slip. Take a look!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning accepted it, then
immediately began to read through it carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right. This information
was indeed more detailed than the information included within the
Brightshore Kingdom’s star map. Patriarch Clearwind truly was
formidable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you think?”
Daolord Solesky looked at Ning. “Still want to fight him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course I’m
going to fight him.” Ning nodded. “We can’t just let him
continue to blockade the entrance of our Vastheaven Palace, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good!” Daolord
Solesky smiled. “Now that you are a Daolord, you are the fourth
Palace Lord of Vastheaven Palace. This here is one of the central
control mechanisms for our barriers and restrictive spells. If you
aren’t able to overcome your foe, you can retreat within the
palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he spoke, he handed
over a black-gold sawtoothed disc which was covered in complicated
divine runes. This thing was part of the core controls of the entire
Vastheaven Palace!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These core controls
can only be bound a single time,” Daolord Solesky said. “After
you bind them, they can never be bound by others again.” This was
for security reasons. If one of the Palace Lords of Vastheaven Palace
died and their opponent managed to take over and bind the core
controls… unacceptable! This place had been the headquarters for
Vastheaven Palace for countless ages, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After binding the disc,
Ning could sense the many complicated and powerful formations
covering all of Vastheaven Palace. Their power was indeed
astonishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then I’ll head
off.” Ning glanced at the others, then transformed into a streak of
light that flew away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful!”
Solesky called out from behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolords Brightfish,
Battlemaster, Pillsaint, and Su Youji all watched nervously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother
Battlemaster, Darknorth won’t be in any danger, will he?” Daolord
Brightfish asked nervously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Overall, he probably
isn’t a match for Clearwind. But he’s a sword cultivator! They
are very skilled in battle…” Battlemaster paused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He might not be able
to beat Clearwind, but he’ll definitely be able to keep himself
safe. Let him have his fight,” Solesky said with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Will he be able to
win?” Su Youji couldn’t help but ask this question.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’ll be hard.
Actually, there’s almost no chance of him winning.” Solesky shook
his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fierce gray tempest
continued to blot out the skies and the sun, causing the entire
Vastheaven Palace to be cast in stifling darkness. A streak of light,
however, rose up from within Vastheaven Palace. It flew out of the
barrier spells, then came to a halt in midair. It was a white-robed
youth who was carrying a black sheath on his back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clearwind!” Ning
barked out, his voice echoing and reverberating in the air, causing
innumerable sword-shadows to appear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The trillions of
sword-shadows all simultaneously shot out towards the distant shrine.
When the sword-shadows collided against the blurry gray storm, a
series of eruptions could be heard. The blurry gray wind began to
splinter and break apart, as did many of the sword-shadows. However,
more and more of the sword-shadows were born as they continued to
press the attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the blurry gray
wind, it also continued to be remade and surge out as well. The wind
was an external manifestation of Patriarch Clearwind’s Dao, while
Ning’s sword-shadows were external manifestations of his own Omega
Sword Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two Daos began to
clash against each other, harder and harder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” This entire
time, the man dressed in handsome black robes had been seated within
the shrine, his eyes closed. He suddenly rose to his feet and then
walked to the entrance of the shrine, where he stared downwards at
the white-robed figure in midair, ensconced by those countless
sword-shadows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So you are
Darknorth?” Patriarch Clearwind immediately recognized the man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am,” Ning
replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Clearwind
said, “A Daolord of the Second Step already? Or were you just
pretending to be at the World level earlier? Hmph. I will admit that
your Sword Dao is extraordinary, and it’s impressive that a weak
Daolord of the Second Step like you could have such an incredible
Sword Dao. If you choose to pit yourself against me, however… then
you truly are overestimating your capabilities.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s cut the
crap. Eat my sword!” The distant Ning let out a furious bellow.
Clang! A Northbow sword immediately flew out from the black scabbard
on his back.
</P>

Chapter 19 – Battling Patriarch Clearwind
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ensconced by trillions
of sword-shadows, the mid-air Ji Ning manifested three heads and six
arms, with each of his six hands gripping that single Northbow sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Ning raised
his Northbow sword up high, the swords emanating auras of
incomparable dominance and power. He then unleashed a single furious
chop directly towards his opponent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like the
Northbow sword was cutting an utterly massive yet extremely neat
chasm through space. Sword-light immediately filled those chasm,
almost instantly chopping directly towards Patriarch Clearwind. The
power of this strike suddenly exploded, as though it a volcano that
had been building towards an eruption suddenly erupted in an instant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was using his
Omega Sword Dao – Heavenbreaker! The Omega Sword Dao could be
gentle or savage, insidious or dominating. It was all up to his
personal decision. Once the many mysteries of the Dao of the Sword
were truly merged together, they instantly exploded in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had chosen to
fight head on with his first strike, which was why he had merely used
a single sword. For such a wild, furious strike, a single sword was
actually better. The deceased Hegemon himself had used that single
dark blue greatsword! This was because when the power of six arms
were completely focused upon a single sword, it would give that sword
even more dominating power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Patriarch
Clearwind remained as calm and unflappable as the winds. He simply
narrowed his eyes and snorted, then produced a seemingly slender yet
incredibly sharp longsword in his hands. He didn’t understand much
regarding the Dao of the Sword, but to him using swords or sabers
really didn’t make much of a difference. The slenderness and
incredible sharpness of this sword was just highly suited to his own
Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Scram!” Patriarch
Clearwind struck out with the longsword in his hands. If one strictly
viewed this from the standpoint of the Dao of the Sword, this truly
was a rather unsightly stance. But when the longsword in his hands
struck out, it instantly began to roar like an endless tempest
howling angrily through the lands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The volcanic eruption
from the Northbow sword clashed against the howling, gale-like
slender sword. Two surges of terrifying, earth-rending power collided
together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Patriarch
Clearwind revealed a shocked look. He had actually been knocked
backwards by that attack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An utterly terrifying
shockwave spread out in every direction, and space itself rippled as
though a black wave had spread across its watery surface. Mountain
ranges were instantly reduced to dust, while Vastheaven Palace’s
barriers managed to withstand this shockwave. As for Patriarch
Clearwind’s shrine, it was actually sent tumbling through the air,
and the seven World-level cultivators within it were all filled with
horror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all stared
nervously towards the outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had taken just a
single step backwards, while Patriarch Clearwind had been knocked
flying. However, the latter quickly found his footing, then turned to
stare icily towards Ning. This was the first time he truly viewed
Ning as a worthy opponent. “What a dominating Sword Dao. I never
would’ve imagined that a Daolord of the Second Step would be able
to threaten me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Clearwind was
truly stunned. Although he had delivered just a casual blow, it was
still a blow from a Daolord of the Fourth Step. How was it that he
had actually lost that exchange?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You aren’t bad
either,” Ning snorted coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent. Receive
another blow from my sword, then.” Patriarch Clearwind’s body
transformed, becoming as blurry as the wind as the slender sword in
his hand struck out again, once more bringing that terrifying,
enraged stormy howl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he once
more valiant and confidently gripped his sword with all six hands,
moving forward to welcome the blow head on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This frontal collision
caused a shockwave that was even more terrifying than the previous
one, but this time the one knocked backwards was Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As expected, he’s
stronger than me in a frontal clash.” Ning’s face tightened
slightly as he was sent flying backwards, and he was only able to
come to a halt just before crashing into the barriers around
Vastheaven Palace. “However… this strike is roughly on the same
technical level as the one that came before it; it was just several
times stronger. He probably used some sort of a divine ability.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s azureflower
mist energy gave him the energy level of a Daolord of the Fourth
Step, but he wasn’t able to use any divine abilities. Now that his
opponent was, he was at an immediate disadvantage! This was one of
the problems of fighting those who were at a higher level than you.
Fortunately, Ning was using a lifeblood weapon; otherwise, he
would’ve lost even more disastrously. Ever since he had used his
Omega Sword Dao to reform the quintessence cores inside his lifeblood
weapons, they had grown significantly more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You actually managed
to block. Hmph.” Patriarch Clearwind’s face tightened slightly as
he narrowed his eyes, then leapt forwards to charge towards Ning once
more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, is this really
all you have?” Ning laughed loudly as five more swords came flying
out from the scabbard on his back, landing in his other five hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six hands, six swords.
All six were lifeblood weapons!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s fight.”
Ning stood there in the air, instantly charging to appear in front of
Patriarch Clearwind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Patriarch
Clearwind chopped out with the slender sword in his hands, his
stances sometimes soft but sometimes ferocious. At all times, it
embodied the essence of the wind itself, and it possessed truly
incredible power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, had six
swords and many different stances available. Some were extremely
inscrutable and mysterious, while others seemed to form terrifying
black holes that had folded layers of terrifying spatial power.
Previously, Ning had to use all six swords together to achieve this
effect with his Soleheart stance, but now that he had his Omega Sword
Dao he was able to infuse all of those mysteries with but a single
sword. It looked like a black hole, but it also seemed to contain
some of the mysteries of the Shadowless stance, the Heavenbreaker
stance, and other stances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was a battle of six
swords against one, and Ning’s sword-arts truly were frightening.
For now, Patriarch Clearwind was unable to do anything to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are quite
impressive. For you to be able to force me to show my divine
abilities… you should feel proud of yourself.” Patriarch
Clearwind let out a cold snort, then instantly manifested a total of
six arms as well as five slender swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six arms, six swords.
Once more, he charged straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” Ning’s
defenses were breached in a single exchange. The enemy’s attack was
simply too overwhelming. This man was clearly quite a bit stronger
than him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems I really
can’t just fight against him head-on.” Ning now understand the
difference in power between the two of them. Earlier, he used all six
arms to wield a single sword while using his most physically powerful
strike, but he had still been overcome. With this foe now using six
swords as well… there was no way he could win in a head-on fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly vanished
into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?!” Patriarch
Clearwind was momentarily stunned. His white eyebrows shot up in
surprise as he swept the area with both his gaze and his godsense,
only to discover that someone was circling him at absolutely
terrifying speeds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light shone once
more. Clang! Patriarch Clearwind immediately moved to dodge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later, hundreds
and thousands of streaks of sword-light began to light up. Ning
struck simply far too fast, and his dodging speed was incredibly fast
as well, so fast that there was nothing Patriarch Clearwind could do.
If your advantage in combat speed and agility reached a point where
you were dramatically superior to your opponent, you could attack
your opponent freely without your opponent being able to fight back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can he be this
fast? How can he be this fast in actual combat?!” Patriarch
Clearwind was completely stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To be able to move at
ten times the speed of light in combat was extremely rare. He never
would’ve imagined meeting someone capable of it who was merely a
Daolord of the Second Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where the hell did
this freak come from? He must be one of those freaks who has mastered
and joined together multiple Supreme Daos… and his Daos must be as
freakishly strong as he himself is!” For the first time, Patriarch
Clearwind was beginning to view Ning as a true equal, not just as a
worthy opponent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth!”
Surrounded by Ning’s attacks, Patriarch Clearwind used his six arms
to defend in an almost whirlwind-like manner. He called out in a cold
and deep voice, “You are indeed a worthy opponent for me.
Unfortunately… in the end, you are just a Daolord of the Second
Step. Have a taste of my [Six Winds] secret art!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As his voice echoed in
the skies…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Clearwind’s
long, handsome black robes began to flutter as a series of gales
sprang up. There were six types of wind; azure wind, red wind, blue
wind, violet wind, white wind, and black wind. The six furious gales
immediately began to erupt after appearing, filling the skies as they
swept towards Ning. As Patriarch Clearwind saw it, even if he was
unable to kill Ning, he’d still be able to shut him down and make
it so that he wouldn’t be able to move so quickly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing this, Ning came
to a halt in midair. “Clearwind, parlor tricks like this really
won’t cut it.” Ning’s body instantly began to emit streaks of
electric light. The lightning was dark-gold in color, so dark as to
be almost black with just a few flickers of gold within. At the same
time, he also unleash a turgid stream of water that was completely
icy-white in color. As soon as it appeared, it emanated an aura of
coldness that caused even space itself to freeze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Septessence thunder,
and septessence water!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s azureflower
mist energy was already comparable to the energy of a Daolord of the
Fourth Step, and he also had the [Seven Leafpill Chapters] to study
from. It had been fairly easy for him to master the septessence
thunder and the septessence water techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!” Ning’s gaze
turned cold as the dark-golden lightning thundered downwards
apocalyptically and the infinitely cold stream of water froze all
within its path. Even worse, they swirled and coiled about each
other, forming an utterly terrifying and enormous vortex-world. This
was the power of the Yin-Yang Sword Domain of Ning’s new Omega
Sword Dao when used in the form of a lightning-water domain. It was
at least ten times stronger than merely using septessence thunder and
septessence water normally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dark
lightning-water domain seemed to be capable of breaking apart
everything within its range. As soon as it clashed against the six
types of wind, the six types of wind emanated terrifying howls of
rage as it began to splinter apart. Clearly, it was actually weaker!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Patriarch
Clearwind’s face finally turned pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Vastheaven
Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolords Solesky,
Battlemaster, Brightfish, Pillsaint, and Su Youji had been watching
this entire time. All of them were stunned as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This battle involved
utterly ruinous levels of power, and both sides were using nearly
apocalyptic techniques. Patriarch Clearwind had long been a famous
figure. Who would’ve thought that Ji Ning would actually be able to
fight him to a standstill?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth’s
lightning-water sword domain was actually able to break apart that
madman’s [Six Winds] secret art.” Daolord Solesky sighed in
amazement. “Oh, this is really, really impressive. I thought that
he would definitely be at a disadvantage in this fight, and would
have to rely on his speed to keep himself alive. Now, it seems as
though the difference in combat power between the two of them isn’t
that great, and he even has an advantage in terms of secret arts. It
won’t be easy for that madman to win this fight. He’ll probably
have to unleash his desperation attacks if he wants to win.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s actually able
to fight Clearwind to a standstill.” Daolord Battlemaster sighed in
amazement as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Su
Youji’s eyes were shining with excitement as she watched this
fight.

Chapter 20 – The Hegemon’s Armor
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A terrifying
vortex-world of lightning and water filled the skies, emanating an
aura of absolute annihilation as it swirled around Patriarch
Clearwind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could his secret
arts be this strong? He’s merely a Daolord of the Second Step. What
type of unearthly, shocking legacy did he manage to uncover?”
Patriarch Clearwind was truly stunned. His divine body began to turn
blurry as gusts of wind began to swirl around him, striving to ablate
the crushing power of the septessence thunder and septessence water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Ning
transformed into a streak of light as he once more charged towards
Patriarch Clearwind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. You think a
minor secret art like that is enough to deal with me?” Patriarch
Clearwind let out an angry roar. Although he was being suppressed by
the water-lightning domain, the furious winds surrounding him made it
so that the lightning and water found it difficult to actually strike
against him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given Patriarch
Clearwind’s power, most likely only the full novessence thunder and
novessence water would be enough to injure him. But of course, Ning
had never planned on using his sword-intent domain alone to injure
his foe. What he wanted to do was to use it to suppress and bind his
foe, making his foe slower and allowing himself to further maximize
his advantage in speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Ning stood
there within the awesome domain of lightning and water… then
suddenly vanished without a trace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One streak after
another of terrifying sword-light began to appear and attack
Patriarch Clearwind. Some of the sword-light possessed terrifying
penetrative powers, some were unfathomable and mysterious. Given that
Ning already had an absolute advantage in terms of speed, for a time
Patriarch Clearwind found himself stifled quite miserably. All he
could do was rely on his six arms to defend as best as he could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You young brat!”
Patriarch Clearwind’s eyes suddenly shone with azure light, and the
power of the howling gale surrounding him instantly increased, making
it so that the lightning and the water were completely unable to
penetrate his defenses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” Daolord
Battlemaster, watching from within the distant Vastheaven Palace,
couldn’t help but narrow his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The madman’s
starting to use his killer attacks.” Daolord Solesky had a solemn
look on his face as well. “Brother Ji Ning was able to force this
madman into using this attack far sooner than I had expected. Still…
brother Ji Ning is incredibly fast. If he chooses to retreat, there’s
nothing which Clearwind can do to him. Clearwind can’t maintain his
berserk state forever; it uses up far too much divine power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master isn’t
retreating?!” Su Youji was panicking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?!” Daolord
Brightfish and Daolord Battlemaster began to panic as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That jade slip I
gave him contained detailed information on Clearwind’s killer
attack. He should’ve been able to recognize it right away!”
Daolord Solesky was frantic as well. The battle in the heavens
between these two mighty figures was absolutely terrifying; his
avatar alone would not be able to make it there in time to help out,
nor did it have the strength to.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Patriarch
Clearwind’s eyes were ice cold, and all six slender swords in his
hands simultaneously chopped out in a deceivingly simple stance. Once
this strike was unleashed, it seemed as though the world itself was
falling apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wind howled
furiously as countless gales buffeted Ning, completely smashing
through the lightning-water domain of sword-intent, which was
incapable of stopping them in the slightest. The difference in power
was glaring and overwhelming.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was this killer
technique which allowed Patriarch Clearwind to be famous throughout
the Endless Territories. Without it, he was just a fairly strong
Daolord of the Fourth Step. With it, he was capable of threatening
the lives of the vast majority of other Daolords of the Fourth Step!
The reason why Daolord Battlemaster did not take part in this battle
was precisely because he was worried about being killed by this
attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was entirely
capable of retreating from it at high speeds! Battlemaster, however,
didn’t have Ning’s speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sort of killer
technique was actually a type of forbidden art which used up an
absolutely shocking amount of divine power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He isn’t fleeing
from it?” Patriarch Clearwind’s eyes grew even colder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning valiantly struck
out with all six swords in a defensive posture, using the mysteries
of the Soleheart stance of his Omega Sword Dao to form a domain of
absolute darkness around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The terrifying winds
blew through his defenses as though they were paper, destroying all
in their path. They slammed straight into and through the dark domain
around Ning, instantly shattering this abyssal domain apart and then
smashing directly against the true body of Ning behind the domain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!” Back in
Vastheaven Palace, Su Youji revealed a look of panic in her eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! Why?!”
Solesky couldn’t believe it. He refused to believe that Ning would
act in such a suicidal fashion. He knew how deadly this killer attack
was. Why didn’t he dodge it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The terrifying blow
landed directly against Ning, but the ancient cuirass of armor Ning
was wearing was covered in many layers of countless divine runes.
When the concussive power of the blow slammed into the armor, much of
it was immediately absorbed and ablated, with some of the power
actually being transformed into energy that was then thrust back
against the blow, weakening it even further. The actual process would
be quite complicated to describe, but by the time the power of the
blow made it through this suit of armor, it had less than one
thousandth of its original power. That remaining amount of power was
spread evenly throughout Ning’s entire body, and it caused him a
negligible amount of damage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This suit of Hegemon
armor truly is extraordinary.” Ning was filled with joy. The
deceased Hegemon of the Dao of the Sword was naturally an expert in
close combat. His most important treasure was naturally that dark
blue greatsword, but his second most important treasure was that suit
of armor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Paragon of Pills
had poured all of her blood, sweat, and tears in crafting this suit
of armor for the man she loved. It had no special properties at all.
It must be understood that most powerful armors had various special
properties, such as reflecting damage onto attackers or even
containing powerful secret arts. The Hegemon’s armor, however, was
very simple. It had only one property – defense!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Virtually all attacks
would be reduced to a thousandth of their original power. Perhaps a
Hegemon’s attack would do better, but even then it would only have
a hundredth of its normal power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thanks to this suit of
armor, the Sword Hegemon’s body had been completely undamaged!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had chosen to
forcibly endure that killing blow precisely because he felt confident
in the armor. But of course, even if he didn’t have it he still
wouldn’t have been afraid, as he had already trained in the
Hegemon’s protective divine ability, the [Sword Dao Body], for over
a thousand years. His body was already comparable to a low-grade
Eternal weapon. If he wanted to keep training, he’d need to use
certain treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To go from being a
top-grade Dao weapon to being a low-grade Eternal weapon seemed like
a minor improvement, but there was a qualitative difference between
Eternal weapons and Dao weapons. For example, Patriarch Clearwind was
able to destroy top-grade Dao weapons, but he wasn’t able to cause
any damage to low-grade Eternal weapons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had the Hegemon’s
armor protecting him on the outside, and a mighty protective divine
ability on the inside! How could Patriarch Clearwind possibly injure
him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! When the attack
landed against him, he couldn’t help but be knocked flying back. It
was only thanks to the power of his lightning-water domain of
sword-intent that he was able to stabilize himself and come to a
halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pretty strong.”
Ning revealed a smile and a praising nod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Y-you…”
Patriarch Clearwind’s smirk suddenly froze as he stared at Ning in
disbelief. “How are you…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if Darknorth
didn’t die, he should’ve at least been heavily injured.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your killer
technique’s not strong enough. You don’t have nearly the power
you would need if you want to kill me.” Ning shook his head. Even
without the Hegemon’s armor, his divine body’s toughness vastly
surpassed that of most Daolords of the Fourth Step. Ning had already
paid a steep price to fully master the [Golden Idol] technique,
making his body comparable to top-grade Dao weapons. To learn another
divine ability that could further upgrade his body and make it
comparable to an Eternal weapon, even a low-grade one, was quite
difficult. The cost of such an ability would be staggeringly high,
making it so that not even the vast majority of Daolords of the
Fourth Step would be able to learn any such technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon mastering the
[Sword Dao Body], your body would become comparable to a supreme
Eternal weapon!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the Hegemon’s
own divine ability, after all. The only reason he had been so
selfless as to give it to others was because he was dead! Someone
still alive like Emperor Mirrorsnow or the almighty Brightshore
Hegemon would always keep a few trump cards hidden for their own
private usage when transmitting legacies to others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I-I… I’m
impressed.” Patriarch Clearwind suddenly waved his hand, causing
the distant shrine to suddenly fly towards him. He then flew straight
into the shrine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning was
startled. The battle was over, just like that?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, there was
nothing Ning could do. He could leave if he wanted, but since
Patriarch Clearwind was actually stronger than him, Clearwind was
similarly able to leave as he pleased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What, you are
planning to leave?” The midair Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not just yet. I
think it’s time for us to have a good chat,” Patriarch Clearwind
said from within his shrine. He had been thoroughly intimidated by
Ning’s absolutely overwhelming speed. If he stayed hidden with his
shrine and relied on its formations, there would be nothing Ning
could do to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Solesky!
Battlemaster!” Patriarch Clearwind called out loudly, his voice
echoing within the skies. “We can have a chat now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The furious gray storm
had long ago vanished. Ning dispelled his lightning-water domain of
sword-intent as well, and the skies became calm and sunny once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, you madman! So
you are finally willing to talk?” Two streaks of light flew out
from Vastheaven Palace. They were Daolord Solesky and Daolord
Battlemaster. Daolord Solesky snickered, “Didn’t you say you were
going to besiege Vastheaven Palace for one or ten chaos cycles? Why
do you want to talk now? What makes you think I want to talk to you?
You really are overestimating your own importance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That was all my
fault,” Patriarch Clearwind said. “Solesky, my friend, please
don’t take offense.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky’s
eyes bulged out, and Daolord Battlemaster was stunned as well. Even
Ning was dazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The man was voluntarily
admitting fault? He was even addressing Solesky as ‘my friend’?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha! It’s rare
for you to bow your head to anyone, you madman. But the two of us
have been tussling for so long… for you to suddenly address me as
‘my friend’ sends chills up my spine.” Daolord Solesky glanced
mockingly at Patriarch Clearwind. “You can’t kill my brother Ji
Ning, but he can’t do anything to you either. Are you lowering your
head in order to ransom back that Daolord of the Third Step of
yours?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ransoming him back
is part of it,” Patriarch Clearwind said from within his shrine.
“More importantly, I wish for our two sides to reconcile. Let us
wipe away all our old grievances with a single handshake and never be
enemies again. If you wish to attach any conditions, my friend, you
can just go ahead and name them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Clearwind
knew exactly what he was doing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He didn’t fear
Battlemaster. He didn’t fear Solesky. He did, however, fear this
Darknorth fellow! Darknorth was already incredibly powerful as a
Daolord of the Second Step; there was nothing Clearwind could do to
him. Once Darknorth reached the third step or the fourth step…
given the feud between the two sides, that would probably be the day
when Clearwind Temple would be wiped out. The best decision was for
him to immediately resolve this feud, no matter what price had to be
paid.

Chapter 21 – Avatar
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Name any conditions
we want?” Solesky and Battlemaster exchanged a glance, mirth in
their eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The old madman’s
finally bowed his head. We’ve been fighting for tens of thousands
of chaos cycles. Now, he’s finally bowed his head.” Solesky
couldn’t help but sigh. He had been tussling with Clearwind for
many years now, and both were famous, respected figures who were
unwilling to concede to the other. Since they were enemies,
Vastheaven Palace and Clearwind Temple naturally became mortal
enemies as well, and the struggle had gone on for tens of thousands
of chaos cycles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To bow the head
represented the loss of face as well as the loss of many treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is all because of
Darknorth.” Battlemaster glanced at the nearby Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Solesky, my friend…
to tell you the truth, do you think I would ever lower my head to
you?” The distant Patriarch Clearwind, still within his shrine,
shook his head. “Absolutely impossible. However, your Vastheaven
Palace has gained yet another fine brother! Although I’m not
worried about this Darknorth at present, he’s still just a Daolord
of the Second Step. Soon, he’ll surpass me, and your Vastheaven
Palace shall become famous throughout the Endless Territories
alongside him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Solesky and
Battlemaster both laughed. In the future, Vastheaven Palace would be
guarded by a truly unearthly Daolord, one who would most likely be
able to kill even Eternal Emperors! It was obvious that Ning had that
type of potential.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However… Clearwind,
Solesky, and Battlemaster had no idea that Ning was actually even
more terrifying than they thought him to be. In truth, Ning was
nothing more than a Daolord of the First Step!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You praise me too
much,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not at all. I’m
just telling the truth,” Patriarch Clearwind said, then looked
towards Solesky. “Go ahead, Solesky. Tell me what you want.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clearwind, if you
want to resolve the enmities between us, I don’t mind,” Solesky
said. “But I do have three conditions.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The negotiations
between Vastheaven Palace and Clearwind Temple went on for over half
a day. Daolord Solesky’s initial requests had been truly excessive;
even if Patriarch Clearwind had sold off all his possessions, it
still wouldn’t be enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was how haggling
worked. One side asked for a sky-high price, the other side would
counter with a dirt-low offer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, Patriarch
Clearwind paid reparations of twenty million cubes worth of treasure.
The feud between the two was thus brought to an end, and the Daolords
of both sides swore lifeblood oaths not to cause trouble for each
other again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So long as the Daolords
did not fight, the squabbles between their World-level cultivators,
Elder Gods, and Ancestral Immortals were nothing more than minor
matters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, Ning
also squeezed all of Daolord Blesswind’s treasures out of him,
extorting almost every last drop of chaos nectar from the man. In the
end, the poor fellow had to swear a lifeblood oath swearing that he
really had less than a cube of chaos nectar’s worth of treasure
left! Only then did Ning allow Daolord Blesswind and the other
captives to be sent back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Vastheaven
Palace. Ji Ning, Solesky, Battlemaster, and Brightfish had all
gathered together. They were drinking Immortal wine and were chatting
together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hah! Just twenty
million cubes.” Daolord Solesky shook his head. “I was planning
to at least hit him for fifty million! I know he has an extremely
valuable life-saving treasure; that treasure alone is worth fifty
million. I blame Battlemaster! You kept on telling me to back off.
Otherwise, there’s no way I would’ve let him off the hook that
easily.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You were being too
hard on him.” Daolord Battlemaster sipped some wine from the cup in
his hands. “He’s just wary of Darknorth’s future potential, but
in truth there’s nothing we can do to him right now. If you pushed
him too far, he could just begin to evacuate Clearwind Temple and
make it impossible for us to find him… and he might scheme in
secret against us to take revenge. That would be nothing but
trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To him, that
life-saving treasure is more important than Clearwind Temple itself.”
Daolord Battlemaster sighed. “He only acquired it after
experiencing countless dangers over the course of many years. You
want him to hand it over? He’d rather you wipe out Clearwind
Temple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Solesky coughed a few
times.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Powerful cultivators
would usually expend their wealth on creating secret arts or powerful
magic treasures. It was very rare for them to actually trade those
things away to others! For example, the treasures which Daolord
Solesky and Daolord Clearwind had, all combined, were definitely
worth over a hundred million cubes each. The problem was that the
actual amount of ‘liquid’ wealth they had was much less, as some
of those treasures they needed for combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s six lifeblood
weapons, his Hegemon armor, and his Hegemon Dao-seals… they too
would not be traded to others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was all thanks to
Ji Ning.” Solesky looked at Ning. “Ji Ning, take the twenty
million.” As he spoke, he sent a storage treasure flying towards
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No way.” Ning was
badly shocked. How could he accept all this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are just a
Daolord of the Second Step. You’ll need more treasures in the
future. Just take it,” Daolord Solesky urged, but Ning steadfastly
refused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Battlemaster
said, “Brother Darknorth, you are a brand new Daolord. You’ll
need to spend money to create an avatar for yourself. A perfect
avatar will cost roughly ten million cubes, all by itself. You’ll
need to spend money in other areas as well. Just take it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could tell that
saying no was not an option. He said, “Then I’ll take half for
now. If you keep pressing me, I won’t take anything.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha! Fine, fine,
fine.” Solesky shook his head. “We won’t press you, alright?
Brother Brightfish, you are also a Daolord of the Second Step. Take
five million! Battlemaster, the rest is yours.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother?”
Battlemaster immediately protested.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This isn’t
necessary, big brother. You can’t do this,” Daolord Brightfish
immediately said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My true body is in
the Waveshift Realm. Once I gain what I need from it, I will
immediately begin my Daomerge.” Daolord Solesky shook his head. “It
doesn’t matter if I succeed or if I fail in my Daomerge; either
way, more treasure will be useless to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Battlemaster, and
Brightfish all felt their hearts grow heavy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Solesky had lived far
longer than the rest of them. He was preparing for his Daomerge, and
everyone knew that this virtually spelled a death sentence! Far, far
too few were able to succeed in this process.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, come! Have
some more wine. Now that Vastheaven Palace has Darknorth as a member,
I can face my Daomerge with much more confidence.” Daolord Solesky
laughed loudly. “And today, my old enemy finally bowed his head
before me. What an absolutely wonderful feeling! This feels better
than gaining any amount of treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For now, Ning elected
to remain within his Darknorth Estate and quietly train inside it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had earned a total
of thirteen million cubes worth of treasure from Patriarch Clearwind
and Daolord Blesswind. Ten million would be used to purchase suitable
materials for the creation of a perfect avatar for himself!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within an estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooooosh. This was a
world of icy darkness, a world where a freezing wind howled through
the skies. The icy wind filling the estate-world came from a black
cave, and deep within the cave there was an ice-locked figure. Next
to that figure sat a white-robed youth in the lotus position. The
white-robed figure’s entire body was emanating an unearthly level
of power that was being poured into the ice-locked figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time slowly flowed on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack! Crack! Crack!
The layers of ice around the figure began to crack apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The ice
shattered, allowing the formerly ice-bound figure to fly out. His
body was completely nude, and he emanated an aura of endless ice and
cold. His appearance was identical to Ji Ning’s. Moments later, a
layer of golden clothing appeared on his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-robed Ning
and the white-robed Ning glanced at each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. My avatar has
finally taken form. It now has a tenth of my full power. The rest
will be a matter of time.” The white-robed Ning nodded slightly,
then smiled. “Fellow Daoist Avatar, I’ll have to trouble you to
stay in Vastheaven Palace for now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll naturally
follow your requests, true body.” This was the golden-robed Ning’s
response.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, the two
shared the same memories and thoughts. This was nothing more than a
bit of an amusing diversion for Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His avatar contained
the same Dao as he himself used. However… it didn’t have the
azureflower seal! Ning had tested out his avatar. It could use most
divine abilities and secret arts, but it was unable to train in the
Nine Chaos Seals no matter what!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When my avatar uses
the Hegemon’s divine ability, it is capable of incredible power as
well. The only problem is, it can’t sustain it for too long.”
Ning shook his head. “Well, since my avatar has been formed, it is
time for me to leave Vastheaven Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning went to meet with
Daolord Solesky in private.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leaving Vastheaven
Palace? When are you planning to go?” Daolord Solesky wasn’t
surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No point in wasting
time. I’ll leave tomorrow.” Ning smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Solesky nodded.
“You are going to be going through a period of explosive growth.
This is indeed the best time for you to go out adventuring! But when
you are adventuring, you must be cautious, especially of Daolords of
the Fourth Step. Don’t underestimate any Daolord of the Fourth
Step; one of them might have an ability or Dao that perfectly
counters yours.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
nodded. The only reason why he had gone out to fight Patriarch
Clearwind was because he had a clear understanding of the man’s
powers. In the outside world, he would have to be far more cautious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were Daolords who
could move even faster than ten times the speed of light, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother, there
is one thing I wish to trouble you about,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re brothers. No
need to stand on ceremony. Just tell me what you need,” Daolord
Solesky said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wish to go to a
Sacred City of the Dao Alliance,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao Alliance was
the strongest of the six major powers in the Endless Territories. 99%
of the territories were controlled by the Dao Alliance. Its only
weakness was that it was not tightly governed and was a very loose
organization, with many of the ancient, reclusive powers within it
being figures with strange dispositions. If the Dao Alliance was
truly unified and stood together, there was no way the other five
organizations could possibly compete against it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao Alliance was
absolutely unfathomable. Treasures, divine abilities, secret arts…
the Dao Alliance was supreme in every area. Over the courses of
countless years, many figures like Emperor Heartsword and Daolord
Allgod had left behind their legacies to the Dao Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Makes sense. We are
Palace Lords of Vastheaven Palace, which means we are members of the
Dao Alliance.” Daolord Solesky nodded. “You really should go to
the Dao Alliance to check things out.”

Chapter 22 – Trailblazing
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Dao Alliance
covers too much territory. It has a total of eight Sacred Cities and
is led by the Dao Alliance’s Palace of Immortals,” Daolord
Solesky said. “Daolords normally head to the nearest Sacred City.
This makes travel much simpler.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning nodded. The
distance between each of the cities was incredibly far, and the
journey would be filled with many dangers. To physically travel all
the way from one Sacred City to another one across so many
territories was simply too taxing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The closest Sacred
City to us… given that you fly a bit faster than me, you should be
able to make it there in around a thousand years,” Daolord Solesky
said. “I’ve already reported the addition of a new Daolord within
Vastheaven Palace to the Dao Alliance. Once you reach the Sacred
City, first go and retrieve a Dao Alliance medallion. Otherwise,
there will be many places within the Sacred City which you cannot
enter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
nodded. The Dao Alliance did have enemies, such as the Dark Kingdom.
There were many places within the Dao Alliance which outsiders simply
were forbidden from entering!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can enter all
eight of the Sacred Cities. The Dao Alliance’s Palace of Immortals,
however, is our true core. No one is permitted to enter unless they
are invited by the palace itself. Only then can they enter,”
Daolord Solesky said. “Generally speaking, fairly powerful Daolords
of the Fourth Step stand a good chance at receiving an invitation.
Given how formidable you are, Ji Ning, you should be able to get an
invitation in the future as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The headquarters of the
six major forces were all mysterious, inscrutable places. The Palace
of Immortals was the most mysterious and the most powerful of the
six. Supposedly, it held the secrets behind the reason why the Dao
Alliance had been able to maintain supremacy for so long without
falling. However, very few knew the truth behind those secrets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s one more
thing I need to warn you about.” Daolord Solesky suddenly seemed to
remember something. He immediately warned solemnly, “The Dao
Alliance is simply enormous, and so it is quite chaotic as well. It
holds many different organizations within it, and the eight Sacred
Cities are all led by different organizations. Every single Sacred
City has certain ancient, powerful freaks ruling them from the
shadows. No matter what, you must not let yourself get dragged into
the internal battles of the Dao Alliance. My guess is, once your true
power is revealed, they’ll definitely try to recruit someone as
talented as you into their fold.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The eight Sacred
Cities all belong to different organizations?” Ning was amazed. “So
there are at least eight different competing ‘branches’?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nine main ones,
actually. There are also many smaller organizations as well. To put
it succinctly, the Dao Alliance is incredibly chaotic,” Daolord
Solesky said. “Supposedly, this involves some of the deepest
secrets of the Palace of Immortals. Daolords of the Fourth Step like
me and Battlemaster would never dare to get involved in these
matters. Only those old freaks and some truly unearthly Daolords
would dare to get involved. Even if you do wish to get involved, you
should only do so after becoming a Daolord of the Fourth Step
yourself. Otherwise, you’ll end up dying without even realizing
what is happening. The civil wars that erupt within the Dao Alliance
are more vicious than anywhere else.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why the
civil wars within the Dao Alliance were so frenzied was actually
because the other five major forces in the Endless Territories were
too weak; they might occasionally take a few provocative actions
against the Dao Alliance, but they would never dare to launch any
large-scale wars.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A vessel was soaring
through the space of the primordial chaos. Atop the flying vessel
were Su Youji, Daolord Pillsaint, and the white-robed Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had already
departed from Vastheaven Palace and had embarked upon an even greater
journey.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, this doesn’t
seem to be the way to the Sacred City, is it?” Pillsaint was
puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re going to
take a detour first. We’re going to my homeland first.” Ning
smiled. “It isn’t too far away. We’ll go to the Sacred City of
the Dao Alliance after that.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your homeland?” Su
Youji was curious. “Where is it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ll know when
you get there.” Ning chuckled. “However, you aren’t allowed to
tell others as to where my homeland is located.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,” Su
Youji and Pillsaint both said. Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It would take a
thousand years to get to the nearest Sacred City. By comparison,
heading back to the Three Realms, given his current speed, would only
take a century!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master and Windfiend
are planning to leave the Three Realms after making their
breakthroughs. They wish to go explore the Endless Territories and
gain a better understanding of the greater world outside.” Ning
frowned. “The spatial tunnel leading from the Badlands Territory to
my homeland isn’t very stable, and there are many dimensional tears
within it. If they aren’t lucky, they might end up being sucked
into one of the tears and be teleported to who-knows-where.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It has been so many
years, but I’ve heard no news of Mother Nuwa at all. I’m afraid
that she must have been trapped within one of those tears and was
teleported away.” This was Ning’s hypothesis.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That unstable vortex
passageway was extremely dangerous. Given Ning’s level of power, he
could use his sword-intent to suppress and stabilize the vortex, but
how could Subhuti and the others possibly be strong enough to do the
same?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems I’ll have
to engage in a bit of trailblazing. I’ll have to establish a safe
and secure route from the Badlands Territory to the Three Realms,”
Ning mused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many ‘safe
routes’ on the star maps of the Endless Territories had all been
discovered by countless generations of exploring cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Primaltwin is in
the Three Realms, while I am outside of it. I can sense its rough
location,” Ning mused to himself. “If I continue to go forwards,
I’ll reach it sooner or later, and the path I cleared would be safe
for future travelers. Since I’m as strong as a Daolord of the
Fourth Step and have the Hegemon’s armor on me, a bit of
trailblazing shouldn’t be too difficult.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hundred years later,
they reached the borders of the Badlands Territory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forward ho!” The
flying vessel ventured deep into the unknown, unexplored parts of the
endless primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Trailblazing was quite
a dangerous decision, as you might encounter certain dangerous
locations along the way. Ning only dared to do this because of how
powerful he had become.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat there in the
lotus position on the deck of his vessel. He could sense some of the
dangers that were located within a certain distance from him. He was
the master of the Omega Sword Dao, which was why he could in fact be
titled as the ‘master of the Dao of the Sword’. The prime essence
of the Dao of the Sword filled every inch of the universe, and it
served as Ning’s ‘eyes’. The stronger Ning’s soul became and
the higher level his insights into the Dao of the Sword reached, the
greater distance he would be able to ‘see’ using the Dao of the
Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After much nurturing
from the azureflower mist energy, Ning’s soul was now comparable to
that of most Daolords of the Fourth Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised his head to
stare off into the distance. “There is some danger roughly sixty
trillion kilometers away from us. Most Daolords who enter that place
will perish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A star map was located
across Ning’s legs. Ning put down a marking on that star map.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was marking down the
various chaos stars and dangerous areas he encountered and saw on
this journey. That way, those who used this map wouldn’t worry
about getting lost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To travel from the
Badlands Territory to the Three Realms was quite a long journey. The
trailblazing ended up taking more than three hundred years, but along
the way Ning was able to sense only one place of incredible danger.
The other areas, a bit of vigilance would suffice. But of course,
that was only true for someone like Ning; for World-level
cultivators, those places were all deathtraps!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, we’re almost
there. We are about to reach the Three Realms.” Ning could sense
that his Primaltwin was fairly close now, and he revealed a smile.
“We should make it there in just a few more decades.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Establishing a safe
passageway out would benefit the members of the Three Realms for
countless years to come. So long as this passageway was kept secret,
outsiders would have no idea how to enter and exit the Three Realms
securely. Not even Daolords of the Fourth Step would have a way to
locate the Three Realms with ease; Ning was only able to accomplish
it thanks to his Primaltwin serving as a guidepost for him. He was
able to sense where his Primaltwin was at all times, thus ensuring
that he wouldn’t get lost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, in the past
three hundred years we’ve discovered quite a few dangerous areas.”
Su Youji couldn’t help but raise this issue. “The area around
your homeland is a bit too dangerous, isn’t it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is rather
dangerous, yes.” Ning nodded. He too felt that the density of
dangerous areas around the Three Realms was abnormally high.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The universe is vast
and mysterious. All things are possible.” Ning smiled. Moments
later, his face suddenly turned pale as a strange look appeared on
his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning turned
to stare in a certain direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master?” Su Youji
and Pillsaint both noticed that something was off with Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just stared
intently off into the distance, and the outlines of the azureflower
seal actually appeared on his forehead. The azureflower seal was
currently resonating with a distant location. Even the azureflower
region with his body was resonating!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Something actually
caused a resonance with the azureflower seal!” Ning was both
shocked and nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had encountered
quite a few fortuitous benefactors, such as the Paragon of Pills and
the almighty Brightshore Hegemon. Both of them were Hegemon-level
figures! He had also received the legacy of the deceased Hegemon of
the Dao of the Sword. By now, Ning was a very experienced man… but
the [Nine Chaos Seals], its azureflower region, and the azureflower
mist energy it generated all remained completely outside of Ning’s
level of understanding.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, it had
been Daoist Three Purities who discovered the Nine Chaos Seals
floating outside the Three Realms. This entire time, Ning had felt
certain that the primordial chaos around the Three Realms had to
contain many secrets within them. And yet, all these years he had
never been able to discover them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now… while he was
trailblazing a path to the Three Realms, he had encountered something
which resonated with his azureflower seal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s head over
there and take a look,” Ning said. Swoosh! The flying vessel began
to fly towards the direction where the resonance was coming from.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it, Master?”
Su Youji couldn’t help but ask.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From this moment
forwards, the two of you need to obey every single word that I say.”
Ning had a solemn look on his face. The closer they moved towards
that location, the stronger the resonance with his azureflower seal
became.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After flying for a few
dozen days, the primordial chaos in the surrounding area completely
vanished, revealing a patch of pure, pristine space. There was no
energy at all in this region of space; in fact, even the power of the
universal prime essence of the Dao of the Sword had been suppressed
and rendered unable to enter this region. And it wasn’t just the
Dao of the Sword; none of the other universal prime essences were
able to enter this place at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that…” Ning
stared at the vast patch of empty space before him. It was completely
pure and pristine, and at its very end he was able to see some golden
mist. Upon seeing that golden mist, Ning had a sudden feeling of
incredible danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youji, Pillsaint,
the two of you must wait here. Do not move any closer,” Ning
barked.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 23 – Deluxe Hellgod
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Pillsaint
and Su Youji both started to grow nervous. The area up ahead
contained a region of pure space, with nothing within it whatsoever;
not even the prime essences of the universe held sway there. And yet,
when they stared at that region of pure space the two of them felt
their very souls shiver in fear. They had the feeling that if they
barged into that place, it was virtually guaranteed that they would
die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, I can sense
that this is no ordinary place. Don’t enter rashly,” Su Youji
said immediately.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, you should
first come up with a method to test it out. Only then should you
enter it,” Pillsaint agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning stared towards
the front, a solemn look on his face. He was supremely confident in
his abilities to handle even the likes of Patriarch Clearwind.
Although the empty field of pure space in front of him seemed rather
special, he was certain it posed neligible danger to him. But that
region of golden mist… his subconscious was screaming of danger.
Ning knew that the depths of the golden mist had to hold something
that was terrifyingly dangerous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This region of space
is quite extraordinary. All techniques and spells have been kept at
bay by it! Even the prime essences of the universe avoid this place,”
Ning said. “I can’t scan it with my godsense either, nor can I
scan it with my Dao of the Sword at all. There are no other options.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then don’t go in!”
Su Youji argued.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, Master!
Forget it. Don’t go in.” Pillsaint said the same thing. The
endless primordial chaos was filled with dangerous places. If you
knew it was dangerous, why did you have to go inside? But Ning only
shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nine Chaos Seals
remained the most inconceivably powerful technique he had ever
encountered. Now that his azureflower seal was resonating so strongly
with this location, it was obvious that there was something calling
to him from the depths of the golden mist. Ning had already placed
his Lifeblood Dao-seal by the side of his avatar in Vastheaven
Palace. Even if he died, he would be able to use that Dao-seal to
come back to life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Taking on a bit of risk
for the chance to learn some of the secrets of the azureflower seal
was worth it. “Just wait for me here,” Ning barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Acknowledged.”
Pillsaint and Su Youji had no choice but to accept his order. “But
be careful!” Su Youji added.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded gently.
Moments later, a vortex-world formed by dark-gold lightning and
icy-white water appeared around in the area around him. Swoosh! Ning
stepped into the region of pure space, and everything around him for
ten thousand kilometers became drawn into that lightning-snow vortex.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh.
Whoooosh. As soon as he entered that region, a stream of invisible
energy instantly swept towards Ning. This surge of invisible energy
was flowing through the empty region at all times. It seemed almost
ephemeral as it passed straight through the lightning-water
vortex-world, then brushed against Ning’s body. It was able to just
barely make it through Ning’s Hegemon armor, but it was
dramatically weakened in the process. It then brushed against Ning’s
soul itself, but Ning’s soul remained very stable; it was as though
a gentle breeze had blown across it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A direct soul
attack?” Ning was quite wary of this. He immediately turned his
head to look backwards, willing his lightning-water vortex-world to
stretch out and encompass Su Youji and Pillsaint within it. “No
matter what, do not enter this region of empty space. It contains a
pervasive force that will directly assault your soul. Ordinary
Daolords of the First Step would not be able to endure this type of
assault.” Ning’s voice echoed in the area around Su Youji and
Pillsaint.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After issuing the
warning, Ning continued to fly through the region of empty space,
moving at just two times the speed of light. For him, this was fairly
slow. As for Pillsaint and Su Youji, they watched Ning leave with
worried gazes as Ning moved towards that region of golden mist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
Ning reached the region of golden mist. This mist completely covered
this side of the empty region, and Ning could sense that the thing
which was resonating with his azureflower seal was on the other side
of the mist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is this mist?”
Ning reached out with his hand and formed a stream of sword-light.
The stream of sword-light stretched out to become thirty thousand
meters long. It delved straight into the golden mist in front of
Ning, slicing through it without encountering any impediments at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The mist doesn’t
seem to be dangerous or offensive, in and of itself,” Ning mused.
“The sense of danger should be emanating from deeper within the
golden mist.” Ning then reached out with his right hand, making it
expand to become more than thirty meters long before plunging it into
the golden mist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was right to be so
cautious. The strong sense of danger coming from his subconscious as
well as the marvelous properties of the Nine Chaos Seals ensured that
Ning would not dare to be negligent in dealing with this matter. As
Ning saw it, anyone capable of creating the Nine Chaos Seals had to
be at least as strong as the likes of the almighty Brightshore
Hegemon or the Paragon of Pills.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There really does
seem to be no danger here. This is nothing more than a metallic form
of energy.” Ning was unable to use his godsense to scan the place;
his only option was to use these fairly crude ways to test everything
out. Whoosh! Ning flew into the golden mist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the golden mist
completely surrounding him, even Ning was only able to see out to a
distance of roughly ten million kilometers. He carefully advanced at
the speed of light; ten million kilometers might seem like a long
distance, but if Ning moved at his full speed of ten tiems the speed
of light, he’d pass that distance in the blink of an eye. It’d be
too risky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning swept
the region before him with his gaze. Within this region of ten
million kilometers, he saw a strange beast that looked like a giant
golden pangolin. Its entire body was covered in armor plates, and it
was gracefully flying through the air. Each time it glided through
the air, it moved at three times the speed of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t sense
this creature posing much of a threat to him. “Still, best to avoid
it. No reason to cause any unnecessary trouble at a time like this.”
With but a thought, Ning suddenly vanished entirely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had just used the
Shadowless evasion skill, becoming one with the golden mist and
completely invisible to the naked eye. Given how distant that
carapaced creature was, it naturally wouldn’t be able to discover
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning spent sixteen full
hours flying through the golden mist, and the resonance with his
azureflower seal only grew stronger. However, he remained within the
golden mist region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? What’s with
all the beasts?” Ning swept the area before him with his gaze, only
to discover twenty-three golden beasts congregating together roughly
ten million kilometers away from him. Some were large, some were
small, but all of them caused Ning to feel a hint of danger. “The
sense of danger isn’t that strong. I should probably be able to
deal with them, but… the ones I encountered earlier were all by
themselves. Why are twenty-three of them here?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The strangest
environments always gave birth to the strangest and most unique
lifeforms or animals. Waterwalker, Bertulu, and others like them who
were born with sufficient amounts of intelligence could train in the
Dao like any cultivator. These beasts before Ning, however, were
fairly dumb and more like bugbeasts; there was no way for them to
cultivate at all. Still, the universe had given them their own path
to growth and evolution. Although it was guaranteed that there was no
way this path could let them gain eternity, it still provided them
with tremendous combat power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why are they all
gathered here? Is this their home?” Ning felt quite curious, and so
he used his Shadowless evasion skill to move closer to them. When he
reached a distance of two million kilometers, he was able to see them
quite clearly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The beasts were all
scattered in a circular fashion around a golden pearl that was slowly
spinning in place. The twenty-three carapace beasts were all
swallowing in the energy being emanated by that golden pearl. The
beasts were dumb, but they knew that absorbing the energy being given
off by this pearl would help them grow stronger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that…” Ning
frowned, then stared in astonishment. “Deluxe hellgold? That’s
deluxe hellgold! Supposedly, it can be used to serve as the energy
core for a golem of the fourth step. D-Damn my luck is good. I
actually ran into a pearl of deluxe hellgold!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Golems with the power
of Daolords of the Fourth step were incredibly few in number,
primarily because the materials needed to build cores for them were
difficult to forge, with all the materials being incredibly rare.
Deluxe hellgold was one of the things that could be used to forge
such a core. In other words… if you had a pearl of deluxe hellgold,
you would have the majority of the ingredients needed to construct a
golem-Daolord of the Fourth Step!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were also a
number of other materials that could be used to build an energy core,
but all of them were just as incredibly rare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When deluxe hellgold
was used to forge magic treasures, the magic treasure in question
could change freely. It could even switch from being a suit of armor
to a sharp sword, and it would have the power of a top-grade Eternal
treasure in any form. But of course, using such a precious material
to forge a magic treasure was a very wasteful act. Generally
speaking, people would save it for creating golems! The golem itself
would be as tough as a top-grade Eternal treasure, one which could
change and transform at will. It would be the perfect meat shield,
and Eternal Emperors would use them to keep themselves alive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once I get enough
materials, I’ll invite a true grandmaster artificer to work on one
for me,” Ning mused. “Many organizations have permanent ‘buy
orders’ for deluxe hellgold, with the price set at thirty to forty
million cubes of chaos nectar.” There were many major powers who
would go out of their way to buy this material, but…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Well. The sellers
weren’t fools either. Everyone knew how rare this material was.
Generally speaking, sellers would only be willing to trade it for
similarly rare treasures. Everyone had chaos nectar; who cared about
that? Not everyone, however, would necessarily have high-quality
treasures. Some unique ones simply couldn’t be found anywhere else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ning was to acquire
this deluxe hellgold, he’d be able to trade it for some treasures
which were truly useful towards him. These were treasures that people
generally wouldn’t be willing to exchange for chaos nectar, not
unless Ning was willing to pay two or three times more than the
market price.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I still haven’t
discovered the source of the resonance with my azureflower seal, but
I found a pearl of deluxe hellgold.” Ning was rather excited. “The
only problem is that it is surrounded by those twenty-three beasts.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 24 – Rooted Down
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning stared at the
twenty-three beasts off in the distance, his eyes narrowing slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Ning didn’t
hesitate at all. He immediately began to quietly approach those
beasts. Any major power would’ve made the same decision as he was
right now, because only a fool would give up the chance to acquire a
treasure like deluxe hellgold without even giving it a shot! It must
be understood that even the deceased Sword Hegemon had only left Ning
with fifty million cubes of chaos nectar, which wasn’t that much
more than the deluxe hellgold was worth!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This pearl of deluxe
hellgold was far more valuable than even the Eternal blood had been!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning used the
Shadowless evasion skill as he continued to stealthily advance. One
million kilometers. Five hundred thousand kilometers. Three hundred
thousand kilometers…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The physically largest
member of the carapace beasts that were absorbing energy from the
hellgold suddenly turned its head to stare in Ning’s direction, a
look of rage appearing within its deep eyes. Moments later, it let
out a furious roar. “RAAAAWR!” Its roar was ear-piercing and rent
the skies, causing countless streaks of heaven-destroying energy to
sweep straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Looks like I’ve
been discovered. Attack!” Ning’s speed increased dramatically as
he sped up to move at ten times the speed of light, and streaks of
dark-gold lightning and icy-white water erupted from his body. An
awesome vortex-world of water and lightning instantly appeared in
front of him, encompassing all of the strange beasts within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It sounded like stones
cracking apart. Explosions appeared on the bodies of eleven of the
smaller beasts as the carapace-like bodies burst open. Moments later,
they disappeared as their bodies were transformed into dust. Nearly
half of the twenty-three beasts had died from Ning’s first strike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill the invader!”
The largest beast let out a frenzied howl as the other carapace
beasts all charged furiously towards Ning as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang! Clang!
Ning immediately activated [Three Heads, Six Arms]. He wielded his
six Northbow swords in his hands as he blocked multiple strikes from
the swarming beasts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While blocking their
attacks, Ning was able to sense several streams of strange,
penetrating power be transmitted into his body. The power dug through
the Hegemon armor and invaded deeper into his body, making him feel
rather numb.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a strange
attack. Even with the Hegemon armor protecting me, I still feel a bit
numb. If I was an ordinary Daolord of the Fourth Step, I probably
would actually end up dying here.” Ning relaxed slightly. Different
beasts which lived in different environments would have different
attacks. Some were born with terrifying illusory powers, while others
were born with tremendous skill in formations. Still others were able
to move so fast, they could attack at the speed of a hundred times
the speed of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ning encountered a
beast whose powers perfectly countered his, he would be in serious
trouble. However, although the carapace beasts before him had very
strange attacks, Ning feared creatures like them the least. He had a
suit of Hegemon armor and a body equivalent to a low-grade Eternal
weapon; to harm him through direct attacks was incredibly difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Ning’s
sword-arts were arcane and profound, far above the level of these
carapace beasts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Sword-light
flashed, piercing through the head of one of the carapace beasts.
Moments later, its head exploded as the internal organs inside of it
were reduced to dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Slash! Slash!
Ning’s sword was incredibly sharp, and the Blood Drop stance of his
Omega Sword Dao contained tremendous penetrative power. The carapace
beasts were able to endure Ning’s lightning-water vortex-world, but
they weren’t able to withstand Ning’s sword! Soon, just three of
the beasts were left in the air. These were the three largest beasts,
and they had the toughest carapaces as well, so tough that not even
Ning’s sword was able to pierce through them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grrrr.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Invader.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Detestable invader.”
The three strongest carapace beasts were completely enraged by the
deaths of their fellows. They attacked even more ferociously than
before, and each time Ning clashed against them he could sense that
penetrative power seep into his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly put away
five of his swords, leaving just one behind. His six hands all
gripped that single sword as he raised it high into the air, then
delivered a ferocious chop with it. The speed of this blow seemed
both as slow as a falling leaf and as fast as a flash of lightning.
An endless amount of power quickly became to accumulate, making it
seem like a volcano that was about to explode.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Ning’s sword
seemed to strike out in a head-on blow, but it actually fluttered out
in an unpredictable arc that skirted past the claws of the carapace
beasts, then smashed one of them on its head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was taking
advantage of the fact hat these beasts had low levels of
comprehension and technique. If he was fighting against Daolords of
the Fourth Step like Patriarch Clearwind, the latter would be able to
block even a maximum-speed attack from Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A low, rumbling
explosion rang out and the carapace beast’s body trembled. Although
its internal organs were very tough, in the end they couldn’t
compare to those of a cultivator who had trained in a protective
divine ability. For cultivators, the strength and endurance of every
part of their body was identical. As for these carapace beasts, they
had incredibly tough shells but somewhat more fragile internal
organs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Under Ning’s most
powerful sword-strike, the creature’s organs were reduced to
smithereens, and it died on the spot. Its body turned soft as it fell
backwards, then simply hovered there in the air, its body twitching
every so often as blood flowed out of its nostrils.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Next.” It was as
though Ning was riding on a sharp sword. With a swoosh, he moved at
ten times the speed of light and appeared next to another one of the
carapace beasts, and the beast bellowed in rage and fear as he
approached.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Yet another
explosion rang out. The beast had tried to fight back, but so what?
It was still struck on the head, and it too fell backwards as all
signs of life disappeared from its corpse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And that leaves
you.” Ning turned his gaze towards the largest carapace beast, the
one who had been the first to discover Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Invader, you shall
die for invading our racial lands.” The carapace beast let out a
low growl. Its armored carapace was clearly thicker than those of the
others, and it was noticeably stronger as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Ning struck out
with a furious chop, his six arms clenched around that single sword
as he once more delivered a hammering blow to the skull of the beast.
An explosion rang out, and even the space around them began to
splinter. The carapace beast was knocked backwards by the force of
the stunning blow, but it then raised its head calmly to give Ning a
murderous glare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning’s
face tightened. For it to possess unearthly defenses was one thing,
but how was it that even a head-on kinetic strike was unable to kill
it?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The carapace
beast once more charged forwards, its tail sweeping straight towards
Ning. As for Ning, he once more wielded all six Northbow swords as he
moved at his absolute maximum speed while using his lightning-water
vortex-world to constrain his foe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Clang! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ear-piercing screeches,
low growls, light pants. All sorts of sounds erupted as the space
around them was repeatedly torn apart and regenerated as Ning engaged
the largest carapace beast in a furious battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Two streaks of
sword-light shot out almost like a pair of flexible ropes, quickly
wrapping themselves around that carapace beast with multiple layers
of ‘shackles’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No! NO!” The
carapace beast had been completely bound. It immediately struggled to
break free, only to no avail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even I would laugh
at myself if you were able to break free from this.” Ning revealed
a smile. “It seems using ‘softer’ methods is more appropriate
for dealing with crazed beasts like this.” Ning had indeed used a
pair of Northbow swords to tie up this beast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Northbow swords had
been forged for Ning by Emperor Gonflame himself, and they were
lifeblood weapons that were well-suited towards all aspects of the
Dao of the Sword. They could be ferocious, could be insidious, could
be unpredictable… and they could be both ‘hard’ and ‘soft’
in their fighting styles. They could be ‘hard’ in striking like a
heavy sword, or they could be ‘soft’ in striking like a whip.
This was the nature of the Northbow swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get in here.” Ning
produced a gourd, then unplugged the stopper. Whoosh! Instantly, the
roaring and struggling carapace beast was drawn flying into the
gourd. Moments later, two steraks of sword-light flew out from the
gourd and into the scabbard on Ning’s back. Ning then waved his
hand again as he collected the corpses of the other carapace beasts
as well. Clearly, their shells could be used as manufacturing
components.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s finally
done.” Ning let out asigh of relief. It might’ve looked like a
quick victory, but Ning had already used all the tools he had
available to win this fight. “The deluxe hellgold.” Ning turned
his gaze towards that pearl of deluxe hellgold. This was what he
really wanted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stepped forward,
reaching out with his right hand and clasping that pearl, then gave
it a tug.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clack clack clack!
Countless strands of golden energy in the area around it began to
tremble. It was as though invisible ropes were connected to the
deluxe hellgold, preventing its removal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
Ning stared, then gave it another tug. Once again, the deluxe
hellgold seemed to be rooted down and immovable. The golden mist for
ten million kilometers around him once more began to shudder. Only
when Ning stopped tugging did the golden mist go back to normal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems the golden
mist is connected to the deluxe hellgold.” Now that Ning understood
the connection, he tugged at it one final time with all his force.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! A massive
explosion could be heard as the pearl of deluxe hellgold was torn
away and entered Ning’s grasp. Ning immediately stored it away into
his estate-world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The endless amounts of
golden mist instantly began to roil about as they furiously flooded
towards a certain direction, becoming sparser and sparser until it
completely disappeared. Soon, the area around Ning became completely
pristine, with not a hint of golden mist remaining.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at his
surroundings in amazement. The golden mist had vanished up to a
distance of ten billion kilometers around him. Only outside the ten
billion kilometer range could more of the golden mist be seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately turned
to look towards the direction of the resonance with the azureflower
seal. Tens of billions of kilometers away, within that golden mist,
Ning was able to vaguely make out an enormous silhouette of something
that looked like an estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An estate?” Ning’s
eyes lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The surrounding area
for ten billion kilometers was now completely clear of golden mist.
Quite a few carapaced creatures stared at their surroundings in
astonishment. Just a few seconds ago, they had been surrounded by
golden mist. Why had it all completely vanished? Soon, their gazes
turned towards the distant white-robed youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“GRWAAAR!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An invader!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were thousands of
those carapace beasts within this region of ten billion kilometers,
and they all glared at Ning as they let out furious roars and charged
straight towards him.
</P>

Chapter 25 – Azureflower Estate
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was badly
shocked. There were actually thousands of carapace beasts within ten
billion kilometers of him? And several dozen were comparable in size
to the leader he had fought a short while ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“KILL!” One
particular carapace beast whose entire body was enormous and
pitch-black let out a furious roar, its head upraised and its glaring
eyes filled with murder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! The
roars generated shockwaves that were visible to the naked eye that
smashed through everything before them, reducing everything a hundred
million meters ahead of the creature to be reduced into dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning looked at the
pitch-black carapace beast, a sense of tremendous danger arose within
his heart. The sense of danger was far stronger than the feeling
Patriarch Clearwind had given him a short while ago. He realized that
if he actually engaged this creature in combat, he would probably
lose his life here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to leave right
away.” Ning immediately used the Shadowless evasion skill and
disappeared without a trace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thousands of
carapace beasts were all stunned. Due to the strange force permeating
this area, even the prime essences of the universe were held at bay
here, and Ning was unable to use his godsense to scan the place at
all. This meant that the carapace beasts were similarly unable to
scan Ning. Even the beast closest to Ning’s location was tens of
millions of kilometers away from him; there was simply no way to lock
onto Ning’s precise location from such a great distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Ning continued
to stealthily flee at ten times the speed of light using the
Shadowless evasion skill. He secretly celebrated, “Thank goodness
there’s no way to scan this empty area. Otherwise, there’s no way
I would’ve been able to escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“GWRAAAAR!” After
being unable to locate Ning, the pitch-black carapace beast lifted
its head and let out a furious howl that completely shattered space
in the area around it. Even carapace beasts which were located close
to it all retreated from it in fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning began to use his
evasion skill to flee towards the direction where the azureflower
resonance was emanating from. Whoosh! He once more flew into a region
of golden mist. Through it, he could vaguely make out the silhouette
of that towering estate up ahead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that an estate?”
Ning continued to fly forwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sometimes, things look
deceptively close. He was clearly able to make out that estate from
far away, but he spent ten hours flying towards it. During that
period of time, he encountered two more pearls of deluxe hellgold.
Alas, each of those two pearls had over ten thousand carapace beasts
surrounding it, as well as a pitch-black carapace beast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just staring at the
thousands of carapace beasts surrounding the pearl of deluxe
hellgold, Ning felt a sense of tremendous danger. He could sense that
as soon as he attacked, he would be almost instantly swarmed and
killed by the carapace beasts!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ten thousand-plus
carapace beasts had divine runes glowing above their shells. The
runes were humming in unison, and the power emanating them caused
even Ning’s heart to quail. Clearly, these beast had a way to join
together into a formation. A joint attack from more than ten thousand
carapace beasts would probably surpass even one of the most powerful
of Daolords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, Ning had
been able to slay those twenty-three carapace beasts because there
simply weren’t enough of them around; they weren’t able to join
together into a formation that would threaten him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems that my
decision to take away one of those pearls of deluxe hellgold has put
the other carapace beasts on high alert,” Ning mused. “Still…
to be able to acquire one pearl is already quite lucky.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning became more
cautious as well. “What in the world is this place? Even the energy
of the prime essences of the universe is forced to avoid this empty
region, and the golden mist region holds treasures like deluxe
hellgold within it. I’ve found three pearls, but there has to be
far more than that.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And those carapace
beasts! The strongest ones are definitely on par with Daolords of the
Fourth Step. As for the ones with the pitch-black shells, they can
crush the vast majority of Daolords. If all of them gather together,
I suspect that even Eternal Emperors would find it hard to gain
victory against them.” Ning was feeling rather nervous. He hadn’t
even entered the estate yet, but the outside perimeter was already
filled with terrors. What, then, would the estate itself hold?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughly ten hours after
acquiring the deluxe hellgold, Ning finally reached the towering
estate. The estate itself was emanating an endless aura of golden
mist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s this?”
Ning stared at the utterly enormous estate in front of him, and its
walls were like mountain ranges. The powerful ripples emanating from
the walls ensured that Ning didn’t even think about trying to scale
over them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The main gates are
over there.” Ning immediately flew towards the gates of the estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
Ning reached the main gates. Directly above the main gates there was
an image of an azure flower that was slowly swiveling in midair. It
radiated a sacred, natural aura which seemed to whisper that even if
the universe itself changed or if time itself ended, this flower
would remain here forever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What in the…”
Ning raised his head to stare at the image of an azure flower. He
trembled, a look of shock in his eyes. That azure flower? Only after
he had managed to combined all of the Nine Chaos Seals had he been
able to manifest the azureflower seal, then gain an azureflower
region in his body. The azureflower seal looked absolutely identical
to the azure flower image hovering above the gates to his estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though
there has to be some sort of connection between my Nine Chaos Seals
and this estate,” Ning mused to himself. “I wonder how Daoist
Three Purities ran into those seals in the past. Given the level of
power he was at, there’s no way he could’ve travelled from the
Three Realms to this place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This place was quite a
distance away from the Three Realms, and back then Ning obviously
hadn’t blazed a trail out from the Three Realms. In addition, even
weaker Daolords would perish within the empty region and within the
golden mist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The gates…?”
Ning turned his gaze from the azure flower to the estate gates. The
towering estate gates were covered with carvings that looked like
tree roots. The carvings looked chaotic and complicated, but when
Ning’s gaze towards them he could sense an invisible power surge
out from the diagrams and sweep around Ning’s heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to stand
in front of the estate gates, but he closed his eyes. The deepest
pains within his heart were once more dragged out from where he had
hidden them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wouldn’t dare
beg that you send my senior apprentice-sister back to my side,
Godking; all I hope is that she can live a simple, peaceful life. If
you can do this, I will be endlessly grateful.” Ning fell to his
knees before the Godking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are the one who
personally consigned her to endless torment within the Infinity
Hells! It was you! You personally!!!” The Godking’s furious roars
reverberated with Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Didn’t you
say…that she’s already dead, and that you killed her? Haha…then,
let me let her truly die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…” The
towering figure of the Rahu-Ning raised its head towards the heaven,
his wild laughter echoing through the Three Realms’ battlefield.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was my fault. I
was the one who consigned you to the Infinity Hells. I was the one
who caused your soul to be destroyed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most agonizing,
wrenching memories in his heart were all pulled out and magnified,
and the sense of self-recrimination which Ning felt was amplified ten
thousand times over. Ning was completely absorbed in his pain and
self-blame. He stood there in front of the estate, his entire body
trembling. In this moment, his Hegemon armor, his lifeblood weapons,
and his protective Dao-seals weren’t able to help him out at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both his soul and his
truesoul were trembling. The same wasn’t true for just him; even
the black-robed Primaltwin Ning was shaking back in the Three Realms.
As for his avatar in Vastheaven Palace, it was also in the same dazed
state. It was as though they had fallen into an endless abyss and
were sinking deeper and deeper into it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go ahead and die.
Once you die, you’ll be together with her once more.” This was
what that invisible surge of energy was whispering to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s soul and
truesoul were shaking so hard, they were about to splinter apart. If
they really did shatter, his true body, his Primaltwin, and his
avatar would all fall simultaneously. Not even his Lifeblood Dao-seal
would be able to save him. This was a technique available to the
truly major powers who stood at the apex of all life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already made
my choice. Even if I had to choose again, I would choose the same
thing. That was a war! A war which would determine the destiny of all
the living creatures of the Three Realms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The war has
concluded. Both my father and my mother have returned. I, Ji Ning,
shall use all the years of my life and all the power that is
available to me to find my wife and bring her back. For her sake, I
would willingly sacrifice all that I have.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing and no one
will bar my path!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still standing in front
of the gates, Ning opened his eyes. His eyes shone with a
terrifyingly sharp light that reflected the innermost depths of his
heart. Nothing and no one would ever be able to stop him on his path,
and he would continue on it until death itself came for him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
Ning’s heartforce was surging and growing increasingly powerful as
it intersected more and more with his sea of consciousness. Once he
experienced a few more things within this universe and accumulated a
bit more power, he would be able to break through to the sixth stage
of heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, mighty
creator of the Azureflower Estate.” The white-robed Ning stared at
the gates in front of him. “Thank you for helping me to once more
reaffirm my own Dao-heart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is my Dao, and
this is my heart. I will continue on this path until the day I die.”
Ning walked forwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The strange tree-root
carvings atop the gates seemed to be able to sense Ning’s
terrifyingly strong Dao-heart, a Dao-heart which no one could alter
or shake. Only someone with a heart like this would have a chance of
truly reaching the apex, would have a chance of standing above all
other living beings. The most terrifying of major powers would also
need terrifyingly strong Dao-hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gates to the estate
automatically swung open with a rumbling sound. The Azureflower
Estate, which had lain silent for countless years, had been opened
once more.
</P>

Chapter 26 – Emperors?
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gates swung open.
Ji Ning stood outside the gates, staring inwards. He was able to see
that the insides of the towering estate stretched out at least ten
billion kilometers, and an awesome, terrifying aura instantly swept
out towards him from inside. The aura of power circulated in
accordance with a formation and gathered at three particular spots,
where three trees were located.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is this…?”
Ning’s face turned pale when he looked at them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three trees. The first
tree was in a corner, and its trunk was twisted like a coiling
dragon. The entire tree, including its leaves, glowed with a faint
blue light. It had three fruits hanging off its branches, and the
fruits were snow-white in color and fist-sized. The fruits were
surrounded by surges of flowing blue energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second tree was the
largest tree and had the most foliage. It was like an enormous canopy
of flowers that covered an area of tens of millions of kilometers,
and as soon as Ning saw it Ning realized that this tree only had two
fruits on it. Both fruits were completely blood-red, and they looked
as though blood would flow out of them if anyone touched them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third tree was the
smallest one, so small it could simply be described as a sapling. It
was roughly just three meters tall, and it looked semi-translucent
and as cold as ice. Every single leaf was like a work of art, while
the sparse branches held nine fruit that glowed with light. Each
fruit was like a miniature sun that glowed dazzlingly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that one of the
eight sacred bloodfruits, the ‘skyjewel bloodfruit’?” When
Ning’s gaze fell upon the two blood-red fruits located on the
second (and largest) tree, he couldn’t help but feel stunned. This
was insane. Insane!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eight sacred
bloodfruits… most likely, people like Daolord Solesky had never
even heard of them. Ning only knew of them because of the [Seven
Leafpill Chapters]. The [Seven Leafpill Chapters] had contained a
great deal of information regarding rare ingredients, including the
eight sacred bloodfruits. Every single one of the eight was
incomparably rare, and a single sacred bloodfruit tree would drive
Eternal Emperors wild with lust and could incite warfare amongst
Hegemons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Skyjewel bloodfruit…
that means this is a sacred bloodfruit tree?” Ning stared at the
awesomely large tree before him, then turned to look at the other
two. The first tree was the one with a twisted trunk that looked like
a coiling dragon, while the other tree was the sapling. However, Ning
had the feeling that the aura of power emanating from these two trees
was every bit the equal of the central sacred bloodfruit tree.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I only recognize the
skyjewel bloodfruit.” Ning shook his head. “I don’t recognize
the other two at all.” The only reason he even recognized the
former was because of the [Seven Leafpill Chapters]. Otehrwise, he
wouldn’t recognize any of them at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder… can I
take them away?” Ning could feel his heartrate speed up. “Won’t
know until I find out.” Ning walked over, quickly arriving at the
large tree at the very center. Ning reached out with his right hand,
which expanded to become so large that it blotted out the skies
itself. His hand was now a million kilometers in size, and it reached
out and grabbed the tree by the main trunk, seeking to uproot it!
Ning’s movements were very slow; if any danger appeared, he would
have ample time to react.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! Suddenly, a surge
of power emanated from the surface of that tree, knocking Ning’s
hand aside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seems I can’t take
it with me after all.” Ning actually laughed. This was as he had
predicted; these three trees had clearly been planted here by the
major power who had set up the Azureflower Estate, after all. How
could that major power have allowed others to so easily rob him of
his trees?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder if I can
harvest the fruit or not.” Ning then reached out to one of the
fruits. He was able to easily harvest a completely blood-red fruit.
Pop! The fruit fell into his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So one sacred
bloodfruit has fallen into my grasp, just like that?” Ning was
rather amazed. He had just wanted to give it a try; he hadn’t
expected to actually succeed. “What about another one?” Ning
reached out to try and harvest the other bloodfruit, but this time a
wave of power swept out from the sacred bloodfruit tree’s trunk,
preventing Ning from succeeding. “So stingy! Still, one is enough.
Thank you, senior.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sacred bloodfruit
tree was currently sending surges of power to the location where the
first bloodfruit had been harvested, and the power was slowly taking
the form of a bloody ball of mist. Clearly, the tree was beginning to
give birth to a new fruit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A single sacred
bloodfruit tree could at most give birth to two fruits at once. Now
that Ning had harvested one, it could give birth to a second one, but
of course that would take quite some time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The value of a single
fruit was naturally much lower than that of the actual tree, which
would be capable of giving birth to sacred bloodfruit over and over.
Despite that, it was still a rare reassure worth over twenty million
cubes of chaos nectar. Treasure like this could be pined for but
never planned on!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What about the other
two trees?” Ning headed over to try his luck with harvesting once
again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Uprooting the trees?
Impossible. He couldn’t break as much as a single twig on the
trees. These three ancient, mysterious trees seemed to possess
sentience; they would only permit Ning to harvest a single fruit
each! After that, they wouldn’t even let Ning draw near them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These three
fruits…?” Ning waved his hand, causing three fruits to appear and
float in the air in front of him. The first was the completely
blood-red skyjewel bloodfruit, the second was a snow-white fruit that
was covered by swirls of blue energy, and the third was the fruit
that shone like a miniature sun. “The major power who built the
Azureflower Estate was quite generous. I won a fortune as soon as I
entered this place!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning put away the fruit
and continued his explorations. Soon, he saw an utterly beautiful
arch bridge, below which was a wide stream of flowing water. The
water was clear and pristine, but radiated an aura of iciness which
caused a layer of white steam to appear above it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning walked onto the
arch bridge. He immediately saw that on the other end, atop the
distant grasslands a pair of old men were seated facing each other, a
chessboard and some chess pieces before them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“T-there are other
cultivators here?!” Ning was stunned. However, the two old men were
dressed in exactly the same clothes; both wore grayish-black robes,
and they both turned their heads to stare towards Ning’s bridge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seniors.” Ning
immediately bowed towards them. The two elders had restrained their
auras, making it so that Ning couldn’t secretly investigate them,
but when Ning looked at them he fel a sense of incredible danger from
them. He knew that if they were to fight, he would probably be at
danger of losing his life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An outsider has
actually arrived in the estate.” One of the two gray-robed elders
chuckled as he looked at ing through his two silver eyes. “It’s
been quite some time since I’ve seen an outsider.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” As for the
other gray-robed elder, he had a pair of blood-red eyes. Ning was
looking right at him as he stared at Ning, and when their gazes
intersected Ning suddenly felt as though he was seeing an endless sea
of murder and blood! Ning’s heart shivered when he saw that
unfathomable amount of hatred and slaughter. Thankfully, Ning’s
heartforce was quite strong and just a step away from sixth-stage
heartforce, and so he was able to safeguard his own heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A mere Daolord of
the Second Step?” The blood-eyed elder laughed coldly as he swept
out with his sleeves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! His sleeves
suddenly stretched out through the skies, seeming able to sweep away
all things and moving so fast that Ning was unable to dodge it before
it reached him and struck at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?!”
Ning had no time to spare. His body immediately blurred as he
manifested [Three Heads, Six Arms], and all six of his arms gripped a
Northbow sword. His sword-light flashed, then transformed into an
enormous black hole. The sky-blotting sleeve lashed down upon Ning’s
sword-light, and Ning’s sword-light began to crack as the black
hole tottered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense a
terrifyingly strong concussive force be applied to his entire body, a
force so strong as to completely stun Ning. He flew backwards
uncontrollably, flying millions of kilometers past the arch bridge
before slamming into the ground with a loud booming sound. He
actually rolled over a few times on the ground before slowly
beginning to regain consciousness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“W-what…” When
Ning came to his senses, he was terrified by the implications of what
had just happened. “Even though I had the Hegemon armor protecting
me, I was knocked completely senseless for a few moments. Thankfully,
my divine body is comparable to a low-grade Eternal weapon.
Otherwise, I probably would’ve died even through the Hegemon
armor.” Ning couldn’t help but celebrate his survival. The
Hegemon armor had once again weakened the attack to one thousandth of
its full power, but that old man had been far more powerful than
Patriarch Clearwind when the latter had used his forbidden secret
arts!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s guess was that
this had been the attack of someone on the Eternal Emperor level.
Ordinary Daolords of the Fourth Step would probably be instantly
slain by it! Ning himself was only able to survive because of both
the Hegemon armor and the fact that his body was incredibly tough as
well. Despite that, he had been instantly stunned and dazed by that
attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Moments ago,
the blood-eyed elder had been smirking. Now, however, he revealed a
look of astonishment. “He didn’t die? How?! How could a Daolord
of the Second Step withstand my killing strike?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kid, get over here.
Let me get a good look at you,” the blood-eyed elder spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stay away!” The
silver-eyed old man immediately said. “No matter what, don’t step
onto that bridge. The area beyond the bridge is forbidden to me and
this old man. If you move past it, he’ll definitely attack you
again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother!” The
blood-eyed elder said angrily, “Whose side are you on?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second brother, he’s
just a young Daolord of the Second Step. He can help relieve our
boredom for atime. Why must you move to kill him?” The silver-eyed
elder was irritated as well. “We are Eternal Emperors, after all.
For you to ignore your own status and try to kill a Daolord of the
Second Step… have you not noticed that you are going crazy?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Emperors? We aren’t
even cultivators any longer. Emperors? Ahaha…” The blood-eyed
elder laughed wildly. He laughed like a madman, and his laughter was
filled with endless hatred and pain.
</P>

Chapter 27 – Withdrawal
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-eyed elder’s
body trembled when he heard this, and a hint of sorrow appeared in
his eyes as he let out a sigh. “We still have a chance at gaining
our freedom. In addition, the person who caused us to fall to such a
state was the master of this estate. It had nothing to do with this
young Daolord of the Second Step! Why must you get him involved?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The master of the
estate? Yes, he’s the one who caused all this,” the blood-eyed
elder howled, “And I know that he’s the one we should hate, but
what can I possibly do to him? We stand no chance against him
whatsoever. He captured us as easily as capturing ants, then
transformed us into our current state. I want to take revenge, but I
have no chance of succeeding whatsoever. He said that he would give
us our freedom once he returned, but how long has it been?! He left
more than thirty million chaos cycles ago. He’ll probably never be
back!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the other side of
the arch bridge, Ji Ning was speechless when he heard the
conversation between the two. Thirty million chaos cycles? That was
an incredibly long period of time! Even Samsara Daolords were only
able to live for 108,000 chaos cycles. Eternal Emperors truly were
special, capable of living nearly forever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And, based on the
conversation between those two, it seemed as though they had been
effortlessly captured by the master of the estate. As they had put
it, he had been able to capture them as easily as capturing ants.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As expected of
someone who created the Nine Chaos Seals,” Ning mused. “He really
is unfathomably powerful and inscrutable. If he was able to so easily
capture Eternal Emperors, he probably is at least at the Hegemon
level of power. Is it possible that there’s an even higher level
which he was at?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill. KILL. KILL!!!
I’ve fallen so hard, why should I show pity for any others? To be
able to discover this estate is indeed a tremendous blessing, but I’m
going to make sure all of those lucky Daolords end up as dead
Daolord!” The blood-eyed elder’s eyes were blazing with that
bloody light as his murderous aura surged towards the skies. “That
kid had better never step foot on the bridge again. Otherwise, I’ll
definitely slaughter him!” His gaze was focused on the distant
Ning, and he didn’t disguise his murderous intent at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You… ugh. What’s
the point?” The silver-eyed elder sighed when he saw this. As for
the blood-eyed elder, he simply snorted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave, kid. Given
that you were able to stay alive when my second brother delivered a
killing blow towards you, you probably are one of the most freakishly
talented Daolords of your generation.” The silver-eyed elder
instructed, “My second brother wishes to stop you, but given your
talent you might be able to defeat him once you become a Daolord of
the Fourth Step. However, this estate is filled with layers of danger
and is much more dangerous than my second brother. I strongly
recommend for you to return only after you become an Eternal Emperor
yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the two
from the other side of the bridge. Both his azureflower seal and his
azureflower region were shaking from the powerful resonance. Clearly,
the thing which was calling to them was emanating from deep within
this estate. But given that two Eternal Emperors were guarding the
bridge, and that one was filled with the desire to kill him…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The difference in
power is too great. If I tried to force my way through, he’d
probably bind and capture me.” Although Ning deeply esired to enter
the depths of the Azureflower Estate, the difference in power was
quite apparent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go, go,” the
silver-eyed elder said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kid, even the
outside perimeter held three sacred trees. There are even more
treasures inside the estate. Don’t you want to go in? Ahaha, I’m
sure you must.” The blood-eyed elder stared at Ning intently. Ning
hesitated for a moment, then turned and left. He soon departed from
the main gates of the Azureflower Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blood-eyed elder
and the silver-eyed elder both watched as Ning disappeared off into
the distance. “The kid is pretty decisive,” the silver-eyed elder
praised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And what good is
that? The master of this estate left behind many fortunes, but he
also left behind many dangers. The two of us were nothing more than
ants to him, and it was so easy for him to capture us and put us here
to serve as his guards. Some of the other Eternal Emperors he caught
were much more powerful than us, but all of them were assigned to the
deeper parts of the estate.” The blood-eyed elder smirked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-eyed elder
nodded. When he thought about what had happened all those chaos
cycles ago, he couldn’t help but once again shiver in fear. They
had been the two weakest Eternal Emperors which the master of the
estate had caught.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But that kid was
quite talented as well. If he can become an Eternal Emperor, he might
just be able to defeat all of the servants which the master of the
estate left behind,” the silver-eyed elder said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Keep dreaming. Do
you know how hard it will be for a freak like him to gain eternity?
Hell, if he succeeds he’ll probably become a Hegemon!” The
blood-eyed elder shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the Azureflower
Estate. Ning emerged from the estate feeling both excited as well as
impatient. He really wanted to delve deeper into the estate and find
the true source of that resonance with his azureflower seal! Alas, he
couldn’t even handle the two Eternal Emperors at the outside
perimeter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wish to save Yu
Wei, but that path will be a difficult one. This estate, however,
might just prove to be one of the major fortunes which I will need to
succeed.” Ning turned to stare at the azure flower image once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This place was indeed a
source of tremendous fortune. Ning’s subconscious was whispering to
him that if he succeeded in traversing this place, he would undergo a
truly earth-shaking transformation. This place might enable him to
ask the most ancient of powers to come and bring Yu Wei back to life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can’t be
impatient. Time spent sharpening the axe will be earned back with
interest when you go out to chop the wood. I’ll return once I
become a Daolord of the Fourth Step,” Ning mused. He didn’t have
any confidence in being able to become an Eternal Emperor! This
didn’t have anything to do with a weak Dao-heart; rather, it was
because far, far too many freakishly talented Daolords had failed in
this final step. Ning knew exactly how difficult it was, and it would
be even harder for him because his path was that of the Omega Sword
Dao. Most likely, it would be far more difficult than the paths which
Bertulu, Solewind, and the others were going to walk. For peerless
geniuses like them, becoming an Eternal Emperor was incredibly
difficult. If they succeeded, they would become Hegemons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was in control of
an Omega Sword Dao. How difficult would his path to eternity be?
Still, he was fairly certain in his ability to become a Daolord of
the Fourth Step. By then, challenging the Azureflower Estate would be
much simpler.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At least…” Ning
stared at the azure flower image floating in front of the gates.
“Here, at least, I can see a hope of saving her. The next time I
come here, I’ll definitely make it into the depths of the estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning left, but when he
left his heart was filled with hope.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The void of the
primordial chaos. A flying vessel was advancing through the chaos
once more, with Ning seated in the lotus position atop the deck of
the vessel, attuning himself to the surrounding area while recording
down the various danger zones on the star map in his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji was seated
next to Ning and was pouring his wine for him, a lovely smile on her
face. Although trailblazing was somewhat dangerous, it really wasn’t
that concerning for someone on Ning’s level. That trip to the
Azureflower Estate had been far more dangerous! When Ning had
returned from the estate, Su Youji had asked about what he had found.
Ning’s response was this: “I nearly died in there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji and the others
still felt twinges of fear when they thought back to that answer. Now
that Ning was back by her side once more, she felt at peace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, that place
was far too dangerous. In the future, you should avoid places that
are excessively dangerous,” Su Youji said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. I
probably won’t go back for a long time,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You shouldn’t go
at all,” Su Youji said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Next time, I’ll be
confident in my abilities to survive. For now, I’m not good
enough.” Ning shook his head. In the Endless Territories, he was
definitely one of the major powers now; he had even been able to
survive a killing blow from an Eternal Emperor, after all! If word of
this spread, his reputation would definitely increase dramatically.
However, Ning’s goals were much higher than merely this. Not even
the most freakishly strong of Daolords would be able to revive an
extinguished truesoul, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on, and
more than thirty years passed in the blink of an eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…” Still
seated in the lotus position within the flying vessel, Ning suddenly
put down his star map and rose to his feet with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it, master?”
Pillsaint and Su Youji were both confused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The trailblazing is
complete. We’ve arrived.” Ning smiled. “I’m familiar with
this region. We have now blazed a trail from the Badlands Territory
to my homeland.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With his Primaltwin
serving as his goal, Ning was able to spent three hundred years to
reach the Three Realms without getting lost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The primordial chaos
outside the Three Realms. Ji Ning’s chaos estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed Ji Ning
led the peerless beauty Su Youji and Daolord Pillsaint into his chaos
estate, where a black-robed Ning was awaiting them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“T-this…” Su
Youji and Pillsaint both had looks of astonishment on their faces.
Before coming, they had both sworn oaths never to divulge anything
regarding Ning’s homeland to anyone else. The trailblazing, the
region of empty space, the Three Realms… they were not permitted to
discuss anything they saw. However, they were still stunned by what
was before them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s wrong,
Pillsaint, Youji? Don’t you recognize me?” The black-robed Ning
laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Primaltwin?!” Su
Youji and Pillsaint couldn’t help but blurt out these two words.
There were very few Daolords who had Primaltwins.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ning
waved his hand, causing a painting to fly out and towards the
black-robed Ning. This painting contained an estate-world inside of
it, and it was filled with the countless secret arts, divine
abilities, cultivation techniques, and other techniques which Ning
had acquired from Vastheaven Palace. It also contained the various
treasures he had obtained from Daolord Blesswind and the other
enemies he had faced, along with chaos nectar, chaos jewels, and
more. There was at least ten million cubes worth of chaos nectar and
chaos jewels here! Ning estimated that this should be enough to
establish a solid foundation for the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is time for the
Three Realms to truly rise to prominence.” Ning nodded.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world of the Grand
Xia. Swallow Mountain. Brightheart Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Yichuan and Yuchi
Snow were being accompanied by their granddaughter, Ji Brightmoon.
They had started to journey through the Three Realms, with even Uncle
White travelling alongside them as well. As a result, Brightheart
Lake was now a bit quieter than it usually was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! The black-robed
Ji Ning suddenly descended from the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
Autumn Leaf immediately ran over when she sensed his presence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder sister Autumn
Leaf.” The black-robed Ning smiled merrily as he called out to her.
“Where are Little Qing and Xiaoyu?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of them went
out to have some fun as well. I have no idea where they went,”
Autumn Leaf said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of them have
gone out. Why don’t you join them, elder sister?” Ning continued,
“Don’t stay at Brightheart Island all the time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone has to stay
on the island. Who knows when you might end up paying a visit?”
Autumn Leaf smiled. “See? You ended up paying a visit today.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled. There
were some words that didn’t need to be said. Autumn Leaf had taken
care of him ever since he was small, and the two were even closer
than actual siblings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come with me, elder
sister.” As Ning spoke, he began to walk towards the inner depths
of Brightheart Island. Autumn Leaf followed from behind, and they
quickly arrived at one of the inner mountains on the island. Ning
stood there halfway up the mountain, then gestured with his hand.
Whoosh! A seemingly ordinary Immortal estate suddenly descended upon
the mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning stared
at the gates to the Immortal estate. Moments later, three words
suddenly appeared directly above the gates: Three Realms Archives.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s this?”
Autumn Leaf was a bit puzzled by what she was seeing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From this day forth,
this shall be the most important place in all the Three Realms,”
Ning said. “This place is filled with countless techniques, divine
abilities, and secret arts. All of them are quite formidable, and
those who are weak will find it difficult to understand them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come forth.” Ning
waved his hand. Instantly, a muscular golem wielding a shield
suddenly appeared. This was Moksha, the golem comparable to a Daolord
of the Third Step which Ning had captured when he was in the Sacred
Immortal Realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The golem
immediately called out with respect. After breaking through to become
a Daolord, Ji Ning had defeated and tamed even the four golems which
Emperor Mirrorsnow had bestowed unto him. This completely convinced
Moksha of Ji Ning’s power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your appearance will
scare everyone on my island. Change into the appearance of an
ordinary cultivator,” Ning ordered with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Moksha’s
body instantly blurred as he transformed into a bald, gray-robed man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “From
this day forth, you shall guard the Three Realms Archives! No one is
permitted to enter this place unless I have given them permission.
This woman here is my elder sister, Autumn Leaf. She is permitted to
enter the archives and study all of the techniques within it whenever
she wishes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, you
can’t just do whatever you want. This will be an important place
for all the Three Realms,” Autumn Leaf said hastily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am the creator of
the Three Realms Archives. So what if I decide to let you view
everything in it right now? Just don’t teach its contents to
others,” Ning said. “Right now, there is no specific system or
rules for studying in the Three Realms Archives. Later, I’ll chat
with my master and set down a few rules. When there are no rules,
there’s no such thing as rule-breaking. Later on, though, all of
you including Brightmoon and my parents will have to abide by the
rules.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand that
much.” Autumn Leaf nodded. Even Ning’s closest family members
would have to follow some basic rules. However, they would definitely
be given the most latitude, with virtually all of the techniques
available for them to study. The only true rule was that they
couldn’t teach these techniques to others without a good reason!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was how things
worked in any organization within the Endless Territories. Once your
secret techniques were taught to others, it was very possible that
unforeseeable and uncontrollable developments would occur.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“T-This place… this
is a sacred place for studying the Dao.” After Patriarch Subhuti
flipped through several of the techniques, he ended up being consumed
by them for several days before he regained his normal clarity of
mind. The first thing he did was let out an excited sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Vastheaven Palace
built up this collection over the course of countless years. Even in
the Endless Territories, a repository like this would be considered a
sacred place for cultivators.” Ning smiled. “There are enough
techniques here for someone to train all the way to the Samsara
Daolord level without pausing. The Three Realms is just a single
chaosworld, after all, and I suspect only a few will end up reaching
the World level. In the end, very few of us shall end up as Samsara
Daolords. I trust that those who do will venture into the Endless
Territories and seek out their own fortunes there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Subhuti’s
face was covered with joy. “The Three Realms’ future is
absolutely unimaginable. Haha! My disciple, you have established a
foundation for the Three Realms. I once thought that after Mother
Nuwa left, she would eventually return to us and help us. Who
would’ve thought that you got it done before she did?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said, “I wasn’t
able to find any trace of Mother Nuwa in the Endless Territories, and
the Badlands Territory and the surrounding territories haven’t seen
any powerful female cultivators similar to her appear. My guess is
that when she left the Three Realms through that vortex passageway,
she was suddenly trapped into a spatial breach that teleported her to
a foreign location.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mother Nuwa, despite
having no guidance and no good techniques, had been able to develop
her own technique and force her way into becoming a World Goddess!
She was definitely every bit as talented as Ji Ning. Once she reached
the greater world outside the Three Realms, just a few simple
pointers would result in her powers skyrocketing. Logically speaking,
she should’ve become a Samsara Daolord long ago. And yet, Ning had
found no trace of her whatsoever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti had a worried
look on his face as well. “Everything is up to destiny. Ugh. For
Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals, passage through the vortex tunnel
will result in almost certain death. Even World Gods will be trapped
within spatial tears if they aren’t lucky. We can’t just let our
cultivators be trapped here in the Three Realms forever, can we?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do not worry,
Master. I spent a few years and used my ability to sense my
Primaltwin’s location to blaze a trail from the Badlands Territory
to the Three Realms.” Ning smiled as he took out a star map.
“Please take a look, Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From the Badlands
Territory to the Three Realms?” Subhuti revealed a look of
surprised joy, hurriedly taking the map from Ning’s hands. He was
so excited by what he saw, even his white beard began to flutter as
he began to roar with laughter. “Disciple, with this route through
space the cultivators of our Three Realms shall be able to enter the
Endless Territories. Windfiend and I were worrying about this matter
just a short while ago. The two of us were planning to explore the
Endless Territories after we break through to the World level, but we
were worrying about that vortex.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, right.”
Subhuti immediately said, “This star map is extremely important.
Every single person who views it must swear a lifeblood oath to never
divulge the existence of the trail you have blazed to others.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I absolutely agree,”
Ning said. “It’s entirely possible that I might make powerful
enemies as I wander through the Endless Territories! Once the Three
Realms are revealed, they might suffer reprisals from certain crazed
enemies of mine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were some
Daolords who were borderline insane, especially the ones who had
failed their Daomerge. They would engage in slaughter on such a scale
that they might wipe out all of the living things in multiple
territories. This wasn’t unheard of! By comparision, wiping out
Ning’s homeland in order to take revenge on him was nothing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Subhuti
nodded solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Subhuti
discussed this matter, then set down the rules for allowing the Three
Realms to be able to continue to propagate stably in the future.
Subhuti and Windfiend both spent a hundred years reading through the
Three Realms Archives, and they benefited greatly from it. Finally,
they were going to break through to the World level! They could’ve
broken through long ago, but the techniques, divine abilities, and
secret arts inside the Three Realms Archives were simply too
alluring, which is why they delayed for a period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First had come Pangu,
Nuwa, and Ning. Now, both Subhuti and Windfiend took that next step
and reached the World level. Just a few decades after reaching the
World level, they decided to leave the Three Realms together via the
route through the primordial chaos which Ning had created to the
Badlands Territory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master. Windfiend.”
Many of the Immortals and Fiendgods of the Three Realms had come to
bid them farewell. As for the black-robed Ning, he said, “The
Endless Territories are filled with endless dangers. World-level
cultivators are not yet at a level where they can go wherever they
want. I recommend you stay in the territories around the Badlands
Territory for now and temper yourselves first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. I
heard that the Badlands Territory has nearly a hundred thousand
chaosworlds as well as many ruins left behind by Daolords. That’ll
be more than enough for us to roam through,” Subhuti laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One of us is a
master of spacetime, the other is a master of space. We two old farts
might not be particularly talented in other areas, but if we work
together we should be able to keep ourselves alive,” Windfiend
laughed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two were both very
relaxed. The reason why they had nearly fought to the death in the
Three Realms was primarily because Old Man Yuan and Lord Demonheart
had been causing trouble in secret. Windfiend had wanted to go out
exploring long ago, and Subhuti was also filled with this same
desire. Long ago, back when Ning had been very weak, the two had
already reached the apex of power; one was the number one spacetime
master of the Three Realms, the other was the fastest person in the
Three Realms. By now, they had reached even higher levels. If they
joined forces, there really were very few World-level cultivators
capable of killing them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have a safe
journey.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful,
Subhuti.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Immortals and
Fiendgods all bade them farewell, then watched as they began their
journey into the outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A flying vessel was
soaring through the primordial chaos, with Ning’s true body at the
helm. After blazing a path to the Three Realms and handing the
archives over to his Primaltwin, he had left and led Su Youji and
Pillsaint to the next part of their journey. By now, they had spent
over a thousand years on this trip to the nearby Sacred City of the
Dao Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. We should
arrive in a bit over two hundred years.” Ning sat on the deck of
his flying vessel, staring forwards into the endless void before
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Su Youji
suddenly appeared out of nowhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm? No longer
training?” Ning looked at her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can sense that I
am about to break through and become a Daolord of the Second Step.”
A hint of excitement was on Su Youji’s face. “Although I wasn’t
as impressive as you, I was still pretty fast, right?”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 29 – The Sacred City of Skywood
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning blinked, then
laughed. “Not bad! I’ll find a place to let you break through in
peace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Su Youji
nodded quite joyfully. As for Ning, he felt rather speechless. Oh,
Youji… you are breaking through to become a Daolord of the Second
Step, but your master is still just a Daolord of the First Step…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
the flying vessel reached a fairly nearby chaos planet, then
descended upon it. Ji Ning waved his hand, setting up a simple
restrictive formation around the planet. Ning was now on a completely
different level of power compared to the past; he would now be
extremely powerful even compared to other Daolords, and to encounter
a worthy opponent in this region of the primordial chaos was fairly
unlikely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! Youji is
about to make her breakthrough?” Pillsaint had a look of
astonishment on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded. “So you have to work hard as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pillsaint nodded
repeatedly. “I need to refine more pills in order to improve my Dao
of Alchemy, but to gain insights from repeated, actual alchemy
attempts will require quite some time. Still… since both you and
Youji have made breakthroughs already, I really do need to pick up
the pace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Samsara Daolords…
with each step we take, we walk the line between life and death. Do
not be rash or push too hard to make a breakthrough. Speed isn’t
the most important thing.” Ning said a few words, then fell silent.
Ugh. Judging from the situation, he would probably be slower than
both of his subordinates.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
causing an enormous boulder to fly off of a distant mountain of the
chaos planet. The boulder landed in front of Ning, who simply looked
at it. Crack! The boulder was sheared flat. Ning then sat down in the
lotus position atop the boulder, beginning to meditate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the past thousand
years, I’ve only been able to improve my Blood Drop sword-intent
slightly.” Ning chuckled self-deprecatingly. “It seems I really
am going to be slower than both Youji and Pillsaint.” He had to
improve in all five of his original Supreme Daos and then recombine
them once more into a new Omega Sword Dao; this was how his Omega Dao
would improve.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyelids slowly
swung shut, but streaks of sword-light could be seen flickering
through the cracks of his lidded eyes. Tiny spatial tears repeatedly
appeared and disappeared within afew meters of him as well. Clearly,
Ning was visualizing and training in sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long while later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! A wind arose in
the skies above the chaos planet, and an awesome vortex of chaos
energy began to form and be absorbed by Su Youji ni large quantities.
Clearly, her breakthrough had begun. Pillsaint watched intently, but
Ning simply considered to meditate in the lotus position, continuing
to visualize his sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This breakthrough took
more than three days before everything became calm once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Su Youji
put away her Immortal estate and walked over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, you really are
different now that you’ve reached the second step. You’ve
actually become even more beautiful!” The nearby Pillsaint whooped
in delight. He truly had the heart of a child, and becoming a Daolord
hadn’t changed him one bit. It was actually because of his pure,
guileless heart that he had been able to become a Daolord. The [Seven
Leafpill Chapters] had assisted him, but at the core was his own
Dao-heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji glanced at
Pillsaint, and the latter was instantly enraptured. “Pillsaint,
address me as ‘big sister’.” Su Youji continued to stare
sweetly at Pillsaint.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big sister… big
sis-” The spellbound Pillsaint suddenly came back to his senses,
then pointed at Su Youji and stammered, “H-Hey…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji said smugly,
“Pillsaint, it seems your Dao-heart isn’t strong enough yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh man. I am doomed.
I was enraptured almost instantly. I am going to be in so much
trouble in the future.” A miserable look was on Pillsaint’s face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It isn’t that
Pillsaint has a weak Dao-heart, it’s that he’s still just a
Daolord of the First Step.” Ning arose from his boulder, then
stepped down. “Pillsaint’s path is the Dao of Alchemy, which
means he will indeed be a bit weaker in combat. You, on the other
hand, have the legacy of Feixian the Exalted. It would be laughable
if you couldn’t enspell a Daolord of the First Step despite having
reached the second step. But Youji, you really shouldn’t do that to
Pillsaint too often.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know, I know. I
was just excited because I broke through.” Su Youji nodded
repeatedly, then looked towards Ning with some excitement. “Master,
why don’t you give my charm skills a try?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning revealed a smile.
“Go ahead and try.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji immediately
said, “Then Master, you must…” Halfway through her words, she
immediately used her secret arts. She had already been beautiful
enough to cause the downfall of kingdoms. Now, her smile made her
eyes look like the most enchanting things in the universe. Her gaze
was unfathomably deep, making it so that Ning couldn’t help but be
drawn to them. Even if he wasn’t, those beautiful eyes seemed to be
imprinted onto his mind, stirring and beguiling his inner heart…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s gaze slowly
grew more and more distant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master,” Su Youji
said softly, “Come here and take Youji into your arms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yeah…” Ning
mumbled softly, and Su Youji revealed a look of excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yeah, no thanks.”
Ning stared at her. “Is this what you were trying to accomplish by
trying to charming your master!?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s soul was
comparable to that of a Daolord of the Fourth Step, and his
heartforce made him superior to many. He was at the cusp of breaking
through to the sixth stage of heartforce; just a few slight
improvements would result in him becoming a true Heartforce
Cultivator. How could a newly ascended Daolord of the Second Step
like Su Youji possibly shake his will? However, Ning could sense how
truly formidable these secret arts of Feixian the Exalted were. Most
likely, once Su Youji became a Daolord of the Third Step she would be
able to have a slight affect on Ning for a very brief period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If she reached the
fourth step… Su Youji as a Daolord of the Fourth Step would be
truly frightening! And yet, this path held both strengths and
weaknesses, with the weaknesses being quite obvious; if she
encountered a Heartforce Cultivator, she would be in serious trouble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I could sense that I
wasn’t able to beguile you, so I just wanted to joke around with
you a bit, Master,” Su Youji explained hurriedly. She then mumbled
to herself, “Can’t I even make a joke?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright, alright.
Time to head out. We’re pretty closed to the Sacred City,” Ning
said with a laugh. “Joking around now is fine, but don’t cause
any trouble once we enter the Sacred City. That is one of the eight
Sacred Cities of the Dao Alliance, after all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning once more began to
advance with Pillsaint and Su Youji in tow. The travelled for another
two hundred-plus years, then finally reached the fabled city of
Skywood, one of the eight Sacred Cities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So that’s
Skywood.” Ning stared off into the distance. Although Skywood was
described as a ‘city’, it didn’t have any walls. It was
actually a collection of staggeringly large edifices which hovered
together above the clouds! It was filled with towering palaces,
ancient estates, and strange buildings. Every single building glowed
with the light of restrictive spells, causing it to radiate with a
plethora of colors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most dazzling of all
were the completely jade-green city gates, which were three million
meters tall. Quite a few figures could be seen soaring through the
clouds and into the gates, with some figures flitting into the
various palaces and estates.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One of the eight
Sacred Cities.” Pillsaint was rather excited. “It reigns over or
directly influences tens of thousands of nearby territories. I hear
that an enormous number of Daolords are here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Normally, Skywood
City sees over ten thousand Daolords at any given point in time,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of raw numbers
of Daolords? The Ancient cultivators, the Brightshore Kingdom, the
Aeonian race, the Aberrant special lifeforms… no one could compete
with the Dao Alliance in this area. Any of the eight Sacred Cities of
the Dao Alliance held more Daolords than any of the other
organizations held in their main headquarters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Brightshore
Kingdom’s Twelve Palaces had thousands of Daolords (excluding the
black-armored ones), but most of them were outside adventuring, and
so only a few hundred powerful Daolords were actually within the
borders of the Brightshore Kingdom at any point in time. Skywood
City, however, held more than ten thousand cultivators who were
training in seclusion… and this represented just a tiny fraction of
Skywood’s total area of influence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If all of the Daolords
of the tens of thousands of nearby territories were gathered
together, there would probably be far more of them! The vast majority
of Daolords were wandering the outside world or in their own sects,
after all. Only a small amount were within Skywood City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Skywood City is
controlled by one of the nine great sects of the Dao Alliance, the
Skywood Sect,” Ning said. “This place is operated in accordance
with the laws of the Skywood Sect.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The eight Sacred
Cities are all quite interesting.” Pillsaint laughed. “Eight
Sacred Cities which are under the control of nine different
organizations. The Dao Alliance really is rather chaotic.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, I hear that
the governor of Skywood City is also the sect leader of the Skywood
Sect, the legendary Emperor Skywood, right?” Su Youji asked
curiously. Eternal Emperor Skywood was extremely famous, and she had
heard of him long ago in the Brightshore Kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled and
nodded. On the surface, the Dao Alliance had a total of eight mighty
Emperors who were the governors of these eight Sacred Cities.
However…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the likes of the
Brightshore Kingdom and the Aeonians had multiple Eternal Emperors,
despite being far smaller organizations. Could the exalted Dao
Alliance truly have just eight Eternal Emperors? Who would possibly
believe such a thing? However, the eight governors of the Sacred
Cities had lived for countless chaos cycles and had reigned over
their respective Sacred Cities. Without question, they were
incredibly strong even amongst Eternal Emperors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not even the most
powerful of Eternal Emperors were able to shake the positions of the
eight governors! Not only were the governors themselves powerful and
given great authority within the Dao Alliance, they were also
secretly supported by many reclusive old experts. This was why they
were referred to as being the nine major organizations which reigned
over the Dao Alliance.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 30 – Ji Ning’s Goal
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gates of the Sacred
City were towering and dazzling to behold. Ji Ning’s group of three
flew straight towards the gates. In truth, Skywood City had no walls
at all, and so there was no real reason to go through the gates.
However, this was the first time Ning’s group had ever come to a
Sacred City, and they needed to procure a Dao Alliance talisman.
Otherwise, they wouldn’t be considered true members of the Dao
Alliance and would be forbidden entry into many places within the
Sacred Cities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoists.”
There was an unprepossessing little pavilion right outside the doors,
and a black-robed woman immediately walked out of it with a smile on
her face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is our first
trip to the Sacred City. We would like to pick up a Dao Alliance
talisman,” Ning said. The black-robed woman before him had a very
weak aura; most likely, she had relied on a Pseudo Samsara Pill in
order to break through to become a Daolord of the First Step.
Daolords like her would generally be given fairly menial tasks within
the larger organizations and sects.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, a Dao Alliance
talisman? Please follow me.” The black-robed woman guided Ning into
the pavilion. Within were a number of white-robed men and women, as
well as a few alien Outsiders. Judging from their auras, they were at
most at the World level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where have the three
of you come from, and what school do you belong to? Are you already
registered with the Dao Alliance?” The black-robed woman asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am Darknorth of
Vastheaven Palace,” Ning said while producing his Vastheaven Palace
medallion. The black-robed nodded, then waved her hand and produced a
little book. She flipped through the book, quickly verifying some
information about Daolord Darknorth of Vastheaven Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth of Vastheaven Palace, here is your Dao Alliance talisman.”
The black-robed woman produced a black talisman and handed it over to
Ning, with the talisman having the word ‘Dao’ atop it. It was
covered in divine runes that seemed quite mysterious and which
ensured the talisman could only be bound once. Ning waved his hand,
binding it to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are these two
registered with us already as well?” The black-robed woman asked.
Ning shook his head and replied, “They are not. These two are my
retainers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Retainers?” The
black-robed woman and the nearby World-level cultivators all glanced
at Ning with surprise. He had two Daolords as retainers? It seemed as
though this ordinary-looking Daolord Darknorth was actually quite an
extraordinary figure! They naturally knew nothing of Ning’s battle
against Patriarch Clearwind, as neither Vastheaven Palace nor
Clearwind Temple had publicized that battle. As a result, very few
knew about it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you aren’t
already registered with the Dao Alliance, things will be slightly
more complicated,” the black-robed woman said. “Please follow me.
We need to take some steps to ensure that no spies are able to make
their way into the Dao Alliance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand.” Su
Youji smiled. She and Pillsaint both obediently followed after the
black-robed woman. They knew coming here what the rules would be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s history was
very clean, and Vastheaven Palace had already vouched for him. As a
result, he was easily able to acquire a Dao Alliance talisman and be
acknowledged as a formal member of the Dao Alliance. As for unknown
figures without any backers, they would need to be investigated and
swear certain lifeblood oaths to prove their ‘innocence’ before
they would be given a Dao Alliance talisman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later, a
white-robed elder led Ning’s group of three away from the city
gates. The four flew through the clouds, and the white-robed man
smiled at them. “Seniors, this is your first trip to a Sacred City,
so I will explain a bit regarding the rules here. There are
restrictive wards and barriers surrounding all of the palaces and
estates inside the Sacred City, and you are forbidden from violence
within them. If you engage in violence, you shall perish and your Dao
shall vanish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
simply listened. These were iron rules which no one could breach.
This was one of the eight Sacred Cities of the Dao Alliance, after
all; no one could violate these rules, unless they had the power to
challenge the entire Dao Alliance and live to tell the tale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once you leave the
protective wards around those various palaces and estates, no one
will get involved no matter how violent the battle becomes.” The
white-robed elder chuckled. “For example, the four of us are in
midair right now. This airspace is not covered by the barriers or
wards of any estate, and so we could theoretically be attacked at any
moment.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How chaotic,”
Pillsaint sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is a bit chaotic.
Wherever there are cultivators, there will always be chaos,” the
white-robed elder said. “Also – please remember this, seniors. In
Skywood City, the disciples of the Skywood Sect are not to be trifled
with, not even the True Gods or Elder Gods. If you kill a member of
the Skywood Sect, then you will also be put to death and your Dao
shall vanished.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji asked, “How
can we tell if someone belongs to the Skywood Sect?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s very easy.”
The white-robed elder smiled. “Members of the Skywood Sect are all
dressed in unique robes that emanate the unique aura of the Skywood
tree. If for some reason they aren’t wearing their robes and they
end up being killed, their killers won’t be blamed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
nodded. The Skywood tree was the sacred tree that stood guard over
the entire Skywood Sect. It served as the foundation for the entire
sect! Ning and the others were now able notice that there was indeed
a unique, ancient, and eternal aura radiating from the robes of the
Skywood Sect disciples they had met thus far. It was immediately
recognizable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me tell you a
bit more about the important places within Skywood City. Those
hundred thousand-plus estates hovering in the air over there all for
cultivators to dwell in. They belong to our Skywood Sect, and the
three of you can spend a bit of chaos nectar if you wish to
temporarily take up residence in one of them. It’ll be fine even if
you want to stay for a hundred chaos cycles; all you need to do is
pay a bit of rent in the form of chaos nectar. No one will ever dare
to disturb you.” The white-robed elder pointed off into the
distance, where there was a group of ancient palaces that radiated
mighty auras. “That region over there is where our Skywood Sect is
located, and the Eternal Emperor resides there as well. No matter
what, you must not trespass there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed elder
introduced one place after another to the group.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll go over
there.” Ning pointed at a distant hall that was constructed within
the clouds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Spellworld?”
The white-robed elder was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, we shall go to
the Spellworld first,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Spellworld
contained countless techniques within it. Every single one of the
eight Sacred Cities of the Dao Alliance contained a Spellworld within
it, and cultivators of the Dao Alliance were permitted to learn many
precious techniques and divine abilities within those Spellworlds for
a fee. There were even techniques belonging to Eternal Emperors…
and supposedly, Hegemons as well! However, the more rare a technique
was, the greater a price one would need to pay to learn it. Nothing
in this world was free.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Spellworld
contains countless techniques. You can choose from them as you
please.” A guardian golem was standing in front of the hall, and it
said in a calm voice, “Come speak to me after you have chosen.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This guardian golem
was left here by the Dao Alliance. It is incredibly powerful,” the
white-robed elder said immediately. In the end, golems were more
loyal than anyone or anything else. If they were assigned to guard a
place, they would never allow even the slightest of slip-ups.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pillsaint, Youji,
the two of you should go inside and take a look as well. See if
there’s anything you need. I’m going to enter now.” Ning
immediately strode in after finishing his words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sure, let’s take a
look inside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s see what
this place has to offer.” Both Su Youji and Pillsaint followed Ning
inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning stepped into
the hall, he felt space twisting around him as though he was entering
a different world. This was a world with canyons, with rivers, with
towering mountains, and with waterfalls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jade scrolls were lying
on boulders, floating in the air above deserts, hanging from tree
branches, and scattered throughout the world in a casual fashion.
This was a world created by an ancient power of the Dao Alliance, and
it was quite mysterious and profound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not this one. Nor
this one. Nope, not this one either…” Ning stood there at the top
of a mountain, stretching out his godsense as he began to scan
through the various jade slips. Every single jade slip contained some
basic information regarding the techniques which were available as
well as the price one needed to pay! Ordinary techniques could be
purchased by using a bit of chaos nectar, but truly core techniques
were much more difficult to procure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here it is!” Ning
suddenly revealed a look of delight. Swoosh! Ning’s body flickered
as he instantly flew from the mountain peak to a prairie that was
tens of thousands of kilometers away. There was a thatched cottage on
this prairies, and there were nine jade slips that had been casually
tossed inside that cottage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These nine scrolls were
the [Novessence Water], [Novessence Fire], [Novessence Wood],
[Novessence Earth], [Novessence Metal], [Novessence Wind],
[Novessence Thunder], [Novessence Light], and [Novessence Void].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s what I
need. As a new Daolord, these are the secret arts which fit me
perfectly.” ‘ Ning nodded slowly. Although he had gained the
secret arts left behind by the deceased Sword Hegemon, it was far too
hard for him to make any headway into them. Even if he put all of his
efforts into training in them, for now it would be very hard for him
to reach a high level of power in them. The nine secret arts created
by Daolord Allgod, however, were a perfect fit for Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had the azureflower
mist energy and the [Seven Leafpill Chapters]. This made it so that
Ning was able to easily train in the various novessence techniques.
He had already been able to reach the level of septessence thunder,
and the only thing holding him back was him not having the other
types of Dao lightning he needed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I can master the
full [Novessence Thunder], I should be able to slay most Verge-level
Daolords with it! If I can merge all nine secret arts together, even
the likes of Patriarch Clearwind would probably die. Even if he
survived, he would be very heavily wounded.” Ning knew that
training in the nine novessence arts was the best choice for him
right now, which was why he had spent a thousand years hastening to
Skywood City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Allgod’s nine
secret arts were only purchasable within the Dao Alliance. The
Brightshore Kingdom had only been able to purchase the five weaker
secret arts, with the [Novessence Thunder], [Novessence Wind],
[Novessence Light], and the most powerful [Novessence Void]
techniques all missing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced at the
various techniques, feeling a sense of joy in his heart. These were
the nine secret arts which Daolord Allgod had painstakingly created,
and when they were used together they were capable of truly unearthly
levels of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going to buy
them all.” Ning waved his hand, collecting all nine jade slips.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_31___Killer_Technique__t"></A>
Chapter 31 – Killer Technique, the Nine Novessence Arts
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the nine novessence
arts, Ji Ning had already acquired the [Novessence Thunder] and the
[Novessence Water]; there was no need to purchase them. He only
needed to buy the other seven.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Novessence Void]
required five million cubes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Novessence Wind]
and the [Novessence Light] each cost 1.5 million cubes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Novessence Fire],
[Novessence Earth], and the others were all fairly cheap, and the
price was the same as it had been in the Brightshore Kingdom – a
million cubes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In total, the cost was
twelve million cubes!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s see if there
are any other techniques that are a good fit for me.” Ning
continued his search. The nine novessence arts of Daolord Allgod
weren’t weak, but they weren’t overpoweringly strong either. This
was because, even trained to the absolute apex, the techniques were
not able to kill an ordinary Eternal Emperor; at most, they would be
able to suppress him! The secret arts which the Hegemon had given
Ning, however, were able to slay Eternal Emperors. The problem was
that it was too hard to train in them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning picked up those
seven scrolls, then spent another three days wandering through the
Spellworld. This truly broadened his horizons and let him understand
how many formidable techniques there truly were. It really was true
that the Brightshore Kingdom could not come close to comparing to the
Dao Alliance in terms of number of techniques. The countless
generations of Dao Alliance experts had left behind plenty of
techniques that were far more powerful than the nine novessence arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, for the present
Ji Ning, the nine novessence arts were indeed still the most
appropriate art for him to train in, and they would allow him to
unleash the maximum level of power possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why didn’t you
spend more time inside?” When Ning exited the Spellworld, he saw Su
Youji and Pillsaint waiting for him at the entrance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There really weren’t
many techniques or spells that we need. Two or three days was
plenty,” Pillsaint said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of us
already have our own techniques which we haven’t finished training
in,” Su Youji said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pillsaint was focused
in alchemy, and the first six chapters of the [Seven Leafpill
Chapters] truly was more than enough for him to train in for a long
period of time. The same was true for Su Youji. “Master, have you
finished choosing your techniques?” Su Youji asked curiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have.” Ning
walked to the guardian golem, then waved his hand and produced those
seven jade scrolls. The golem turneds it flaming gaze towards those
jade slips ,then said calmly, “These seven secret arts will cost a
total of twelve million cubes of chaos nectar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That much?” Su
Youji and Pillsaint were both speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take it.” Ning
produced a jade bottle. The guardian golem accepted it, examined it,
then nodded as it waved a finger towards the seven jade slips.
Instantly, layers of light appeared on the surface of the seven jade
slips; the restrictive spells over them had been temporarily removed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately sent
his godsense into the jade slips. He first swore a lifeblood oath not
to teach them to anyone else, then begain to memorize all seven of
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve finished
memorizing them.” Ning returned the seven jade slips back to the
golem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” The golem
accepted the slips, then waved its hand and caused the restrictive
spells to reappear. The golem then gave them a toss, returning them
into the Spellworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
was in quite high spirits.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The World-level
white-robed elder belonging to the Skywood Sect had been waiting for
them this entire time, and he now continued to lead the way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How many places
which sell magic treasures does Skywood City have?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The best one is
naturally the Plumesoar Hall belonging to our Skywood Sect,” the
white-robed elder said hurriedly. Engaging in the trade of magic
treasures could result in significant profits. Daolords would often
risk their lives for a few million cubes, but the auction halls of
the eight Sacred Cities earned ridiculous profits every day with
comparatively little risk. But of course, in the eight Sacred Cities
ordinary organizations weren’t even qualified to enter this
lucrative trade.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My question was ‘how
many’,” Ning repeated. The white-robed elder said resignedly,
“Three in total. The first one is the Plumesoar Hall of our Skywood
Sect. The other two places are the Blackwater Pavilion and the
Universal Treasures Hall. However, this place is Skywood City; as a
result, our Plumesoar Hall has far more treasures than the other two
places.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then let’s go to
the Plumesoar Hall,” Ning said with a chuckle. Now that he had the
secret arts, he needed to buy the treasures necessary to train in
them. He was still lacking in Dao lightning and Dao water, for
example!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Plumesoar Hall of
our Skywood Sect is over there.” The white-robed elder pointed
towards the extremely beautiful, nine-storied tower which rose up
into the clouds. An aura of light rose up thirty thousand meters aboe
the tower, and it was protected by layers of protective spells. The
Plumesoar Hall was the place where the Skywood Sect stored its
countless treasures. It naturally was tightly protected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Plumesoar Hall often
holds treasure auctions. There will be another one roughly a month
from now,” the white-robed elder said. “You can go take a look
when the time comes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need for the
treasure auction.” Ning flew straight towards Plumesoar Hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Places like Waveshift
City of the Badlandss Territory rarely held treasure auctions, but
this was Skywood City, one of the eight Sacred Cities of the Dao
Alliance. Plumesoar Hall, Blackwater Pavilion, and the Universal
Treasures Hall would hold one every so often.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Ning flew past
the protective barriers, he could sense a flood of treasure auras
sweep towards him like a tidal wave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There really is a
mountain of treasures here.” Ning took a glance past the main gates
of Plumesoar Hall. He saw an utterly amazing number of magic
treasures inside the hall, far more than ten times as much as much as
any of the Twelve Palaces of the Brightshore Kingdom. In terms of raw
quality, the Dao Alliance had far more of everything than anyone
else, be it cultivators, treasures, or techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pillsaint, Youji.
Now that you have broken through to become Daolords, you’ll need
good treasures so that you can unleash your full potential,” Ning
said. “Go buy whatever you need, but keep it under five million
cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five million cubes?”
Pillsaint and Su Youji were both rather shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be shy.
Pillsaint, you are an alchemist; you not only need a good alchemy
cauldron, you also need many valuable ingredients. Otherwise, how can
you improve?” Ning continued, “Youji, you are now fairly
powerful, but if you have suitable treasures you can become even more
powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two had sworn to
follow him unto death itself; they would be his eternal retainers.
There was no way Ning could be too stingy with him, now that he had
sufficient resources. If it wasn’t for the fact that he needed a
lot of resources in order to train in the nine novessence arts, he
probably would’ve been even more generous with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go on in.” Ning
immediately entered the Plumesoar Hall. The conversation between the
three had been a silent mental discussion as they didn’t wish for
the white-robed elder to overhear it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seniors, I’m going
to leave now. If there’s anything you need, you can seek out the
attendants within the Plumesoar Hall,” the white-robed elder said
loudly. His main mission had been to send these three to the
Plumesoar Hall and ensure that they made a good amount of money off
the three.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Plumesoar Hall
contained everything within it. Beautiful women were as common as the
clouds, and although they weren’t as beautiful as Su Youji they
were still dazzlingly and beguiling. Magic treasures and unique items
were everywhere, the cheapest being a few hundred cubes and the most
expensive ones being priceless!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, what do you
wish to purchase? The Plumesoar Hall has accumulated countless
treasures over endless chaos cycles. We have everything here.” A
female attendant was standing next to Ning. She had some red fur on
her face, but that just made her look even more bewitching.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the list of
treasures which I need.” Ning produce a jade slip, then handed it
over. “Let me know what the price will be.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dazzling female
attendant smiled as she accepted the jade slip, then sent her
godsense into it. When she did, her face turned pale. She couldn’t
help but raise her head to look at Ning. What an impressive fellow!
He was apparently a Daolord of the Second Step, but he wished to
purchase this many valuable treasures? All combined, this had to be
tens of millions of cubes!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go make some
inquiries. Please wait for a while, senior,” the attendant said in
a soft voice. She then departed to go make the report to her
superiors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he spent
some time casually strolling through the Plumesoar Hall and admiring
its many treasures. His list had included all of the precious
treasures needed for training in all nine novessence arts. And of
course, he already had seven types of Dao lightning and Dao water.
The main issue was that the ones Ning had were the cheaper ones; in
the Brightshore Kingdom, the most expensive type of Dao lightning,
the Felworld lightning, needed 1.9 million cubes of chaos nectar! The
two types of Dao lightning and Dao water which Ning needed were the
most expensive ones. As for the other seven novessence arts, he
needed everything!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist.” A
silver-robed Daolord walked over. When he saw Ning, he sent a mental
message to him. “You really need a large number of magic treasures.
However, Plumesoar Hall can provide everything you need.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning nodded.
These items existed in the Brightshore Kingdom as well. Ning wasn’t
surprised that the Skywood Sect, the ruler of one of the eight Sacred
Cities, was also able to procure them. “How much chaos nectar will
it cost?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Some of the Chaos
fire and Chaos wind, we can just give to you as gifts. The others,
though… in total, it’ll cost roughly 38 million cubes of chaos
nectar.” The silver-robed Daolord looked at Ning. He was actually
quite curious; would a Daolord of the Second Step really be able to
produce that much? It must be understood that even when Vastheaven
Palace extorted Patriarch Clearwind for his treasures, it had only
been able to gain roughly twenty million cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s too
expensive.” Ning shook his head. “I could purchase these things
in the Brightshore Kingdom for less than that.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Brightshore
Kingdom?” The silver-robed Daolord was startled. He immediately
said, “Then how about 36 million cubes? This is a very low price; I
think you know, fellow Daoist, what the rough price for these things
are.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
speechless. If he had purchased these items in the Brightshore
Kingdom, the price would have indeed been around 36 million cubes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go pay a
visit to the Blackwater Pavilion and the Universal Treasure Hall
first. I have to find the best price, of course,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-robed
Daolord’s face twitched slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After haggling for a
period of time, they ended up settling on the price of 34 million
cubes! There was some competition amongst the three markets, after
all; it was indeed possible to lower the price substantially.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All your treasures
are ready. Fellow Daoist, you can simply pay me in chaos nectar.”
The silver-robed Daolord looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you accept
payment in precious minerals?” Ning suddenly asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Minerals?” The
silver-robed Daolord was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “Right.
Minerals. For example, darkspace flamestone.” Ning didn’t really
want to do this, but all of his chaos nectar and chaos jewels
combined was not enough to reach the price of 34 million cubes.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 32 – What The Hell?
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the deceased
Sword Hegemon had left him fifty million cubes, he had left ten
million of them back in the Three Realms! The Three Realms would need
that money for its development. As for the money he had gained from
Patriarch Clearwind, that was reserved for the creation of his
avatar. The total amount of chaos nectar and chaos jewels Ji Ning had
totaled roughly thirty million cubes or so… and he had already
promised up to five million for Su Youji and Pillsaint for them to
purchase what they needed. Thus, Ning was lacking quite a bit; he’d
have to throw in his darkspace flamestone ore.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darkspace flamestone
ore? Of course Plumesoar Hall would be willing to purchase it. Follow
me. A different Daolord is designated as the purchaser for special
items and valuable treasures,” the silver-robed Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
followed behind the silver-robed Daolord and began to move deeper
into Plumesoar Hall. They travelled through a wide passageway, and a
short while later a thin, gray-robed man emerged from another part of
the passageway. He glanced sideways at the two of them, then walked
past them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the gray-robed man
exited Plumesoar Hall, a hint of avarice appeared in his eyes. “That
Daolord of the Second Step was actually being invited into the
important parts of Plumesoar Hall?” The gray-robed man pondered to
himself, “That place is used for selling valuable treasures that
are worth more than ten million cubes.” He had been to Plumesoar
Hall on multiple occasions, and so he was quickly able to deduce what
was happening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I never would’ve
imagined that a puny little Daolord of the Second Step would have
more than ten million cubes worth of treasure.” The skinny
gray-robed man narrowed his eyes, both greed and violence filling his
thoughts. “I’ve followed Master for countless years and gone into
many dangerous locations, but I only have a few million cubes worth
of treasure. If I can kill him, all of his treasures will be mine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But the problem is…
if he has that much treasure, he definitely must have experienced
extraordinary events. Should I attack him or not?” The gray-robed
man pondered for a while, then made up his mind. “The path of
cultivation is a dangerous path by nature. I am a Daolord of the
Third Step, while he’s merely a Daolord of the Second Step. How
strong could he possibly be? I’ll attack him. If I win, his
treasures will be mine. If I lose, I should still be able to escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having pondered
for aw hile, the gray-robed man decided to give it a try. As he saw
it, even if this Daolord of the Second Step was a freakishly talented
genius, he should be able to retreat unscathed. The gray-robed man
immediately flew towards a nearby cloud-shrouded palace, preparing to
keep watch from there. He didn’t plan on asking anyone else for
assistance. Asking someone weaker to help out was pointless, while
someone stronger than him would probably demand the lion’s share of
the loot. He certainly didn’t wish to let that happen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the nature of
cultivation. Some cultivators focused on the Dao, tempering
themselves through dangerous experiences. Others, however, preferred
to plunder the possessions of their fellows. This was the fastest way
of accumulating treasures, after all! But this path was a very
dangerous path, because you never knew what secret killing techniques
or trump cards your target might be holding. There are tradeoffs in
all things. Plundering offered great rewards, and so there were still
many Daolords willing to engage in such activities. A single
successful kill might result in astonishing rewards, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were a few who
were able to keep true to their own hearts and not engage in murder
or robbery, with Ning being one of them. If other Daolords didn’t
cause him problems, he wouldn’t antagonize them either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had no idea that
he had just become a target. He was happily selling off his stockpile
of darkspace flamestone for the princely sum of 9.2 million cubes of
chaos nectar, and he then purchased a number of things for Pillsaint
and Su Youji.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now that I have this
‘Heartspiral’, I am much stronger than I was before.” Su Youji
happily held the white shell-shaped treasure in her hands, then
looked at Ning. “Thank you, Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whee hee hee!”
Pillsaint was celebrating his new treasures as well. As for Ning, he
felt both happy and resigned. The Heartspiral was extremely powerful,
and it was a perfect fit someone who walked the path of charm like Su
Youji. However, it had cost him 5.8 million cubes of chaos nectar! Su
Youji had lingered over the Heartspiral for quite some time, wanting
to buy it but knowing that it cost more than the five million cube
limit. In the end, after Ning had finished buying the materials he
needed for his nine novessence arts, he saw her staring at the
Heartspiral and agreed to buy it for her. As for Pillsaint, he had
purchased a good furnace and various alchemical materials, which cost
a total of around two million cubes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh. I only have a
few hundred thousand left.” Ning couldn’t help but sigh to
himself. It really did seem as though he never had enough money on
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, he really
wanted to study the full copy of Emperor Heartsword’s [Heartsword]
technique, but it was far too expensive. The cost of that technique
was many times higher than the nine novessence arts; there was no way
he could afford it. In addition, Ning had already acquired the first
ten stances of the [Heartsword] stance long ago. The truly valuable
aspect of [Heartsword] lay in teaching its wielders the mysteries of
how to truly merge one’s heartforce with one’s sword-arts. The
first ten stances would already be plenty for Ning to research,
especially given that Ning still wasn’t a full Heartforce
Cultivator yet. There was no rush.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the future, as he
continued to grow more powerful in his path of cultivation, he would
definitely need to perfectly merge his heartforce techniques with his
Dao of the Sword. Only then would he grow more powerful. Sooner or
later, he would have to acquire the full [Heartsword] manual.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to leave,”
Ning said with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Su Youji
held the Heartspiral in her hands very happily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where are we going,
Master?” Pillsaint asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First, let’s go
rent out an estate within the Skywood Sect,” Ning said. Skywood
City had more than a hundred thousand estates for rent that were made
available to local cultivators; all one needed to do was spent a bit
of chaos nectar for them. This really didn’t amount to much; the
several hundred thousand cubes of chaos nectar which Ning had on hand
was enough for him to stay here for more than ten chaos cycles. All
Ning really wanted to do was to just reside within the estates,
giving him a safe place to master all nine novessence arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He now had his
techniques and his treasures. It was time to master the nine
novessence arts!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He came out.” The
skinny, gray-robed man was staring intently at Plumesoar Hall from
his distant palace perch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s group of three
had just flown out of Plumesoar Hall, smiles on their faces. They
were chatting as they flew through the clouds. Ning was in an
excellent mood, because he had come here precisely for the sake of
those nine novessence arts! Although he had all but depleted his
store of chaos nectar, he had done everything he wanted to do.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning suddenly
frowned. A thin, gray-robed Daolord was flying straight towards him.
It was normal to encounter Daolords in Skywood City, a Sacred City of
the Dao Alliance, but what caused Ning to go on his guard was the
fact that this Daolord was the one he had encountered earlier in
Plumesoar Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he was
immediately put on high alert, on the surface he continued to smile
as he lead Su Youji and Pillsaint forwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black mist suddenly
spread outwards, so thick that one couldn’t see through it with the
naked eye. It instantly covered an area of tens of thousands of
kilometers around them, and as it did an invisible surge of power
swept across Ning. As for Ning, as soon as he saw the black mist
coming he immediately drew Su Youji and Pillsaint into his
estate-treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The surge of invisible
power struck directly at Ning’s soul. If Ning really was just an
ordinary Daolord of the Second Step, he would’ve fallen prey to
this trick… but unfortunately, the gray-robed Daolord’s opponent
was Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A soul-shaking
technique? It doesn’t even match up to Youji’s.” Although Ning
didn’t really worry about the attack too much, he was still
prepared to unleash his full power in his counter. When a lion hunted
a rabbit, it would still strike with full force!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“DIE!” The
gray-robed man manifested a total of six arms, each wielding a curved
scimitar. The light of his scimitars howled through the air as he
chopped towards Ning with them. The area around Ning began to crack
and shatter as saber-light appeared everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First a secret art
to shake my heart, then close combat to ensure my death. What a nasty
fellow.” Ning waved his right hand, causing a Northbow sword to
appear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break.” Ning
stabbed out with his sword. His strike seemed ordinary in every
respect. And yet, although the gray-robed man had clearly been the
first to strike, Ning’s sword had stabbed through his forehead
before his saber-light had even gotten close to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fast. Indescribably
fast. This was the Blood Drop stance of Ning’s Omega Sword Dao! Of
Ning’s five Supreme Daos, the only one which had made further
breakthroughs thus far was his Blood Drop sword-intent, and so his
Blood Drop stance of his Omega Sword Dao was currently his most
powerful strike. He was now a bit more powerful than he had been when
he fought Patriarch Clearwind, and the power of this strike was close
to Patriarch Clearwind’s killer attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“H-how can…” A
look of horror and shock appeared in the gray-robed man’s eyes. How
could it be that his six scimitars weren’t even able to touch or
block this person’s sword? How could his opponent be this fast?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! The Blood Drop
stance’s full, penetrating power stabbed deep into the gray-robed
man’s body, instantly reducing it into dust. The man died on the
spot! It must be remembered that Patriarch Clearwind’s killer
attack was able to kill weaker Daolords of the Fourth Step. This
attack of Ning’s wasn’t much weaker!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I never would’ve
imagined that I’d be attacked as soon as I left Plumesoar Hall.”
Ning waved his hand, collecting the treasures which the gray-robed
man had left behind. “Not even cultivators are immune to the allure
of treasures…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a surge of
terrifying black mist shot out of one of the hundred thousand-plus
estates off in the distance. Ning turned to look, only to see a pair
of eyes emerge from the mist and stare towards him with a murderous
look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seal!” An
invisible ripple of power spread out from afar. Although this attack
came from a great distance, the region which Ning was in was almost
instantly locked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s subconscious
immediately began warning him that a terrifying threat was
approaching, and the level of the threat was every bit the equal of
the one posed by the Eternal Emperors Ning had encountered in the
Azureflower Estate. Ning’s heart began to tremble. He knew that the
situation was dire, and could vaguely sense that the Daolord of the
Third Step he had just slain had to have had some sort of connection
to a truly major power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What the hell is
going on?!” Ning had been in a wonderful mood just a few moments
ago, but now his face immediately turned pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hide!” Ning was
out of options. He immediately transformed into a streak of light,
moving ten times faster than the limits of the Heavenly Daos as he
charged right back into the nearby Plumesoar Hall.
</P>

Chapter 33 – Daolord Kongsan
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Plumesoar Hall was very
close, and so Ji Ning was able to almost instantly fly back inside
it. Per the rules of the Dao Alliance, it was absolutely forbidden to
engage in acts of violence inside the restrictive spells protecting
the various palaces and estates within the eight Sacred Cities.
Anyone who violated this rule would be slain and their Dao destroyed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This fellow is
pretty strong, but he probably wouldn’t dare to violate the rules
of the entire Dao Alliance.” Ning relaxed slightly after hiding
himself within the Plumesoar Hall. Even figures like Palace Lord
Dawnstar or historical legends like Daolord Allgod hadn’t dared to
challenge the Dao Alliance! The Dao Alliance’s roots were
immeasurably deep, and it was the greatest organization of the entire
Endless Territories. Challenge the Dao Alliance? The three Hegemons
might have the power to do so, but even they wouldn’t actually
carry it out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What an enormous
disturbance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is going on?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The customers and
servants inside Plumesoar Hall all stared outside. Although the
battle between Ning and the gray-robed man had concluded quite
quickly, it had caused quite a disturbance as well. As for Ning, he
had no time to waste on the gazes of others; his attention was
focused on what was happening outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Far away, a
ball of black mist suddenly appeared at the margins of the frozen
space. Moments later, that black mist solidified into a human figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a man dressed
in long, beautiful black robes. He had fiery red hair and fiery red
eyes that were filled with an evil, murderous intent. He was
currently staring at Ning, hidden away within Plumesoar Hall. Ning
was staring right back at this man. Their gazes collided in midair!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quite bold. No
wonder you dared to kill the disciple of myself, Kongsan.” Daolord
Kongsan stood there calmly in empty space, emanating an aura of
transcendant dominance. This was an aura that came from overwhelming
self-confidence, which was in turn born from a person having reached
an extremely high level cultivation that allowed him to roam the
Endless Territories without meeting any superiors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kongsan?” When
Ning heard this name, his heart turned cold. His star map had some
records regarding some of the more famous Daolords of the Endless
Territories. Although the records he had on Kongsan weren’t very
detailed, he still had a rough idea as to how strong this person was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Kongsan.”
Ning remained within the protective embrace of the Plumesoar Hall’s
barriers as he said in a loud voice, “I imagine, given your power,
you know what happened just now. Your disciple suddenly ambushed me
with the intention of killing me. I didn’t cause any trouble for
him! Since he struck to kill, I cannot be blamed for killing him
instead. I only struck out with a single sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He ambushed you and
wanted to kill you. He failed and you killed him instead. This is all
very normal.” The distant Daolord Kongsan stared at Ning calmly,
but Ning couldn’t help but feel a cold feeling in his heart. “He
was still, however, my disciple. Since you killed my disciple, I am
going to kill you. If you have the necessary patience, you should
stay in Plumesoar Hall for the rest of your life. As soon as you
leave it, I’ll kill you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice was very
calm, but the murderous intent within it was quite clear and heavy.
There was nothing to negotiate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning
narrowed his eyes, then turned and left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cultivators and
servants within Plumesoar Hall all watched curiously as they listened
to Ning and Daolord Kongsan’s conversation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This white-robed
Daolord is screwed. He actually pissed off Daolord Kongsan! Given
Daolord Kongsan’s temper, he’s going to kill this kid no matter
what.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Poor bastard.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Did he really think
he could get away with killing Kongsan’s disciple?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But the white-robed
Daolord is also quite formidable. He’s clearly just a Daolord of
the Second Step, but he was able to kill Daolord Kongsan’s disciple
with ease. That disciple had visited Plumesoar Hall on many
occasions, often serving as his master’s errand boy. He was still,
however, a Daolord of the Third Step. I never would’ve thought that
he’d be killed in the blink of an eye. He didn’t even have the
chance to beg his master to come save him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These cultivators and
servants all chatted amongst themselves, with the servants of
Plumesoar Hall being especially casual in their words. They might be
weak, but they belonged to the Skywood Sect. There was an ironclad
rule in Skywood City – disciples of the Skywood Sect were not to be
touched! Not even Eternal Emperors would dare to violate this rule
within the confines of Skywood City. This type of rule was a joint
one shared throughout the eight Sacred Cities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning entered
the hall once more. The cultivators and servants turned their gazes
towards Ning, and they naturally stopped chattering about him. Ning
had a solemn look on his face, and his forehead was furrowed as he
frowned. Clearly, he was quite troubled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To have been targetd by
Daolord Kongsan was indeed quite troublesome. Still, Ning wasn’t
really afraid of him. The deceased Hegemon had given him two
Dao-seals, after all, which contained the power of a full-force
strike from the Hegemon. If push came to shove, he would just use one
of them up! However, Ning knew exactly how valuable those two
Dao-seals were. They were priceless treasures! The Sword Hegemon had
only been willing to pay the price necessary to make them once he
realized that he was definitely going to die. These two Dao-seals
would be protective, life-saving talismans for Ning for a long time
to come. Ning wouldn’t use them unless he truly had to.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” The
female attendant who had received Ning earlier walked over to him
once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. I heard that
in a month from now, Plumesoar Hall will be holding a treasure
auction?” Ning suddenly asked with a laugh. The nearby guests and
attendants were all secretly amazed. This Daolord of the Second Step
was still able to laugh at a time like this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The female attendant
immediately replied, “Yes, senior. A month from now, Plumesoar
Cloud will indeed hold a treasure auction. Quite a few treasures will
be up for sale this time, and the reserve prices will be much lower
than in the outside world. You might find something which is both
cheap and useful.” The low reserve prices of the treasure auctions
was a main reason why they were so attractive to cultivators.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m being targeted
by Daolord Kongsan, so I can’t leave for now. I have nothing better
to do, so I figured I’d go check this treasure auction of yours
out,” Ning laughed. “Give me a private room. I’ll wait a month
for that treasure auction to begin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Done.” The female
attendant nodded repeatedly. “Please follow me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were some very
cheap seats for each treasure auction, but there were also private,
secluded rooms. If you wished to purchase some extremely valuable
treasures while keeping your identity private, you would generally
use one of those private rooms. No one would disturb you so long as
you remained inside – this was one of the rules which Plumesoar
Hall had established long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The attendants and
guests once more began to speculate as they watched Ning leave with
the female attendant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The white-robed
Daolord looks pretty calm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed. He knows
that Daolord Kongsan is outside waiting for him, but he’s still
able to relax and take part in the treasure auction.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In my opinion, he’s
probably going to stay inside this hall for a very long period of
time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t be
bothered to respond to the gossip going on around him. Soon, he and
the attendant both reached a private room. Daolords lived for
extremely long periods of time; for them to arrive a few months early
for a treasure auction was quite commonplace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, while you
are in this private room, no one will disturb you unless you summon
them first. Not even the members of Plumesoar Hall itself will
disturb you, to say nothing of Daolord Kongsan,” the female
attendant said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have faith in the
Skywood Sect.” Ning nodded. “Now, there’s something I need you
to do for me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please tell me what
you need, senior” the female attendant said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly. “I
need an intelligence report regarding Daolord Kongsan’s abilities,
the more detailed the better. It needs information on all his
techniques and secret arts, as well as information on his previous
opponents. I need as much information as your Skywood Sect can
provide.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The female attendant
couldn’t help but feel shocked, but she nodded. “As detailed as
possible? The price will be quite high. It’ll probably cost around
a hundred thousand cubes of chaos nectar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A hundred thousand
is fine.” Ning nodded. The more powerful a cultivator was, the more
expensive intelligence reports about them would be. The Brightshore
Kingdom’s star map held information on virtually all the Daolords
of the Endless Territories, but that information was fairly cursory
in nature. To procure much more detailed individual intelligence
reports was extremely difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Give me a moment,”
the female attendant said respectfully, then retreated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the private
room. Ning was originally there by himself, but moments later
Pillsaint and Su Youji appeared by his side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, what
happened?” Su Youji immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why did you put the
two of us into the estate-world?” Pillsaint was puzzled as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We encountered a bit
of trouble.” Ning narrated what had just happened to them. Su Youji
and Pillsaint’s faces instantly turned pale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji said
worriedly, “From what you are saying, it sounds as though this
Daolord Kongsan is extremely powerful. What should we do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, no need to
worry too much. We have all the food and drink we want here. Why
worry about him?” Ning picked up a nearby canteen of wine and
poured himself a cup, then began to sip it in a relaxed manner as he
glanced sideways at Pillsaint and Su Youji. “Don’t just stand
there like idiots. Sit down and have a cup with me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Su Youji and Pillsaint
were both feeling rather nervous, but they still sat down. After a
short period of time drinking together, the sound of the door being
knocked rang out. “Come in,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The female attendant
was outside. She handed a jde slip to Ning, then said respectfully,
“Senior, all the information we have regarding Daolord Kongsan is
here.” Skywood Sect not only engaged in the treasure trade, it also
engaged in the intelligence trade.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning put down
his wine cup, then picked up the jade slip and began to read it
carefully. As he read through the information, he tossed a storage
treasure to the outsider woman. “You can leave now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The attendant looked
through thestorage treasure, then left obediently. “If ther’s
anything that you need, just summon me whenever you wish, senior.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, and she
shut the door behind her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kongsan.” Ning
picked up the jade slip once more, studying all of the information
regarding Daolord Kongsan which was within that jade slip.

Chapter 34 – Secret Arts Mastered
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning began to frown
as he stared at the jade slip. What a formidable figure. He was so
strong that he was most likely ranked amongst the second tier of
Verge-level Daolords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Based on what Ning
knew, the first-tier Verge-level Daolords included the likes of
Palace Lord Dawnstar, Daolord Allgod, and other similar figures.
Palace Lord Dawnstar had once slain an Eternal Emperor with three
chops of his saber, while Daolord Allgod had sent Emperor Melobo
fleeing in terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be remembered
that Emperor Melobo was not only an Eternal Emperor, he was also an
Awakened member of the Aeonian race who was still alive today.
Ordinary Eternal Emperors simply couldn’t compare to him in power…
and yet, in the face of Daolord Allgod, he was only able to flee. In
a true duel, Daolord Allgod was a bit inferior to Palace Lord
Dawnstar in ferocity of attacks, but he was actually superior in
tenacity and endurance. The Dao of the Sword and the Dao of the Saber
were offensive Daos, after all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Kongsan is a
bit weaker than Palace Lord Dawnstar, but not even Palace Lord
Dawnstar would be able to slay him.” Ning frowned. “He’s
skilled in the Dao of Darkness and can transform into darkness
itself. He’s virtually unkillable. His ability to transform into
darkness means that he has incredible control over space! When
fleeing, he’s able to move at thirty-six times the speed of light.
The darkness, by nature, is inscrutable and mysterious. This Dao can
be used to affect the soul, but its particularly dangerous in close
combat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s an untamable,
unruly figure with no clan and no sects. He is also an extremely
selfish person, and at least sixteen Daolords of the Fourth Step have
died to him. He’s currently living in an estate within Skywood
City.” The more Ning read, the bigger his headache became.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolords who were
skilled in combat weren’t terrifying. Daolords who were skilled in
staying alive were! Kongsan was one such person. His ability to
dissolve into darkness made him virtually unkillable, and he was
incredibly fast and skilled in spatial teleportation. He could flee
whenever he wished, but was also dangerous in close combat. He had no
obvious weaknesses!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master?” Su Youji
called out softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, is Kongsan a
tough nut to crack?” Pillsaint asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning put away the jade
slip, then nodded. “A very tough nut indeed. He’s one of the
toughest Daolords to deal with. Not even Palace Lord Dawnstar would
be able to kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s that
powerful?” Both Su Youji and Pillsaint were shocked. Palace Lord
Dawnstar was the most powerful Daolord of the Brightshore Kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, he’s just very
skilled in staying alive. His attacks are nowhere near Palace Lord
Dawnstar’s level.” Ning had already come to a decision on what to
do. “Pillsaint, Youji, I need to train for a while. Help stand
guard over me, and don’t let anyone in Plumesoar Hall disturb me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,”
Pillsaint and Su Youji both said in unison. Ning then waved his hand,
causing a stooped, thatched cottage to appear next to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s body flickered
as he flew into the thatched cottage. This was actually a small
temporal acceleration estate-world, and by using up a bit of Immortal
energy Ning would be able to maintain a rate of a hundred times the
normal flow of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the thatched
cottage. Ning was seated here in the lotus position. With a wave of
the hand, he caused a series of black gourds to appear. Each black
gourd contained Dao lightning, Dao fire, and other similar materials
that he needed to train in the nine novessence arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pop! Pop! The stoppers
popped out of two of the gourds. Instantly, two streaks of Dao
lightning flew out towards Ning. One was a streak of gray lightning
that was filled with endless destructive power, while the other was a
streak of white lightning that seemed to emanate an endless aura of
hope. These two streaks of Dao lightning instantly surged into Ning’s
body and were easily absorbed into their respective lightning bases.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I now have all nine
lightning bases I need. Time to give it a try. If my prediction is
correct, I should stand a good chance of mastering the full
novessence thunder.” Ning immediately began to try it out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack! Bang! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was a scene of utter
chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Boom! Crack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Explosions rang out
unabated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning was able
to remain very calm. Everything was under his control. The alchemical
techniques he had learned from the [Seven Leafpill Chapters] were
extremely profound! Lightning was by nature an unruly type of energy,
and he was dealing with nine different types of it! The hardest part
was perfectly joining the octessence thunder together with the
Felworld lightning. The octessence lightning was already incredibly
hard to control and was capable of easily wiping out Daolords of the
Third Step. As for the Felworld lightning, it was easily the most
berserk of the nine types of Dao lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You couldn’t force
things when trying to control them; you had to find and follow the
flow, then slowly nudge them together, making it so that although
they seemed to remain as wild and unruly as ever, they were acting in
accordance with the will of an incredibly sly hunter and were drawn
into one ‘trap’ after another. Ning spent a full two months
guiding and nudging the octessence thunder and the Felworld
lightning, and during this period of time he could not slack of in
the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“BOOM!!!” In the
end, a sudden explosion blasted out as the novessence thunder was
formed! This was a streak of beautiful black lightning, and its black
surface was covered with tiny silk strands that were like a layer of
fur. The novessence thunder was like a living creature, like a dragon
that happily swam through Ning’s Jindan chaos region with ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a sigh of
relief. He opened his eyes, then stretched out his right hand.
Whoosh! A stream of soft black divine lightning appeared within the
palm of his hands. It looked like a streak of gentle and reserved
black lightning, but it actually held an incomprehensible amount of
power inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This streak of
lightning is able to slay Daolords of the Fourth Step by itself?”
Ning couldn’t help but sigh. Daolords of the Fourth Step generally
possessed incredible divine bodies and were garbed in Dao armor, but
the novessence thunder was capable of slaying them! Of course, it
could only slay ‘ordinary’ Daolords of the Fourth Step, but that
did not detract from how terrifying it was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The novessence water
is easier to master than the novessence thunder. Time to train in
it.” Ning gave himself one day of rest, then continued in his
training. This time, he focused on mastering the [Novessence Water]
technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had taken him two
months to master the [Novessence Thunder], but only half a month to
master the [Novessence Water]. He took over a month to master the
[Novessence Fire], as Ning wasn’t nearly as talented in fire as he
was in thunder and water. The [Novessence Earth] took more than two
months, while the [Novessence Metal] took more than three months.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning mastered one
secret art after another, spending the most time on the [Novessence
Light] technique, as he knew very little regarding the Dao of Light.
This took him nearly two years before he was able to master it. The
[Novessence Void], the most powerful and thus the (theoretically)
most difficult of the novessence arts, Ning was actually able to
master in just eight months.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve actually
mastered all nine of the secret arts?” After finishing the
[Novessence Void], Ning himself felt a bit amazed at what he had
accomplished. He would’ve been satisfied if he had been able to
master the [Novessence Water], which was fairly weak and which he was
quite familiar with. He never would’ve imagined that after a bit of
effort, he would master all nine of the novessence arts!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Allgod had used
these arts to roam the Endless Territories. They really were a killer
combination! And he, Ji Ning, had actually mastered them?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank goodness I had
the azureflower mist energy, the Omega Sword Dao, and most
importantly of all the [Seven Leafpill Chapters].” Ning quickly
understood why he had been able to master this technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Allgod had
originally claimed that one would have to first become a Daolord of
the Fourth Step, then become extremely skilled in alchemy, lightning,
light, water, etc. before one would be able to master this technique!
As for Ji Ning?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had the azureflower
mist energy, making him comparable to a Daolord of the Fourth Step in
terms of Immortal energy. As far as alchemical techniques went, Ning
had spent millions of years by the side of the Paragon of Pills. He
hadn’t advanced too much in sword-arts during that period of time,
and almost all of his spare time had been spent on the [Seven
Leafpill Chapters] and the alchemical techniques included within its
most profound seventh chapter. His alchemical technique was superior
to even Daolord Allgod’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Dao…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He wasn’t exactly
skilled in the Dao of Metal, the Dao of Wind, the Dao of Wood, and
many of the other Daos. However, the fifth stance of the [Brightmoon]
sword-art, the Shadowless sword-intent, required him to be able to
merge himself into all of his surroundings. Thus, when he had been in
the inner reaches of the Genesis Lands of the alternate universe,
Ning had personally visited all of the corpses of the many deceased
Eternal Emperors and had meditated on the auras of their Daos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was very familiar
with the auras of all types of Daos, and he had learned how to merge
himself into them. This was part of the reason why his Shadowless
sword-intent allowed him to merge into all things. Thus, although
Ning wasn’t skilled in the Dao of Metal or the Dao of Wood, he was
at least familiar with them. This familiarity with them, their
strengths, their weaknesses… it was all a prerequisite for Ning to
be able to merge into them and disappear within them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was exactly what
the nine novessence arts required, for the user to be very familiar
with the various elemental properties. One had to follow their flow
and go with the grain in mixing them together like alchemical
ingredients in a pill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On this day, within a
nondescript private room inside the Plumesoar Hall of Skywood City,
one of the eight Sacred Cities of the Dao Alliance, Ji Ning silently
and soundlessly mastered all nine of the novessence arts, arts which
would cause countless Daolords to blaunch with fear!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This was rather
unexpected. Still… since I’ve mastered all nine of the secret
arts…” Ning pondered for a moment. “I might not need to waste
the Hegemon’s Dao-seal after all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right now, those
nine mighty novessence arts are my greatest trump card. I need to
find a way to make them unleash the maximum amount of power
possible,” Ning pondered. The Hegemon’s two Dao-seal were trump
cards that could only be used one time each, while the nine
novessence arts were his own arts that could be used as many times as
he chose. He naturally had to enhance them as much as he could. If he
just used them for their raw power, they would still be quite strong,
yes, but this wasn’t their full potential. If he could use those
nine novessence arts as nine swords and then use his Omega Sword
Dao’s Yin-Yang Sword Domain, the power of the novessence arts would
be vastly greater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Omega Sword Dao’s
Blood Drop sword-intent has made a breakthrough, but the Yin-Yang
sword-intent has not. I hope I will be to make some breakthroughs
soon. That way, my nine novessence arts will be able to unleash even
greater power. Daolord Allgod was a grandmaster in the art of
formations, which was why he was able to use those nine secret arts
to form a terrifying formation to attack his foes. This was what
allowed him to crush Emperor Melobo.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clearly, Ning wished to
upgrade the power of his nine novessence arts as best he could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, I’ve just
finished mastering these nine arts. I need to rest a bit first.”
Whoosh. Ning’s body flickered and emerged from the thatched
cottage. He waved his hand, putting it away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” “Master.”
Pillsaint and Su Youji were seated outside the private room, and they
immediately turned to stare towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” Ning
laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The treasure auction
has already begun. It’s gone on for several days,” Pillsaint
said, then added worriedly, “Master, how do you plan to deal with
Daolord Kongsan?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to worry.”
Ning walked out of the private room, then stared downwards through a
window. A this very moment, a loud and exciting treasure auction was
occurring below them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat down
relaxedly, then picked up a nearby cup of wine. He sipped at it as he
watched the treasure auction.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 35 – An Exchange of Goods
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The treasure auction
was in progress. In order to attract more Daolords, each treasure
auction would have a few incredibly rare and valuable items that
normally would never be sold and would only be traded for similarly
valuable items. During the treasure auctions, however, they could be
purchased for chaos nectar. Only, the price would be incredibly high.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…” Ning
couldn’t help but laugh as he watched. “In the end, there’s a
limit to how useful magic treasures can be.” There were some
unearthly treasures which would allow a Daolord of the First Step to
contend against a Daolord of the Fourth Step, but treasures could
only help up to a certain point. Treasures that could unleash the
power of a Daolord of the Fourth Step were generally worth more than
ten million cubes of chaos nectar, and as their power increased their
cost would skyrocket.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning noticed one
insanely powerful and insanely expensive treasure known as the
‘Kingdom Blade’. This was a formation, and anyone who had this
formation could spread it across a hundred million kilometers with a
single thought. Within the formation, countless streaks of
saber-light would appear, and these attacks were so powerful that
ordinary Daolords of the Fourth Step would be instantly slain by
them. Even Daolords who weren’t killed would still be heavily
constrained! Ning estimated that this formation was definitely on par
with his own novessence thunder attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bidding for this
formation started at the reserve price of eighty million cubes of
chaos nectar, and in the end it was sold for 120 million cubes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Treasures like these
are all external sources of strength.” The nearby Pillsaint nodded
sagely. “Artificing and alchemy all have their limits as well.
Earlier, I saw a treasure in Plumesoar Hall which could unleash the
power of an Eternal Emperor, but treasures like that would never
appear in a treasure auction. Without question, they can only be
traded for.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Treasures
could generally be used multiple times, whereas Dao-seals would be
consumed after a single use as all they did was unleash the power
which had originally been sealed into them. As a result, Dao-seals
were much easier to make than magic treasures. The Sword Hegemon’s
Dao-seals and the almighty Brightshore Hegemon’s spacetime disc
were all single-use items.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A few days later, yet
another incredible treasure appeared within this treasure auction.
Generally speaking, each treasure auction would have ten or so
treasures like this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoists.”
The ancient elder standing before the dais called out in a loud
voice, “This treasure is an important item which was personally
forged by Emperor Milcloth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many Daolords
seated below were all stirred. Even Ning’s eyes lit up as he stared
downwards from his private room. Emperor Milcloth was one of the top
three artificers of the entire Endless Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A palm-sized
black flying vessel suddenly appeared in the air above the elder’s
hands. Although the flying vessel was small, it naturally emanated an
aura of such terrifying keenness that anyone who saw it knew it had
to be incredibly fast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a flying
vessel which is perfectly suited for soaring at high speeds. The
Emperor forged it just a short while ago, and has yet to even choose
a name for it. The person who purchases it shall have the right to
name it.” The elder smiled, but the Daolords didn’t really care
about this. What a treasure’s name was didn’t matter; what really
mattered was the amount of power it could unleash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This magic treasure
can move a hundred times the speed of light,” the elder said
softly, but his quiet words drove the many Daolords below him into a
state of frenzy. “The reserve price is 60 million cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“60 million cubes.”
A deep voice instantly rang out from one of the private rooms up
above.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“65 million cubes.”
One of the Daolords seated in the corner of the main hall below, a
golden-robed man, calmly made his offer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“68 million cubes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was one of the
eight Sacred Cities, after all. It had many Daolords within it.
Evasion-type treasures were extremely valuable to begin with, with
vessels that could move at ten times the speed of light generally
costing more than ten million cubes. Ones which could move at a
hundred times the speed of light could generally only be traded for.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although there were
technically a number of master artificers in the Endless Territories
who were capable of creating evasion-type treasures that could move
at a hundred times the speed of light, the actual creation process
was extremely difficult. Powerful Daolords were extremely interested
in treasures like this, as there were very few who could move at a
hundred times the speed of light. In fact, there weren’t even many
Eternal Emperors who could move at that speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning suddenly
rose to his feet within his private room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master?” Pillsaint
and Youji both looked towards Ning, but Ning walked towards to the
window, then pushed it open. Outside was that female attendant, who
had been awaiting his summons this entire time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” Although
she had been waiting here for months, she immediately addressed him
with respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wish to use a
treasure to trade for that flying vessel which is currently being
auctioned off,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The female attendant
was startled. That was one of the top ten treasures of this treasure
auction! She immediately said, “I’ve already sent your request
forwards. A Daolord will arrive shortly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Just as she
finished saying this, a figure suddenly materialized directly in
front of Ning. It was the silver-robed Daolord who Ning had
interacted with just a few months ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist, you
truly do business on a grand scale.” The silver-robed Daolord
smiled, quite amazed by the white-robed youth in front of him. The
man looked like a Daolord of the Second Step, but he was able to kill
Daolords of the Third Step as easily as crushing an ant. He had
already brought forty million cubes worth of business to Plumesoar
Hall. Now, he was planning to acquire that flying vessel?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come inside and
chat,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait outside,” the
silver-robed Daolord instructed the female attendant, then followed
Ning into the private room and shut the door.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the private
room. The silver-robed Daolord walked to the windows as well. He
glanced downwards, then said merrily, “That flying vessel can move
at a hundred times the limits of the Heavenly Daos. That’s the
maximum speed any flying vessel can obtain, and they are generally
only exchanged for goods of similar value, never sold. When they do
appear during our treasure auctions… the price has already reached
seventy million cubes, but I wager it’ll at least hit ninety
million cubes. Plumesoar Hall will never engage in a losing business
transaction, no matter what.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He also
felt certain that the final price would be at least ninety million
cubes. “I know that Plumesoar Hall has more than a single flying
vessel that can move that fast,” Ning said. “I wish to trade for
one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Trade?” The
silver-robed Daolord’s eyes lit up. He delighted in engaging in
this type of trade. Flying vessels of this quality were generally
only traded for similarly valuable treasures, as only the most
valuable of items could possess such amazing properties.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ordinary treasures
won’t cut it,” the silver-robed Daolord reminded softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take a look for
yourself,” Ning said, then waved his hand, causing a golden pearl
with a flowing surface to appear within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Deluxe hellgold?”
The silver-robed Daolord’s eyes lit up. This was a core for
creating a golem equivalent to a Daolord of the Fourth Step. Items
like this could only be hoped for, not hunted down. “But a single
pearl won’t be enough.” The silver-robed Daolord shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand
again. This time, a small, light green jade bottle appeared within
it. A single blood-red fruit that looked like an actual drop of blood
flew out from the jade bottle and hung there in the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I-is that…” The
silver-robed Daolord’s face began to turn pale as he stared at the
item. A sacred bloodfruit? A skyjewel bloodfruit? This thing was even
rarer than the deluxe hellgold, because sacred bloodfruit trees were
generally controlled by the ancient, truly supreme powers of the
Endless Territories. Even Hegemons would fight over such trees! Thus,
the sacred bloodfruit which came from these trees would generally
fall into the hands of Hegemon-level individuals. Although every
single major organization was willing to spend roughly twenty million
cubes to purchase a single sacred bloodfruit, those ancient powers
who owned them cared little for chaos nectar and would generally only
exchange them for other valuable treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These two treasures
combined are still a bit lacking.” The silver-robed Daolord looked
closely at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A pearl of deluxe
hellgold and a skyjewel bloodfruit, if sold on the treasure auction,
should have a reserve price of at least sixty million cubes of chaos
nectar,” Ning said. “Tell me, what do you think the final price
would be?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-robed
Daolord was startled by the question.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although flying
vessels that can move at a hunndred times the speed of light are
rare, there are a number that are available for sale,” Ning said.
“If you aren’t happy with my offer, I’ll go take it somewhere
else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Y-you are seriously
such a…” The silver-robed Daolord laughed helplessly. The deluxe
hellgold and the skyjewel bloodfruit were indeed quite intriguing,
but a flying vessel that could move at a hundred times the speed of
light was also extremely valuable. The two really were worth roughly
the same.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine. Plumesoar Hall
is willing to enter this deal with you.” The silver-robed Daolord
nodded, then glanced downwards. By now, the bidding war had already
reached a price of 90 million cubes, but the bids were clearly
slowing down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“95 million cubes,”
the silver-robed Daolord called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“95.5 million cubes,”
a different Daolord gritted his teeth and called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“98 million cubes.”
The silver-robed Daolord wasn’t interested in wasting time; he
immediately raised the price once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Su Youji, and
Pillsaint were all a bit surprised. The silver-robed Daolord glanced
at the three of them, then chuckled. “Making bids on our own
treasures is actually quite common. If the real bids on the best
treasures aren’t high enough, we’ll just ‘buy’ some of them
ourselves.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
couldn’t help but let out startled laughs. It seemed as though
Plumesoar Hall really did refuse to lose money on any of these
treasure trades.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, to the
massively powerful organizations within the Dao Alliance like the
Skywood Sect, chaos nectar wasn’t really all that valuable. Deluxe
hellgold, sacred bloodfruit, and other similarly rare cosmic
treasures were much more worthy of collection. Deluxe hellgold wasn’t
that alluring; it was the skyjewel bloodfruit which caused this
silver-robed Daolord to agree to this trade, because the Skywood Sect
just so happened to need it to go with a number of other valuable
ingredients for pill-refining.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, the flying
vessel was ‘won’ at the price of 98 million cubes. The deluxe
hellgold and the skyjewel bloodfruit was given to the silver-robed
Daolord, while the flying vessel entered Ning’s hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you have other
rare items, feel free to bring them to Plumesoar Hall.” The
silver-robed Daolord smiled. “We have many precious treasures,
including even Dao-seals which mighty Eternal Emperors poured all of
their effort into. Those can all be traded for.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not a bad idea.”
Ning smiled, then picked up the flying vessel and nodded mentally to
himself. Just using the nine novessence arts against Daolord Kongsan
probably wouldn’t be enough, as the man was capable of transforming
his body into darkness and making it virtually indestructible. But
now that Ning had this flying vessel, he would definitely be
guaranteed of being able to escape whenever he chose.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the deluxe
hellgold and the skyjewel bloodfruit were important, one was an
artificing ingredient while the other was an alchemical ingredient.
Ning neither understood artificing nor specialized in alchemy. Use
skyjewel bloodfruit in alchemy? Not even Daolord Allgod would
necessarily be qualified to engage in alchemy on such a level.

Chapter 36 – Into Battle
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skywood City. The
fiery-haired, fiery-eyed, black-robed Daolord Kongsan was seated in
the lotus position within the protective formations of Plumesoar
Hall, his eyes closed as he waited quietly. He had been waiting
before the doors for more than two years already. So long as Ji Ning
dared to emerge, he would immediately sense it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is Daolord Kongsan
going to just wait there?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What else can he do?
That white-robed Daolord has been hiding inside Plumesoar Hall this
entire time, refusing to come out. No matter how strong Daolord
Kongsan is, he wouldn’t dare to challenge the Dao Alliance.” The
attendants inside the hall were all gossiping amongst each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If the white-robed
Daolord stays inside Plumesoar Hall for an entire chaos cycle, will
Daolord Kongsan wait here for an entire chaos cycle?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hard to say!
However, the white-robed Daolord seems to be just a Daolord of the
Second Step. This is a critical period of time for him as a
cultivator. There’s no way he’s going to just hide in there
forever, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It might slow down
his cultivation, but at least he’ll stay alive if he continues to
hide in there! If he leaves, he’s dead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all continuously
whispered amongst each other about this. These attendants were all
World-level figures, and they were quite interested in the grudges
which elite Daolords held against each other. Whenever such elite
Daolords battled against each other, news of it would quickly spread
far and wide. The stories of how Daolord Allgod hunted Emperor Melobo
were passed down for countless generations. Although the affair
between Ning and Daolord Kongsan wouldn’t be talked about for
nearly that long, it would still be the talk of the town for a brief
period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On one side was a
monstrously strong Daolord, Daolord Kongsan. On the other side was a
mere Daolord of the Second Step who was so talented he had easily
slain a Daolord of the Third Step; his true power was most likely
that of a Verge-level Daolord as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both were at a high
level of power, which naturally made for a good story.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Am I seeing things?’
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The attendants of
Plumesoar Hall all stared in astonishment at the white-robed figure
who had just emerged from the inner hallways, carrying a black sword
scabbard on his back. That face… those clothes… that aura… it
was the person they were talking about, the mysterious white-robed
Daolord!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually came
out? He actually dared to come out?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is he suicidal?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no way
he’s coming out to die. He has to have something up his sleeve.”
These attendants all watched curiously, alongside a good number of
guests. Most of the guests were Daolords, and a few were even
Daolords of the Fourth Step. However, none of them dared to get
involved in a matter like this. Daolord Kongsan had been waiting here
for more than two years already! This alone testified as to how badly
he wished to kill the white-robed Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced at the
attendants and Daolords, chuckled, then flew towards the entrance of
Plumesoar Hall. As soon as he stepped outside, he saw the black-robed
Daolord Kongsan seated in the lotus position by the doorway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Kongsan, you
certainly are quite a patient man,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Kongsan opened
his eyes. The sharpness of his fiery eyes would cause ordinary
Daolords to feel a sense of oppression in their hearts. He cracked
his lips into a cold, strange smile. “I thought you would hide
inside for a few chaos cycles, kid. I didn’t expect you to come out
so soon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I stayed inside
for several chaos cycles, would you really have waited here the
entire time?” Ning was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m a very patient
man,” Daolord Kongsan said calmly. “To me, time doesn’t really
matter. When my life is about to end, I shall go and prepare for my
Daomerge.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You sound as though
you really have nothing interesting in your life.” Ning shook his
head. Wait here for several chaos cycles? How long had Ning been
cultivating for?! Daolord Kongsan might be patient enough to wait
htat long, but Ning himself definitely was not.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The attendants and
guests within Plumesoar Hall all watched curiously as the two figures
outside chatted with each other. One was dressed in beautiful black
robes, the other was dressed in white clothes. One had a dominating
and rather evil aura, while the other looked unassuming and reserved
but was clearly a freakishly talented Daolord who had simply hidden
away his sharpness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The white-robed
Daolord doesn’t look scared at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Their words are tit
for tat against each other.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The customers all
listened quietly, and many of them couldn’t help but feel
admiration for the weaker white-robed Daolord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing interesting
in my life? You don’t understand. Waiting is a way to temper one’s
Dao-heart, and as such is a form of cultivation.” Daolord Kongsan
wasn’t the slightest bit irritated, and his eyes remained as cold
as ice. “What, are you going to stay within the protective barriers
this entire time?” Both of them were inside the barriers of
Plumesoar Hall, and combat was forbidden here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not as bored
as you. I wouldn’t waste time coming out here just to tease you a
bit.” Ning shook his head. “I’m going to be leaving now. Follow
me if you can.” Swoosh. Ning transformed into a streak of light,
instantly flying outside the protective barrier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Daolord
Kongsan’s aura expanded dramatically as he instantly disappeared
into a cloud of black mist which surge out of the barrier formation
and swept towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, in midair,
glanced backwards at the mist. The mist was a roiling mass of
darkness that was rolling straight towards him. Just looking at the
mist alone caused Ning to feel a powerful sense of danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It isn’t the right
time to fight you just yet,” Ning mused to himself. With a wave of
his hand, Ning caused a black flying vessel to appear next to him.
This vessel was shaped like the tip of a sword, and it emanated an
aura of incredible keenness. Whoosh! Ning entered the vessel. “Let’s
go.” Now that Ning was in control of the flying vessel, it suddenly
exploded with speed and went from zero to a hundred times the speed
of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” A human
face immediately appeared within the roiling black mist behind Ning,
and it stared straight at the vessel. “He actually has a flying
vessel that can move at a hundred times the speed of light?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hundred times faster
than the limits of the Heavenly Daos. What did speed like this mean?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even Dao lightning
‘only’ moved at this speed! This was a level of speed which
Samsara Daolords generally were unable to aspire to. There were many
freakishly talented Daolords who weren’t even close to being this
fast, even when they reached the Verge. Kongsan himself, for example,
could only move at thirty-six times the speed of light! Palace Lord
Dawnstar had reached incredible heights in the dao of the Saber, but
if he merely relied on his Dao to travel even he would only be able
to move at fifty times the speed of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even those who were
skilled in speed-oriented Daos such as the Dao of Lightning, the Dao
of Wind, or the Dao of Light were rarely able to reach a hundred
times the speed of light. To exceed that level of speed? You had to
reach an absolutely unimaginable level of insight into a speed if you
wished to do so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For flying treasures,
vessels like the one which Ning had purchased represented the apex of
speed possible for treasures! Flying treasures could at most move at
a hundred times the speed of light. If you wanted to go faster than
that, you’d have to focus on your own trainng and cultivation. The
vast majority of Eternal Emperors weren’t able to move that fast!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A hundred times the
speed of light?” Daolord Kongsan was truly stunned, but moments
later his murderous intent began to boil once more. “Excellent. It
seems this kid has many treasures on him, far more than most Daolords
of the Fourth Step.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be remembered
that Daolord Kongsan had sixteen verified kills of Daolords of the
Fourth Step. He loved to kill others and seize their treasures. “No
wonder he dared to come out. Unfortunately… he’s still too
young.” Daolord Kongsan smirked. “Activate!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was controlling
his flying vessel to advance at high speed. He flew out of Skywood
City in the blink of an eye, but suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Activate.” A cold
voice echoed for countless kilometers around him. Rumble… the
formation-bases which had been hidden throughout this area suddenly
showed themselves, emanating pillars of light that towered to the
heavens. An enormous amount of power began to gather, and this area
quickly became a completely sealed region that was separated from the
outside world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning’s
face paled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…” The
black mist once more reformed into the black-robed Daolord Kongsan.
He said with a cold laugh, “Kid, did you really think you were a
match for me? I knew that you would only leave once you were fully
prepared… but did you really think that you were the only one who
could make preparations? I’ve already set up four rings of
formations in the area outside of Skywood City. No matter which way
you fled, you’d still end up inside one of them. Space has been
completely locked within this formation; no matter how fast you are,
you won’t be able to escape. The only path still open to you… is
the path to hell!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there within
his flying vessel. He stared at the distant Daolord Kongsan, then let
out a chuckle. “Daolord Kongsan, I didn’t expect that you would
surreptitiously set up four sealing formations while keeping watch on
the gate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I had thought that
you would arrange for attendants of Plumesoar Hall to keep an eye on
me, which was why I stayed at the gates.” Daolord Kongsan shook his
head. “While keeping them distracted, I ordered my eldest disciple
to quietly set up these formations. Now, it seems, the subterfuge was
unnecessary. I overestimated you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You certainly went
to a great deal of trouble.” Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m impressed at
how calm you are, given your situation.” Daolord Kongsan laughed
coldly. “Prepare to die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! He shot through
the air at high speeds, his robes fluttering with an aura of dark
mist that made him move incredibly fast, but no matter how fast he
was he still couldn’t move as quickly as Ning did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! The black
vessel easily and quickly pulled away from him, and Ning’s voice
rang out once more. “Daolord Kongsan, even though we are both
inside this formation, you won’t be able to catch up to me or do
anything to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that so?”
Daolord Kongsan suddenly barked, “Disciple, come out!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A figure
suddenly emerged on the other end of the sealing formation, passing
through it and appearing within the sealed region. This was a female
green-robed alien Outsider, and the area around her was flooded with
green mist that caused space itself to hiss and crackle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciple, stand
guard on the other side while I chase him down from this side. We’ll
catch him and kill him.” Daolord Kongsan said these words aloud,
not worried that Ning might overhear them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.” The
green-robed woman immediately assented to his orders.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 37 – Captured
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Trapping me between
the two of you?” Ji Ning glanced at the two sides. No matter which
way he flew, either Daolord Kongsan or his eldest disciple would be
able to move closer to him. His free space would slowly lessen no
matter what.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, my dear Daolord
Kongsan… your eldest disciple is quite formidable, and if I hadn’t
mastered the nine novessence arts I wouldn’t be able to do anything
to her… but now?” A cold light flashed through Ning’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The green mist
twisting around the green-robed woman began to spread out as a number
of long ropes began to reach out in every direction, with her at the
very center. Every single rope-type magic treasure was able to
stretch out a hundred million kilometers, and she was charging
straight towards Ning. Clearly, she wanted to use these ropes to
further lower Ning’s area of free mobility. As for Daolord Kongsan,
he transformed into that endless black mist that billowed straight
towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Kongsan, do
you really think your eldest disciple will be able to capture me?”
Ning’s voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if she can’t,
she can at least tie you down,” Daolord Kongsan replied coldly.
“There’s nowhere for you to run. No matter where you go, you will
die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The green-robed woman
was quite strong, fairly close to Patriarch Clearwind in power when
he wasn’t using his killer attack. As Daolord Kongsan saw it, no
matter how freakishly talented this Daolord of the Second Step was,
even if she failed in capturing him she would still be able to slow
him down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that so?” Ning
smiled coldly. Swoosh! His black vessel began to flee at high speeds,
and perhaps by accident it moved closer and closer towards the
green-robed woman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Kongsan wasn’t
surprised in the slightest. In the end, Ning had to choose a
direction, and Kongsan’s eldest disciple was naturally a bit weaker
than Kongsan himself. It made sense for Ning to move in her
direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciple, kill him
if you can. If you can’t, slow him down. Once I arrive, I’ll
crush him to death,” Daolord Kongsan sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I definitely won’t
disappoint you, Master,” the green-robed woman replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The green-robed woman
was moving closer and closer to Ning. Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Her
magic ropes stretched out through the skies like giant pythons which
coiled and lashed out against Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahah!” Ning
stood there at the prow of his black vessel, his two hands gripped
around a single sword. He struck out, sending a dazzling streak of
sword-light out ten million kilometers and striking against one of
the ropes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Kongsan was
skilled in close combat, and for now Ning wasn’t confident in
fighting him up close. But this eldest disciple? She was the perfect
match for Ning. In the end, his close combat skills had the greatest
latent potential for further development. His nine novessence arts
were more powerful, true, but they had already reached the level of
complete mastery. In the future, he would only be able to strengthen
it by making it fit into his sword-arts, but there was a limit to how
much stronger they would grow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This kid…”
Daolord Kongsan couldn’t help but feel shocked by what he was
seeing from afr. “What incredible sword-arts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the
green-robed woman had moved closer and closer to each other, and the
two had entered close combat. The green-robed woman actually reduced
the range of each rope to be merely a million kilometers, causing
them to grow noticeably more powerful. When the ropes were too long,
they would naturally become harder to control and thus would be
weakened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning brought out all
six of his swords, fighting to his heart’s content and actually
holding the upper hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s actually
slightly more powerful than my disciple?” Daolord Kongsan’s face
tightened slightly as he picked up the pace. “Keep him tied down,
disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
Master. The kid has extremely profound sword-arts, but he’s on par
with me at most.” The green-robed woman didn’t want to admit
defeat in the face of a Daolord of the Second Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time slowly trickled
on. The green-robed woman’s techniques were softer and more
insidious, and a battle on this level gave Ning a few deeper-level
insights into his own Dao of the Sword. Life-and-death battles,
especially ones against different types of opponents, were of great
benefit to him training in the Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm?” Ning glanced
backwards, only to see that the fast-moving black mist was about to
reach him. “A pity.” Ning turned to look back at the green-robed
woman, then laughed, “I wanted to tussle with you for a bit longer,
but your Master has arrived.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A pity indeed.”
The green-robed woman spoke out as well. “You are a freakishly
talented Daolord who should’ve been able to rise to the heavens and
stun the Endless Territories… but today, you shall die and your Dao
shall vanish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head.
Suddenly… boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! ……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One surge of incredible
power after another began to blast out from the area around Ning,
each contained unbelievable amounts of force. Generally speaking,
Daolords of the Fourth Step would immediately die if touched by a
single one of these streaks of power, and there were nine of them
roaming around in the skies. Moments later, they swiftly began to
twine around each other, transforming into two dazzling streaks of
sword-light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The novessence fire,
novessence water, and rest of the Five Elements techniques all joined
together under the leadership of the novessence water. Water
supported all things without complaint, and was able to tolerate
everything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The novessence thunder,
novessence wind, novessence light, and novessence void were led by
the novessence void. The novessence void technique was the most
powerful of the nine novessence arts, and it was actually capable of
commanding all eight of the other arts. For it to merely command
three was simplicity itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two groups
transformed into two enormous streaks of sword-light, which then gave
birth to the Yin-Yang Sword Domain of Ning’s Omega Sword Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What the hell is
that?!” Daolord Kongsan was still trying to catch up, but his face
instantly tightened when he saw this. He could tell that this was a
technique of incredible power, but for a brief moment he wasn’t
able to recognize it. The Endless Territories held far too many
secret arts, and in the past he had never battled against experts who
had mastered the nine novessence arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“B-but…” The
green-robed woman’s face turned completely ashen as she called out,
“Master, save me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He won’t make it.”
Ning glanced at the green-robed woman. Whoosh! The two enormous
streaks of sword-light formed into an awesome, enormous vortex that
instantly encompassed and surrounded the green-robed woman. She
frantically tried to use her ropes to defend against them, but the
power of the nine novessence arts when applied through the Yin-Yang
Sword Domain of Ning’s Omega Sword Dao was simply too powerful.
There was no way she could possibly endure such an attack, and her
magic treasures were knocked flying away like duckweed in a raging
river.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the green-robed
woman, she frantically tried to use other spells or magic treasures
to buy herself some time, but alas they were all knocked flying away.
In the blink of an eye, the enormous whirlpool had ground its way to
her body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“NO!!!!” The
green-robed woman let out a resentful howl. She truly couldn’t
accept this outcome. Her master was an extremely selfish and vicious
man, but for the sake of growing and improving herself she had still
chosen to become apprenticed to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, she was a Daolord
of the Fourth Step. She was planning on helping her race survive and
flourish. She couldn’t die. She couldn’t die!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! She had tried
everything she had, but there was nothing she could do in the face of
this overwhelming disparity in power. Her skills were stronger than
those of ordinary Daolords of the Fourth Step, but there was no way
she could possibly endure Ning’s killer strike. Her body was
instantly disintegrated, and as she died a hint of agony and despair
flashed through her eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Moments
later, she was stunned… because part of her body was actually left
undamaged. Although the terrifying vortex of sword-intent surrounded
her, it no longer pressed the attack. If it did, she would be totally
destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and get in
here. Otherwise, I’ll take your life.” Ning tossed out a gourd
which instantly flew to the green-robed woman’s side and sent out a
surge of overwhelming strong sucking power towards her. What remained
of the green-robed woman’s body didn’t dare to resist, and it
allowed Ning to suck her into the gourd. If Ning was going to capture
her, at least she wouldn’t die right away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
causing the gourd to return to him. He then turned to look at the
attacking Daolord Kongsan. “Daolord Kongsan, your eldest disciple
is now in my hands,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” Daolord
Kongsan had an ugly look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Withdraw immediately
and I’ll spare her life,” Ning barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Withdraw?” The
baleful look in Daolord Kongsan’s eyes only grew stronger. “No
one can threaten me. She’s just one disciple. Today, I shall take
your life no matter what.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing this, Ning just
shook his head. What a madman. The information which the Skywood Sect
had given him was quite accurate; Daolord Kongsan was an exceedingly
selfish man who didn’t really care about his disciples, only
himself. The reason he had chosen to kill Ning was not because he
cared about his disciple or felt sorry for him, but because he felt
as though his personal dignity had been affronted by his disciple’s
death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If that’s the
case, let’s fight.” A fierce light flashed through Ning’s eyes.
“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble… those nine
novessence arts once more formed into those two enormous streaks of
sword-light, and they illuminated each other as they intertwined and
lashed out through the skies towards the distant Daolord Kongsan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attacks on this
level are useless against me.” Daolord Kongsan was filled with a
desire to kill, and he revealed his true form as the black mist
roiled around him. He stretched out with his right hand, producing an
enormous, pitch-black scimitar within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous scimitar
swept out, carrying a hint of black light on its edge. Space itself
parted in a natural way in front of that edge, but not a single iota
of his power leaked out. It was like space was nothing more than
butter, with his knife cutting neatly through it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The scimitar chopped
out towards those nine rampaging novessence arts as the two began
their midair clash.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 38 – A Furious Fight
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a terrifying
scimitar.” Ji Ning could sense that the flows of his nine
novessence arts were being parted as though they had been split in
half. “But my secret arts were formless to begin with!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you cut a stream of
water with a knife, the water would continue to flow. Ning’s nine
novessence arts of lightning, wind, fire, void, and everything else
were all types of formless energy that could assume whatever shape he
chose.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the face of that
terrifying scimitar, the rampaging flood of the novessence arts was
instantly split in half. Despite that, the power of the secret arts
didn’t lessen at all, and two dragon-like streams of sword-light
continued onwards towards Daolord Kongsan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” Daolord
Kongsan’s face paled, and the black mist around him instantly
became far denser and thicker than before. Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
The sword-light formed by the novessence arts were able to transform
into many forms. They instantly transformed into eighteen different
streams of sword-light, each of which was violent beyond care. Filled
with the sword-intent of the Omega Sword Dao’s Blood Drop stance,
they forcibly pierced through the black mist!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Ning’s nine
novessence arts were far stronger than Daolord Kongsan’s
darkness-based secret arts, and so penetrating them was very simple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heavenbreaker!” As
soon as those eighteen streams of sword-light pierced through the
black mist, they suddenly transformed. They became like eighteen
whips of flowing water that furiously lashed out, striking Daolord
Kongsan on his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since Ning had
come up with his Omega Sword Dao, he had been able to perfectly join
together all different types of sword-arts and Sword Daos. This was
why his attacks could seem incredibly soft and yet unleash a
dominating display of sword-intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
These eighteen streaks of sword-light contained both the
criss-crossing power of the Yin-Yang stance as well as the ferocity
of the Heavenbreaker stance. Daolord Kongsan was forced to instantly
transform his body into darkness itself. The sword-light roamed
through the darkness unimpeded, causing his form to shudder a few
times, but he was able to easily endure the strike.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What formidable
secret arts. Your sword-intent roams everywhere, letting no opening
go untouched.” Daolord Kongsan’s face suddenly appeared from that
pool of darkness, and he had a cold smile on his face as he spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It does indeed leave
no opening untouched,” the distant Ning said. “My secret arts are
formless like water; of course they flow over and into everything.
But precisely because of that, they aren’t particularly powerful
when I use them to display these sword-arts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You could use a stream
of water to stab or to whip someone, but there was no way it would
ever hit as hard as an actual weapon meant for those purposes.
Weapons were both tougher and sharper.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Omega Sword Dao,
Yin-Yang.” Ning’s gaze turned cold. Rumble… instantly, the
energy of the nine novessence arts began to crush and grind down upon
everything within a hundred million kilometers. Yin and Yang
criss-crossed with each other, grinding away at each other and
everything between them. Even though Daolord Kongsan had transformed
into darkness incarnate, he could still sense how terrifying this
Yin-Yang Sword Domain was, and it was suppressing and restraining him
from every possible angle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” Daolord
Kongsan felt as though he had been trapped in quicksand. Ning’s
secret arts were simply too strong, and they were omnipresent; there
was no way Daolord Kongsan could completely block them. Or at least,
there was no way he could use his secret arts or magic treasures to
block them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I had thought that
by using my nine novessence arts, I would be able to cause him
serious injury even though I probably wouldn’t be able to kill him.
Daolord Kongsan truly does have a virtually indestructible body.
There’s no way to injure him at all.” Ning couldn’t help but
sigh. He had already unleashed his most powerful attacks, but all he
was able to do was to suppress this foe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, Ning simply
was at too low a level. His Omega Sword Dao might be formidable, but
he was still just a Daolord of the First Step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Allgod was a
grandmaster of formations and had reached a much higher level than
Ning was currently at. When he used those nine same arts alongside
his formations, his power was much greater than Ning’s was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While Ning was sighing
to himself, he had no idea just how stunned and furious Daolord
Kongsan was. Daolord Kongsan was a venerable Verge-level Daolord who
had roamed the Endless Territories for many years… but today, he
was actually being beaten down by a Daolord of the Second Step?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“GRAAH!” The
endless darkness suddenly released a low, furious growl. Instantly,
the darkness quickly began to solidify into a black silhouette that
had a noticeably more powerful aura than before, and which was
wielding an enormous scimitar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kid, you should feel
proud that you’ve forced me to use my supreme attack. Now die!”
The blurry black silhouette instantly charged towards Ning as he
furiously chopped towards Ning with that enormous scimitar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This chop caused
spacetime to freeze. It was filled with a towering killing intent
that struck out from incredibly far away, slamming directly through
Ning’s body as it struck against his soul. Ning was still standing
at the prow of his distant black vessel, but he could still clearly
sense a soul attack of immense power striking at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph!” Within
Ning’s sea of consciousness, his soul let out a furious snort. The
murderous intent slammed towards Ning’s soul like a wave, but
Ning’s soul was completely unmoved. It was comparable to the soul
of a Daolord of the Fourth Step, after all, and his heartforce was at
the point where he could break through to the sixth stage of
heartforce at any moment. Once he did, he would be a true Heartforce
Cultivator! Less than 1% of Daolords were Heartforce Cultivators, and
so this enormous advantage in terms of heartforce made Ning’s
mental and soul defenses incredibly strong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, Ning had
already read an intelligence report stating that Daolord Kongsan had
a soul attack, but the attack was only able to confuse and disrupt;
it wasn’t all that powerful. In the end, Daolord Kongsan was most
skilled in close combat!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?!” The distant
Daolord Kongsan looked at Ning both angrily and expectantly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Kongsan, did
you really think you would be able to shake my soul with an attack on
this level?” Ning laughed coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Kongsan was
shocked. It was true that soul attacks weren’t his forte, but the
soul attack wasn’t a weak one either. Daolord Kongsan felt certain
that this mere Daolord of the Second Step had to have a fairly weak
soul, even if he did have a fairly high level of insight into the
Dao. Logically speaking, the soul should’ve been an enormous weak
point. Even Daolords of the Fourth Step would’ve been confused and
impacted by his soul attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You aren’t bad at
all, kid. But if you are really so tough, stop running and fight me
in close combat!” Daolord Kongsan bellowed angrily as he flew
towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, I’m just a
Daolord of the Second Step! You want me to fight in you in close
combat? Do you have any sense of shame? If I broke through to become
a Daolord of the Third Step, I’d be more than happy to fight you in
close combat.” Riding his black vessel, Ning was able to easily
pull away from Daolord Kongsan once more. He also continued to use
his nine novessence arts to either slow down or attack Daolord
Kongsan repeatedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Kongsan was
getting angrier and angrier as this ‘fight’ continued. Ning
continued to flee, and he continued to chase. Ning had it quite easy
in this battle, as he continued to attack while fleeing thanks to his
overwhelming advantage in speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If this continues…
I really won’t be able to do anything to this kid at all.”
Daolord Kongsan shook his head. “If memory serves, the secret arts
this kids is using should be the nine novessence arts of the
legendary Daolord Allgod.” The reason why hadn’t recognized the
technique earlier was because he had never personally battled it
before, but he had read the description of the techniques within the
Spellworld. After having battled against Ning for so long, he had
some insights into what it was that he was up against.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really wonder how
a Daolord of the Second Step like him was able to master such
terrifying secret arts,” Daolord Kongsan mused. “I heard that in
order to master those nine novessence arts, you not only need to have
certain insights into the likes of lightning, wind, and fire, you
also have to be a grandmaster alchemist; if your alchemy skills are
even the slightest bit deficient, you will never be able to master
the nine novessence arts. Is this Daolord of the Second Step a
grandmaster alchemist?!” Even Kongsan was secretly speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If he is… there’s
no way he could’ve learned alchemy by himself. He either won an
incredibly powerful legacy or has an incredibly powerful teacher
behind him.” After having battled for so long, Daolord Kongsan was
starting to grow wary of Ning. This person definitely wouldn’t be
as easy to deal with as the other Daolords of the Fourth Step he had
slain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Screw it. I’ll
capture him alive first! If he really does have a powerful figure
behind him… hmph. I’m a core member of the Dao Alliance. Very few
people are qualified to threaten me. When the time comes, I’ll chat
with him a bit. I can force the kid to swear a few lifeblood oaths,
then let him go.” Daolord Kongsan mused to himself, “But if he
doesn’t have any powerful figures behind him, I can do whatever I
want to him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Daolord Kongsan
sent his will outside the grand sealing formation and towards one of
the hundred thousand estates located at the margins of Skywood City.
Aside from Kongsan, there were a few other incredibly powerful and
ancient Daolords who lived in seclusion in those estates.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother Shaka.”
Daolord Kongsan instantly sent mentally, “I’m embarrassed to say
this, but it seems I’ll need to ask you to help me out and capture
the kid.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the estate. A
handsome man with long golden hair and a golden suit of armor was
seated in the lotus position inside a courtyard, staring at the
heavens. He looked like an ordinary cultivator, but in truth he was a
terrifyingly strong Aberrant. Amongst the ancient figures who lived
in seclusion in Skywood City, he was reputedly the fastest of them
all. The Dao Alliance was an extremely welcoming and open
organization, allowing members of the Brightshore Kingdom, the
Aberrants, and even the Ancient cultivators to live within their
cities. Only their mortal enemies, the Aeonians, were refused entry
by the Dao Alliance. And of course, the Dark Kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kongsan, he seems to
just be a Daolord of the Second Step. You really can’t catch him
yourself?” A gleam of purple light flashed through Daolord Shaka’s
eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really cannot.
This kid has way too many tricks up his sleeve, which is why I’ve
come to ask you for help, big brother Shaka.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 39 – Summoning Friends
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Describe all of his
abilities to me in detail,” Daolord Shaka said. He wouldn’t agree
to a request like this lightly; he had to first see what sort of
abilities this Daolord of the Second Step possessed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll narrate to
them to you.” Since Daolord Kongsan was asking this man to help
out, it wasn’t appropriate for him to hold anything back. He gave a
quick explanation, then continued, “Don’t worry, big brother
Shaka. I also have the feeling that he probably has a significant
background, given how talented he is. To be safe, we should first
capture him and then see if anyone comes to save him. If an Emperor
comes for him, we’ll ransom him for a pretty price. If no one comes
from him, we’ll just kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Shaka nodded.
“Alright.” Neither of the two were the cowardly, trouble-fearing
type. Kongsan was a core member of the Dao Alliance, while Daolord
Shaka was a high-level member of the Aberrants. The kid might have
powerful backers, but so did they. The only reason they were planning
to capture Ning first was to avoid causing unnecessary trouble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll agree to help
you here,” Daolord Shaka said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, big
brother Shaka.” Daolord Kongsan was delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Daolord Shaka
instantly transformed into a streak of light that disappeared into
the skies as it hastened towards the grand sealing formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the sealing
formation. Daolord Kongsan continued to chase after the fleeing Ji
Ning as the two continuously exchanged attacks against each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He can’t do
anything to me.” Ning was extremely clear-headed despite the
battle’s progression. “Daolord Kongsan himself knows this quite
well. He won’t just let things drag out like this; he must be
coming up with a plan! But it won’t matter what he has up his
sleeve; I won’t let him do as he wishes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning
immediately sent a mental message, “Send word to the Brightshore
Kingdom right away that I am in a grand sealing formation outside
Skywood City and am being pursued and attacked by Daolord Kongsan. I
would like to ask the fellow Daoists of the Brightshore Kingdom to
help out. The duration of this request is a single day.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.” The
alien World-level retainer who had with Ning this entire time
immediately acknowledged the order. This retainer had another clone
in the Brightshore Kingdom, and so was able to make the report almost
immediately. Moments later, the Brightshore Kingdom sent word to
every single Daolord and Emperor within its ranks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, in recent
years Ning had received quite a few distress calls as well, but they
were all too far away from him. This time, for example, Ning himself
had said that the duration of his request was a single day! If others
couldn’t make it here within a single day, there was no point to
them even coming. If they were too far away, they would only find at
the end of their long journey that the matter had come to an end long
ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But asking for the
Brightshore Kingdom to help out is just a precaution,” Ning mused.
“In the end, it doesn’t have that many Daolords. The number of
Daolords it has who can deal with Kongsan are even fewer. Although
this is one of the eight Sacred Cities and there should be quite a
few members of the Brightshore Kingdom here, it’s hard to say if
there are any who can match Kongsan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I suppose I’ll
have to wait and see. If there’s nothing I can do, I’ll use up
the Hegemon’s Dao-seal,” Ning mused. You always had to have a
backup plan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao of the Sword
was an offensive Dao, and so the Sword Hegemon’s Dao-seal possessed
terrifying offensive power. Even Eternal Emperors would deeply desire
an item of such incredible value. However, the path of cultivation
was a long one, and this affair with Daolord Kongsan might be nothing
more than a minor bump in this long road. Ning wasn’t willing to
use up his Dao-seal unless absolutely necessary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course… if it
WAS absolutely necessary, then he would simply use it! Once he used
it up, he would win all of the treasures which Daolord Kongsan
possessed. However, in Ning’s eyes not even all of the combined
treasures Daolord Kongsan possessed were as important as his
Hegemon’s Dao-seal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha!” Daolord
Kongsan suddenly began to laugh. “Let’s see how much longer you
can keep fleeing, kid.” Ning’s face tightened. Daolord Kongsan
suddenly pointed off into the distance. Instantly, a golden figure
flew through the distant barrier, followed by the barrier once more
being sealed shut.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden figure was
that of a handsome, golden-haired man dressed in golden armor. He
glanced at Ning curiously, then slowly shook his head and said, “Kid,
it’s quite rare and impressive for a Daolord of the Second Step to
be as strong as you are. What a true pity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please help me, big
brother Shaka, in capturing him,” Daolord Kongsan said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shaka?” Ning’s
face turned pale. “Daolord Shaka of the Aberrants?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Shaka was an
incredibly famous Daolord of the Aberrants, and that fame came from
his incredible speed. He was one of those figures who could go more
than a hundred times faster than the speed of light! In speed alone,
he was superior to the vast majority of Eternal Emperors. And, as an
Aberrant, he was incredibly fast and powerful in close combat as
well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems I’ll have
to use the Hegemon’s Dao-seal after all.” A sharp light flashed
through Ning’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kid, I recommend you
give up,” Daolord Shaka said calmly. He had absolute faith in his
overwhelming speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kongsan! Stay your
hand!” A cold shout rang out from afar, going through the barrier
and reverberating within the world inside it. The people outside the
formation were unable to see what was going on inside, but those
inside it were able to see and hear what was happening outside with
perfect clarity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Daolord
Kongsan and Daolord Shaka both looked outside, as did Ning. Two
figures had appeared outside the formation. One was a skinny,
white-haired, middle-aged man. The other was a muscular man with a
giant greataxe on his back who had a single horn in the middle of his
head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kongsan, stay your
hand. Release Darknorth!” The skinny, white-haired man said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Soleman?
Daolord Skyaxe?” Daolord Kongsan’s face tightened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Palace Lord
Soleman?” Within the formation, Ning revealed a look of delight as
well. Lord Soleman was the Vice Palace Lord of the Heartforce Palace!
Other Daolords of the Fourth Step might be strong or weak, but every
single one who was also a Heartforce Power possessed terrifying
power. Daolord Soleman, as the Vice Palace Lord of the Heartforce
Palace of the Brightshore Kingdom, was also an incredibly powerful
figure whose name alone was enough to terrify countless cultivators.
Heartforce Cultivator Daolords simply possessed far too many strange
ways to kill people. Sometimes, a single glance from them was enough
to slay.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Daolord Skyaxe,
he wasn’t a member of the Brightshore Kingdom; he was probably just
accompanying Daolord Soleman and so came over as well. However,
Daolord Skyaxe was one of the most freakishly powerful of Daolords
who had most likely devised and joined together multiple different
Supreme Daos. He was ranked as the number five Daolord of this era in
the Endless Territories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth? The kid
over here?” Daolord Kongsan laughed coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Release him,”
Daolord Soleman barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Soleman, if I
release him just because you told me to, I would have no face left,”
Daolord Shaka said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Soleman,
Daolord Skyaxe, next to me is big brother Shaka,” Daolord Kongsan
said. Soleman and Skyaxe were outside the formation and so weren’t
able to see anything inside of it at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although there was a
ranking of power in the Endless Territories, ranks didn’t count for
everything. For example, an incredibly powerful Daolord’s abilities
might be perfectly countered by a lower-ranked Daolord’s abilities!
Palace Lord Dawnstar might be in trouble if he encountered an
ancient, incredibly powerful Eternal Emperor, but someone like
Daolord Shaka would be able to escape thanks to his incredible speed.
Everyone had their own strengths and weaknesses; those who stood at
the very top ranks amongst Daolords all had their own pride and
rarely submitted to others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Kongsan encountered
Soleman and Skyaxe by himself… he was strong enough to stay alive,
but he’d still feel trepidation. Now that Daolord Shaka, a Daolord
even more powerful than himself, was by his side… he felt much more
confidence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Soleman, Skyaxe, the
two of you don’t have the right or the power to demand me to
release this kid,” Daolord Shaka said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!” Daolord
Soleman was instantly enraged. “Break this formation apart!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The nearby
Daolord Skyaxe was enraged as well. He immediately attacked, and when
he did the world itself seemed to tremble, and even Skywood City
itself seemed to turn dim. Endless yellow illusions filled the vast
area surrounding Skywood City. Moments later, a terrifying greataxe
struck out from within the yellow illusions and chopped downwards
towards the grand sealing formation. In terms of using raw power to
break apart formations, Daolord Soleman clearly wasn’t as strong as
Daolord Skyaxe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?
What’s with this terrifying aura?” Quite a few cultivators within
Skywood City were surprised by the commotion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The grand sealing
formation shook a few times and a few ripples appeared on the surface
of the barrier, but it managed to endure the blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha! Daolord
Skyaxe, if I was forced to fight you in combat I would have no choice
but to turn tail and flee. It would be a joke, however, if you could
overwhelm me even through these formations I’ve set down.”
Daolord Kongsan’s voice echoed from within the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” Daolord
Skyaxe was infuriated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They won’t be able
to help you.” Daolord Kongsan turned his head to stare at Ning,
still aboard his black vessel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you aren’t
willing to just surrender… then we’ll be forced to simply capture
you alive. Let’s see what Soleman and Skyaxe can do about it. Last
time we met in the Terror Starsea, he caused me to lose face. Does he
really think I’ll just give way to him this time?” Daolord Shaka
snickered, then transformed into a streak of light that instantly
moved more than a hundred times the speed of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aboard the black
vessel, Ning let out a long sigh. “It seems I’ll have to use the
Hegemon’s Dao-seal after all.” Murder flickered in Ning’s eyes.

Chapter 40 – Hegemon’s Dao-Seal
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the grand
sealing formation. Soleman and Skyaxe were both furious but helpless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the grand
sealing formation. Daolord Kongsan was smirking from afar. It looked
as though things had been settled! Daolord Shaka had transformed into
a dazzling, breathtakingly eye-catching streak of golden light as he
charged towards Ning. He truly was moving extremely fast, but Ji Ning
was able to see him moving with perfect clarity. There was a
sensation of time itself being distorted, which caused Ning to feel
rather uncomfortable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
calmly fly forwards on his black vessel, and a dark blue crystalline
leaf suddenly appeared in his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack! A seemingly
simple action, the crushing of a leaf… but the terrifying,
overwhelming amount of power hidden within that leaf-shaped Dao-seal
was finally unleashed! The deceased Sword Hegemon had paid an
enormous price to create this terrifying Dao-seal before his death,
and the power within it was truly inconceivable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What terrifying
power. So this… this is is the might of a Hegemon.” When Ning
crushed the seal, he instantly sensed a surge of unfathomable power
flood through him and come under his control.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was the guide, the
conduit for this power. He had the right to tell it where to strike,
and that was where it would strike. He could also allow the power to
voluntarily disperse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go, then. Kill
them.” Ning turned his gaze to Daolord Shaka, soaring towards him
like a streak of golden light, as well as the distant Daolord
Kongsan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! An awesome
display of power burst forth. It was like the darkness before the
dawn was suddenly split by the first rays of the sun which cast its
radiance over the land. The streak of sunlight shone down upon the
hearts of both Daolord Shaka and Daolord Kongsan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“NO!!!!” Looks of
utter horror appeared on the faces of both of them. As soon as that
overwhelming burst of force first revealed its true, terrifying
luster, both of their hearts were filled with the utmost terror. They
wouldn’t feel such terror even in the face of death itself, but the
overwhelming power of a Hegemon caused them to feel a sense of
uncontrollable terror. This was something which came from the very
depths of their souls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the formation.
The faces of Daolord Soleman and Daolord Skyaxe both changed as well.
Although they weren’t able to see what was happening inside the
formation, a sensation of complete and utter terror filled their
hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Retreat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Retreat
immediately!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the only
thought which entered their minds: Get as far away from this place as
possible!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They could sense that
something terrifying was about to happen within the formation!
Perhaps the terrifying power within it wasn’t aimed directly at
them, but they still couldn’t help but feel a sense of fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Both
retreated immediately.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Skywood City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most of the cultivators
were too distant from the grand sealing formation, and so when Ning
shattered the Hegemon’s Dao-seal they didn’t sense much when its
power was unleashed. The two most powerful figures inside the city,
however, able to sense it clearly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I just sensed an
enormous burst of power.” Emperor Skywood turned his head, staring
towards the distant grand sealing formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. The power is
tremendous.” The old man with tousled blue hair facing him nodded
solemnly as well. “I can sense that it is strong enough to threaten
the two of us. Skywood, this is your territory. How could there be
such a strong burst of power here? It must have been generated from
one of those strange treasures that was brought back from the Terror
Starsea. That, or it had to be a single-use Dao-seal or another
similar type of treasure which was personally created by a Hegemon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Skywood nodded
as well, then chuckled. “It’s been a long time since I’ve
sensed anything that could threaten me. Let’s go take a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Ning guided
that terrifying surge of Sword Dao power forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The enormous,
terrifying illusion of a greatsword suddenly appeared in the area
around Ning. As soon as the greatsword appeared, both space and time
were completely squeezed and compressed. Daolord Shaka and Daolord
Kongsan were both so terrified that they went numb. This was a level
of power which they were completely unprepared to handle!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn, damn, damn!
Damn that Kongsan. How could he have offended a freak like this?!”
Daolord Shaka’s heart was filled with shock, rage, and resentment.
“What sort of incredible fortune did this freak stumble upon? How
could he have such a monstrously powerful treasure? Not even the
protective treasure which the Hegemon bestowed upon me might not be
able to resist this terrifying sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A translucent bottle
suddenly appeared out of nowhere within the palm of Daolord Shaka’s
hand. Within the bottle was a crystalline speck of sand. Daolord
Shaka felt such sorrow that it was as though blood was dripping out
of his heart. This was an ancient relic he had acquired after
countless years of braving dangerous territories, and was the most
powerful protective treasure he had ever acquired. He hadn’t
expected that he would have to use it up because of his decision to
help Daolord Kongsan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack! The bottle was
shattered, and the sand within it instantly emitted a softy, blurry
glow that covered Daolord Shaka. Whoosh! The light-covered form of
Daolord Shaka instantly disappeared without a trace, as though he had
never even been here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“N-no. How could I,
Kongsan, die in a place like this? Impossible.” Daolord Kongsan
instantly produced two strange treasures in his hands. He immediately
shattered them without even pausing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These two different
treasures, when shattered, produced two different surges of power.
The first surge of power sought to influence the local spacetime and
change the trajectory of the impending giant sword illusion. Alas,
the surge of power instantly disappeared, because it was powerless
against the sword. As for the second surge of power, it was applied
to Daolord Kongsan himself. It transformed into an enormous globe of
water that covered his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous sword came
slashing down. Space and time both came to a halt as all things were
sheared away by its power. It chopped down upon the giant globe of
water, which was instantly shattered by this overwhelmingly
dominating sword. As for Daolord Kongsan, he had already transformed
into darkness incarnate within that water globe. But in the face of
that terrifying sword illusion… he melted away like snow in summer.
His body of darkness incarnate was completely unable to help him.
When the sword-light chopped down, the region of darkness dissipated
into nothingness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Kongsan had
perished!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! The enormous
illusion of a greatsword continued forwards to chop through the grand
sealing formation, easily piercing through it and continuing to
charge forwards. It then flew into the skies, out of this everworld,
and into the distant primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dissipate!” Ning
willed it, and that terrifying illusion of a greatsword quickly
dissipated. Its power spread out into trillions of tiny streams that
swept out in every direction, causing the primordial chaos itself to
tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Kongsan.”
Ning’s body flickered as he instantly moved as though by
teleportation through the void to appear at the place where Daolord
Kongsan died. Ning glanced at the treasures that lay there in midair,
then shook his head. “I didn’t imagine that this sword would
shatter even Daolord Kongsan’s storage treasures. A few of the
items inside remain, though.” Ning waved his hand, gathering all of
the remaining treasures of Daolord Kongsan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daolord Kongsan
actually had several storage estate-treasures. Some of the weaker
ones had been crushed, as had many of the treasures stored within
them. However, his top-grade Eternal estate-treasures were scarred
but still whole.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After putting away
Daolord Kongsan’s treasures, Ning turned to glance off into the
distance. Earlier, he had seen Daolord Shaka flee. Fleeing wasn’t
that impressive, actually. For example, Ning himself had that
spacetime disc which the almighty Hegemon had given him. If he had
been faced with a similar attack, he might’ve been able to flee as
well. But of course, Ning wouldn’t dare say that he was completely
certain in his chances, and he wouldn’t be so foolish as to
actually test it out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.” Two
distant figures flew towards him from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned to look at
them. It was Daolord Soleman and Daolord Skyaxe. They had fled in
terror moments ago, but now they had flown back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Soleman.” Ning hurriedly flew over and said
courteously, “Thank you and Daolord Skyaxe so much for coming here
to rescue me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Daolords of
Brightshore Kingdom all referred to each other as equals of the same
generation. Even when Ning was merely at the World level, he still
addressed Palace Lord Woodflower as senior apprentice-brother
Woodflower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, we didn’t
really save you; you saved yourself.” Daolord Soleman glanced at
the white-robed youth with quite a bit of curiosity. This was his
first time meeting Ning; in the past, he had only heard stories of
Ning from Solewind. “Darknorth, you sent a request to the
Brightshore Kingdom to ask the other Daolords to help out because you
didn’t wish to use up that precious treasure, I assume?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That treasure was
absolutely extraordinary.” The nearby Daolord Skyaxe sighed in
praise as well. “It truly was powerful. Anyone who wants to rely on
their own powers to survive such an attack would absolutely have to
have the most supreme of protective divine abilities.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. That
attack wasn’t necessarily omnipotent; for example, Daolord Shaka
had been able to escape. Certain divine abilities that could make the
body comparable to top-grade Eternal treasures might also allow for
survival! However, such techniques were incredibly rare and valuable,
and to actually reach such a level was extremely difficult. Ning had
a Hegemon’s legacy, but had still only been able to train his body
to the low-grade Eternal treasure level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really didn’t
want to use it up, but I had no choice,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, come! I’ve
heard about you from Solewind long ago, and it seems you truly are an
incredible figure. Come have some wine at my estate,” Daolord
Soleman said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps other powers
from the Brightshore Kingdom will come here as well.” Ning
hesitated a bit. “I should…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had notified the
Brightshore Kingdom for anyone within a day’s travel of Skywood
City to come help him fight against Daolord Kongsan. Some of them
might be on their way even now. If they arrived only to be unable to
locate Ning… that would be inappropriate of Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Simple.” Daolord
Soleman chuckled. “Just send another message through the
Brightshore Kingdom. Just say that anyone who can reach Skywood City
within a day should come visit Daolord Soleman’s residence.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, I was foolish
not to think of this.” Ning immediately sent another message to the
Brightshore Kingdom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, come!”
Daolord Soleman urged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Absolutely.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so Ji Ning, Daolord
Soleman, and Daolord Skyaxe transformed into streaks of light and
flew towards Skywood City.
</P>

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_41___Dao_Alliance__Palac"></A>
Chapter 41 – Dao Alliance, Palace of Immortals
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A mysterious place far,
far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a secret realm
which was atop a towering tree which was countless kilometers tall.
Near this giant tree, there was a lake that was overflowing with
spiritual energy, and next to the lake sat a grim-looking man dressed
in black imperial robes and who wore a crown on his head. The man was
seated in the lotus position. This was Prince Greatjoy, and with
every single breath he took he seemed to draw the spiritual energy of
the lake into his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Prince
Greatjoy couldn’t help but reveal a smile when he heard the news
his servant brought him. “It seems as though Darknorth has dealt
with his problems. How impressive. He was able to hold off Daolord
Kongsan long enough to buy time for senior apprentice-brother Soleman
to save him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am now a Daolord
of the Second Step. I have gone through many dangerous places and
profited from them, but I wouldn’t be able to survive Daolord
Kongsan if I fought him head-on. Still… this treasure of mine
should allow me to escape through my control of spacetime.” Prince
Greatjoy quite smugly produced a fist-sized seed. This seed was quite
strange, and it seemed to throw the surrounding field of spacetime
into a state of flux.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All the suffering
and trouble I went through in this place was worth it, now that I’ve
found this. The real problem for me… is how to get out!” Prince
Greatjoy was rather irritated by this. “This is such an enormous
place, but there are no other living creatures here save for myself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The darkness of outer
space. An enormous beast was roaring furiously within the void, and
opposite it stood Waterlord Firesurge. Firesurge was battling the
creature in close combat, using vicious, accurate, and cruel strikes.
His two hands would occasionally transform into streams of water that
were filled with overwhelming amounts of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crunch! The beast was
already so heavily wounded that it could no longer fight back.
Waterlord Firesurge managed to grip it by the throat using his
enormous, watery right hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you submit or
not? If you do not submit, you will die!” Waterlord Firesurge’s
eyes were filled with a sinister, murderous look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m willing to
submit.” The beast hesitated for a moment, then finally lowered its
head. Only then did Waterlord Firesurge produce a silver collar which
was covered with divine runes. He casually waved his hand, causing
the silver collar to fly out and encircle the beast’s neck. Moments
later, it vanished entirely. As for the beast, it immediately became
far more obedient.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Waterlord
Firesurge frowned. “It seems Darknorth has grown much more
powerful. He was actually able to buy himself enough time while being
hunted by Daolord Kongsan for Daolord Soleman to save him? It seems
that the difference between Darknorth myself is still significant.
No… no! I have to be the strongest one. Greatjoy, Solewind,
Darknorth… I will surpass them all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Waterlord
Firesurge waved his hand, collecting the beast. His body then
flickered as he disappeared into the void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within an ordinary
mortal city in an ordinary mortal world. There were a number of
roving patrols within this city, as well as a number of small-time
merchants and commoners. There were quite a few beggars as well. A
bald, thin, red-robed youth was walking through the streets of this
city.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hey kid!” The
youth suddenly walked towards a child beggar, then said in a soft
voice, “I can sense the endless rage, hatred, and resentment
festering in your heart. I’ll give you a special opportunity. Seize
it, and you will have a chance to become the ruler of this kingdom,
the most powerful figure here. But of course, it’s also possible
that you will descend into the deepest hells, never to recover. Are
you willing to give it a try?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The child beggar was
speechless. He glanced sideways at the other beggars and even the
passerbys, but no one was looking at him. It was as though no one had
even heard the treasonous words the red-robed youth had said to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Me? The ruler of
this kingdom?” The child beggar’s voice was clear and crisp, but
it was also quavering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
red-robed youth nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m willing.”
The child beggar gritted his teeth, then knelt down and kowtowed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then go.” The
red-robed youth waved his hand, causing a streak of light to fly into
the beggar’s body. Moments later, the red-robed youth disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where’d he go?!”
The child beggar frantically scanned his surroundings, but was
completely unable to locate that youth. “My body…?” The child
beggar could suddenly sense that his body was filled with an
overwhelming, shocking amount of strength. He lowered his head and
used his finger to poke at the rock beneath his feet… and his
finger pierced straight through it. He couldn’t help but feel
wildly overjoyed. Moments later, his head started to hurt slightly as
an enormous amount of information began to flood into it. This was a
cultivation technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Far away, in the skies.
The red-robed youth, Daolord Solewind, was staring downwards and
watching all this happen. He nodded slightly. “I’ve already left
behind thirty thousand seeds within this chaosworld. Now, let’s see
how this world develops.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some cultivators needed
to go out adventuring through dangerous places. However, other
cultivators did not have to. Daolord Solewind’s path was that of a
Heartforce Cultivator, and his path was a different one entirely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For another example,
Daolord Badlands’s path was the Dao of Numerancy. Even as a Daolord
of the Third Step, he was already one of the top three divination
experts in all the Endless Territories. Once he took one more step
and became a Daolord of the Fourth Step, he’d undergo a fundamental
change. Most likely, he would be ranked number one in divination in
all the Endless Territories. His close combat abilities might not be
overly impressive, but he would be ranked as one of the most
difficult foes to deal with in the entire universe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you wanted to kill
him, he would be able to sense it well in advance and have more than
enough time to flee and hide. If he wanted to kill you, he would be
able to set the most intricate of plots against you, calculating
everything with precision. This was why the Dao of Numerancy was so
terrifying. However, Daolord Badlands’ path was clearly an
extremely difficult one to travel. Otherwise, how could he have
reached such incredible heights in Numerancy despite merely being at
the third step? As a result, reaching the fourth step would be
extremely difficult as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? It seems brother
Darknorth has managed to survive the dangerous situation he was in.
Impressive.” Daolord Solewind nodded slightly. “Big brother
Soleman is already at the Verge. Compared to him, I’m still lacking
as a Heartforce Cultivator.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two messages Ning
sent out to the Brightshore Kingdom caused quite a few of its
Daolords and Emperors to become aware of his troubles. Lord
Woodflower and the others let out sighs of relief when they heard the
good news. They also realized that word of how Daolord Darknorth of
the Sword Palace was able to survive Daolord Kongsan’s assault
would surely spread. Soon, he would most assuredly stand at the very
peak of power in the Endless Territories. He would become one of the
most freakishly strong Daolords in existence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Skywood City. The empty
space outside and above the city. Two figures appeared within the
empty void. It was Emperoer Skywood and the blue-haired elder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a powerful
remnant sword-intent.” Emperor Skywood said softly, “This is
definitely a Hegemon’s sword-intent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Hegemon’s
sword-intent? But none of the three Hegemons of the Endless
Territories are skilled in the Dao of the Sword.” The blue-haired
elder was instantly puzzled. “Could it have come from the Terror
Starsea?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. It most likely
was generated from one of the curios that can be found in the Terror
Starsea.” Emperor Skywood nodded. “Let me take a closer look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The surrounding
field of spacetime quickly began to flow in reverse… but as it did,
some sort of invisible, terrifying power seemed to disrupt the
process, causing the technique to dissipate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not able to
reverse it.” Emperor Skywood frowned when he saw this. “That
surge of sword-intent was simply too strong. It completely disrupted
the local fabric of spacetime. There’s no way for me to see what
happened in the past here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then take a look at
what happened right afterwards,” the blue-haired elder laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All I can see is
what happened after that burst of power.” Emperor Skywood nodded.
The Sword Hegemon’s Dao-seal was simply too powerful, disrupting
even a temporal inversion spell to scry what had happened here.
Everything that had ever happened here since the Sword Hegemon’s
Dao-seal was used had been rendered completely un-scryable. Only
someone incredibly talented in the Dao of Spacetime, such as the
Brightshore Hegemon, might be able to reverse spacetime here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, scenes from
earlier began to replay, revealing a shattered formation and a
white-robed youth waving his hand, taking away Daolord Kongsan’s
treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those are Kongsan’s
treasures. He was the only one who left anything behind?” Emperor
Skywood murmured softly, “It seems Kongsan was the only one to die
to that strike.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The scene of the
white-robed youth chatting with Daolord Soleman and Daolord Skyaxe
played next.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems that
Hegemon’s Dao-seal was used by that kid.” Emperor Skywood pointed
at Ning’s form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. Judging from
what they are saying, the kid should be a member of the Brightshore
Kingdom.” The blue-haired elder nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Skywood shook
his head and laughed. “The Hegemon of the Brightshore Kingdom often
abducts World-level cultivators from other areas, and he has a good
eye for talent; he really can pick out quite a few exceptionally
talented fellows! This young fellow named Darknorth is a member of
our Dao Alliance, but he still ended up being abducted by the
Hegemon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Brightshore
Hegemon knows his boundaries. He doesn’t really abduct all that
many, and he only goes after World-level cultivators,” the
blue-haired elder said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come over here.”
Emperor Skywood suddenly turned his head to stare off into the
distance. Whoosh! Space and time twisted, followed by a gray-robed
elder appearing. The elder said respectfully, “Greetings,
Sectlord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are responsible
for overseeing this everworld. Do you know what happened earlier?”
Emperor Skywood asked. This was the territory of the Skywood Sect,
and so everything here was under their supervision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sectlord, the
white-robed youth was Daolord Darknorth of Vastheaven Palace,” the
gray-robed elder said respectfully. “He purchased seven of the nine
mighty novessence arts of Daolord Allgod, then went to Plumesoar Hall
and purchased many treasures that those nine novessence arts need.
Finally, he used two treasures, ‘deluxe hellgold’ and ‘skyjewel
bloodfruit’, to trade for a flying vessel that can move a hundred
times the speed of light.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems this young
fellow has quite a few treasures.” Emperor Skywood chuckled as he
praised Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually found
skyjewel bloodfruit? Haha…” The blue-haired elder nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gray-robed elder
continued, “Outside Plumesoar Hall, he was ambushed by the disciple
of Daolord Kongsan. He was able to slay that disciple, a Daolord of
the Third Step, with a wave of his hand. As a result, he ended up
being chased and assaulted by Daolord Kongsan, who failed in his
pursuit and so asked Daolord Shaka for assistance. A short while
later, Daolord Soleman and Daolord Skyaxe arrived as well, but they
weren’t able to breach the grand sealing formation. As for what
happened afterwards inside the formation, there was no way for me to
tell. I imagine Daolord Darknorth must’ve used some sort of special
killer technique that slew both Daolord Shaka and Daolord Kongsan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kongsan died, but
Shaka probably did not,” Emperor Skywood said. They only saw the
scene picking up Daolord Kongsan’s treasures, not Daolord Shaka’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The kid is quite
impressive, and he seems to have had some incredible luck.” Emperor
Skywood instructed, “Make the arrangements for Daolord Darknorth to
be given a Palace of Immortals medallion. He’s qualified to enter
it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,” the
gray-robed elder said respectfully.

Chapter 42 – Emperor Blueblaze
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gray-robed elder
departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You actually chose
to proactively hand out a Palace of Immortals medallion. It seems you
have taken a liking to the kid?” The blue-haired elder said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s just a
Daolord of the Second Step. Once he becomes a Daolord of the Fourth
Step, he’ll be of some use to me. Only then would he truly be worth
recruiting and befriending.” Emperor Skywood glanced at the
blue-haired elder, then sighed. “Blueblaze, my old friend… you
are my true helper, my right hand. We’ve experienced life-and-death
battle on numerous occasions. Once again, I want to urge you to
reconsider. Don’t go any further into the Terror Starsea! The
region you’ve delved into is already quite terrifying. If the two
of us go any deeper into unknown territories, we can die at any
moment.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” The
blue-haired elder let out a sigh. “Aberrants like us are different
from members of the Dao Alliance like you. Your Dao Alliance has an
incredibly deep and solid foundation; all five of the other
organizations combined still couldn’t match you in this regard.
That’s why you can relax. We Aberrants, however, have to fight for
every scrap we can get.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Hegemon is the
cornerstone and the pillar of our race and kingdom; there’s no way
he can go out adventuring. As for those other Daolords, most of them
are far too weak. That’s why I was chosen to lead this squad deep
into the Terror Starsea. This is the best option available to us. In
addition… I’ve had enough of this eternal, endless life. If I’m
lucky, I might find something within the Terror Starsea that will
allow me to become much more powerful! Haha. By then, Skywood, you
won’t be a match for me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Skywood was
filled with mixed emotions. Compared to them, Daolords lived
extremely short lives. Although they were able to dazzle others for a
period of time, in the end they would still perish. Very few were
able to become Eternal Emperors, and those who were able to become
Eternal Emperors who were his equal and who he could view as friends
were even fewer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Emperor
Blueblaze belonged to a different organization, they truly did treat
each other as bosom friends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blueblaze, your
protective abilities are indeed quite powerful,” Emperor Skywood
said softly, “But you still can’t be too rash. If things look
bad, you should flee right away! As for those Daolords under your
command? If they die, they die. There’s no need to concern yourself
too much about them. Even if they don’t die while adventuring,
virtually all of them will be dead 108,000 chaos cycles from now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha! I came here to
bid you farewell, old friend. I’ve said everything I need to say.
It’s time for me to leave. Once I come back from the Terror
Starsea, I’ll find you and drink with you again.” When Emperor
Blueblaze saw that look on Emperor Skywood’s face, he couldn’t
help but laugh. “Hah! Don’t worry. I won’t die that easily.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While laughing, Emperor
Blueblaze transformed into a single blue streak of fire that
disappeared into the horizon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Emperor Skywood stood
there in midair. He was silent for a long moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to help you,
but I cannot decide for the Dao Alliance.” Emperor Skywood shook
his head, then flew towards hiw own estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within one of the many
estates within Skywood City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the ancient
Eternal Emperors living here had their own worries, but the Daolords
were focused on the here and now. They did as they pleased with very
few long-term concerns, by comparison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You, a Daolord of
the Second Step, slew Kongsan! Not even I would be able to kill him.
Darknorth, I feel confident that when you become a Daolord of the
Fourth Step, you’ll be every bit my match. Come, let us drink!”
Daolord Skyaxe was bare-chested, and his chest was covered with fur.
He picked up an enormous black vessel of wine, and Ning did the same.
Ning explained, “I relied on my treasures to win. Big brother
Skyaxe, you are ranked in the top five in the Endless Territories. It
won’t be easy for me to catch up to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Top five my ass. I’m
simply number five.” Skyaxe laughed loudly. The Daolords continued
to chat rather casually with each other. For the most part, Ning just
listened and responded as Skyaxe and Soleman spoke. They had
experienced far more than he did and had visited many places. Just
listening to them, Ning’s horizons were broadened. He repeatedly
let out amazed sighs. Although he had visited the Archaeus region of
the alternate universe, it seemed as though some of the dangerous
regions in the Endless Territories were even more mysterious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The more you
experience, the more you will understand.” Soleman sighed.
“However… although adventuring is a good thing, you still run the
risk of losing your life. For example, three of us headed out on our
latest journey, but only two returned. My old friend Eastroad lost
his life. Ugh.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daolord Eastroad
died?” Ning was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. He died just a
thousand years ago.” Soleman nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There was nothing
the two of us could do. We were fleeing for our lives as well; we
simply didn’t have the ability to help him out.” Skyaxe slowly
shook his head. “Eastroad was just a bit slower than us, and so he
was surrounded and killed there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later, Skyaxe
let out a hearty laugh. “But so what? Even if we don’t die while
adventuring, almost all of us will die after failing our Daomerge.
While adventuring through the outside world, we’ve visited many
ancient sites in search for good fortune that might help us further
perfect our Daos, so that our chances during our Daomerge will be
better. And I have to say, the adventuring life really is stirring.
Those memories are a joy to think back to.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of us were
in the process of disposing of the treasures we acquired on this
trip.” Soleman looked at Ning. “After we finish, we plan to visit
Eastroad’s homeland and help him take care of it. We didn’t
expect to run into you just as we were preparing to leave, junior
apprentice-brother Darknorth. If you sent out your message just a
short while later, we probably would’ve already left.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That means the two
of us were destined to meet with brother Darknorth,” Skyaxe
laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Soleman.” Ning immediately said, “Are you
still planning to go to Daolord Eastroad’s homeland?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are.” Daolord
Soleman nodded. “When we were in that deadly trap, we each told the
others what our greatest regrets and hopes were. We agreed that the
survivor would ensure that the wishes of the deceased were carried
out! The one thing Eastroad was worried about prior to dying was what
would happen to his homeland.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “Senior
apprentice-brother Soleman, I’m just journeying through the outside
world, with no plans to go to any particularly dangerous areas for
now. Leave it to me to take care of Daolord Eastroad’s homeland.
I’ll make the arrangements for it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soleman and Skyaxe had
helped him out. Although they hadn’t been able to breach the
formation and rescue him, for them to hurry over and try was already
an act of kindness. Ning naturally wanted to help them out and repay
them. As for Daolord Eastroad’s homeland, the ‘Eastroad
Territory’, Ning knew about it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You?” Daolord
Soleman and Daolord Skyaxe exchanged a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you were an
ordinary Daolord, I probably wouldn’t feel comfortable about it.”
Daolord Soleman laughed. “We’re planning to send some of the
treasures we acquired during our last expedition to his homeland,
after all. Given that you killed Kongsan and acquired virtually all
his treasures, I feel confident that you probably wouldn’t pilfer
any of the treasures we’re planning to gift Eastroad’s homeland.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a resigned
chuckle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since you’ve made
the offer… I’ll accept it. Thank you for helping out,” Daolord
Soleman said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry about
it at all.” Ning smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll have to
trouble you to deliver these treasures. As to what you plan to do
with them once you bring them to Eastroad’s homeland, that’ll be
up to you to decide.” Daolord Soleman handed over a storage
bracelet, which Ning accepted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later.
“An emissary from the Skywood Sect has arrived.” Daolord Soleman
turned his head to glance towards the outside region, only to see a
gray-robed elder walk towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gray-robed elder
looked towards Ning, then said, “Per the sectlord’s orders, I’ve
come to deliver this Palace of Immortals medallion to Daolord
Darknorth.” As he spoke, he sent a medallion flying towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s this?”
Ning reached out to accept it. The medallion was pitch-black and
cold. It was covered with many complex runes, but it had only a
single word atop it – ‘Soldier’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gray-robed elder
immediately turned and left. As for Ning, he was quite startled. This
was rather abrupt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
junior apprentice-brother Darknorth. This is a medallion of the Dao
Alliance’s Palace of Immortals… but of course, it is only the
most basic ‘soldier’ medallion.” Daolord Soleman chuckled.
“Once you become a Daolord of the Fourth Step, you’ll earn a
‘commander’ medallion. By then, you’ll be allowed to pay a
visit to the Palace of Immortals. It might be of benefit to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? A ‘commander’
medallion?” Ning was curious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Palace of
Immortals is quite a special place. The lowest-ranking members all
have ‘soldier’ medallions, but almost all of them are formidable
Daolords of the Fourth Step. The most talented and powerful of
Daolords will have a chance to earn a ‘commander’ medallion.”
Daolord Soleman explained, “The Palace of Immortals is a very
mysterious place… but for now, you are nothing more than a pawn.
There’s no point in you visiting it. Only once you gain a
‘commander’ medallion would it be worth it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning nodded.
All places were the same. The higher your status was, the more would
be made available to you.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Generally speaking,
these medallions are only issued by the Palace of Immortals. It
sounds as though the sectlord of the Skywood Sect, Emperor Skywood,
personally gave you this one. He’s one of the highest-ranking
members of the Dao Alliance and has the authority to do this. It
seems as though he’s noticed you. This is a good thing for you, but
it could also be a bad thing.” Daolord Soleman chuckled. “While
you are still weak, you should avoid the internal squabbles of the
Dao Alliance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand.”
Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had come to
Skywood City for the sake of the nine novessence arts. He had only
spent another two years here due to Daolord Kongsan and all the other
accompanying issues. Now that everything had concluded, he departed
after spending another two days at Daolord Soleman’s place. He left
Skywood City, heading towards the Eastroad Territory.
