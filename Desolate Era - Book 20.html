Chapter 1 - Undermoon Lake
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You win?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning instantly grew
excited. When he first came up with this idea to butcher the Seamless
Gate’s forces until they lowered their heads, it had been a
seemingly crazy, suicidal idea. Even Ning himself knew how dangerous
his plan was, and how low the chances of success would be. However,
he had no other options left to him; this was the only plan that was
possible. Fortunately, thanks to the prisonworld, he had acquired the
[Ninehorn Lightning Serpent] evasive divine ability, which was why he
had finally been able to render the Seamless Gate helpless before
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Release my wife.”
The Rahu-Ning stared intently at the black-robed Godking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be
impatient.” The black-robed Godking looked back at Ning. “Let’s
have a chat first.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chat?” The
Rahu-Ning said coldly, “No need to chat. So long as you release my
wife, I’ll immediately withdraw. Otherwise, I’ll keep killing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The
black-robed Godking’s voice turned cold. “You want to bring your
wife back without paying any price at all? You are absolutely
dreaming. So if I release Yu Wei, you’ll stop acting against the
Seamless Gate?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Rahu-Ning replied,
“At least I won’t continue attacking in this manner.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hah! Easily said,
but once Yu Wei returns to your side, the Seamless Gate will have
nothing to threaten you with. And, in the end, you are a member of
the Nuwa Alliance. Our alliances are engaged in a war for survival,
and both sides are struggling to seize any advantage possible. If
your master Subhuti and the other supreme powers on your side ask you
to act against us, would you really be able to refuse them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Godking
laughed coldly, “You’ve become powerful, which is why I said ‘you
win’; you’ve won a chance to negotiate with us. In the past, my
decision was that I would only allow you and Yu Wei to reunite if you
joined us. Now, I’ll no longer try to force you to join us. But you
want to get her back without paying any price at all? Ahahaha…and
once you and Yu Wei reunite and you launch more attacks against us,
wouldn’t the Seamless Gate become the laughing stock of the Three
Realms?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can swear an
oath,” Ning growled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oath?” The
black-robed Godking snickered. “True Gods and Daofathers can ignore
oaths to the Dao of the Heavens. Given your current level of power,
so long as your master is willing to assist you, you can withstand
the punishment levied by the Heavenly Daos for violating an oath to
them. Those oaths are meaningless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was true. Oaths to
the Dao of the Heavens were useless against True Gods and Daofathers.
The main reason for this was that there was a limit to the punishing
power of the Heavenly Daos; the power behind it wasn’t truly
limitless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Either you pay a
price to reunite with your wife, or we keep fighting like this. If
worse comes to worse, I’ll simply have all our Empyrean Gods and
True Immortals withdraw, then come up with a different method to
infiltrate the Three Realms.” The Godking laughed coldly, “Although
we spent quite a bit of blood, sweat, and effort building up those
bases, we can still afford to lose them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Choose.” The
Godking looked at Ji Ning coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning looked back at
the black-robed Godking. He was silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems you aren’t
willing to pay any price at all. Very well.” The black-robed
Godking’s voice turned even colder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak.” Finally,
Ning responded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking laughed.
“That’s more like it. Everything has to be fair. You were able to
force the Seamless Gate to negotiate with you…you should feel
proud. But for you to think that you’ll get what you want without
paying any price at all is a bit delusional.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate
won’t ask too much of you. The evasion technique that you’ve
acquire is quite formidable. The Seamless Gate will only ask one
thing; that you hand this divine ability over to us. In addition, you
have to guarantee that at least one of our major powers is capable of
successfully training in it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible.” Ning
laughed coldly. “You are dreaming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Was this a joke?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti had become
incredibly excited when Ning had offered the Nuwa Alliance the
evasion technique and the six bottles of chaos nectar. Clearly, this
was something that would have a major impact on the war, far more so
than the emergence of a new True God or Daofather. The Godking really
was quite greedy; he actually dared to ask for a divine ability like
this? In addition, the Godking had to know that training in this sort
of divine ability had to be incredibly difficult, and so he insisted
that Ning ensure at least one of their major powers could train in
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My request is very
simple, but you won’t accept…” The Godking shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s not that I
won’t accept. It’s that I don’t have the ability to accept.”
Ning shook his head and snarled, “It was my master who discovered
this technique and bestowed it upon me. I’m forbidden from teaching
it others. I cannot violate Master’s orders; if I do, he’d
definitely kill me. What’s the difference between this ultimatum
and your previous ultimatum of having me join the Seamless Gate?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t even think
about it. This divine ability is a supreme technique that belongs to
the Nuwa Alliance, and it is extremely hard to train in. Although
Master acquired it, not even he has been able to master it; to date,
I’m the only one who has succeeded.” Ning laughed coldly. “As
for you, you can forget about it. Even if you obtain it, you wouldn’t
be able to train in it…and there’s no way you’ll obtain it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are the only one
who has learned it?” The Godking asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Subhuti had given
the six bottles of chaos nectar to Suiren, he had once more informed
Ning that Suiren training in the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent] was a
major secret that absolutely could not be revealed. Given Suiren’s
power, he would only begin to truly fight during the Endwar. When he
suddenly revealed the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent] during the Endwar,
he would catch the Seamless Gate offguard. By then, the Seamless Gate
would realize that Ji NIng was lying…but it would be too late!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This wasn’t just the
story they decided to tell the Seamless Gate. They would tell the
same story to the other major powers of the Nuwa Alliance. The only
ones who actually knew the truth, that Suiren had trained in the
[Ninehorn Lightning Serpent] evasion technique, were Subhuti, Daoist
Three Purities, Shennong, and the other overlord-level Daofathers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking felt rather
suspicious. Could it be that Ji Ning truly was the only one who had
mastered it? Still, he also knew that it was true that a divine
ability like this had to be extremely hard to train in. The number of
people who could learn it in the entire Three Realms could probably
be counted on one hand. It was possible that what Ji Ning said was
the truth. The Godking still clung on to a sliver of hope…but he
also knew that it was very likely that there was no hope for him to
acquire this technique from the Nuwa Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, his request
for the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent] was a bargaining tactic; he had
never expected it to succeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine. I won’t try
to force things with the evasion technique.” The black-robed
Godking looked at Ning. “I need three treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak.” Ning
looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first treasure
is known as the ‘Seven Treasures Azure Sunfiend’. I don’t need
too much of it, just five kilograms!” The black-robed Godking
looked at Ning. “The second treasure is known as the ‘Bloodflower
Pith’; I only need five kilograms of this as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just listened
silently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three treasures?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although these two
treasures were rare and costly, the Nuwa Alliance had them. He could
use treasures to trade for them. Although five kilograms of each
would be quite costly, it wouldn’t be too burdensome to Ning.
However, based on what Ning knew of the Seamless Gate’s Godking, he
knew that matters wouldn’t be that simple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The third
treasure…is an Iceheart Leaf.” The black-robed Godking stared
intently at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Iceheart Leaf?”
The Rahu-Ning growled, “Are you referring to the Iceheart Leaves of
Undermoon Lake?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The
black-robed Godking looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Rahu-Ning bellowed,
“Are you trying to get me to commit suicide?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vast, infinite
primordial chaos contained many unexplored, marvelous places.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In previous eras, when
everything was peaceful, the major powers loved to wander through the
primordial chaos and explore it. Many treasures and ingredients could
only be found within the primordial chaos, and it also contained some
truly lethal areas. Daofather Fuju had silently, soundlessly died
within the primordial chaos, while Daoist Three Purities had
discovered the nine chaos seals. In short, the primordial chaos was
filled with both great danger and great opportunity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for ‘Undermoon
Lake’, this was an extremely dangerous location.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Undermoon Lake was a
deep lake that existed within the primordial chaos. It was adjacent
to an enormous star, and the surface of the lake just so happened to
face the star. The star was reflected off the lake, much like the
image of a moon being reflected in water. It was extraordinarily
beautiful, and thus it was named Undermoon Lake. However, Undermoon
Lake was an incredibly mysterious place. Only Empyrean Gods could
enter it! During the Primordial Era, Empyrean Gods would often enter
it, as they felt certain that there had to be a tremendous karmic
fortune waiting for them within it. For the sake of acquiring that
fortune, the Empyrean Gods were willing to take the risk. But…upon
entering, none of them ever returned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It wasn’t until the
era of the Three Realms that an Empyrean God known as Bodhisattva
Jueming managed to return alive. He had entered during the Primordial
Era, but only managed to leave during the era of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After he came out, his
only explanation was that the lake contained tremendous danger, as
well as many precious chaos items. He returned with a total of three
treasures, one of them being the Iceheart Leaf. He had always been
tremendously powerful, and when he returned to the Three Realms he
had already been at the peak of power possible for an Empyrean God.
By now, after so many years of cultivation, he had broken through to
become one of the Buddhas of the Buddhist Sangha.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I only need a single
Iceheart Leaf.” The black-robed Godking looked at Ning. “Jueming
brought back a total of twelve of those leaves.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But Buddha Jueming
has been the only one to return in countless years,” Ning said
angrily. “An enormous number of Empyrean Gods have entered,
including quite a few who belong to your Seamless Gate. Which one has
ever come out again? If I was to die inside, you would be quite
happy, wouldn’t you? Alternately, if I was to be trapped inside for
countless years before emerging, this entire storm might have already
passed, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
Godking stared steadily at Ning. “You are quite clever. I know you
have a Primaltwin. When your true body goes into the lake, your
Primaltwin can continue to remain in the Three Realms, and so you
won’t truly die. In addition, it’s always possible that you’ll
successfully leave from Undermoon Lake. In terms of power, you are
after all far stronger than Jueming was at the time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m only asking
you to send your true body inside, and there’s a chance you’ll be
able to come back. This, in exchange for Yu Wei being returned to
you. You should feel satisfied.” The Godking looked towards Ning.
“The Seamless Gate insists on acquiring these three treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked back at the
Godking. In his heart, however, he was laughing coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate’s
scheme was really something. If his true body entered Undermoon Lake,
the Seamless Gate would no longer be worried about Ning launching
more ambushes. What the Seamless Gate didn’t realize…was that
Ning had a total of eighteen ‘true bodies’!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Buddhist Sangha
has long ago used up those twelve Iceheart Leaves.” The black-robed
Godking looked at Ning. “You’ll only be able to acquire more
within Undermoon Lake. If you accept, I’ll immediately release Yu
Wei from the Infinity Hells, and I’ll even let you meet with her.
Once you bring me all three treasures, you can take your wife back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was silent for a
moment. Finally, he answered. “Fine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given how much Ji Ning
cared for Yu Wei, the Godking knew that he would accept. He was only
asking Ji Ning to take on some danger, after all, not to join their
side. Even when Ji Ning had been weak, he had been willing to risk
his life to ambush and attack the Seamless Gate; clearly, he was
willing to take on risks for Yu Wei’s sake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And it was true that
the Seamless Gate was in urgent need of these three treasures. They
would either be able to acquire the treasures or perpetually trap Ji
Ning within Undermoon Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…I’ll
immediately make the arrangements for you to meet with your wife.”
The Godking laughed.

Chapter 2 - Long Time No See
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Voidboat floated
downwards past the turbid waters of a river.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed youth was
seated alone atop the boat. As for the 90,000 Celestial Immortals and
8 million Loose Immortals he commanded, he had sent them all back
into the Starseizer world. So long as he was in the Rahu-Ning mode,
the Godking of the Seamless Gate would be unable to draw him into the
dreamworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A figure suddenly
appeared out of nowhere atop the Voidboat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Ning
hurriedly rose to his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How did it go?”
Subhuti looked at Ning. He was very concerned about this disciple of
his. Ning had risked utter calamity when he had first launched these
dangerous attacks against the Seamless Gate. From the very start,
Subhuti understood how important Yu Wei was to him, and was worried
that the Seamless Gate would make use of that to set a trap for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What did the Godking
of the Seamless Gate say to you?” Subhuti immediately asked. The
Godking had used a technique to ensure that no one was able to spy
upon his conversation with Ning. “Given my understanding of his
devious disposition, there’s no way he would simply hand Yu Wei
over to you. He must have listed certain preconditions…and those
preconditions may very well be deadly traps!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti was very
worried about him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are right,”
Ning replied. “The Godking did indeed list certain preconditions.
He wants me to give him three treasures in exchange for her.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three treasures?
Which three?” Subhuti immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five kilograms of
‘Seven Treasures Azure Sunfiend’, five kilograms of ‘Bloodflower
Pith’, and a single Iceheart Leaf.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A murderous look
appeared in Subhuti’s eyes. “The first two aren’t that hard to
acquire; they are ingredients used to produce Great Firmament pills.
I have plenty of them, and I can easily bring out five hundred
kilograms. I myself can handle the first two requests. But Iceheart
Leaf…it no longer exists within the Three Realms. The twelve leaves
that were originally acquired were used up long ago. They want to
force you into Undermoon Lake!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Great Firmament pills
were the very best Immortal pills, capable of replenishing power for
Daofathers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Endwar, all the
Daofathers would use up enormous amounts of energy in battle, and so
both sides needed to store up large amounts of Great Firmament pills!
Ning was merely an Empyrean God and True Immortal, after all, and so
the Seamless Gate didn’t request an excessively exorbitant amount
of materials for making them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These three
treasures are indeed somewhat useful for the Seamless Gate, but even
if you gave them these items it wouldn’t have much of an impact on
the overall situation.” Subhuti laughed coldly. “Their goal is to
force you into Undermoon Lake! The ideal outcome for them is you
dying inside that place. Even if you don’t die, you might be
trapped there for countless years. Even if you manage to leave, the
war would have long since ended, with you having caused no impact on
the Endwar at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ever since the
Primordial Era, the only one who has ever survived to return was
Buddha Jueming, but he was trapped there for countless years as well.
What a fine plan. What a fine ploy!” Subhuti looked at Ning. “You
have to be careful. I know you wish to rescue your wife, but your own
life is even more important. Don’t forget that you have a daughter
to take care of.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” Ning
assented respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti just sighed to
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some cultivators would
go so far as to kill their own parents or spouse so as to strengthen
their Dao-hearts! They would place their own cultivation in a
position of paramount importance; everything else could be discarded.
In the Three Realms, there were quite a few such figures who were
completely focused on the Dao and were willing to sacrifice
everything else. However, his disciple Ji Ning was a person who
viewed relationships as being tremendously important.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Houyi, all those
years ago, was just like how Ji Ning is. Both of them care deeply
about relationships. Can it be that this is necessary in order for
one to be accomplished in heartforce?” Subhuti still felt fairly
unconcerned, relatively speaking. “The Seamless Gate’s
calculations are off. They want to use Undermoon Lake to trap or kill
Ji Ning, but they don’t know that he has a total of 18 bodies. Even
if one dies within Undermoon Lake, it won’t have much of an impact
on him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. Today, they
are using love to manipulate my disciple. In the future…” A
murderous intent began to rise within Subhuti’s heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After his master left,
Ning continued to sit there in the lotus position within his
Voidboat. He allowed the Godking’s invisible energy to infiltrate
his mind, guiding his senses downwards. He remained conscious, but
part of his mind had been drawn into the dreamworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the vast, dark
dreamworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking, seated
atop his towering throne, stared downwards at the newly-appeared Ji
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right after our
negotiations concluded, your master sought you out. It seems he
really does care about you quite a bit.” The Godking looked at
Ning, then laughed coldly. “Have you changed your mind? If you’ve
changed your mind, we can keep fighting. But of course, your senior
apprentice-sister will continue to suffer endless torment within the
Infinity Hells…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To force Ji Ning to
enter Undermoon Lake was the best idea the Godking had come up with.
Ideally, Ji Ning would die, but even if he didn’t die he would
still be trapped there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His only worry was that
Subhuti would dissuade Ning, causing him to change his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. I’ll
go to Undermoon Lake.” Ning looked at the Godking. “Hurry up and
release her.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha.” The
Godking let out a secret sigh of relief. “Don’t worry. I’ll
release Yu Wei right now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly sensed a
ripple next to him. Turning his head, he saw that upon a distant
meadow the figure of an incredibly beautiful black-robed maiden had
appeared. This peerless beauty had a rather glazed look in her eyes;
clearly, the torment she had endured in the Infinity Hells had nearly
broken her. Fortunately, the Godking had been in control of things;
otherwise, her soul would’ve shattered long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But upon seeing her in
such a state, Ning still felt pain in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This wife of yours
has only spent a mere century in the flame hell,” the Godking said
calmly. “According to my original plans, I was going to to have her
spend a thousand years in each of the hells. Your wife has only
gotten a taste of the first hell…but alas, you’ve forced us to
compromise with you. I have to say, I feel some admiration for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t respond
to the Godking. ‘Flame hell’? He still remembered how, when he
made the choice all those years ago during the Realmwar, he had
watched as Yu Wei was sent to suffer an agonizing set of torture by
fire. So during the past century…she had been continuously
suffering that agony.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei slowly came back
to her senses. After suffering a century within the Infinity Hells,
she had already somewhat lost control of her senses. Her soul was
simply too weak. Only after her torment had finally halted did she
slowly come back to her senses. In front of her, off in the distance,
stood a white-robed youth. A white-robed youth who seemed to have
unshed tears glimmering in his eyes…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.” This was the first time Yu Wei had spoken in a
century.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister.” Ning’s body blurred, then reappeared next to
her. He took Yu Wei by the hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their gazes met.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning held Yu Wei in his
arms. He could sense the warmth, her warmth, emanating from her body.
“Senior apprentice-sister. I’m sorry.” It had been his choice
that had consigned her into the Infinity Hells.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was I who wronged
you.” Yu Wei smiled into Ning’s embrace. “When I destroyed
Shennong’s medicine, I knew that it would be impossible for me to
make up for the harm I caused you. I couldn’t even face you. I
thought that perhaps death would be the best outcome.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It wasn’t your
fault. Wasn’t your fault.” Ning said, “The Godking is the
disciple of the Lord of the Demonheart; he’s skilled in mesmerizing
the hearts of others. In your past life, you suffered too much and so
the demon in your heart became incredibly powerful, giving him a
chance to bewilder you…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei nodded gently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She had become
completely clear-minded now. When she had shattered Shennong’s
medicine, her soul had been shattered as well. The Godking had
hurried after her, dragging her truesoul back, then sending it to be
reborn into a new, weak soul. That weak soul, however, no longer had
any soul-imprints on it, and the Godking no longer spent any effort
in mesmerizing her a second time. After all, there was no point to
doing so when she was going to be in the Infinity Hells.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the soul imprint
gone, the century of burning agony she had experienced caused her to
see things even more clearly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m actually quite
content. Ordinary mortals only live for a single century. I’ve
lived a very, very long life in my previous life and in this life,
and I even met you. We even had a daughter together, Brightmoon. It’s
enough.” Yu Wei said consolingly, “I did wrong by you, junior
apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking, seated
upon his massive throne, laughed as he stared downwards towards them.
“What a fine pair of Immortal lovers. Even I feel a bit moved by
you two. Yu Wei, do you know? For your sake, this Dao-companion of
yours used his own strength to cause major disturbances to my
Seamless Gate’s disposition of forces throughout the entire Three
Realms. He forced me, the exalted Godking, to bow my head and to
negotiate with him. Haha…from this day forth, Yu Wei, you will no
longer need to enter the Infinity Hells. You can live a peaceful,
joyful life. Once your Dao-companion, Ji Ning, returns with those
three treasures I’ve asked for, you’ll regain your freedom. You
will be allowed to reunite with Ji Ning and your daughter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two distant
embracing figures suddenly let go of each other. Yu Wei stared at Ji
Ning. She asked hurriedly, “Junior apprentice-brother, three
treasures? Don’t trust the Godking. He’s skilled in manipulation
and lies. There has to be a plot behind it.” After having recovered
from her own beguiling, Yu Wei knew very well how terrifying the
Godking could be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know exactly what
the Godking is scheming.” Ning looked at Yu Wei. “Don’t worry.
Have faith in me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Yu Wei, you
should have faith in this junior apprentice-brother of yours. He’s
become quite a noteworthy character in the Three Realms. Perhaps,
towards the end of this great storm, he’ll break through to become
a True God or Daofather and end up fighting against me during the
Endwar. These three treasures won’t pose much of a threat to him.”
The Godking looked down upon her as he spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.” Yu Wei looked at Ning, extremely worried.
“Brightmoon. You have to take care of Brightmoon and protect her.
It’s not worth it to risk yourself for me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just held Yu Wei
in his arms. “Enough. Don’t say anything else. I’ve already
made up my mind.” His voice was very soft, but it was very
determined.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His wife in his arms,
he felt extremely calm, peaceful, and warm inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sort of feeling…it
had been so long!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he was to remain
alive but be like an emotionless walking zombie, life would be worse
than death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the sake of this
sort of warmth…even death would be worth it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seated atop the
Voidboat, Ning opened his eyes. When he thought of how his family
would be reunited once he emerged from Undermoon Lake, he felt filled
with strength and resolve! Yu Wei had already been placed by the
Godking into a minor world-estate; she was no longer suffering any
torment and was going to live a blissful, peaceful life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt much better
now. During the past century, he had spent almost every day training
in sword-arts as well as frantically trying to search for treasures
within the prisonworld to help him grow stronger, eventually
acquiring the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent]. Despite that…deep in
his heart, he felt a pain that would never go away. This was because
he knew that his wife was suffering torment within the Infinity
Hells.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After acquiring the
[Ninehorn Lightning Serpent] evasion technique, he had been
absolutely ecstatic. This was because…he finally saw hope. Hope of
rescuing her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Soon, senior
apprentice-sister…soon, we’ll be reunited for good. I’ll
definitely return from Undermoon Lake.” Ning immediately boarded
the Voidboat, leaving this major world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the endless
Void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as the Voidboat
appeared within the Void, a terrifying ripple of power suddenly
descended. Shocked, Ning immediately used the [Ninehorn Lightning
Serpent] technique to flee at high speed, but a voice suddenly spoke
out within Ning’s mind. “Don’t panic, my young friend Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 3 - Demanding the Technique
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ji Ning didn’t
slow down in the slightest. With a swish, he moved hundreds of
thousands of kilometers away while spreading out his heartforce,
taking a close look at the major power who had just arrived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to panic.”
A warm, gentle laugh rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning dodged past the
man, his heartforce completed the scan. The newcomer was dressed in
Daoist robes; it was a very authentic-looking white-bearded Daoist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Him?” Ning was
secretly surprised. “I knew that my display of the [Ninehorn
Lightning Serpent] would arouse the attention of some major powers.
I’m not worried about the Seamless Gate; it’s the ones on our
side that are more troublesome. So the first one to appear is Daoist
Yu Qiu. His nickname ‘Ascetic’ is quite fitting; he really is
quite shameless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some True Gods and
Daofathers were vile, vicious demons. Others were crafty,
unscrupulous, petty figures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Yu Qiu was one
of the most classic examples of the latter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His avariciousness and
craftiness was legendary, and so the major powers of the Three Realms
all referred to him as the ‘Ascetic’; clearly, this was a title
given to mock him! However, given that he had become a Daofather, his
Dao-heart wouldn’t possibly be shaken by a bit of mere mockery, and
he continued to act as he pleased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many of the major
powers of the Nuwa Alliance had been intrigued after Ning had
displayed his [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent], with the evil ones
becoming especially greedy for it. However, because so many people
were watching, and because Ning was a member of their alliance,
everyone continued to hesitate. No one wanted to be the first to act.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, Daoist Yu Qiu
became the first.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings, senior Yu
Qiu,” Ning said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need for such
courtesy. I have quite a close relationship with your master,
Subhuti. As for your other master, Daoist Threelives, we were
lifelong bosom friends. We were like brothers,” Daoist Yu Qiu said
with a merry laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly became
speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti held Daoist Yu
Qiu in disdain; the number of times they had met could probably be
counted on one hand. To stretch that into a so-called ‘close
relationship’? Fine. As for Daoist Threelives, over the course of
his battles for supremacy during the Primordial Era, he had made
friends with many of the other major powers. He had merely been on
courteous terms with Daoist Yu Qiu. For that sort of lukewarm
relationship to be described as ‘lifelong bosom friends’ and
‘like brothers’ by Daoist Yu Qiu was…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I heard that old
Threelives finally found a successor. I’m delighted for him. Alas…”
Daoist Yu Qiu let out a sigh. “A pity that in that battle, my old
brother Threelives ended up dying in the fight. I still regret it to
this very day.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fortunately, he has
a disciple like you now.” Daoist Yu Qiu laughed and nodded. “Just
now, I saw you use an evasion technique that involved riding a
Ninehorn Lightning Serpent. Now that the storm has descended upon us,
if the major powers of our alliance were to learn this technique, we
would have a much better chance of surviving. Ji Ning, would you be
willing to let me take a look at this evasion technique?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been given
orders by his master Subhuti long ago. He immediately said, “Senior,
this evasion technique was accidentally acquired by my master,
Subhuti. Although he’s transmitted it to me, he’s strictly
ordered me not to teach it to any others. As his disciple, I wouldn’t
dare to disobey my master’s orders. If you wish to learn this
evasion technique, senior, you can go and speak to my master about
it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Yu Qiu frowned
slightly. Seek out Subhuti?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti’s status was
close to that of the likes of the Human Sovereigns and the leaders of
the Daoist Path and the Buddhist Sangha. His mastery over spacetime
was number one in the Three Realms. If he wanted to avoid someone,
that person would never be able to find him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s just an
evasion technique.” Daoist Yu Qiu’s face sank. “This matter
involves all the major powers of our side, as well as the storm that
we are facing. Can it be that Subhuti is trying to hoard it for
himself?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yet another aura of
power and majesty descended, and the Void began to crackle with bolts
of lightning. This aura was a familiar one. Ning’s heart clenched.
This familiar aura…it belonged to Exalted Celestial Thundergod, who
he had once paid a visit to.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Void split apart,
and a muscular, black-armored man came walking out from it. His eyes
brimmed with sparks of lightning, and as he walked forward Ning felt
as though the entire Void itself was rendered breathless. If Daoist
Yu Qiu was merely an ordinary Daofather, Exalted Celestial Thundergod
was a top-tier Daofather.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thundergod.”
Daoist Yu Qiu smiled at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For once, Thundergod
gave him a nod, showing him some face. This time, they were standing
on the same side, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
Thundergod’s face was as cold as ever. “Daoist Yu Qiu’s words
are correct. This matter has an impact on the war and involves the
lives of countless living creatures on our side. You had best hurry
up and hand this divine ability over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master’s orders
are…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as Ning spoke,
Thundergod frowned and barked, “If your master has given you orders
and you aren’t qualified to decide on your own, then have your
master come out! You are his disciple; you definitely must have a
method that you can use to notify him. Go summon your master right
now. Have him come over here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was true. Subhuti
had indeed given Ning a message-talisman. As for the other major
powers? Aside from the few who were on very close terms with Subhuti,
they weren’t able to simply go meet with him when they wanted to.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A vortex suddenly
appeared in the Void, with a robed elder walking out from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Subhuti had
been paying close attention the entire time. He knew very well that
sooner or later, a major power would jump out to speak to Ning. He
had been quite calm when Daoist Yu Qiu had emerged, but once Exalted
Celestial Thundergod also emerged, Subhuti knew that things had
become a bit troublesome. This was because Daoist Yu Qiu was weak; he
wouldn’t really dare to offend Subhuti. Thundergod, however, was an
extremely powerful person with an incredibly violent and stubborn
temper. He often wouldn’t even give face to the two leaders of the
Buddhist Sangha and the Daoist Path. He was also the most highly
skilled lightning expert in the Three Realms; he definitely would
feel deep desire towards the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent] technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thundergod.”
Subhuti appeared before them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Respectful
greetings, Subhuti,” the smiling Daoist Yu Qiu hurriedly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thundergod looked at
Subhuti. He growled, “Subhuti. This evasion technique…I think you
had best hand it over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Subhuti
normally had a calm smile on his face, but his face was calm and cold
right now. “I worked hard to acquire that technique. It’s my
decision as to who I wish to teach it to. What, do you want to try
and force it out of me? Is there now a new rule that all the major
powers have to offer up all of the techniques they have at their
disposal? Why haven’t I heard about this rule?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thundergod was
momentarily speechless. The supreme techniques which each major power
used to roam the Three Realms were generally not taught to outsiders.
For example, there was no way Daoist Three Purities would teach
anyone else his ‘Immortal Slaying Sword Formation’. And, in
truth, even if he was willing to teach it to someone else, no one
else would be able to successfully learn it, as they wouldn’t have
the four Chaos-level swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, even though no
one else could master the technique, once others completely
understood it, it would be much easier for them to deal with it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Similarly, Subhuti’s
special skills involving spacetime would only be taught to Redsnow.
No major powers would say anything about it, nor would they try to
force the spacetime technique out of Subhuti or the Immortal Slaying
Sword Formation out of Daoist Three Purities. This was because every
major power had their own path of Immortal cultivation; they couldn’t
split their attention and focus on something else. Thus, they didn’t
feel too much desire for other top-tier techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ji Ning’s
[Ninehorn Lightning Serpent] evasion technique was different. It was
a divine ability; anybody could use it upon learning it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This divine ability
will be of tremendous use to the other major powers on our side,”
Thundergod said angrily. “This is a matter which has implications
for the lives of countless people on our side. Don’t you think you
should hand it over?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s not that I’m
unwilling to. Of course I care about this war! That’s why I offered
it up long ago.” Subhuti suddenly let out a sigh. “The Buddhist
Sangha, the Daoist Path, and the Sovereigns of Mankind have already
acquired copies of this technique. Fuxi, Shennong, Suiren, and the
two leaders of Buddhism and Daoism each have a copy, but none of them
have been able to master it yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Yu Qiu, Exalted
Celestial Thundergod, and the many major powers who had sent their
coresense to watch this location were all shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were many major
powers who were paying attention to this place. Most of the major
powers of the Nuwa Alliance had sent their corense to keep watch
here, covering the entire region! In fact, they were all prepared to
appear at any moment. As for the major powers of the Seamless
Gate…they wanted to scan this place as well, but Subhuti, Daoist
Three Purities, and the others had long ago joined together to
completely seal the area off from the Seamless Gate’s forces,
preventing their coresenses from entering it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This seal allowed their
allies in but completely blocked their enemies out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If such an unearthly
divine ability could be easily learned by all major powers, our side
would be guaranteed to win.” Subhuti shook his head and sighed.
“Tell me, do you really think that this divine ability is an easy
one to learn?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thundergod muttered,
“Why don’t you transmit copies of it to all the major powers on
our side? Perhaps one of us will be able to master it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no rush.”
Subhuti shook his head. “It isn’t as though you don’t know how
terrifying the spy network of the Seamless Gate is. Over the years,
we’ve found quite a few Seamless Gate spies amongst our ranks; in
fact, even one of the major powers on our side was revealed to be a
spy. It is entirely possible that there are other spies amongst the
major powers as well. We have to be careful, be cautious.
Otherwise…once the spy procures this technique, the Seamless Gate
will have access to it. If the supreme powers on their side learn it,
that would be disastrous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thundergod was stunned
yet again. Indeed, the Seamless Gate’s network of spies was very
formidable. The Empyrean Gods and True Immortals would never be
discovered until they themselves chose to reveal themselves. The only
reason why the Nuwa Alliance found out about the likes of Sword
Immortal Evergreen was when they suddenly engaged in acts of betrayal
at a crucial moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One figure after
another began to materialize out of nowhere. Some were tall and
muscular, some were as ephemeral as the clouds, some were filled with
murderous auras, some seemed to be as cold as glaciers. Incarnations
of one True God or Daofather after another began to form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After this group
manifested, more and more True Gods and Daofathers began to send
their incarnations to this place. Clearly, everyone wanted to discuss
this manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From Subhuti’s words,
they understood that their most supreme leaders such as Suiren and
Daoist Three Purities were hesitating on what to do, due to their
concerns over potential spies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good heavens…”
Ning could barely breathe. To see so many True Gods and Daofathers
together was an incredibly rare occurrence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five supremely powerful
auras suddenly descended together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shennong. Fuxi. Suiren.
Lord Tathagata the Buddha. Daoist Three Purities. They, too, only
sent incarnations over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eighty-two True Gods
and Daofathers.” Ning was secretly shocked. “However…not
everyone has arrived. My eldest apprentice-brother and second
apprentice-brother have yet to arrive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I feel that
Subhuti’s words are correct.” A distant, headless Fiendgod, Xing
Tian, spoke out. “This divine ability was discovered by fellow
Daoist Subhuti. It is completely his choice as to whether or not he
should offer it up, and he’s already chosen to act on all of our
behalfs. The Three Sovereigns of Mankind and the two leaders of
Daoism and Buddhism cannot possibly be spies. As for other major
powers…it is best to be a bit more cautious. Training in a divine
ability like this must be incredibly difficult. I don’t wish to see
all of us fail in learning it, only for it to be acquired by the
Seamless Gate and someone on their side mastering it. That would be a
nightmare.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed. We can’t
be hasty,” Lu Dongbin concurred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were actually
many major powers who were supportive of Subhuti’s decision. This
was primarily because the five mighty overlords were all standing
alongside Subhuti. Their influence and power was simply tremendous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thundergod began to
grow frantic. Although many of the major powers here wanted this
divine ability, mots of them would follow the lead of the five mighty
overlords. In addition, the chance that they would be able to
actually succeed in mastering this divine ability was miniscule.
Ninehorn Lightning Serpents weren’t so easily tamed, after all.
Thundergod, however, felt that he had a much better chance than the
rest of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was born from the
primordial chaos as one of the eighty-one original True Gods.”
Thundergod could no longer hold himself back, and he immediately
spoke out in a thunderous voice that echoed within the Void. “There’s
no way that I could possibly be willing to become a spy for the
Seamless Gate. In addition, in terms of control over lightning, I am
the number one expert in the entire Three Realms. I’m also
extremely familiar with Ninehorn Lightning Serpents. There’s a very
high chance that I will be able to master this divine ability.
Sovereigns of Mankind, Tathagata, Three Purities…can it be that all
of you believe that I, Thundergod, am not able to learn this divine
ability?”
</P>

Chapter 4 - Icefire Jindan Smelting
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Three Purities’
eyes had been shut this entire time. Suddenly, they opened up
slightly, his sword-like gaze landing upon Exalted Celestial
Thundergod. “Thundergod, this isn’t just about you. This will
have an impact on the lives of countless living beings on ours die.
How can we be so blasé about handing out this divine ability? If we
make just a single misstep and the Seamless Gate acquires it…we
might very well end up losing this entire war. We’ll never be able
to recover!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know that…but do
you really think that I’m a spy?!” Thundergod was still unwilling
to bow his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Three Purities
said calmly, “I know that you badly desire to learn this technique,
and that you think you have a good chance of succeeding.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course! Even Ji
Ning was able to learn it. My mastery over lightning is second to
none in the Three Realms. Why wouldn’t I be able to?” Thundergod
glanced at Ning, who was standing next to Subhuti. A lofty,
self-confident look was in his eyes. “I know more about Ninehorn
Lightning Serpents than anyone else. All I need is a tiny hint about
this technique and I might very well master it at one go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such arrogance.” A
deep, sonorous voice suddenly rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thundergod immediately
turned his head to look. He discovered that the speaker was the
fur-clad Suiren. Suiren’s beard flowed like the whiskers of a
dragon, and his gaze caused even Thundergod to feel his heart clench.
This was the most ancient, most powerful member of the human race.
Long ago, he had caused even Elder God Zhurong to bow his head and
admit inferiority. In the past, for the sake of protecting the human
race, Suiren had challenged all comers to display his power. He had
actually beaten Thundergod senseless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Most of the major
powers present understand that the big picture is what matters. They
know what matters and what doesn’t.” Suiren gave Thundergod a
look, then swept his gaze towards the others. “However…I imagine
that all of you are quite curious regarding this evasion divine
ability. I’ll let you all take a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Human Sovereign, you
must not.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You absolutely must
not.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, quite a few
major powers began to cry out in disagreement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we really do have
a spy amongst our ranks, that would be disastrous.” Exalted
Celestial Carefree argued frantically against it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Thundergod, his
eyes lit up. If he was able to acquire this technique, it would be a
wonderful thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no need to
worry,” Suiren said. “I’ll only reveal a very small part of
this evasion divine ability. This part is just one of the many
difficulties that are inherent in cultivating this technique. I trust
that after seeing this part…everyone will understand how difficult
it is to learn this technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After he spoke, one
flame after another began to appear within the Void around him. Every
single flame twisted into the form of a character, resulting in a
dense cluster of characters appearing within the Void. This was a
record of part of this technique. Instantly, all the major powers
looked towards it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The nearby
Ning hurriedly turned to look as well. “That’s really the
Ninehorn Lightning Serp-…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait. They changed
it a bit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quickly finished
reading through it. He continued to stand there quite calmly, not
saying a word…but in his heart, he sighed with utter amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The part of the
technique which Suiren had just made public pertained to the taming
of the Ninehorn Lightning Serpent. Originally, the technique had
described three items which one could use to tame the serpents; chaos
nectar, Myriad Thunders Godgems, and Thousandrot Godfruits. One of
them had to be used! The version which Suiren had publicized,
however, had a fourth, additional option…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To ‘use heartforce to
commune with the Ninehorn Lightning Serpent, then tame it’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, you can
see it for yourself.” Suiren’s sonorous voice boomed out,
reverberating within the Void. “This is the final part of the
[Ninehorn Lightning Serpent] evasion technique, the part which
involves the taming of the serpent itself. You can succeed by using
either chaos nectar, Myriad Thunders Godgems, or Thousandrot
Godfruits. But do any of you have any? Do they exist anywhere within
the Three Realms?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dead silence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone was thinking
on this matter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of these major
powers had previous slain alien Outsiders and had acquired techniques
from them, and thus had heard of those three items. Even in the
infinite primordial chaos, those three treasures were incredibly rare
and precious. They didn’t exist in the Three Realms at all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Without those three
treasures, the only option remaining is the fourth option, the most
clumsy option,” Suiren said. “To use heartforce to commune with a
lightning serpent and tame it. Ninehorn Lightning Serpents are
sentient, which is why they can be tamed, but to use heartforce to do
so is incredibly difficult, and the chances for success are
incredibly low. All of us have tried to use heartforce to tame the
serpents, but all of us failed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Three Purities
shook his head. “I can be considered as quite learned in the art of
heartforce, but I was still unable to tame a serpent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No one present knew
what to say. All five of them, with Subhuti being the sixth, had
failed?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that almost all of them had reached the fourth stage of heartforce.
Daoist Three Purities in particular was particularly skilled in the
application of heartforce; his breadth of knowledge in heartforce was
not one whit inferior to that of Old Man Yuan’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the end, it was
my young friend Ji Ning who succeeded. He is extremely talented in
the application of heartforce.” Suiren looked towards Ning, letting
out an approving sigh. “He was able to come up with a heartforce
sword technique years ago, after just a few decades of cultivation.
Then, during the Realmwar, he came up with his own soul heartforce
technique. Now, he’s successfully mastered the [Ninehorn Lightning
Serpent] evasion technique. I feel tremendous admiration for him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense that
Human Sovereign Suiren was looking towards him with a very gentle,
loving look in his eyes. Suiren’s repeated praises to all these
other major powers made Ning feel quite embarrassed, as in reality
Ning had relied on chaos nectar to succeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What he didn’t
understand was that Suiren, being the oldest human major power,
viewed all the talented humans who came after him as he would his own
grandchildren. He was extremely protective of humanity. Nuwa had
initially only created a few humans, after all; the race had only
proliferated after countless generations of procreation. It was
actually entirely possible that Ning held the blood of Suiren’s
lineage within his veins.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, it was
Suiren who ended up being the overlord who trained in the [Ninehorn
Lightning Serpent] technique. Thus, Suiren felt as though he owed
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Training in this
technique involves multiple difficulties. I’ve merely described one
of them to you.” Suiren stared at Thundergod. “Thundergod, do you
still believe that you can master it? As I recall…you’ve only
reached the second stage of heartforce.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thundergod was silent,
not saying a thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was unwilling to
accept this! But he also knew full well that if not even Daoist Three
Purities was able to use heartforce to tame the serpents, the chances
of him succeeding would be even more remote.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus, Thundergod…”
Subhuti said calmly, “Don’t think that just because Ji Ning was
able to learn this technique, that you would be able to learn it as
well. To learn this sort of supreme evasion technique…you need
strength, skill, and luck. You can’t be lacking in any of the
criteria!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why would you even
compare me to a puny little Empyrean God?” Thundergod snapped,
somewhat embarrassed and irritated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Houyi was once a
‘mere’ Empyrean God as well,” Subhuti said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…!”
Thundergod was infuriated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you continue to
have such a poor temper, you’ll probably never be able to break
through in heartforce.” After saying this, Subhuti couldn’t be
bothered to say anything else.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Exalted Celestial
Thundergod and the rest of his fellows were all born at the True God
level of power from the primordial chaos! However, there’s a flip
side to all things. They didn’t have the experience of starting
weak and slowly growing powerful. They didn’t undergo enough mental
toughtening, and so almost all of these True Gods and Elder Gods of
Primordial Chaos had poor talent for heartforce. Even the likes of
Daoist Three Purities and Lord Tathagata, who had been iron-willed
enough to repeatedly commit suicide and throw themselves into the
cycle of reincarnation, had only been able to reach the fourth level
of heartforce. As for those who merely had their clones go
reincarnate, their heartforce was even weaker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thundergod was clearly
a classic example. He was born with incredible power and arrogance.
Because of his great power, he was naturally able to hold great sway
over the lives and deaths of others, resulting in his terrible temper
growing even worse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep in his heart, he
viewed those weaker than him with disdain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those creatures were
nothing more than crawling worms! He was a True God of Primordial
Chaos. Those weak little fellows were nothing compared to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can all leave.
The six of us will discuss the matter of how to transmit this
technique to others without giving the Seamless Gate any chance to
steal it,” Daoist Three Purities said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the various
incarnations all began to vanish. Daoist Yu Qiu tore a hole through
the Void and left as well. As for Thundergod, he gave Ning a hard
look, then turned and left. Clearly, in his heart Thundergod had
already transferred to Ning all the resentment he felt for having
lost so much face in front of so many major powers today. All of this
was because of Ji Ning…a puny Empyrean God and True Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciple, no need to
quibble with Thundergod.” Subhuti looked at Ning, then chuckled.
“He was born a True God, but that was just a matter of luck. That
Dao-heart of his…he’s essentially reached his limit. He can
forget about improving even one whit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wouldn’t dare be
angry with him,” Ning said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Subhuti
nodded. “You can leave now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vast prisonworld.
The endless ‘skies’ of this world were covered with countless
divine runes. They were part of the large, marvelous formation that
extracted the essence the primordial chaos, refining it into chaos
nectar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even as Ning had been
negotiating with the Godking and meeting with the True Gods and
Daofathers, his two clones within this world continued to sweep
through it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Where did the [Ninehorn
Lightning Serpent] evasion technique come from? The prisonworld!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew very well
that this prisonworld was a tremendous source of karmic luck for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had to make good use
of it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, True God
Skysplitter, dominated the land for multiple chaos cycles. I’ve
killed more than a hundred puny True Immortals like you…who
would’ve thought that I’d end up dying in the hands of an ant?
What a joke. A joke!” A shackled True God dressed in tattered
clothes raised his head, roaring with fury.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His entire body blasted
apart, causing the entire area inside the formation to shudder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the white-robed
Ji Ning who was outside the formation, keeping the ‘Eight Fires
Qiankun World’ active, he could sense the three divine swords
within his body absorb an enormous amount of baleful energy, causing
them to rapidly grow. There was no way he was going to let all of
this baleful energy go to waste. With the Darknorth swords gone, he
had procured three other exquisite swords to use. He had also named
them ‘Darknorth swords’, and so he now had a total of six
‘Darknorth swords’. “This time, my luck wasn’t bad. I met a
True God who only had a little bit of divine power left. I managed to
finish him off after just a few years. Alas, everyone imprisoned here
had extraordinarily high status back in their world. All of them are
simply too proud.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After briefly
inspecting and collecting the relics left behind by True God
Skysplitter, Ning flew away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just one hour later, he
arrived at a vast prairie. A True Immortal dressed in beautiful
golden robes was imprisoned here, his shackles stretching off into an
empty Void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Odd. Most people
imprisoned here are conserving their energy, but this True Immortal
has kept his clothes in perfect shape.” The white-robed Ning flew
towards him through the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He is…True
Immortal Sevenwind?” Ning immediately recognized the person upon
seeing his face. Ning had engaged in multiple soulscours, and thus
now knew quite a bit regarding the chaos-kingdom of Pangaea. The True
Immortal in front of him had maintained his original appearance
instead of allowing himself to turn skeletally thin like the others,
making him easy to recognize.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quickly flew
forward, then descended outside the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Overseer?” The
beautifully dressed True Immortal looked at Ning, then suddenly
frowned. “You…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The chaos-kingdom of
Pangaea has already been destroyed.” Ning chuckled. “This
prisonworld has fallen into my hands. I can’t just sit outside such
a treasure vault without entering and making use of it, right? Thus,
you have two choices right now. One, let me soulscour you and take
away your treasures. Two…die. Prior to this, I’ve already
encountered and dealt with four True Gods and True Immortals. Here
are their treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. One Protocosmic
spirit-treasure after another began to appear in front of Ning,
hovering in the air and emanating auras of shocking power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empress Jin?
Skysplitter…” The formerly tranquil True Immortal Sevenwind’s
face instantly changed. Everyone imprisoned here was an influential
member of society in Pangaea. The True Immortals that Ning had
encountered were all first-tier True Immortals; he hadn’t
encountered a single one of the second-tier ones thus far. True
Immortal Sevenwind naturally knew how formidable the four slain ones
were.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hah.” True
Immortal Sevenwind laughed as he looked at Ning. “I’m nothing
more than a prisoner now. What’s the point of resisting? In the
future, would you be willing to release me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I have gain the
power I need to release you, I will,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Sevenwind
nodded, then shut his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was absolutely
delighted. This was the fifth True God/True Immortal he had
encountered. The previous four had required quite a bit of time and
effort on his power to deal with, but this one had been willing to
submit right away. Ning immediately stretched out with his hand. His
arm stretched out hundreds of kilometers, landing atop True Immortal
Sevenwind’s head as Ning began the soulscour.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time continued to flow
onwards, one minute after the next.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning suddenly
halted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Icefire Jindan
Smelting]?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In True Immortal
Sevenwind’s memories, Ning discovered a particular thought-bubble
that was unprotected by any life-oaths which contained something
called the [Icefire Jindan Smelting] technique. Ning’s soul quickly
began to memorize the contents of the thought-bubble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s long arm
rapidly began to shrink as he returned to normal. He just stood
there, dazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Icefire Jindan
Smelting]…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninefire
Lava…Iceheart Pith…” Ning mumbled to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is this…destiny?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Earlier, when Exalted
Celestial Thundergod had shown Ning disdain, Ning hadn’t grown
angry. His heartforce had reached the fourth level; he knew very well
that he was indeed just an Empyrean God and True Immortal. Although
he had a formidable evasion technique, he was still far, far away
from the power level of a top-tier Daofather like Thundergod.
Thundergod would be able to kill him ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no one to
blame for it from himself for being weak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ning wanted to prove
himself to the Daofathers, he had to train to a level where he was
equal in power to them! However, he truly didn’t expect that in
such a short period of time after the gathering of Daofathers, he
would discover a Jindan upgrade method within his prisonworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Upgrading the Jindan
requires outside sources of energy and materials. Chaos ingredients
are necessary.” Ning sighed softly to himself, “I had thought
that even if I was to obtain such a technique, actually upgrading my
Jindan would be incredibly difficult. I’d have to find many Chaos
ingredients, and it’s quite possible that I would never find many
of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This [Icefire Jindan
Smelting] technique requires just two types of Chaos ingredients;
Ninefire Lava and Iceheart Pith. Although it’ll be hard, it’s
still possible for me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire Lava…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had heard of it
long ago. It existed in the Three Realms! The Three Realms was born
from the collision of two large chaosworlds, after all, and it had
many major powers who often roamed the primordial chaos, collecting
quite a few Chaos ingredients. Right at this very moment, the
treasure vaults of the Sovereigns of Mankind held Ninefire Lava
within it. He absolutely could trade for it using his own treasures!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, the ‘Ninefire
Lava’ would be easily acquired. It wasn’t viewed as particularly
precious in the Three Realms, because to date the Three Realms had
discovered no use for it, aside from using it to forge treasures! For
now, the Three Realms had discovered no other uses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Iceheart Pith,
it didn’t exist in the Three Realms. But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Iceheart Pith can be
found in Undermoon Lake!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Undermoon Lake had
Iceheart Leaves…and Iceheart Leaves grew out of Iceheart Pith.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate’s
Godking is forcing me into Undermoon Lake. Now that I have this
Jindan upgrade method, I’m in desperate need of Iceheart Pith. And
I just so happen to be heading towards Undermoon Lake…” Ning
suddenly felt that fate truly worked in mysterious ways.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter what…I
absolutely have to acquire Iceheart Pith! So long as I acquire those
two Chaos ingredients, I’ll be able to use this [Icefire Jindan
Smelting]] method. By then, I’ll be a second-tier True Immortal;
I’ll have half-stepped into the Daofather level.” Ning finally
began to have the feeling that he was beginning to gain the power he
needed to fight back in this war.

Chapter 5 - The Treasury
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal world.
The towering Five Treasured Peaks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning stood atop a
cloud in front of the stone cliffs of the fourth peak, staring
intently at the fourth chapter of the [Five Treasures] sword-art.
Ning hadn’t been in a hurry to immediately go to Undermoon Lake
after the meeting with the Nuwa Alliance’s major powers. He first
headed to the Five Treasured Peaks to carefully read through chapter
four.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had been years, but
despite all his hard work Ning remained unable to master the third
chapter! It was obvious that for him to read through the fourth
chapter before mastering the third was a bit too impatient. The
reason he was doing this was because he was about to enter Undermoon
Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Undermoon Lake was an
incredibly mysterious place. Once he entered, he would be completely
shut off from the outside world. Not even his Primaltwin or his other
clones would be able to communicate with the clone that had entered
Undermoon Lake! Ever since the Primordial Era, thousands of Empyrean
Gods had entered Undermoon Lake, many of whom had Primlatwins or
other clones living in the Three Realms. This was the reason why
despite that, no one knew exactly what was inside Undermoon Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To this very day,
Buddha Jueming was the only person to leave the place after having
entered it. He had come back with three treasures, but had only said
that the place contained many treasures within it. He had carefully
described these three treasures to others, but with regards to the
dangers and events which occurred within Undermoon Lake, he was
completely close-mouthed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only person who had
ever left the place was unwilling to say anything about it at all.
Undermoon Lake was a complete mystery!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Buddha Jueming had
entered when he was merely an Empyrean God. After he became a Buddha,
many Empyrean Gods in the Three Realms felt certain that Undermoon
Lake must be a place of fortune and tempering. Thus, there were still
many who were willing to enter the lake and risk their lives. Alas…no
one else had ever left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My true body’s
clones shall immediately lose contact with the outside world upon
entering Undermoon Lake. I’m afraid I’ll spend quite a bit of
time within it. If that’s the case, the clone that enters Undermoon
Lake will work hard on the [Five Treasures] sword-art with the
primary goal of perfecting the ‘Shadowless’ stance of my
[Brightmoon] sword-art. As for my other clones and my Primaltwin
clones in the Three Realms, they’ll meditate on the [Five
Treasures] to improve the other four stances of [Brightmoon].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no way to
link the memories together when separated by Undermoon Lake. There
was no point in duplicating his efforts in Undermoon Lake and the
Three Realms; that would be a waste of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Shadowless stance
was the most mysterious stance, and an incredibly fast one. For a
single clone to train in it was quite suitable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After returning from
Undermoon Lake, his memories would merge together again. Because they
had been training in completely different things, once all those
memories merged, his insights might very well increase dramatically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Icefire Jindan
Smelting]?” The Ning who was carefully reading the fourth chapter,
attempting to get a clearer picture of it, was suddenly stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the moment
that his clone within the prisonworld had discovered the [Icefire
Jindan Smelting] technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I had been planning
to closely read through the [Five Treasures], then head straight to
Undermoon Lake. Now, it seems, I need to pay a visit to the
Humanworld of Yu the Great first,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A day later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having memorized
the [Five Treasures] multiple times, Ning boarded his Voidboat and
flew towards the headquarters of the Primordial Imperial Clan, the
Humanworld of Yu the Great.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Ji
Ning.” A voice rang out as a muscular, fur-clad man appeared out of
nowhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empyrean God Fuqu.”
Ning smiled. Last time, it had been Fuqu who had welcomed him as
well. This was primarily because one of Fuqu’s primary
responsibilities in the Primordial Imperial Clan was to welcome
guests.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fuqu looked at Ning
with a gaze that was a bit different than before. This was because,
just a day ago, Ning had shown off his [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent]
technique and roamed through the Three Realms, slaughtering the
Seamless Gate’s forces until the Seamless Gate had bowed their
heads. News of this had quickly spread out, and even the major powers
of the Nuwa Alliance were often discussing this matter. They all
tsked and sighed appreciatively, “Ji Ning truly is talented in
heartforce.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the major powers
of the Nuwa Alliance truly believed that Ning had relied on
heartforce alone to tame a serpent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, after Suiren
had carefully analyzed and researched the [Ninehorn Lightning
Serpent] technique, he had the feeling that there was a tiny chance
one could indeed use heartforce to tame a serpent, which was why he
inserted the part about heartforce into the technique’s
description. This also served the dual purpose of hiding the fact
that they had the necessary chaos nectar. Only by deceiving their own
would they also be able to deceive the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Might I ask why you
have come again, fellow Daoist Ji Ning?” Empyrean God Fuqu asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wish to pay a
visit to the treasury and trade for some treasures,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh. Quite a few
fellow Daoists of the Three Realms have come to visit the treasury,
but this is your first trip, fellow Daoist Ji Ning. I had thought
that our treasures didn’t match up to your expectations.” Fuqu
chortled. “Come, come. Follow me in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later, two
streaks of light shot past the winding clouds that were outside a
grouping of ancient palaces. They flew straight into one of the
palaces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Primordial
Imperial Clan truly is extraordinary.” As Ning flew forward, he
paid close attention to his surroundings, and he couldn’t help but
feel stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nominal managing
power of the Three Realms, the Celestial Court, was extremely
beautiful and filled with lofty jade buildings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial palace of
the Grand Xia had the Skylight Palace, an absolutely dominating
fixture that was not one whit inferior to the Celestial Court.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Palaces of Mankind
of the Primordial Imperial Clan was quite simple and plain. And yet,
every single palace gave Ning a sensation of tremendous pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our human race spent
countless years during the Primordial Era to build them,” Fuqu said
proudly. “We produced a total of thirty-six top-grade Pure
Yang-level magic treasures which could be used as palaces. Over the
course of time, they’ve grown more powerful and all of them have
become Protocosmic spirit-treasures. These thirty-six supreme
Protocosmic spirit-treasures match perfectly with a formation-diagram
which Human Sovereign Fuxi has created, and their joint power is
equal to that of a Chaos treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All those years ago,
during the war that destroyed the Primordial Era, the Palaces of
Mankind played a major role and rendered many merits,” Fuqu said
proudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nind nodded, sighing in
amazement. The Palaces of Mankind were indeed like an impregnable
fort!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the Palace
of the Numerous Heavens.” Fuqu led Ning into a large gray palace.
“The treasury is right inside. There are a few Immortals inside
right now as well. Pick what you want. As long as you have enough
treasure, you’ll be allowed to trade for it. I still have other
tasks to attend to, so I won’t stay here with you any longer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Empyrean
God Fuqu,” Ning said with a smile. Fuqu transformed into a streak
of light and departed, leaving Ning here. Ning turned and stepped
inside the treasury.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many of the major
powers and experts of the Nuwa Palace had placed the treasures they
didn’t need into this place. It made for an utterly astonishing
sight!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were piles of
powerful Protocosmic spirit-treasures, and the weakest treasures here
were at least at the Pure Yang level. There were many Chaos
ingredients and materials as well. Virtually everything could be
found here!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During normal times,
the various major powers would probably hide their treasures in other
locations, making these items almost impossible to locate and trade
for. Now that the storm had descended, everyone took out everything
they didn’t need.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What fine
treasures.” Ning knew, however, that only treasures which were a
good fit for him were truly ‘good’ treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He first procured five
kilograms of the two other types of materials the Seamless Gate had
requested. In truth, the Seamless Gate had underestimated Ji Ning. As
they saw it, he was still just an Empyrean God and True Immortal; if
they demanded too many valuable treasures, there would be no way Ji
Ning could produce them. Thus, two of the three treasures the Godking
had requested were fairly common.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If they knew that Ning
had acquired a prisonworld of the chaos-kingdom of Pangaea, giving
him thousands of times as many treasures as they had expected, they
would probably feel quite regretful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How much of this
Ninefire Lava do you have?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Darknorth.”
Instantly, a Celestial Immortal walked over and said respectfully,
“We have quite a bit of this Ninefire Lava, more than a million
kilograms. All of it was discovered in the past by Human Sovereign
Suiren in the primordial chaos. If you need more, senior Darknorth,
the Human Sovereign should be able to provide you with it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “Give me
half a million kilograms of it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos materials could
differ greatly in value. Chaos goldstone, for example, was available
in almost limitless supply. Some of the medicinal herbs that could be
found in the primordial chaos were extremely rare and valuable, while
others could be produced in enormous batches.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire Lava and
Iceheart Pith were fairly average items as Chaos materials went.
Whenever they appeared, they would appear in large quantities. The
Iceheart Leaves of Undermoon Lake grew out of large quantities of
Iceheart Pith; although the pith was valuable, it was naturally on a
lower level of value compared to the leaves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Icefire Jindan
Smelting]…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were different
levels to the technique. This was much like how the higher levels of
Ning’s [Starseizing Hand] required increasingly large amounts and
increasingly expensive types of Five Elements treasures!’
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When smelting a
treasure, the more valuable the ingredients you used, the more
powerful the flames would have to be to smelt it! In turn, the
higher-level the Jindan in the body was, the more materials the
[Icefire Jindan Smelting] technique would require.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Celestial Immortal’s
Jindan needed one level of items, while a True Immortal’s Jindan
would require a high level’s worth of items. As for an Ancestral
Immortal/Daofather’s Jindan…those were simply far too powerful.
To transform them would require even more treasures, none of which
would be so easily acquired.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to my
records, to advance a True Immortal’s Jindan from the third-tier to
the second-tier will require 5000 kilograms of Ninefire Lava and 5000
kilograms of Iceheart Pith. I have more than thirty clones; I’ll
need more than 150,000 kilograms of each. Alright…the Ninefire Lava
was the easy part. Iceheart Pith…I wonder how much of it exists in
Undermoon Lake.” Ning boarded the Voidboat, then left the Palaces
of Mankind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning only had to hand
over six Protocosmic spirit-treasures and three sets of top-grade
Pure Yang treasures. The Empyrean Gods and True Immortals of the
Seamless Gate which Ning had slain had provided Ning with dozens of
Protocosmic spirit-treasures. It was normal for ordinary Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals to have several Protocosmic spirit-treasures
with them, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go to
Undermoon Lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Voidboat quickly
traversed through the great Void, speeding towards and entering the
infinite primordial chaos.

Chapter 6 - The World of Undermoon Lake
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prisonworld 17.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
A series of white-robed figures flew through the region of primordial
chaos, entering the vast prisonworld. A total of sixteen white-robed
figures levitated in midair. All eighteen of Ning’s clones had
entered the prisonworld now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Before I go to
Undermoon Lake, I need to complete certain careful preparations.”
Fifteen of the sixteen white-robed youths instantly vanished, leaving
behind only the one with the Ninehorn Lightning Serpent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. An enormous
black lightning serpent streaked through the skies, rapidly flying
off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning had
acquired quite a few treasures thanks to his many battles against the
Seamless Gate, that amount couldn’t come close to comparing to the
things he had gained from this prisonworld. Even the prisonworld’s
Empyrean Gods and Celestial Immortals had carried extremely rare and
valuable treasures with him, thanks to the fact that all of them had
extraordinary backgrounds. As for the True Gods and True Immortals,
they were equivalent to the Daofathers of the Three Realms, and so
their treasures were even more shocking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Undermoon Lake is
too mysterious a place. To this very day, only Buddha Jueming managed
to survive it and emerge from it. It’s very possible that this
clone of mine will die inside. I need to bring some good treasures
with me, but I can’t take the very best ones,” Ning mused to
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus far, Ning had
already disposed of Empress Jin, True God Skysplitter, and three
other True Gods and True Immortals. These were all figures that were
comparable to Daofathers! Every single one of them possessed
treasures that were far better than Ning’s Voidboat and Darknorth
swords. Although most weren’t a good fit for Ning, there were some
that were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True God Skysplitter,
for example. After he self-detonated and died, he had left behind a
total of nine divine swords. Each of them were Protocosmic
spirit-treasures, and they formed a complete set! This set of swords
alone was enough to make the True Gods and Daofathers of the Three
Realms turn glaze-eyed with lust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no way Ning
would be willing to take them into Undermoon Lake. Even in the
prisonworld, only a few True Gods and True Immortals specialized in
the sword. It was entirely possible that after sweeping through the
entire prisonworld, he still wouldn’t be able to find a better set
of swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My true body has
eighteen clones. I’ll send two of them into Undermoon Lake; sending
an extra clone will give me an extra chance for success.” Ning made
up his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two clone he had
sent naturally didn’t include the clone that possessed the Ninehorn
Lightning Serpent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the eighteen clones,
just a single one was in possession of a Ninehorn Lightning Serpent.
These serpents were far too hard to come by; if he ended up losing it
within Undermoon Lake, he would feel endless regret.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll take these
treasures with me.” Ning finished selecting his treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First, he chose a set
of 729 top-grade Pure Yang flying swords which he would use for the
[Greater Thousand Swords] formation. He had acquired 720 of these
swords from the first Celestial Immortal he had met in the
prisonworld, Liangqiu. There weren’t many Empyrean Gods or True
Immortals in the Three Realms who could afford to be spend so much on
swords. This set would allow him to launch distant attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next, he chose a set of
twelve swords that were well-suited for close combat. All of them
were also top-grade Pure Yang swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After that, he selected
a Protocosmic spirit-treasure meant for fleeing, the ‘Ruyi
Soulsnake Shuttle’ <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="#Top_of_Section0003_xhtml">1</A></U></FONT>.
Ning actually had several Protocosmic treasures of this type, having
acquired three from the True Gods and True Immortals of the
prisonworld and a few from the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Naturally, h,e also
brought along some Ninefire Lava and other necessary treasures such
as spirit pills. No one knew how long he would be trapped there,
after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning brought along
fifty thousand kilograms of Ninefire Lava. Supposedly, Undermoon Lake
had Iceheart Pith inside; he would absolutely be able to refine and
upgrade his golden pellet Jindan with Undermoon Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After completing his
preparations, the white-robed Ning boarded his Ruyi Soulsnake Shuttle
and began to travel towards Undermoon Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms. Sword
Immortal world. The thatched cottage in front of the Five Treasured
Peaks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
was seated in the lotus position within the cottage. Since his true
bodies were going to hide for now, it was time for the Primaltwin
Ning to take the lead. It was now the Primaltwin which carried the
Starseizing Manor with it. Given how strong the Primaltwin was, it
was also capable of joining together into the Rahu Formation as it
pleased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous star hung
there in the primordial chaos, emanating a gentle aura of light that
shone down upon the chaos around it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This star was very
similar to the Lunar Star. Because the Lunar Star was located in the
Void outside the Three Realms, there was no chaos blocking its light,
allowing it to shine down upon the entire Three Realms. Although the
star in front of Ning was very similar to the Lunar Star, it wasn’t
particularly famous. The countless ordinary denizens of the Three
Realms, at least, had no idea of its existence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Undermoon Lake!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seated within his Ruyi
Soulsnake Shuttle, the white-robed youth stared off into the
distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An utterly titanic lake
of water hung there in the middle of the primordial chaos. It was so
vast, even Ning’s heartforce couldn’t cover it all. The surface
of this endless lake of water was extremely calm and tranquil, making
it as flat and smooth as a mirror. It reflected the image of the
enormous nearby star, which appeared within it like the reflection of
the moon. It truly was absolutely mesmerizing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Undermoon Lake truly
is an odd place. One has to be an Empyrean God to enter it; anyone
else, including True Gods and Daofathers, are completely unable to
pass through it. If they try to force their way into the lake, the
waters of the lake will squeeze and compress around them, preventing
them from entering the world within.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t hesitate.
“Time to go in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Ruyi Soulsnake
Shuttle swooped into the water. Plop! Water sprayed upwards from the
point of impact as Ning and the shuttle both completely disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the instant that he
entered Undermoon Lake, Ning felt a strange ripple of energy surround
him. And then, spacetime distorted and changed. This was a subtle
transformation that was filled with the faint aura of primordial
chaos. Given Ning’s heartforce abilities, even when Patriarch
Subhuti used a spacetime-distorting technique he would still be able
to see and potentially evade it, but this spacetime distortion came
naturally, not revealing any flaws or traces at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning fell down from the
skies. As soon as he landed, he saw that he was standing upon a piece
of scorched rock that was three hundred meters long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place is…?”
Ning put away the shuttle, scanning his surroundings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was surrounded by a
seemingly endless sea. Its waves continuously washed across the
scorched stone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A bright moon hung high
in the sky, its cold and clear moonlight shining down upon the entire
sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…” Ning
stared at this in astonishment. Ahead of him was a floating wooden
bridge. At one end of the bridge was this scorched stone he was
standing upon, while the other end stretched far off into the
horizon, where sea met sky. Not even Ning could see to the end of the
bridge with his eyes alone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How long is this
floating bridge?” Ning was speechless. He immediately sent out his
heartforce to take a look. Ning had already grown accustomed to using
heartforce in dangerous areas, because it was even more unfathomable
and mysterious than coresense. True Gods and Daofathers who were
weaker than him in heartforce wouldn’t even notice him scanning
them. But of course, they in turn would be able to scan him with
coresense without him noticing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? My heartforce…?”
Ning’s heart clenched. He had clearly spread out his heartforce,
but he wasn’t able to find anything at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Coresense.” Ning
immediately sent out his coresense to investigate as well, but as he
had expected, even coresense was unable to detect a thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face changed.
Very, very few in the Three Realms were capable of blocking out
coresense and heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That bright moon in
the skies…where is that moon from?” Ning raised his head to stare
at the moon. “Can it be the star outside this world?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Ning soared
into the skies, flying higher and higher. He flew for hundreds of
thousands of kilometers before, with a thud, he rammed into an
invisible barrier. A series of concentric ripples spread out from the
part of the barrier which Ning struck. As for the bright moon, it was
still far, far above him in the depths of the sky. There was no way
to move any closer to it at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning pondered carefully
for a moment, then elected to once more return to that floating
wooden bridge. He advanced rapidly, because he had the feeling that
the reason why this bridge existed was to serve as a guide for people
to know where to go.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thousands of
Empyrean Gods have entered Undermoon Lake since ancient times. Why
haven’t I encountered any of them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there atop
his Ruyi Soulsnake Shuttle. The shuttle followed the floating wooden
bridge forward, advancing at a rapid pace. It flew for millions of
kilometers, but still the only thing to be seen was the endless sea
and that lonely little bridge. The only sound that could be heard was
that of the water slapping against the sides of the bridge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This made Ning even
more wary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although Buddha
Jueming successfully escaped this place, he refused to say anything
about it. Even when other major powers asked him, he still refused to
say a thing. As for the thousands of other Empyrean Gods…” Ning
frowned. “Are all of them dead?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thought of how
thousands of Empyrean Gods might have perished here made Ning even
more nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh. He continued
to fly forward, the shuttle advancing at an astonishing pace. He had
flown for more than a hundred million kilometers, but there was still
nothing besides the endless bridge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, far off in
the distance, an ugly green head suddenly popped out from beneath the
surface of the sea. The head stared at the distant white-robed youth
aboard the shuttle. Because Ning was only able to see with his eyes,
he wasn’t able to discover the appearance of this creature.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here comes another
one,” the jade-green head mused softly, eyes filled with an excited
gleam of bloodlust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> 1. Ruyi is a very
difficult to translate term which basically means, ‘as one wills’;
it suggests that it can transform free in size and shape, or that it
will allow him to go where he desires.  <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="#1">↩</A></U></FONT>

Chapter 7 - Yaksha
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ruyi Soulsnake
Shuttle followed the floating bridge forward, flying at high speed.
Ji Ning, however, maintained a vigilant watch. He continued to have
the feeling that the seemingly-peaceful world of Undermoon Lake was
hiding a terrifyingly lethal danger within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within the depths
of the sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A completely jade-green
human-shaped figure, steel warfork in hand, was drawing close to Ning
at high speed. Every so often, he would vanish and reappear more than
a hundred thousand kilometers away. Soon, he stealthily arrived in an
area located in front of Ning. His dark-red gaze pierced through the
water, seeing the distant shuttle fly forward at high speed along the
bridge’s path. His long tongue licked his lower jaw as he murmured
to himself, “It’s rare for new prey to come. I hope this one is
strong. Otherwise, it’ll be quite boring.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah, here he comes.
Attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The jade-green humanoid
suddenly burst out from the surface of the sea, transforming into a
green blur that streaked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Although he
had been flying for a long period of time, he hadn’t relaxed at
all. Ning was rather shocked. “He was able to get so close to me
without me noticing at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s pupils were
filled with torchlight, and he used the [Torch Dragon’s Eye] to see
his foe clearly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an oceanic
creature that looked rather like a yaksha-demon. The yaksha had a
pair of dark-red eyes that were filled with a baleful, murderous
aura, and it was wielding a steel warfork that it stabbed straight
towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to capture
him and take a good look.” Ning stretched out with his arm, and it
instantly expanded, transforming and becoming enormous enough to
cover the skies themselves as his fingers reached out to the jade
yaksha. This was Ning’s [Starseizing Hand] divine ability. The
yaksha sensed a tremendous amount of danger from this attack, and it
immediately roared in a shrill voice, “BREAK!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? This jade yaksha
speaks in the language of Pangaea?” Ning murmured to himself.
However, he showed no mercy at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the steel
warfork stabbed into his palm, the enormous star-seizing hand still
wrapped itself around the jade yaksha, capturing it. No matter how it
struggled, it was unable to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tell me, what
exactly is going on in this world? And what happened to the thousands
of Empyrean Gods who came before?” Ning barked coldly, his hand
still wrapped firmly around the creature.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heh heh, so you have
a bit of talent after all. How unexpected.” The captured yaksha
actually let out a shrill laugh, dark-red eyes staring weighingly at
Ning. “Interesting, quite interesting. It’s been a long time
since I’ve encountered a formidable opponent. You were able to
capture my clone in just a single exchange…this will be fun. Fun!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clone?” Ning was
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kid…this was just
the start.” The green-haired yaksha laughed savagely, then suddenly
transformed into a stream of liquid that quickly flew out from Ning’s
palm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Transformed into
water?” Ning barked coldly, “Even if you transform into a damn
ghost, you still won’t escape!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Yet another
enormous palm came sweeping over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s left and right
hands seemed to have transformed into two enormous black stormclouds.
They viciously clapped against each other. BOOM!!!! The stream of
water that was caught between those two enormous hands was instantly
and completely destroyed, leaving behind only a shrill voice
reverberating in the empty skies: “Ahahaha…how intriguing…how
intriguing!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After slaying the
yaksha, Ning once returned to stand within his Ruyi Soulsnake
Shuttle. The sea wind blew past him, causing his white robes to
flutter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Judging from what
that jade yaksha said, just now I merely battled one of his clones?
And he tried to kill me without negotiating or speaking to me at all.
I haven’t encountered any Empyrean Gods yet….is it because all of
them have been killed?” Ning couldn’t help but shiver. Thousands
of Empyrean Gods…perhaps the vast majority were ordinary in power,
but some were truly top-tier experts. A few might be even more
powerful than Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ning didn’t use
the Rahu Formation, on Mount Innerheart alone the likes of Redsnow,
Silvermoon, and Goldcrow were figures that Ning was no match for. In
an actual battle, there were too many deficiencies in Ning’s
understanding of the Dao. Only if Ning’s swordforce reached the
fourth stage would he become equal to the likes of Redsnow in a
frontal battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to be even
more careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ruyi Soulsnake
Shuttle continued to fly forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Intriguing. He was
actually able to wipe out one of my clones.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha…it’s rare
for me to encounter a tough enemy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But the tough ones
are fun.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One jade yaksha after
another began to emerge from the depths of the sea in front of Ning,
hastening towards him at high speed. At the same time, their shrill
voices echoed within the world. After the time needed to boil a
kettle of tea, Ning heard their shrill voices echoing in the skies.
Shrill voices and strange laughter seemed to come forth from every
corner of the seas. Clearly, there were an enormous number of these
creatures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are they all
gathering together?” Ning’s eyes blazed with torch-light as he
stared at his surroundings. He was able to see past the water and
locate the many jade yakshas that had appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many?!” Ning
was rather stunned. His [Torch Dragon’s Eye] alone was able to see
more than a hundred of those yakshas. Although he had slain the first
yaksha in a seemingly simple manner, in truth the yaksha had
essentially likely reached the Empyrean God level of power. If there
were enough of them, they would be able to overwhelm him with raw
numbers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Explosions could be
heard throughout the sea. One jade yaksha after another burst through
the surface of the sea, standing on the water and completely
surrounding Ning. All of them stared at Ning, filled with
maliciousness and avarice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a thought, Ning
put away the shuttle. He had noticed earlier that the speed of the
shuttle was actually inferior to that of the jade yakshas. Thus,
there was no choice but to fight; escape was not an option.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“519 clones.” A
pair of blood-colored swords appeared in Ning’s hands. By now, he
had no choice but to rely on his sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t wish to be
your enemy.” Ning’s gaze swept past every single one of the many
jade yakshas surrounding him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha…but I want
to kill you, kid.” The 519 jade yakshas simultaneously spoke out,
saying the same words. When their voices merged together, they
actually had the power to shake one’s Dao-heart. “Be careful,
now. If you end up dying in my hands, don’t claim that I tricked
you or plotted against you. I’m battling against you openly and
fairly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, swords in hands,
grew even more wary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly…swoosh!
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! ….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ten of the jade yakshas
simultaneously circled around and attacked Ning with their steel
warforks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A killing intent
suddenly flashed in the eyes of the white-robed Ning. The
blood-colored swords in his hands suddenly transformed into blurs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash. Slash. Slash.
Slash…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bodies of the jade
yakshas were each bisected. In a single clash, ten of them had been
cut in half.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Brightmoon] sword-art,
Shadowless stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Shadowless stance:
This was a very fast stance that was the strangest stance of all. It
was meant to attack from an unpredictable angle and chop the enemy in
half. Clearly, these jade yakshas were unable to block Ning’s
sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s face
changed slightly. The bodies of the bisected yakshas first
transformed into water, then reformed to become ten more jade
yakshas. And then…frenzied, bloodlusted looks appeared in the eyes
of the 519 jade yakshas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, the 500-plus
jade yakshas all simultaneously charged towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Three Heads, Six
Arms]!” Ning’s body blurred, then reformed with three heads and
six arms. He now wielded six swords as well. Faced with the utterly
relentless horde of enemies, Ning didn’t dare to use the [Greater
Thousand Swords Formation] against them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s six blood-red
swords transformed into bloody blurs. They were simply too fast! The
bloody blurs swirled around around Ning, completely blocking and
halting all of the assaulting jade yakshas. In fact, many of their
bodies were chopped apart and knocked flying, but moments later they
would reform unharmed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the ‘slain’
yakshas were able to reform after being bisected, Ning had the
feeling that after doing so they would become noticeably weaker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, Ning felt a
sense of pressure and danger. The enemies were simply too numerous,
and all of them could be said to have reached the Empyrean God level
of power. Even against Ning’s sword-arts, the yakshas managed to
land the occasional blow against his body. However, Ning’s body had
reached the Ninth Cycle of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]; it wouldn’t
be easy to damage. If this continued, in the end it was more likely
that the enemy would be the first to lose this war of attrition. At
present, Ning had only used [Three Heads, Six Arms] after all; this
divine ability used up very little divine power. In addition, at the
Empyrean God level the body was further perfected, easily capable of
battling for months on end. If Ning used the [Starseizing Hand], the
amount of time he’d be able to battle would be decreased a
hundredfold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“DAMN!!!!” A
furious bellow suddenly shook the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The 519 jade yakshas
simultaneously retreated backwards, levitating up into midair. All of
them appeared utterly furious. Then, all of them began to ram against
each other, completely merging into each other with each collision.
The number of jade yakshas in the skies began to decrease as more and
more of them began to fuse together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more yakshas fused
together, the darker a green they became. Soon, their color became as
black as night…but then, they became a dark-gold color. When the
two final dark-gold yakshas rammed against each other, they
transformed into a golden yaksha that held such power as to cause
even Ning amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This golden yaksha was
thirty meters tall, and his aura was extremely close to that of a
True God’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To force me to use
my true body in battle…you aren’t bad. Over the course of all
these years, more than a thousand Empyrean Gods died without even
seeing my true body,” the golden yaksha growled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! More than a
thousand?!” Ning’s heart shook. Most of the thousands of Empyrean
Gods who had entered this place belonged to the Nuwa Alliance. Many
had entered back during the Primordial Era, after all, and almost all
of those belonged to the Nuwa Alliance. Ning had been hoping that he
would be able to come up with a way to rescue the thousands of
Empyrean Gods trapped here, but…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Apparently, an enormous
number had died by the hands of this yaksha. Indeed…surrounded by
more than five hundred yakshas, very few would be able to survive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…the number
of Empyrean Gods that died to my true body is in excess of two
thousand.” The golden yaksha stared at Ning. Light suddenly flashed
within his hands, and a steel warfork that looked ancient suddenly
appeared within it. The steel warfork looked very plain and simple,
but it clearly had an aura of incredible power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You should rejoice
in the fact that you will die to my true body,” the golden yaksha
laughed savagely. “All of you want to acquire the relics which my
master left behind…did you really think it would be that easy?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes narrowed.
Master?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, as soon as he
had entered Undermoon Lake, Ning had the feeling that this was a
place that was artificially created by a major power of the ancient
days. The floating wooden bridge spanned countless kilometers, and
neither coresense nor heartforce could be used to scan this place. It
all suggested that this was part of a deliberate design by a major
power; it didn’t seem like something that would naturally emerge
from the primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you want the
treasures…use your life to trade for them!” The golden yaksha
laughed strangely, and then, steel warfork in his hands…suddenly
vanished. He left behind just a golden streak of light in the air as
he suddenly appeared before Ning. He was simply too fast; Ning only
had barely enough time to use his sword to block.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning transformed into a
shooting star as he was knocked flying backwards. From this initial
clash, Ning understood that the foe’s power was very close to that
of a True God’s. “No wonder more than three thousand Empyrean
Gods died to by hands.”

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are too weak.
Too weak!” The golden yaksha’s frenzied voice echoed throughout
the heavens as he once more transformed into a streak of golden
light, chasing after Ji Ning and assaulting him repeatedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was knocked flying
backwards repeatedly, sometimes being driven into the sea, sometimes
somersaulting backwards in rather pathetic fashion. He was at a
definite, absolute disadvantage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are really
weak…but your body’s pretty tough. My [Seagod Yaksha] is
incredibly strong, but you are able to easily absorb this type of
punishment.” The golden yaksha continued to attack as he spoke,
laughing wildly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His words were correct;
any ordinary Empyrean God body that wasn’t protected by the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art] would’ve long ago been destroyed by now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But if he didn’t have
the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], Ning wouldn’t have dared to choose
this style of fighting either!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s very strong
and incredibly fast, but his agility is average. His combat
techniques are all quite ordinary.” Over the course of this battle,
Ning quickly deduced his foe’s strengths and weaknesses. “When
fighting against him, I can’t just take him head on. I have to use
the intricacies of my sword-arts to deal with him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly burst
forth from the surface of the sea, as did the golden yaksha which was
in hot pursuit of him.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come.” Two swords
in his hands, a fierce light flashed through Ning’s eyes. It was
time to counterattack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a total of
729 swords appeared out of nowhere. These swords all undulated in
different manners as they levitated in the air. In front of Ning’s
chest, a jade sword began to take form. The power of this jade sword
was terrifyingly great. The only reason why Ning was able to use the
ninth stage of the [Greater Thousand Swords Formation] was entirely
because he had fourth-level heartforce and a soul heartforce
technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This jade sword that
was manifested by merging the power of 729 top-grade Pure Yang
swords. It’s power was definitely not weaker than Ning’s when
using the [Starseizing Hand]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Ning pointed
towards the distant Yaksha.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha, he’s
actually using an Immortal technique.” The golden yaksha laughed
wildly, continuing to crush forward. He didn’t care if Ning was
going to use close combat or long-range attacks; with his absolute
advantage in power, he was crush Ning with overwhelming force.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The jade sword struck
out towards the golden yaksha, seeking to avoid the yakshas defenses,
but the yaksha was simply too strong. A brandishing block with the
steel warfork was able to block in time. With a ‘bang’ sound, the
jade sword was instantly destroyed, while the golden yaksha merely
paused for a moment in midair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even the ninth stage
of the [Greater Thousand Swords Formation] is only able to cause him
to pause slightly? It seems I’ll have to use heartforce.” A
second jade sword materialized in front of Ji Ning’s body, and his
invisible heartforce surged into it. The power of the second jade
sword instantly rose, transforming it on a qualitative level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fourth stage
heartforce, in and of itself, was far more powerful than the
ninth-stage [Greater Thousand Swords Formation].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When using fourth stage
heartforce, Ning would be able to reach the apex of power possible
for Empyrean Gods and True Immortals for a short period of time. The
only difference was that the likes of Redsnow would be able to fight
at that level for a sustained period of time, whereas Ning would only
be able to do so briefly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s useless. That
tiny bit of power you have is usel-…” The golden yaksha was
roaring with savage laughter as he pounced towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The jade sword
transformed into a blur. It seemed identical to the first sword, but
once the golden yaksha actually reached jade sword, the speed of the
jade sword suddenly increased dramatically. The heartforce within it
exploded forth with full power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The upgraded jade sword
became nothing more than a vague blur in front of the golden yaksha.
The golden yaksha tried to block it, but his combat techniques were
simply too weak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">SLASH!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Brightmoon] sword-art,
Shadowless stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The jade sword sliced
through the golden yaksha’s body in a bizarre, unpredictable
manner. Although this body was very close to that of a True God, it
actually wasn’t enhanced by any body-protecting divine ability at
all. Assaulted by the incredibly sharp jade sword…it was instantly
chopped in half.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, remained
wary and vigilant. He knew very well that the golden yaksha was able
to easily dissolve and coalesce his body, or even to completely
transform it into liquid. He probably wouldn’t die that easily. In
addition, Ning could sense that his foe’s aura remained incredibly
powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two halves of the
bisected golden yaksha’s body suddenly transformed into a flood of
water. The enormous flood of water spun in midair, then completely
detonated, blasting apart into countless smaller streams of water
that flew everywhere. Once they touched the surface of the sea, the
streams once more transformed into many jade yakshas, a total of 519
of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You were actually
able to injure my true body. You are qualified to pass through this
section that I guard.” The 519 jade yakshas stood atop the sea,
staring towards Ning and speaking together in a strange voice.
“However, I am merely the weakest of the guardians which Master
left behind. Those ancient fellows are all more powerful than me. If
you want to survive them and acquire the treasures which Master left
behind…I judge that you are lacking in power. Hahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Laughing in a shrill,
ear-piercing manner, the 519 jade yakshas all flew in different
directions, quickly disappearing from Ning’s field of vision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just silently
stood there in midair for a moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come back.” The
729 top-grade Pure Yang swords all returned to his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just the weakest
guardian, with more to come?” Ning frowned, murmuring softly to
himself. He was slowly beginning to understand things here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even the sole person
to leave this place, Buddha Jueming, entered during the Primordial
Era and was only able to emerge during the era of the Three Realms.
It took him countless years,” Ning mused to himself. “Clearly,
Undermoon Lake isn’t so easily traversed. The very first opponent I
encountered was able to force me to use heartforce to beat him. The
rest will be even harder.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning once more boarded
the Ruyi Soulsnake Shuttle and continued to advance along the path of
the floating wooden bridge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After flying for more
than half a day, Ning was vaguely able to make out an extremely
beautiful island far off in the distance. The wooden bridge was
leading towards this island as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a lovely
island.” Ning quickly arrived at the island and took a close look
at it. The natural energy surrounding the island had all been
manipulated and controlled, causing this island to be perpetually
blanketed in falling snow. The island itself was very beautiful as
well, and at the center of it was a beautiful palace that was at
least three thousand meters high.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the palace, he
could see the statues of three strange beasts that were seated in the
lotus position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A palace? Why has a
palace been built here?” Ning was secretly puzzled. He immediately
landed and walked through the island, scanning his surroundings as he
moved towards the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood outside the
palace, staring towards the insides. His eyes were filled with
torch-light as he did so. He had the feeling that there was a reason
this palace was here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s
[Torch-Dragon’s Eye] suddenly discovered a body flickering about
within the deepest parts of the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s coming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It hasn’t been a
thousand years yet. Why has it come again?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then let’s fight.
Let’s fight!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The figures within the
darkest reaches of the palace had eyes filled with frenzy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, still
standing outside the palace, he frowned. “I wasn’t seeing things.
There really are living beings inside this place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. After
hesitating for a moment, Ning stepped into the palace. Here at
Undermoon Lake, neither coresense nor heartforce could be used to
search. Thus, the only choice was for him to investigate in person!
Since the wooden bridge led to this place, this eye-catching palace
definitely served a specific purpose.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the front
palace. Two corridors connected to it led deeper into the palace.
Ning chose one of them. He walked through it, leading to an enormous
courtyard that was filled with many pavilions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! The wind
suddenly moved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was still walking
through the corridor. His faced changed, and a sword in his hands
instantly chopped backwards. Here in the palace, Ning had naturally
kept his swords in his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! A ringing sound
could be heard, followed by a figure flashing past him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stay your hands!”
Ning’s face changed, and he hurriedly called out, “Stop this! I’m
not an enemy!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Yet another gust
of wind as yet another blurred form appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empyrean God
Roughpeak, I’m from the Three Realms as well!” Ning said
hurriedly. His voice, filled with divine power, echoed outwards as he
used his swords to block as he dodged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The distant
blur came to a halt, revealing an ashen-faced youth who was wielding
a pair of bladewheels in his hands. He stared at Ning with a berserk
look in his eyes. His eyes were vaguely bloodshot; clearly, he wasn’t
disguising his murderous intent at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three Realms?” The
ashen-faced youth snickered coldly, then growled, “Snowfiend, we’ve
fought countless times by now, and you’ve also disguised yourself
as an Empyrean God of the Three Realms on multiple occasions. Do you
really think you’ll be able to fool me again?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empyrean God
Roughpeak,” Ning said hurriedly, “I really am from the Three
Realms. I’m not this ‘Snowfiend’ person. Your master is Exalted
Celestial Carefree of the Daoist Path, am I right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was naturally able
to recognize this person at a single glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms only
had so many Empyrean Gods and True Immortals to begin with, and Ning
had actually spent time memorizing all of the thousands who had
entered Undermoon Lake. Undermoon Lake’s world was filled with
natural energy, and it also contained within it multiple types of
stellar energy. Both divine power and ki could be replenished here.
Although the density of the energy here couldn’t compare to that of
the Three Realms, it was still more than enough to maintain life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, Empyrean God
Roughpeak’s appearance hadn’t changed. His aura, however, had
changed dramatically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughpeak: A relaxed,
carefree Empyrean God who always had a smile on his face. That’s
what the report about him said. But the person Ning saw had an ashen
face, bloodshot eyes, and was filled with a surging killing intent.
Clearly, he had reached the point where his Dao-heart was unable to
control his murderous impulses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master?” The youth
stared at Ning, frowning. “And who are you? I’ve never even met
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I only began my
training long after you entered Undermoon Lake, Empyrean God
Roughpeak,” Ning said. “I am the disciple of Daofather Subhuti.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many people in the
Three Realms now knew that Ning was Subhuti’s disciple, and so
Subhuti no longer forbade Ning from telling it to others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Subhuti?” The
youth laughed coldly, “I imagine you overheard a few things from
many of the other Empyrean Gods who entered this place. Do you really
think you’ll be able to fool me so easily?” But despite his
words, the youth still didn’t move.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My master resides
within the Crescent world, within the Triscar Crescent Abode of Mount
Innerheart,” Ning said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The youth frowned.
Although many Empyrean Gods had indeed entered this place, it was
true that few of them would have cause to discuss the Tristar
Crescent Abode of Mount Innerheart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your master is the
Exalted Celestial Carefree. Exalted Celestial Carefree, back when you
were still in the outside world, had a total of seventy-three
disciples. These days, he has a total of seventy-six,” Ning said.
“The eldest disciple of Exalted Celestial Carefree died during the
Primordial Era. His name was True Immortal Riverloss. Exalted
Celestial Carefree’s second disciple…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
speak, and the face of the youth quickly changed. His body actually
began to tremble, and tears began to appear in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ha…hahaha….”
Tears flowed down the youth’s face as he laughed.
“Hahaha…hahahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning slowly came to a
halt. He stared quietly as Empyrean God Roughpeak cried and laughed
at the same time. He could sense that Roughpeak had endured many
things; this wild laughter was nothing more than a way to release
some of his feelings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is your name,
junior apprentice-brother?” The youth finally came to a halt, and
he now looked towards Ning with a warm look in his eyes. Generally
speaking, disciples of major powers that all belonged to the Daoist
Path would sometimes refer to each other as ‘senior
apprentice-brother’ or ‘junior apprentice-brother’; this was a
fairly friendly way of referring to each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, although
Daofather Subhuti trained in both Buddhism and Daoism, he couldn’t
really be considered a member of the Daoist Path. Clearly, Roughpeak
felt extremely friendly towards this newcomer Empyrean God from the
Three Realms, which is why he referred to Ning as ‘junior
apprentice-brother’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My name is
Darknorth. Respectful greetings to you, senior apprentice-brother
Roughpeak,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Darknorth.” The youth smiled, the tears having
vanished from his eyes.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 9 - Wall Carvings
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Roughpeak
said hurriedly, “I really am ashamed. Just now, I actually took you
to be Snowfiend and immediately attacked you! Fortunately, you are
very powerful, which is why I didn’t injure you. If I was to have
slain you…by the time I felt regret, it would be too late. Alas…I
never would have thought that I, Roughpeak, would end up in a state
where I would launch killing blows without even trying to ascertain
the situation clearly.” A hint of grief flickered in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You cannot be
blamed, senior apprentice-brother.” Ning smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But it truly is my
fault. Forget it, enough of that for now.” Roughpeak frowned as he
looked at Ning. “Junior apprentice-brother Darknorth, you should
know how dangerous Undermoon Lake is. Many Empyrean Gods have entered
since the Primordial Era, but the only one to actually leave was
Buddha Jueming. Why were you so foolish as to enter this place? Back
then, I personally watched as Reverend Jueming ascended to become a
Buddha. I was so incredibly bored that I ended up deciding to enter
Undermoon Lake to try my luck. Countless years have passed since
then. At first, other Empyrean Gods would enter this place, but it
has been a long, long time since any have made the attempt. Why have
you…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am indeed the only
one to enter in ten million years. As for the reason why I
entered…that’s a long and complicated story.” Ning sighed. “I
came because I was forced to by circumstances outside my control. I
had to come here to procure a certain treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughpeak nodded, then
hurriedly asked, “Right, what’s the situation in the Three
Realms? Did you say that my master took on new disciples?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three Realms…”
Ning hesitated for a moment. “…Has already been swept into a new
storm!” Ning’s voice was heavy, but he still forced the words
out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Storm?” Roughpeak
was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One which might be
even more brutal than the war which ended the Primordial Era.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can that be
possible? So many people died in the war that ended the Primordial
Era…” Roughpeak was shocked and stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That time, Mother
Nuwa broke through to the Pangu level, which is why we managed to
avoid disaster. This time…well, listen to me explain in detail.”
Ning didn’t hold anything back from this disciple of Exalted
Celestial Carefree. If they all managed to survive, they would be on
the same side, and so Ning told him almost everything about the storm
that had embroiled the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The telling of this
tale took a full hour.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughpeak stood there
in a daze. He muttered to himself, “How could this have happened?
After the Seamless Gate re-entered the Three Realms, everything was
peaceful. Why is it that all of a sudden…” He paused. “This
time, Mother Nuwa isn’t around to keep the peace. Nobody in our
Nuwa Alliance is capable of countering the abilities of the Lord of
All Fiends. However, the Seamless Gate will find it difficult to
counter our leaders as well. The only result would be heavy losses on
both sides. In the end, how many of us will possibly survive?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he had been in the
Three Realms, the Three Realms had been in a state of peace. But now,
the storm had descended upon it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Either the Seamless
Gate dies or we die,” Ning said calmly. “There are no other
choices. Although I am weak, I can still sense my subconscious
whispering to me that one of our two sides has to be wiped out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even you can sense
it?” Roughpeak was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why…why is destiny
forcing a tribulation like this?” Roughpeak simply didn’t
understand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tribulations and storms
didn’t descend without a reason. The war that ended the Primordial
Era, for example, was caused by two chaosworlds moving towards each
other and colliding together. The Lord of the Demonheart wished to
take over both worlds, but the Pangu Chaosworld resisted him. Thus, a
great war erupted. In addition to that, the Lord of All Things was
manipulating things in secret.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The secret workings of
fate would only reveal the results. The results in this case were
that one side would definitely be wiped out. Only if one side was
wiped out would the other side survive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the reason for
the storm? That was all left up to conjecture.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nuwa Alliance’s
guess was that it was very possible that this was all caused by the
‘king’ of the Seamless Gate. That ‘king’ had been very close
to the Pangu level. He had merged himself into the Heavenly Daos, but
since then he had slowly begun to awaken. Part of his consciousness
was already awake. Through its partial control over the Heavenly
Daos, it was providing intelligence reports to the Seamless Gate,
giving them the power to fight back against the Nuwa Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This inevitably caused
the Three Sovereigns and the leaders of Daoism and Buddhism to
question if the Lord of the Demonheart had managed to escape the
restrictions of the Heavenly Daos. Was he seeking to cause yet
another storm?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Or was there perhaps
yet another alien Outsider causing trouble from the shadows?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Or was there another,
even more inscrutable reason?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was hard to say.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of the
Demonheart, who had merged himself into the Heavenly Daos, most
likely knew the most…and his order had been to have the Seamless
Gate assault the Nuwa Alliance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“People on our level
can’t possibly learn the real reasons why this storm descended,”
Ning said. “In short…the Seamless Gate has already infiltrated
the Three Realms and has begun to attack us. We can’t let ourselves
just be defeated without fighting back!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Roughpeak
nodded as well, a murderous look flashing through his eyes. “The
Seamless Gate…only after Mother Nuwa left the Three Realms did the
Lord of All Fiends sneak back. The only reason we let them join our
Three Realms was because we didn’t want to cause unnecessary death.
Who would’ve thought that…ugh. It’s been so many years, but you
just can’t teach a dog not to eat shit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon learning that both
sides had begun a war of annihilation, Roughpeak naturally was going
to stand on the side of the Nuwa Alliance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, we’re all
trapped here at Undermoon Lake. There’s no point in talking
endlessly about these things.” Roughpeak shook his head. He then
turned his head towards the corridor and began to walk towards it.
“Junior apprentice-brother Darknorth, follow me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two advanced
through the corridor. A short while later, they arrived at the
innermost courtyard to this palace. It was extremely quiet, as no
sounds could be heard at all. Light reflected off the accumulated
snow, making every inch of it easily visible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All these years,
I’ve been living here.” Roughpeak stepped into the courtyard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning followed behind
him. This courtyard was very plain and simple…but almost
immediately, Ning’s gaze was drawn to the walls of the courtyard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s this?”
Ning walked over, astonished. He couldn’t help but stare at the
diagrams and characters engraved onto the walls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The diagrams were of
close-combat techniques, while the characters were detailed
descriptions and in the language of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These have been left
behind since the Primordial Era by bored, trapped, and despairing
Empyrean Gods.” Roughpeak sat down on the ground, leaning against a
tree trunk. “Junior apprentice-brother Darknorth, do you have any
wine?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I do.” Ning waved
his hand, producing a gourd of wine and tossing it over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent.”
Roughpeak’s eyes lit up. He caught the gourd of wine, pulled open
the stopper, then raised his head and began to guzzle it down. Only
after finishing a barrel’s worth all did he let out a long sigh of
contentment. He then laughed loudly, “Wonderful. What a wonderful
feeling. It’s been forever since I’ve had wine. I’ve been
trapped here for so long without seeing even the shadow of another
person, and I always have to be vigilant of that Snowfiend’s
attacks. Life really has been worse than death here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Darknorth, don’t waste your time looking at
that. There’s no point.” Roughpeak called out to Ning upon seeing
Ning stare unblinkingly at the wall carvings. “They were all left
behind by the Empyrean Gods that came to this place. In terms of
quality, they naturally can’t compare to that of the techniques
which True Gods and Daofathers pass down. These were all left behind
by Empyrean Gods who knew that they were going to die here, and so
they left behind a few techniques so that future arrivals would see
them and know that they had once lived here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh, you just won’t
listen.” Roughpeak, seeing that Ning continued to stare at the
wall, no longer said anything. He just raised his head and continued
to drink.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To be able to drink
wine was already a tremendous blessing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he just
stared quietly at the many carvings on the wall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snowleaf,
subordinate of Buddha Maitreya, leaves behind his last words.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swordback,
subordinate of the Lord of the Everwood, leaves behind his last
words.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Windbrother,
subordinate of Wargod Xingtian, leaves behind his last words.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of these Empyrean
Gods were quite famous, while others were low-key recluses. They had
all come here, to the world of Undermoon Lake. Although they had
managed to survive the yaksha, they were no unable to advance a
single step past this place. They knew that their chances of
surviving this palace were very low, and so they had left behind some
words on this wall, telling future arrivals that they had once been
here!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The techniques they had
left behind naturally weren’t that impressive, and of course Ning
found them useless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the Empyrean God
level, one would mainly rely on self-developed techniques. Ning, for
example, had developed the [Brightmoon] sword-art, and they were
quite formidable in his hands. But if he was to leave the
[Brightmoon] sword-art on the wall carving, other Empyrean Gods
wouldn’t really care to learn it, as it was a technique developed
by Ning for Ning; it wouldn’t be very useful for others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even techniques created
by True Gods and Daofathers wouldn’t be that useful to them, unless
the techniques were truly monstrous, unearthly techniques like the
[Five Treasures] sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why Ning was
staring at the wall carvings was because he had the feeling that
every single stroke and dotted line, every single character,
represented a type of entrustment! These were all left behind by
powerful Empyrean Gods prior to their deaths. This sort of faith and
spiritual entrustment caused Ning’s soul to quiver. He could sense
that none of these Empyrean Gods wished to die. All of them wished to
live! But alas…they didn’t have the power to do so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I do not wish to
leave behind any carvings.” At some point in time, Roughpeak had
walked to Ning’s side, wine gourd in hand. He said calmly, “If I
die, I die. I’ve had enough of this life.”

Chapter 10 - Snowfiend
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s wrong?”
Ji Ning immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortals and Fiendgods
would generally be able to withstand the loneliness of solitude. The
prisoners of Prisonworld 17, for example, had been trapped for
multiple chaos cycles with only a small number committing suicide in
desspair. Empyrean God Roughpeak, by comparison, had been trapped
here a far shorter period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Didn’t I tell you
how I mistook you for ‘Snowfiend’ earlier?” Roughpeak said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Undermoon Lake is an
exceptionally deadly place. Many years ago, I made my way past the
sea yaksha and arrived here at this snowy island. When I first
arrived, there were no other Empyrean Gods, and so I continued to
advance,” Roughpeak said. “On the other side of this island,
there is another floating wooden bridge. If you proceed past it,
you’ll encounter Snowfiend.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was unable to
defeat Snowfiend. Fortunately, by relying on my agility techniques, I
managed to escape and flee back to this snowy island,” Roughpeak
said. “Snowfiend pursued me all the way back to this location, but
once I fled into the island itself, Snowfiend immediately halted the
pursuit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Each time I fought
against Snowfiend, I was unable to win. Thus, I have no choice but to
remain here on this island.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I thought that I
would be safe here, but I didn’t expect that after being here for a
thousand years, one of Snowfiend’s clones actually attacked the
island.” Roughpeak shook his head and sighed. “Every since that
day, roughly every thousand years, a clone of Snowfiend would come to
the island to attack me. Each time, its power is a little bit greater
than it was before. After a million years, the clones will be close
to its true body in power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning asked, puzzled,
“Once every thousand years, with a gradual increase in power…is
he doing this just to temper you, senior apprentice-brother?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is indeed a
form of tempering.” Roughpeak nodded. “At first, the Snowfiend
clones were fairly weak, and I was completely capable of withstanding
them. After a million years, my agility techniques reached an
extremely formidable level; even the clone that was comparable to
Snowfiend at full power is unable to kill me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s not able to
kill me, but I’m not able to go past him either.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And so, I’ve been
trapped here on this island the entire time. Over the course of many
years, other Empyrean Gods have come to this island. Some of them
died to Snowfiend, while others made it to the next island. Some were
like me, trapped here for long periods of time…but because the
Snowfiend clones grew increasingly powerful, they were unable to keep
up and ended up dying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m the only one
left!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Roughpeak
shook his head and laughed. “In terms of power, many of them were
actually my equal…but my forte lies in agility. Thanks to
Snowfiend’s pressure, I’ve reached a level that I would never
have dared imagined I would reach.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But what of it?
Snowfiend continues to disturb me time and time again. He uses
illusions, ambushes, assassination attempts…he continues to try to
kill me.” Roughpeak let out a sigh. “I’m here, all by myself,
and I’m unable to improve any further at all. I’m also unable to
make it past Snowfiend…and I have to be wary of his attacks.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if I’m not
killed, I’ll eventually suffer a mental collapse,” Roughpeak
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Roughpeak,” Ning said solemnly, “I feel that
Undermoon Lake is quite a strange place. Based on what I’ve seen,
it should be a world that was created by an ancient major power.
After we enter, we will be beset by a number of trials. If we are
unable to endure the trials, we will die. If we can endure them, we
will be allowed to proceed, eventually acquiring treasures and even
being allowed to leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is it possible that
the major power who created Undermoon Lake did so in order to help
cultivate juniors, giving us treasures then letting us leave?” Ning
was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s not as nice
as you think.” Roughpeak shook his head. “The major power who
created Undermoon Lake definitely had schemes of his own.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed. Nobody is as
selfless as that.” Ning agreed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To help train Empyrean
Gods, producing top-tier ones that would be gifted with treasures and
allowed to leave…that was an act of utter selflessness. Ning didn’t
think that anybody would be that selfless. There had to be a reason
behind it all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that
Buddha Jueming has never said anything at all, despite so many years
having passed?” Roughpeak asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing.” Ning
shook his head. “I asked my master, and my master also told me that
Buddha Jueming sealed his lips, saying nothing about this place. It
doesn’t matter who asks. Even Lord Tathagata the Buddha was unable
to convince Buddha Jueming to divulge any information about Undermoon
Lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughpeak frowned. “How
odd. Why is Buddha Jueming so completely closemouthed about this
place?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Buddha Jueming refused
to speak, but he also refused to prevent other Empyrean Gods from
entering this place. Still…no one could force him to speak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snowfiend’s
continuously attempted to kill me. In fact, he’s even chatted with
me several times. That’s why I’ve learned that there is only one
method of surviving Undermoon Lake and leaving with treasures,”
Roughpeak said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
listened carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The method is…to
continuously advance through the floating bridges, defeating all
guardians. The journey will see you go past a total of five islands.
Once you reach the fifth island, you’ll be able to depart in peace.
However, to date only Buddha Jueming has succeeded,” Roughpeak
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five islands?”
Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The snow-covered island
the two of them were on was merely the very first island. To reach
the fifth island would be no easy feat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Upon reaching the
fifth island, you’d most likely learn what the creator of Undermoon
Lake has been scheming,” Roughpeak said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Ning didn’t
really care as to what that ancient major power was scheming. What he
cared about was Iceheart Pith and Iceheart Leaf.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, I’ve battled against Snowfiend for countless
years, and I’ve also chatted with him many times.” Roughpeak
looked at Ning. “He told me that there’s one other way to survive
and leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning’s eyes
lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To hide within an
extremely powerful Empyrean God’s magic treasure.” Roughpeak
continued, “For example…if someone felt tremendous faith in
Buddha Jueming, they could’ve chosen to secrete themselves in his
treasures, assuming he was willing to let them do so. Upon him
successfully leaving the place, they would be able to leave along his
side.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, there’s
one bad part about hiding; you won’t be able to acquire any
treasures at all. In addition, your own life will no longer be yours
to control.” Roughpeak continued, “For example, if Buddha Jueming
was to die, then the Empyrean Gods hiding within his treasures would
all die as well. After all, they would all emerge upon his death, and
anyone capable of killing Buddha Jueming would also be capable of
killing them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right now, I’m
trying to decide…if I should follow you.” Roughpeak looked
towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled.
“Follow me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Follow you. I’ll
go wherever you go, as far as you go. If you manage to escape, I will
as well. However, I feel that your chances of making it out alive are
quite low.” Roughpeak chuckled. “Still, I want to at least take a
look at the other islands. Even making it to just the second island
would be enough. I’ve been here all by myself for so long…I’ve
had enough of it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, if you truly were to trust me in such a way, I
would definitely do my utmost,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But I’m worried
about something…” Roughpeak said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s that?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m worried about
whether you are strong enough to go past Snowfiend,” Roughpeak
laughed. “If you fail and die, I’ll probably be unable to escape
as I’ll be trapped in your treasures. I’ll end up being killed by
Snowfiend. If that happens, I won’t be able to see the next island.
I’ve been quite curious as to what the rest of the five islands are
like, and how terrifying the upcoming dangers are, for so many
Empyrean Gods to have failed here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hesitated
momentarily. “I…can’t make any promises.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t need any
promises. Follow me.” Roughpeak led Ning forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The snowy island was
quite large, but the two of them moved with incredible speed. Soon,
they arrived at the other end of the island, where they saw a
floating wooden bridge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning took a
good look. This wooden bridge stretched off into the distant horizon,
but the endless sea to each side of it was completely frozen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless petals of
snow continued to fall down from the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All you need to do
is step on the wooden bridge.” Roughpeak gestured towards the
bridge. “Once you step onto it, Snowfiend will sense it. There’s
no need for you to even advance; you can just wait here for him. A
short while later, Snowfiend will arrive! The first ‘Snowfiend’
you encounter will merely be a clone. Fight it. If you can kill it
with just a single blow, I’ll take the gamble and hide inside your
treasures, following you forward.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.” Roughpeak bowed deeply towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, don’t act like this!” Ning hurriedly moved to
stop the bow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m asking you to
help me advance, but I’m first insisting on testing out your power.
I honestly am ashamed of my actions,” Roughpeak said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is just normal
behavior,” Ning said hurriedly. “If I can’t even dispose of one
of Snowfiend’s clones, for you to follow me would be suicidal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughpeak no longer
said anything else to Ning. He just stared at the vast sea, at the
distant horizons. He murmured softly to himself, “I really wonder
what the next island is like. I wonder if there are any other
surviving Empyrean Gods on that island. I really want to know what’s
there. Once I see it…even if I die, I’d be happy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he moved
forward, stepping onto the wooden bridge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! As soon as he
stepped onto the wooden bridge, the amount of snow falling from the
heavens grew noticeably greater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A pair of blood-red
swords appeared in Ning’s hands as he began to wait quietly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Far away in the distant
skies, a large amount of snow began to rapidly condense, transforming
into a white-furred ape. The ape held a snow-white staff in his
hands, and he stood there in midair, his gaze passing through the
endless snowfall and falling upon the distant Ji Ning and Roughpeak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yet another
youngster has arrived.” The ape-like Snowfiend murmured softly to
himself, “Judging from their words…that kid Roughpeak is no
longer able to endure the solitude of being trapped here for so many
words. He plans to take a chance on following the white-robed kid?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s rare for
someone to accompany for so long. If it wasn’t for Master’s
orders, I’d be fine with letting you leave. But alas…although
Master has left, his orders remain. I must follow them.” The simian
Snowfiend shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Snowfiend
disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face changed
slightly as he looked towards the front. A large amount of snow had
begun to rapidly condense in front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful, junior
apprentice-brother. Snowfiend’s clone has arrived,” Roughpeak
warned him from behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just watched
calmly. As the snow began to condense, a large amount of natural
energy began to condense as well. Soon, a white-furred ape wielding a
snow-white staff appeared before him. The ape’s eyes were filled
with an innate killing intent; it was born for the sole purpose of
slaughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heh heh heh. That
kid Roughpeak has quite the agility technique; he’s been able to
slip through my hands time and time again. However, nearly a thousand
other Empyrean Gods have died by my hands.” The simian Snowfiend
stared at Ning, seeming to weigh Ning with his eyes as a predator
would its prey.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t dare to
be too reckless. All of the Empyrean Gods capable of making it past
the sea yaksha were extraordinary figures, but a thousand of them
still ended up dying by Snowfiend’s hands. Although Ning had
sparred for only a brief moment with Roughpeak, he could still tell
that in terms of agility, he was far from being Roughpeak’s match.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t disappoint
me.” The ape-like Snowfiend let out a strange, chortling laugh that
reverberated in the skies, then charged straight towards Ning with a
‘swoosh’, both hands clutched onto that snow-white staff.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the staff came
smashing down, countless snowflakes swirled around it, causing its
power to increase explosively!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning just stood
there quietly as Snowfiend’s blow descended towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Roughpeak
had said it himself; this was merely one of Snowfiend’s clones. If
Ning could destroy this clone in one blow, Roughpeak would follow
him. In his heart, Ning wished to help out this ‘senior
apprentice-brother’ of his. His wife’s master, Patriarch Lu
Dongbin, could actually be considered a fellow disciple of
Roughpeak’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin had once
apprenticed himself to two of the major powers of the Daoist Path.
One was Daoist Three Purities; the other was Exalted Celestial
Carefree.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the sake of his
connection to Lu Dongbin alone, Ning would’ve been willing to give
Roughpeak a hand. But of course, Roughpeak’s status was far lower
than Lu Dongbin’s. Even as far back as the Primordial Era, Lu
Dongbin was viewed as one of the most peerless of geniuses. But alas,
his ambitions in dual-cultivating in Buddhism and Taoism were too
great. It wasn’t until the Three Realms was swept into this current
storm that he was finally able to make his breakthrough, but upon
doing so he instantly became a top-tier Daofather.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The staff came
smashing downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Ning’s
sword-light flashed. As soon as he used his sword, he executed the
[Starseizing Hand], causing his sword to be filled with tremendous
power. “This Snowfiend clone is far too slow.” The strange,
unfathomable sword-light flashed, and it was about to land against
Snowfiend, except…Snowfiend’s longstaff suddenly spun around,
moving to block Ning’s sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s face
changed slightly, and he sent the longsword forward in a stabbing
motion, following the momentum of the blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stab! The tip of the
sword pierced straight through the skull of Snowfiend’s clone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Brightmoon] sword-art,
Blood Drop stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Snowfiend’s
clone completely dispersed, transforming back into the snow that
filled the skies. At the same time, Snowfiend’s voice echoed forth
throughout the region. “If that’s all the power you have…you
aren’t even close to being strong enough to pass. Haha…I’ll be
waiting for you on the path ahead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Roughpeak
walked to Ning. “What do you think?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I underestimated
him,” Ning said. “His clone only had an ordinary amount of power
and speed; I thought I’d be able to easily kill him with one blow
of my sword. Who would’ve thought that his staff-techniques would
be so formidable? I had to spend a little bit of effort on him after
all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughpeak nodded. “The
clones of the sea yaksha that were all very weak; they could be
effortlessly killed. But the clones of Snowfiend are far harder to
deal with. As for his true form, it’s even more powerful. His
greatest strength is that he has almost no weaknesses at all. Or
perhaps he does have weaknesses…but I wasn’t able to discover
any.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Almost no
weaknesses?” Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. You
don’t have to actually defeat him; so long as you have reached a
certain level of power, he’ll voluntarily withdraw and let you
pass.” Roughpeak chuckled, “Just now, you were able to kill
Snowfiend’s clone in one exchange, and your sword-art appeared
quite impressive. I’ll follow you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, strictly
speaking Ning didn’t really just use a single technique; he had
first used the ‘Shadowless’ stance, then transformed it into the
‘Blood Drop’ stance. The reason why Roughpeak described it all as
being ‘one exchange’ was because he truly could no longer endure
the loneliness of being trapped in this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
waved his hand. Roughpeak didn’t resist, allowing himself to be
drawn into Ning’s Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning himself was
carrying a Pure Yang Immortal estate that held his other body within
it. But of course, as the master of the estate, Ning was able to
separate it into many different ‘sections’. For now, he didn’t
wish to let Roughpeak know of his second body’s existence. There
were very few in the Three Realms who knew this secret.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning boarded the Ruyi
Soulsnake Shuttle, then continued to advance along the path set by
the wooden bridge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snowflakes drifted
downwards, seeming to cover the entire world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a beautiful
scene.” Ning smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He continuously
advanced. After two full hours, the Ruyi Soulsnake Shuttle came to a
sudden halt, and Ning’s face changed slightly as he stared up
ahead. Far off in the distance, a golden-furred ape was seated atop
the bridge. In front of the golden-furred ape was placed a long staff
that emanated a tremendous aura of power as well. Clearly, this was
an extremely formidable treasure. At present, the golden-furred ape
was seated in the lotus position, resting his jaw against his arms,
waiting for Ning in an extremely bored-looking manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You finally came. I
waited forever for you.” The golden-furred ape rose to his feet,
stretching slightly. “That flying treasure of yours is far too
slow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With but a thought,
Ning dismissed his Ruyi Soulsnake Shuttle, landing atop the wooden
bridge. A pair of blood-red swords in his hands, he stared at the
distant form of Snowfiend. “Although Snowfiend’s true aura is far
more powerful than his clone’s aura, it feels as though his aura
isn’t even as strong as the aura of the true body of the sea
yaksha.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heh heh heh…what’s
wrong? Are you wondering why my aura seems fairly weak?” Snowfiend
laughed mockingly. “Don’t compare that sea yaksha to me; that
idiot isn’t even able to fully control all of his power. All he has
is brute force. I, however, am in complete control of every shred of
my power. Once I withdraw my aura, I can change my aura, change my
appearance, change everything.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Transform!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snowfiend’s
appearance suddenly transformed into that of Roughpeak’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Again!” This time
he transformed into Ning. The aura was completely identical.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, seeing this, was
quite startled. This was equivalent to the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus, kid…you
should understand that true experts can’t be judged based on their
looks,” Snowfiend said with a laugh. “The more powerful one is,
the more they will generally choose to restrain their auas. In fact,
they might appear like an ordinary person, giving off no aura of
danger at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but nod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was true. For
example, when he had encountered Old Man Yuan, Old Man Yuan had
transformed himself into an ordinary-looking old gardener. Ning truly
had thought him to be nothing more than an ordinary mortal, and he
truly had sensed no aura around him at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come. Let’s see
what you’ve got. Show me what you have,” Snowfiend called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come out.” A
fierce light flashed through Ning’s eyes, and a total of 729 Pure
Yang swords appeared around him, hovering in the air. A large amount
of Immortal energy had been pumped into them, and the energy was
cycled through them, transforming into an incomparably sharp jade
sword that materialized in front of Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, it seems you
have some skill after all.” Snowfiend hefted his golden staff,
chortling merrily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyelids
twitched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The jade sword
instantly pierced through the skies, leaving behind a streak of light
as it chopped towards Snowfiend in an unfathomable, unpredictable
manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Snowfiend gently
flicked out his golden staff, smashing it against the jade sword. The
jade sword instantly shattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s face
changed. “Go, go, go!” One jade sword after another materialized
and soared off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snowfiend just lazily
advanced, his golden staff casually trembling with each blow. The
staff transformed into a layer of concentric circles, effortlessly
smashing apart each seemingly ‘unfathomable’ jade sword. Boom!
Boom! Boom! All three were broken apart in succession.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is this the only
technique you know?!” Snowfiend stared wide-eyed, seemingly
befuddled. “Then this is going to be really boring.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After speaking,
Snowfiend’s golden staff suddenly flew into the air, transforming
into a golden streak of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My ‘Shadowless’
stance is inscrutable and mysterious, and it was backed by the power
of the ninth-stage [Greater Thousand Swords Formation]. And yet, he
was able to effortless deflect it. It seems I’ll have to use
heartforce.” Ning didn’t expect that he would immediately be
forced to use haertforce. Yet another jade sword appeared in front of
him, and yet another streak of light flashed out, chopping towards
Snowfiend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snowfiend leapt
forward, and the jade sword stabbed through the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two collided.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” Ning willed
it, and the heartforce within the jade sword instantly burst forth,
causing the speed and power of the jade sword to increase
dramatically, making it even faster and more unpredictable as it
chopped towards Snowfiend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” For the first
time, Snowfiend revealed a solemn look on his face. Prior to this, he
had been holding the staff with one hand, but now he instantly
switched to a two-handed grip.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! The staff
trembled, causing circles to instantly appear in the skies. Two calm
streams of black energy and white energy appeared on the surface of
the staff.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The staff once more
smashed against Ning’s jade sword…and despite adding fourth-stage
heartforce to the mix, the sword was still completely shattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Interesting.”
Snowfiend’s eyes lit up. “Ahahaha, let’s do it again! Agai!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snowfiend’s body
bounded forward at high speed. As he ran forward, his movements
became strange and unfathomable. He occasionally moved left and
occasionally moved right, advancing nonstop in a zig-zag pattern.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clearly, Snowfiend was
taking things seriously now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was able to stop
even fourth-stage heartforce?” Ning felt a hint of surprise. Every
time he applied heartforce, he used up a good amount of his energy.
He would only be able to unleash a total of ten such swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go, go, go!” Ning
gritted his teeth. Once more, he shot out three jade swords. This
time, only one of them was filled with fourth-stage heartforce as he
mixed ‘real’ attacks with ‘fake’ attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…”
Snowfiend roared with laughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three consecutive
explosions. Although one of the jade swords suddenly increased
dramatically in power, it was still completely smashed apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning could
instantly tell that this would be tough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, Snowfiend had
already closed in on Ning. With no time for anything else, Ning
immediately put away his Pure Yang swords while manifesting his
three-headed, six-armed form. Six swords in his hands, he charged
forward to meet Snowfiend in combat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The staff was filled
with tremendous power. As soon as their attacks clashed, Ning was
knocked flying backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What tremendous
strength.” Ning flew backwards, his back smashing directly against
the frozen sea. With a boom, the frozen sea trembled from the
collision, but it remained completely undamaged. As for Ning, he
rolled backwards a considerable distance before once more flying
forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I don’t use the
[Starseizing Hand], I probably can’t compete against him in raw
strength.” Ning could feel a headache coming.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Starseizing Hand]
used up divine power at a tremendous rate. [Three Heads, Six Arms]
allowed him to increase his power significantly; given that he had
six swords against the enemy’s single golden staff, he thought that
he would at least be able to give the ape a run for his money,
perhaps even winning. Who would’ve thought that he would be smashed
backwards in their first exchange?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although he’s not
as strong as the true form of the sea yaksha, he’s still much
stronger than me. His staff-technique is also unfathomably profound,
and his movement techniques are shockingly brilliant as well. He
truly is virtually flawless. Senior apprentice-brother Roughpeak was
actually able to escape Snowfiend through his evasion
techniques…that’s quite impressive.” Only now did Ning truly
understand how impressive Empyrean God Roughpeak’s evasive
techniques were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to make use
of my advantages.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had no choice but
to engage in a bit of scheming now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha!” Snowfiend
roared with laughter, charging forward onto the floating bridge and
ramming straight towards Ning, who was still standing atop the frozen
sea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to wield
six swords in his three-headed, six-armed form. Once Snowfiend
reached him, he moved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning completely ignored
the oncoming blow, sending all six of his swords smashing downwards
towards Snowfiend’s body. You want to hit me? Hit all you like.
Thanks to my [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], I can completely ignore your
attacks. As long as my swords can chop you to death, I’ll win.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the sake of
success, Ning even used the [Starseizing Hand], allowing all six of
his arms to explode with terrifying power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The staff in
Snowfiend’s hands suddenly twisted about, and the two streams of
black energy and white energy once more appeared, forming an enormous
vortex that trapped all six of Ning’s swords. And then, Snowfiend’s
staff came smashing viciously towards Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The staff smashed
away the six swords, then smashed down upon Ning’s body. Ning was
once more knocked flying backwards, and he once more struck the
frozen sea. This time, with a series of shattering sounds, a large
number of cracks appeared on the icy surface.

Chapter 12 - Swordforce, Stage Four
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can he be so
fast? My sword-arts are already quite fast, and I used six swords to
launch six simultaneous attacks…but he was able to block them all.”
After slamming into the frozen sea, Ji Ning quickly flew back into
the air, his eyes filled with disbelief. Just now, he had used the
[Starseizing Hand] with all six of his arms, but he was still easily
smashed away by his foe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The difference in power
between the two made Ning feel quite miserable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heartforce. In the
end, it’s still an ephemeral, invisible form of energy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In close combat,
strength is just one aspect; combat techniques matters even more.”
Ning sighed in his heart. He was able to see long ago that this
Snowfiend was in control of taiji-force, and his battle-techniques
were also incomparably profound. Ning’s own swordforce had merely
reached the third stage; clearly, his [Brightmoon] sword-art, in
terms of technique, was completely outmatched by his enemy’s
staff-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The difference in
combat skill was simply too great. Even with three heads and six
arms, Ning was still at a complete disadvantage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha, come, come,
come! Again!” Snowfiend was growing excited, and he twirled the
golden staff in his hands, sending it howling forth once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he charged
forward as well, once more entering the fray.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! Clang! Clang!
Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two battled wildly
over the frozen sea. Every so often, Ning would be bashed backwards,
but thanks to the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] he was able to continue
exchanging blows with his foe. He had to keep the [Starseizing Hand]
maintained the entire time, as otherwise his swords would instantly
be knocked flying upon contact with the enemy. The difference in raw
strength was simply too great; only by using the [Starseizing Hand]
was he able to maintain parity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every so often, Ning
would let his heartforce explode forth as well! This would cause
Snowfiend’s body to suffer some wounds as well, but Snowfiend’s
body was capable of transforming into countless flakes of snow, then
reforming; those light wounds were completely useless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Interesting. You are
actually capable of suddenly exploding forth with great power in a
way which even I cannot detect. Is this the legendary, invisible,
formless power of heartforce?” Snowfiend continued his attacks
while chatting with Ning, who just gritted his teeth and fought back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the first time
that he had found himself completely outclassed by someone who was on
his own level of power. In strength, in agility, in technique…he
was at a disadvantage in every single aspect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Faster. Faster!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Five Treasures]
manual was correct when it said that upon reaching an unstoppable
level of speed, one’s attacks will become completely unstoppable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When the Golden Crow
‘Emperor of Monsters’ reached maximum speed, none of the major
powers of the Primordial Era were able to do anything to him; in the
end, Houyi had to use a special arrow to slay him. If I can make my
sword fast enough, he’ll be unable to stop me!” Ning attacked
frantically, completely ignore defense and focusing solely on
offense. The two stances he used were ‘Shadowless’ and ‘Blood
Drop’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although there were
three attacking stances in the [Brightmoon] sword-art, Heavenbreaker
primarily relied on crushing with weight and power. The difference in
strength between Ning and Snowfiend was simply too great; Snowfiend’s
own primary skill revolved around using overwhelming power in each
staff-smash! For Ning to use the Heavenbreaker stance to fight
head-on would be a foolish choice; he would be using his weakness to
combat the enemy’s strength. He would lose disastrously if he did
this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shadowless stance.
Blood Drop stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His attacks were
occasionally drifting and bizarre, occasionally rapid and savage.
With three heads and six arms, he wildly launched attacks, attacks,
and even more attacks!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Faster, fasater,
faster!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snowfiend himself
continued to twirl that golden staff, the two streams of black and
white energy flowing around it in a series of circles that completely
shut down all of Ning’s attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m still not fast
enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s six swords
emanated a natural, blurry golden light. This light was truly
breathtaking and dominating, but no matter how valiantly and savagely
Ning fought his attacks continued to be dispersed by the
seemingly-ordinary staff techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After fighting for a
long period of time, Ning’s divine power was close to being
depleted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems you still
aren’t good enough.” Snowfiend chuckled to himself, his staff
completely suppressing Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he
continued to launch attacks at a frenetic pace. Suddenly…one of the
six swords exploded forth with shocking amounts of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heartforce yet
again?” Snowfiend didn’t feel any concern at all. Although this
sword-strike of Ning’s was even stranger and more unfathomable than
before, and although his sword had managed to draw close to
Snowfiend’s body due to the sudden increase in power, Snowfiend was
still able to clip the side of Ning’s sword with his staff,
knocking it aside. Ning was only able to leave a slash on Snowfiend’s
flank.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, right at this
moment, one of Ning’s hands suddenly released a sword. The hand
suddenly increased in size as it clawed towards Snowfiend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This attack was simply
too sudden. The heartforce-filled sword had been nothing more than a
decoy; Ning’s true goal was to ensure that this hand of his would
be able to close in on the enemy! In the same instant that the
sword’s attack ‘failed’, Ning released the sword and let his
hand become his true weapon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Shocked,
Snowfiend hurriedly moved backwards. His movement techniques were
quite marvelous as well, and Ning’s clawing attack was only able to
latch onto one of Snowfiend’s arms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sever!” Snowfiend
let out an uncaring chortle. He was formed from snow, and his body
could manifest or dissipate as he willed it. The loss of an arm was
nothing to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of his arms had
been seized by Ning, but the other sword continued to wield the long
staff and battle against Ning’s other five swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A bloody sword-tip
suddenly pierced out of Snowfiend’s forehead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snowfiend revealed a
look of shock. He…he had actually been stabbed in the head?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later,
Snowfiend’s body completely dissipated, reforming off to the side a
few moments later. He stared in disbelief at the direction from which
he had been attacked; a second Ji Ning was standing there!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two?” Snowfiend
stared at the two white-robed Ji Nings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just now, when you
released your sword and grabbed me, it was all for the sake of giving
your other clone a chance?” Snowfiend looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
“You are indeed strong enough to outmatch me; I’m not your equal
at all. Thus, I had to play a small trick on you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First, you filled
your sword with heartforcce, then you released the sword to attack me
with your hand. That hand of yours is no weaker than your sword,”
Snowfiend said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Correct. To be
precise, my hand is actually a bit more powerful,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s [Starseizing
Hand] had made his hands comparable to supreme Protocosmic
spirit-treasures. Although they weren’t sword-shaped, they were
still comparable in might to high-grade Protocosmic swords.
Naturally, his hands would be a bit more powerful than the swords he
was using.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although my palms
are a bit more powerful, and although my attack came quite suddenly,
your agility techniques are simply too impressive; I was only able to
grab onto your arm.” Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You released the
sword so that you could attack with your hand, but even if the hand
succeeded, you would still have the option of using your second body,
which is just as strong as your first body.” Snowfiend shook his
head. “I was tied down by you for a moment; that sudden attack
caught me offguard, rendering me unable to dodge. I am thoroughly
convinced by my defeat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wasn’t strong
enough, so I had no choice but to use trickery,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he had started the
battle with two clones, the ape would’ve been prepared for it.
Given how overwhelmingly powerful Snowfiend was, if that happened the
outcome could be summarized in one word: LOSE.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, Ning’s second
clone would only appear at a critical moment, unleashing a sudden
attack that would gain him victory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was because you
have other clones.” Snowfiend shook his head. “You actually have
two true bodies, and both are Empyrean God bodies. It seems that you
must’ve trained in some sort of special divine ability. Generally
speaking, this sort of divine ability should allow you to create
quite a few clones, correct?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled. Indeed;
[Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods] allowed for a total of eighteen clones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You win.”
Snowfiend hefted the golden staff onto his shoulders, then turned and
left. Snow fluttered around him, and he quickly disappeared into the
snow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a sigh of
relief. “Good heavens.” Ning felt a spike of fear for what had
almost happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although I knew that
Snowfiend had to be powerful…he was way too powerful! I threw
everything I had at him, and my first clone used up almost all of its
divine power and heartforce. If my final ploy had failed, my only
option would’ve been to try and flee back to the island.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why Ning had
battled ineffectively for so long as to make the ape ‘accustomed’
too him. Everything lay in that final attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First the sword, then
the hand, then the second clone! If he failed, he would’ve fled
back to the island. Just like Roughpeak, he would train for a few
more years before making any further attempts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success! Finally, I
succeeded.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning
celebrated his victory, he still felt a sense of pressure. This
journey involved a total of five islands; his defeat of Snowfiend
only allowed him access to the second island. This battle, however,
had already forced him to reveal his trump card and use all the
tricks he had available. Would he be able to overcome the upcoming
challenges?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ruyi Soulsnake
Shuttle followed the floating wooden bridge, rapidly advancing
towards the horizon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While flying, Ning
pondered the previous battle nonstop. Just now, when he had been
battling so frantically, he had a vague feeling that he was about to
completing the third chapter of the [Five Treasures] sword-art, which
he was still a hairs-breadth away from mastering. However, because he
was in a life-and-death battle, he didn’t have any time to think
about the sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, Ning began to
think back to the previous battle and carefully analyze it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After flying for half a
day, another island appeared before Ning. This island had a massive
volcano in the center of it. Boom! Boom! Boom! The volcano constantly
belched forth lava and ash, sending them flying into the skies and
turning the entire island red.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A volcano island?”
Ning no longer pondered his sword-arts. Instead, he rapidly flew
forward and landed atop the volcano island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the second of
the five islands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the end of the
wooden bridge, Ning sat a giant, vertical stone stele, with the stone
stele covered by an enormous diagram of a bellowing ape. This ape
looked rather similar to Snowfiend, and he was roaring at the
heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as Ning saw it,
his mind was drawn into the diagram’s depths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He saw the illusion of
an ape, twirling a longstaff in its hands as it trained in a staff
technique. The ape started with the simplest techniques, then
proceeded to the advanced ones, his staffwork growing increasingly
marvelous. A short while ago, Ning had battled against Snowfiend for
a long period of time. Now that he was able to carefully see each of
the illusory ape’s separate techniques in detail, he instantly felt
enlightened regarding his previous experiences. Only after a long
period of time did the display of techniques come to an end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s
consciousness returned to his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a marvelous
staff technique. A pity that my path is the Dao of the Sword.” But
suddenly, Ning’s entire body turned stiff as he just stood there
blankly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had been trapped at
a bottleneck in the [Five Treasures] for some time now. Upon viewing
that complete staff technique, it was as though a ray of sunlight had
suddenly pierced through a covering of dark stormclouds, illuminating
a world that had previously been cast in shadow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there
silently and unmovingly. Both him and his second clone were
completely absorbed in the [Five Treasures] sword-art. They were
gaining continuous insights into the third chapter, and in the end
the bottleneck was no longer able to impede Ning’s progress. The
bottleneck shattered, and all of his insights became completely
linked together, merging to form a perfect whole. The entire third
chapter was completely mastered…and Ning’s swordforce silently
advanced to the fourth stage as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swordforce, stage one -
Silver Moon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swordforce, stage two -
Dazzling Sun.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swordforce, stage three
- Imperial Ruler.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swordforce, stage four
- Sword Heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword Heart…”
Ning murmured to himself, then flicked out with his finger in a slow
arc. A black streak of sword-light appeared, swirling around it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he had created the
very first stance of the [Brightmoon] sword-art, Ning had already
reached the third stage of swordforce. Nearly a century had passed,
and over the course of this period of time Ning had completed the
[Brightmoon] sword-art, battled against many Empyrean Gods and
Celestial Immortals in the prisonworld, and even sparred against True
Gods and True Immortals there. However, he had been unable to make
that final breakthrough. Only after sparring against Snowfiend and
after his consciousness was drawn into the stone stele did he finally
break through the last bottleneck and reach the fourth stage of
swordforce.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly, an invisible

into the blurry image of a black sword which covered Ning and swirled
around him.

opened his eyes, staring at the blurry, illusory black sword around
him. This manifestation of fourth-stage swordforce allowed Ning to
clearly sense the childish playfulness of the illusory sword. It was
like a little child that absolutely loved to stick closely to Ning,
causing Ning’s own heart to be filled with joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sentience. Life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first three stages
of swordforce only involved the rigid application of power, but the
fourth stage of swordforce actually gained both life and sentience.
Although the level of intelligence was very low, it was still enough
to truly stun Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prior to this, before
his heartforce had actually reached the fourth stage, Ning had never
sensed this from his swordforce. As for heartforce, it came from
himself; it was the power of his own heart. Swordforce, however, came
from an arcane, inexplicable, unfathomable essence of the sword
itself. The path that Ning was pursuing was the path of finding the
original essence of the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning rose to his feet.
He waved his hand, and the black swordforce responded accordingly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Such tremendous
power. Prior to this, I was a bit weaker than senior
apprentice-brother Silvermoon and Redsnow, due to me not having
trained for long enough. Although my heartforce is formidable, it’s
consumed far too quickly in battle. When I want to beat down on those
weaker than me, it’ll allow me to gain victory in just one or two
blows, but when fighting against experts of the same level, it simply
won’t last. Swordforce, however, doesn’t use up any divine power,
and it comes in a steady, unbroken stream.” Ning was absolutely
delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon truly
comprehending swordforce, even a mortal commoner would be able to
infuse his punches and kicks with fourth-stage swordforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can vaguely sense
that the power of this swordforce is roughly equal to 80% of the
power unleashed when I use my heartforce to maximum ffect.” Ning
sighed in amazement. Although it was ‘only’ 80%, it could be used
in every single strike and blow; in a protracted battle, it would be
far more useful to Ning than heartforce would be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From this day forth,
in a one-on-one battle, I am now the equal of senior
apprentice-brother Silvermoon and Redsnow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After calming himself,
Ning took a look at the volcanic island. This island had a towering
volcano in the center that was occasionally belching forth plumes of
lava. However, because the sea around the volcanic island was
completely frozen with countless snowflakes falling all around it,
the borders of the volcanic island were at a perfect temperature,
with only the volcano itself being blazingly hot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning willed it,
and a second person appeared next to him. It was Empyrean God
Roughpeak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Darknorth.” Roughpeak immediately smiled and
called out to Ning upon stepping out…but upon seeing his
surroundings, he was instantly stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The volcano belching
fire…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was a sight
completely different from that of the snowy island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Th-this place is…”
Roughpeak stuttered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the second
island. I call it ‘Volcano Island’,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You actually
su-succeeded. Ahahaha…wonderful! Wonderful!” Roughpeak turned his
head to look at Ning with eyes full of excitement. “Junior
apprentice-brother Darknorth, to tell you the truth, I didn’t
really think you’d be able to succeed. In fact, after spending a
few days in your Immortal estate, I was truly afraid that you had
already failed. But you actually succeeded! Wonderful, simply
wonderful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughpeak truly didn’t
have that much faith in Ning. He had watched as Ning killed the
Snowfiend clone on the snowy island, and had seen that Ning’s
sword-arts were only at the level of third-stage swordforce. However,
Ning’s sword was quite shockingly fast, which was why he thought
that there might be a chance that he would be acknowledged by
Snowfiend! It wasn’t necessary to actually defeat Snowfiend in
order to go past him; if one fought him for long enough and was
acknowledged by him, one would be allowed past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had spent a long
period of time analyzing the stone stele. Although Ning had felt that
only a brief moment had passed, in truth he had spent more than two
days on it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After waiting for so
long within the Immortal estate, Roughpeak felt that the reason why
Snowfiend had let Ning pass was because the two had fought for so
long that Snowfiend had acknowledged Ning’s power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled. “Luck
was part of it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Being able to pass
Snowfiend proves your power.” Roughpeak sighed. “No matter
what…we’ve finally left the island of snow. I’ve had more than
enough of that place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The island was
actually quite pretty,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When you’ve spent
countless terrified years by yourself in one place, it’ll turn into
hell for you, no matter how ‘pretty’ it is.” Roughpeak said
hurriedly, “Let’s go! Let’s not chat here; let’s take a look
at what’s up ahead! Let’s see if there are any other Empyrean
Gods on this island. The further along we go, the stronger any
surviving Empyrean Gods must be. Even if they aren’t able to make
it to the next island, they should be able to stay alive for quite
some time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, let’s take a
look.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Roughpeak
walked through the volcanic island, taking in the sights. A short
while later, they found a winding series of spiky palaces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Over there. If there
are any surviving Empyrean Gods, they should be living there.”
Roughpeak hurriedly pointed towards the palaces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as his words
came out…whoosh! A fur-clad, muscular, bronze-eyed man appeared at
the entrance to one of the palaces, glancing outside. He instantly
saw both Ning and Roughpeak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eldest brother!
Second brother! Third brother! Fourth brother! Fifth brother! Seventh
sister!” The muscular man instantly called out in a loud voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
One figure after another began to charge out from the other palaces.
They all congregated together, staring towards the two newcomers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six were men, one was a
woman. All of them were dressed in furs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that my young
friend Roughpeak?” Suddenly, a wrinkle-faced man called out to the
two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seven Dragon
Gods…all of you are still alive?” Roughpeak began to roar in
laughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seven Dragon
Gods of the Primordial Era?” Ning was truly shocked as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Before coming to this
place, he had naturally read up on the Empyrean Gods who had entered
Undermoon Lake. The Seven Dragon Gods had entered Undermoon Lake
during the Primordial Era! Countless years had passed since then, and
during his conversation with Roughpeak, Ning had learned that the
island of snow had suffered attacks every thousand years. The same
was most likely true for the other islands as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To be able to live for
even a hundred million years in Undermoon Lake was a marvel. To be
able to survive from the Primordial Era to the modern day?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young friend
Roughpeak, why have you come to this damned hellhole? We should never
have come to this damned place.” The oldest-looking man spoke out
as Ning and Roughpeak walked towards the seven.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too late for
regrets. I’m already here.” Roughpeak let out a sigh. “I was
trapped on the snowy island for more than a hundred million years,
but the seven of you entered during the Primordial Era. I’m in
complete awe of you; you were actually able to survive for so long!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha…and who is
this new friend?” A fiery-haired man looked towards Ning, a
friendly look in his eyes. “Although I don’t recognize him, I can
sense that he’s one of my brothers, a human.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me make the
introductions.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughpeak smiled as he
looked towards Ning. “Junior apprentice-brother Darknorth, I trust
that you must have guessed by now, but these seven are the Seven
Dragon Gods who once followed Human Sovereign Suiren in his campaigns
across the world. In the past, as our human race just began its rise
to prominence, we were still testing out many different cultivation
paths. Human Sovereign Suiren once harvested draconic blood from a
True God and used it to qualitatively change a human’s body and
allow them to train in superior Fiendgod techniques. However, he
discovered later that this sort of forced transformation had an
impact on both the body and the soul, resulting in most being unable
to progress past the Empyrean God level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why do you have to
talk about these things?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At least we became
Empyrean Gods!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seven Dragon Gods
all laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are the Seven
Dragon Gods. The eldest is Empyrean God Witherdragon. This is the
second, Empyrean God Fiercedragon. This is the third, Empyrean God
Blackdragon. This is the fourth, Empyrean God Dragoncaller. This is
the fifth, Empyrean God Owldragon. This is the sixth, Empyrean God
Tyranodragon. And this one, the most beautiful of the seven, would
naturally be Empyrean God Voidragon.” Smiling, Roughpeak made the
introductions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he felt
true admiration for these seven.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had always felt
true admiration for the earliest human experts. They had established
a foundation for all their human descendants, and they had even used
their own bodies to test out new cultivation methods. It wasn’t
just these seven who had attempted to use draconic blood to transform
their bodies; many others had died on the spot, their bodies
instantly blasting apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not just anyone could
withstand the blood of a draconic True God, after all. The seven of
them were seven of Suiren’s early test subjects, and they became
known as the Seven Dragon Gods. Although they weren’t true
siblings, they were even closer to each other than true siblings!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and
introduce this young friend of yours.” The only woman present was
dressed in fur clothes that couldn’t disguise her beauty. Her voice
was clear and crisp, but as heroic and valiant as any of the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He is junior
apprentice-brother Darknorth, one of the disciples under the tutelage
of Daofather Subhuti,” Roughpeak said with a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My young friend
Darknorth, it’s been a long time since we’ve encountered other
humans. The seven of us have nearly died of loneliness here.
Ahahaha…come, come, come! Taste some of this wine which our seventh
sister created through harvesting elemental energy.” The tall,
muscular, bronze-eyed man who had been the first to see Ning and
Roughpeak immediately stepped forward, slapping his arm around Ning’s
shoulders and pulling him towards his palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seven Dragon Gods
of the Primordial Era, Empyrean God Roughpeak, and Ji Ning. These
nine humans all seated themselves in a casual manner, beginning to
drink wine in large gulps while chatting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I trust that the
seven of you know by now that the outside world is now in the era of
the Three Realms,” Roughpeak suddenly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, we’ve heard
of this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Some Empyrean Gods
who passed by mentioned this to us.” They all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughpeak nodded as
well. “But I imagine that those Empyrean Gods didn’t know that
the Three Realms have fallen into a state of crisis. A tribulation
has descended.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tribulation?” The
faces of the Seven Dragon Gods all changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One which is as
deadly as the tribulation which destroyed the Primordial Era,”
Roughpeak said somberly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seven Dragon Gods
had entered Undermoon Lake during the Primordial Era, and so they
didn’t experience the war that destroyed it. However, the Empyrean
Gods that had come past them since then had described the war to
them. They knew exactly how calamitous that war had been. Even major
powers had died, as well as Elder Gods! The Pangu Chaosworld itself
had been shattered!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was junior
apprentice-brother Darknorth who told me this.” Roughpeak looked
towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me explain.”
Ning began to narrate the details of this tribulation to the seven.
Upon hearing the story, their faces all changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I knew this…I
would’ve slaughtered all of the Empyrean Gods of the Seamless Gate
that came here in the past!” Empyrean God Tyranodragon bellowed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn. Damn! They
really are like a pack of wild mongrels that just can’t be tamed.
They should die. Every last one of them should die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seven Dragon Gods
were all utterly furious. They could imagine how disastrous and
calamitous this new storm would be. The more they imagined it, the
angrier they grew.
</P>

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_14___Volcano_Island"></A>
Chapter 14 - Volcano Island
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After chatting for a
long period of time and finishing all the wine, everyone prepared to
retire to their own residences. Ji Ning hurriedly advised Empyrean
God Roughpeak, “Senior apprentice-brother Roughpeak, there’s a
stone stele located right at the entrance to Volcano Island. The
stone stele contains the representation of Snowfiend displaying the
intricacies of his staff-technique in detail. You can go take a
look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Roughpeak’s
eyes lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Roughpeak, you
haven’t taken a look yet?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and take a
look. That stone stele really is quite interesting.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, hurry up and
take a look!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dragon Gods all
laughed and urged him to go take a look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine. I’ll go take
a look right now.” Roughpeak immediately headed out towards the
stone stele by himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My friend Darknorth,
there are plenty of palaces here. Just pick one as you see fit. Since
you’ve just arrived, it’s guaranteed that you won’t suffer any
attacks for the next thousand years,” Empyrean God Witherdragon
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded, then casually chose a palace to temporarily reside in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two days later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughpeak returned from
his trip to the stone stele, once more reuniting with the Seven
Dragon Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How did it go? That
stone stele is quite nice, right?” Empyrean God Owldragon laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It really is quite
something, but my path isn’t the Dao of Taiji. Alas…I was trapped
on the snowy island for more than a hundred million y ears because my
attacks are too weak.” Roughpeak let out a sigh. “My agility
techniques ensured that not even Snowfiend could kill me, but what of
it? My attacks are too weak; Snowfiend completely refused to
acknowledge me. He wouldn’t let me pass him no matter what! It was
all thanks to junior apprentice-brother Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And where is our
friend Darknorth?” Witherdragon asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s still
training,” Voidragon replied. “I saw him meditating so I didn’t
disturb him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth truly is
hard-working.” Blackdragon asked, “Roughpeak, how strong is our
friend Darknorth? The seven of us have been trapped here for far, far
too long. We’ve been here since the Primordial Era and really can’t
take it any longer. If Darknorth is strong enough, we’d be willing
to ask him to help lead us out of here. We no longer harbor any false
illusions regarding the treasures of Undermoon Lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How strong is he?”
Roughpeak shook his head. “I’ve seen him fight. He’s skilled in
swordplay and quite formidable, but he’s only reached the third
stage of swordforce. His divine abilities should be quite powerful,
though. He spent several days travelling from the snowy island to
Volcano Island. I imagine that he must’ve fought against Snowfiend
for a long period of time, resulting in Snowfiend acknowledging his
power and letting him pass.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Third-stage
swordforce?” Witherdragon shook his head. “A pity. Although he
can be considered an expert of the Dao of the Sword, it won’t be
enough against the Purgatory God.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A pity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well, let’s keep
waiting.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were rather
disappointed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m already
satisfied at having been able to make it out of the first island to
Volcano Island. In truth, my decision to follow junior
apprentice-brother Darknorth was a gamble. When I saw him fight, I
didn’t have much faith in him…but in the end, my gamble paid off.
Honestly, there’s no need to be depressed; perhaps after million
years or so, junior apprentice-brother Darknorth will suddenly
advance in strength and we’ll be able to make yet another gamble,”
Roughpeak said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hopefully.” The
Seven Dragon Gods all sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had been hoping
that someone would be able to come here and help them out, but
Roughpeak had actually been carried here by Ning; there was no hope
to be found from him at all. As for Ning himself…he had been just
barely able to make it into Volcano Island. The chance that he would
be able to progress further was quite remote.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a quiet,
secluded palace. Ning was seated in the lotus position here,
completely silent. His other clone was within his Immortal estate,
and both of them were meditating on the [Five Treasures].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His earlier
breakthrough had allowed him to completely master the third chapter
of the [Five Treasures], and so he was now able to begin training in
the final, fourth chapter of the [Five Treasures]. This final chapter
caused Ning to feel even more amazed and how unfathomably marvelous
the [Five Treasures] sword-art was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew very well
that Undermoon Lake would not be an easy place to conquer. He had
only been able to reach Volcano Island; how incredibly difficult
would the next few islands be? Thus, he had to do everything he could
to grow stronger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time slowly flowed on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
more than half a year had gone past. During this past half-year,
Ning’s two clones finished nearly half of the fourth chapter of the
[Five Treasures] sword-art. Now, however, they found it difficult to
advance any further whatsoever. Thus, Ning decided to completely halt
his meditations on it and turn his attention towards perfecting his
[Brightmoon] sword-art. He had yet to improve the [Brightmoon]
sword-art after reaching the fourth stage of swordforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Perfecting [Brightmoon]
was, by comparison, an easier task than mastering the fourth chapter
of the [Five Treasures]. In fact, over the course of perfecting it,
Ning occasionally gained insights that allowed him to once more
ruminate on the fourth chapter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After one year and
three months had passed since Ning’s arrival at Volcano Island…Ning
finally opened his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My [Brightmoon]
sword-art has reached the apex of perfection possible for me at
present.” Ning rose to his feet, a smile on his face. “If I was
to meet Snowfiend again, I’d probably be able to easily defeat him
with just a single body.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swordforce was highly
well-suited for combat to begin with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s [Brightmoon]
sword-art had been based off of the essence of the [Five Treasures]
sword-art, a technique which surpassed the limits set by the Heavenly
Daos. Its power was naturally staggering, and in attack power it was
now completely capable of suppressing Snowfiend. Once Ning used
[Three Heads, Six Arms] and fought against Snowfiend’s two arms
with six arms…he would absolutely be able to dominate and defeat
Snowfiend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s been quite
some time since I’ve spoken to Roughpeak and the Seven Dragon
Gods.” Ning felt rather embarrassed. During this year, he had spent
all of his time in meditating. He immediately left his palace to go
meet with the Seven Dragon Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
the Seven Dragon Gods, Roughpeak, and Ning all gathered together once
more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s very unlikely
that the eight of us will be able to advance any further, and so we
often gather together. But you, junior apprentice-brother
Darknorth…you end up going into seclusion for a full year in one
training session! You remind of me myself when I first entered
Undermoon Lake,” Roughpeak said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m embarrassed,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, right.” Ning
looked at the other eight. “I’m preparing to go test the next
guardian and see if I can reach the next island?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seven Dragon Gods
and Roughpeak all glanced at each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Witherdragon said,
“Brother Darknorth, do you know that there are treasures on the
third island? If you can make it there, you can acquire treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Treasures?” Ning’s
eyes lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The sea yaksha,
Snowfiend, and Purgatory God - these are three of the guardians which
the creator of Undermoon Lake left behind. If you can make it past
the three of them, you’ll be able to acquire treasures. And of
course, the fourth and fifth islands all have treasures as well.”
Witherdragon looked at Ning. “But…do you think those treasures
are so easily acquired? You can probably guess at how powerful the
Purgatory God is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately began
to listen carefully. Only by understanding both one’s self and
one’s enemies would one be able to win all battles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“On the other side of
Volcano Island, you’ll be able to see yet another floating wooden
bridge. This floating wooden bridge will pass through an endless sea
of fire…and within the sea of fire lives a Fiendgod known as the
Purgatory God.” Witherdragon continued, “The Purgatory God is
formed by countless flames that gather together. He wields a pair of
halberds, and he is incredibly powerful, close to a True God in
might. Although he flies quite slowly, his twin halberds attack at an
utterly incredible speed. His infiniforce has even reached the fourth
stage! Compared to Snowfiend, he’s stronger, has faster attacks,
and is even more skilled. When those twin halberds of his start to
chop about…he’s an utter nightmare.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
shocked by what he heard. Even stronger and even faster than
Snowfiend? This meant that this Purgatory God’s underlying
foundation was superior to Snowfiend’s!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The seven of us know
exactly how powerful he is. Honestly, we hope for your success, as
that way we’d be able to follow you through, but…” Witherdragon
shook his head. “He’s far too powerful. If you aren’t strong
enough, you will likely die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The seven of you
entered long ago during the Primordial Era.” Puzzled, Ning said,
“If you wanted to follow a powerful Empyrean God to the next
island, you probably could’ve done so long ago. You should’ve run
into quite a few by now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Voidragon,
the only female of the seven, nodded. She said in a clear voice,
“Your words are correct. From the Primordial Era to the present
day, we’ve encountered more than ten who we were absolutely certain
had the power to pass through. However, all of them came a long, long
time ago. When the seven of us work together, even when the Purgatory
God attacks the island he is unable to do anything to us. We were
patient enough to keep waiting and training, hoping that we’d be
able to break through by relying on our own power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…roughly
thirty million years ago, the Purgatory God told us that we have
almost spent an entire chaos cycle in Undermoon Lake. After a hundred
million years, he would use his full power to wipe us all out.”
Voidragon’s gaze turned dim. “Only then did we realize that there
was a limit to the amount of time which Undermoon Lake gave us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If the Purgatory God
really was to attack at full-power and press us nonstop…our divine
power would rapidly deplete, and when we use it all up, we’ll die.
We’ve never heard of the term ‘chaos cycle’ before, but we
understand that it has to be a period of time which the major power
that created this world uses.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A chaos cycle?”
Ning was startled. A chaos cycle had already passed since the
Primordial Era?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had felt all along
that Undermoon Lake was a place that was meant to cultivate Empyrean
Gods through particularly ruthless methods. However, a chaos cycle
was enough; if one wasn’t able to make any real breakthroughs in an
entire chaos cycle, they generally wouldn’t be able to make any
more breakthroughs at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We only have seventy
million years left.” Tyranodragon’s deep, sonorous voice boomed
out. “We absolutely aren’t willing to just admit defeat. We want
to keep living, so our only hope right now is to find a powerful
Empyrean God who can bring us along with him. But alas, no such
figure has appeared recently.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. During the
past ten million years, he had been the only person to even enter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although we truly
wish to leave this place and aren’t willing to just die here…Ji
Ning, you really are not yet strong enough.” Tyranodragon
continued, “Please don’t blame me for saying something
unpleasant, but the Purgatory God truly is incredibly powerful. Your
third-stage swordforce…it’s far from being enough. You don’t
have much of a chance to make it past him. To make it past him, you
generally have to reach the fourth stage of thunderforce,
taiji-force, infiniforce, heartforce, etc.; you have to reach the
fourth stage to have any hope of succeeding.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And of course, if
you are particularly skilled in a battle-type force, such as
swordforce or saberforce, you’ll be completely capable of
succeeding.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tyranodragon looked at
Ning. “Brother Darknorth, you should wait until you have at least a
decent chance before making the attempt. Otherwise…you’ll be
gambling with your life. If you are lucky, you might escape, but if
you aren’t, you’ll die there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Darknorth, it’s best if you wait patiently for
some time. You aren’t like us; a long path still lies ahead of
you,” Roughpeak said. “Honestly, I’m already quite content with
being able to see Volcano Island.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Third-stage swordforce?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why did they believe
him to be at the third stage of swordforce?

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop!” Ji Ning
hurriedly called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seven Dragon Gods
and Empyrean God Roughpeak paused their protestations, looking at
Ning. Truthfully speaking, they didn’t really want to say these
words either, but they also didn’t wish to see Ning die in the
hands of the Purgatory God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You, uh…who told
you that my swordforce is at the third stage?” Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The other
eight were all startled. Judging from Ji Ning’s words…it seemed
as though he wasn’t at that stage?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I did.” Roughpeak
looked at Ning, puzzled. “Was my guess wrong?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh!” Ning now
understood. Laughing, he explained, “When I first encountered you,
senior apprentice-brother Roughpeak, I was indeed just at the third
stage of swordforce.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These words instantly
caused the eight to reveal looks of surprised delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You broke through?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You made a
breakthrough when fighting Snowfiend?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have you reached the
fourth stage of swordforce?” All of them looked eagerly and
excitedly towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled, then
nodded. At the same time, he waved a finger, causing a loop of
extremely sharp black sword-light to circle around it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon seeing the black,
sword-shaped swordforce, the Seven Dragon Gods and Roughpeak felt
extremely excited, but they also didn’t know whether to laugh or to
cry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughpeak finally said,
“Junior apprentice-brother Darknorth, I…uh…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand,”
Ning said hurriedly. “Senior apprentice-brother Roughpeak, you
believed that I had fought against Snowfiend for an extremely long
period of time, and so you naturally came to certain conclusions
based on that. It’s my fault for not having explained it to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can it be your
fault? Who would be so foolish as to blurt out exactly how strong
they are?” The nearby Empyrean God Tyranodragon boomed with
laughter. “Excellent. It seems as though the seven of us aren’t
destined to die just yet. Given how powerful you are, brother
Darknorth, it should be easy for you to overcome the Purgatory God.
Come, come, come! Let’s make haste towards the next island. Our
chances of leaving will be greater as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve been in
Undermoon Lake for countless years. Oh - according to what the
Purgatory God said, we’ve been here for nearly a ‘chaos cycle’.
I wonder what the next island is like?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m rather
curious.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hear that after
defeating the Purgatory God, you’ll be able to acquire treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fourth brother, why
are YOU getting excited? You won’t be the one to get the
treasures!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My excitement is no
business of yours!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all celebrated and
joked about. Clearly, the chance to leave this Volcano Island had put
them all in quite a good mood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An hour later, Ning and
the others arrived at the other end of Volcano Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here we are. All you
need to do is advance past the floating wooden bridge.”
Witherdragon pointed towards the wooden bridge up ahead. In front of
them was an endless sea of flames that stretched off into the
horizon, with the wooden bridge being the only thing within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s really hot.”
Ning turned his head and grinned. “Everyone, come into my Immortal
estate for a few days.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sorry for the
trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“C’mere, lemme see
what your Immortal estate is like!” They all laughed and jested.
Their relaxation was primarily due to the fact that they knew how
strong Ning was and that he was certain of victory. Roughpeak, when
he had first joined Ning, had done so in a much more nervous,
restless manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand.
None of the eight Empyrean Gods resisted, allowing him to draw them
into his Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
seated himself within his Ruyi Soulsnake Shuttle, then began to
rapidly advance via the wooden bridge into the sea of flames.
Although the flames were incredibly hot, Empyrean Gods would
generally find it easily to endure them, to say nothing of someone
like Ning who was protected by the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After flyinig for just
a single hour…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning came to
a sudden halt, staring in front of himself. Up ahead, a massive red
figure that was more than ten meters tall had appeared on the bridge.
The figure was bald, had red eyebrows, a red beard, and was extremely
muscular. He wielded a pair of short halberds in his hands, and his
dark-red eyes were fixed upon Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The invisible
pressure he gives off truly is stronger than Snowfiend’s,” Ning
murmured to himself. The only reason Ning was able to sense this was
because his foe had prepared his full power, not disguising his aura
at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning put away the Ruyi
Soulsnake Shuttle, then landed on the bridge. A pair of swords
appeared in his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He wasn’t even
willing to use [Three Heads, Six Arms]. Now that his swordforce had
reached a new level, and his [Brightmoon] sword-art had been further
perfected…he wanted to give himself a good challenge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can sense…that
the volcanic island no longer has any Empyrean Gods on it.” The
Purgatory God’s dark-red eyes held a hint of madness within them.
“It seems you are quite confident.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please come,” Ning
said politely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Purgatory God
didn’t hesitate. He immediately bound forward, his body moving at
incredible speed. He instantly arrived before Ning, who charged
forward as well, sending two streaks of black sword-light towards the
Purgatory God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but take several steps back, while the Purgatory God was knocked back
by one step as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What tremendous
power.” Ning was secretly surprised. “In strength alone, he’s
nearly at the True God level. Fortunately, my swordforce reached the
fourth level.” After swordforce reached the fourth level, Ning was
able to unleash power equivalent to 80% of a full-force heartforce
blow with each ordinary strike. This level of power was absolutely
enough for him to do battle head-on against his foe. All Ning had to
do was reserve enough divine power to allow him to move about at high
speed. There wasn’t even a need for him to use the [Starseizing
Hand] or [Three Heads, Six Arms]. In fact, he didn’t even really
need to fight with full power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was completely
capable of replenishing the amount of divine power which he was using
up through absorbing natural elemental energy from Heaven and Earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stage-four
swordforce?” The Purgatory God instantly grew even frenzied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
The twin halberds hacked downwards, screaming through the air like
devils.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two short halberds
were like the Taiji itself; one was Yin while the other was Yang, and
both joined together into a perfect whole that completely embodied
the essence of of what Wuji, Infinity, was all about. Although Ning
also wielded a pair of twin swords, in terms of making his swords
work together in harmony he was vastly inferior to the Purgatory God.
Anyone who had embarked on the path of Wuji would be extremely
skilled in making multiple weapons work together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Ning’s sword-light remained as fast and bizarre as ever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In Undermoon Lake, Ning
had spent most of his time and effort on the Shadowless stance, and
this stane was the most unpredictable stance of them all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two exchanged blows
for a long while. For a period of time, Ning was at a slight
disadvantage; although his attacks were more powerful, his two
weapons didn’t work together as seamlessly as his enemy’s did,
resulting in him being at an overall disadvantage. In truth, if Ning
used the [Three Heads, Six Arms] technique, he would be able to
quickly suppress his opponent, but Ning was in no hurry to do so.
Finding such a perfect opponent wasn’t an easy task!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of his
sword-arts primarily came from his black swordforce. Very little of
Ning’s divine power was being used up, and it was actually being
replenished faster than it was being consumed. He’d easily be able
to battle like this for a thousand years without any problems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This battle went on for
more than half a month. Ning had just broken through to the fourth
stage of swordforce a short while ago; now that he was able to fight
against such a perfectly matched foe for so long, his sword-arts grew
increasingly refined and perfected. Although he had spent more thana
year meditating on his sword-arts on Volcano Island, he hadn’t had
an actual opponent to test himself against. Only upon encountering a
formidable opponent would he realize that his ‘perfected’
sword-arts were still lacking in many areas. As a result of his
continued improvement, his sword-arts grew increasingly powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You win.” The
Purgatory God suddenly retreated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. During
the past half-month, he had went from being at a slight disadvantage
to holding a slight advantage! The Dao of the Sword was simply too
well-suited for launching offensive attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Purgatory God
looked at Ning, his lips cracking apart into an ugly grin. “I’ll
be waiting for you at Myriad Mountains Island.” His body then
vanished, leaving behind countless flames that quickly dissipated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Myriad Mountains
Island?” Ning murmured softly to himself, “Can it be that the
third island is Myriad Mountains Island?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish. Ning boarded his
Ruyi Soulsnake Shuttle, then continued to advance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After flying for around
an hour, an enormous, gourd-shaped island appeared before him. This
gourd-shaped island looked as though it was a small island and a
large island joined together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the wooden
bridge, it led to the small island. At the end of the wooden bridge
stood the bald, red-browed Purgatory God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this is Myriad
Mountains Island?” Ning landed with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To be precise, the
small island is a treasure island.” The Purgatory God pointed
towards the distant, larger island. “That large island over there
is the actual Myriad Mountains Island. As for this small island…it
has quite a few treasures. You can choose three of them. After doing
so, you have to enter the large island. You won’t be allowed to
come here again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Undermoon Lake was a
place where you could only advance, not retreat. Ning understood
this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon reaching Volcano
Island, for example, there would be no way back to the snowy island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After entering Myriad
Mountains Island, there would be no way back to Volcano Island. The
only options were to die or to successfully pass through the
remaining islands and return to the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three?” Ning said
with surprise, “I hear that the fourth and fifth islands all have
treasures as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The
Purgatory God nodded. “The third, fourth, and fifth islands all
have treasures within them. In each place, you can choose three
items. Thus, there’s a total of nine items you can acquire. Once
you reach the fifth island, you’ll be allowed to leave Undermoon
Lake. But of course, in this chaos cycle, the only one who survived
was the man called ‘Jueming’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly became
filled with questions. The legends of the Three Realms stated that
Buddha Jueming left Undermoon Lake with three treasures…but the
Purgatory God now said that he left with nine?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems there are
six treasures which Buddha Jueming did not make public,” Ning mused
to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Follow me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They walked through the
smaller island, nearly a million kilometers in circumference. It took
them only a short while to travel hundreds of thousands of kilometers
and arrive at a lake. Compared to the endless amount of distance the
Ruyi Soulsnake Shuttle had traversed over the oceans here, this
island really was just a small island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The island lake was
covered by a hazy mist that prevented others from seeing it clearly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disperse.” The
Purgatory God waved his hand, causing all the mist to dissipate and
the lake to appear. The lake was actually separated into nine
distinct regions! One region was filled with incredibly hot Ninefire
Lava, with a dark-red snow lotus growing atop it. Another region was
filled with slowly flowing rivers of icy Iceheart Pith, and atop the
pith grew a clump of jewel-like Iceheart Leaf. There was also a
region filled with many types of precious medicinal herbs, all filled
with life energy. These precious herbs had given birth to a
jade-green fruit that appeared to levitate above them…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nine regions of fire,
of ice, of darkness, of life, of death…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A single invisible
formation joined these nine regions together in a perfect manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? Iceheart Pith?
Ninefire Lava? This place actually has both of them?” Ning’s
heartrate instantly sped up. He grew excited now; he didn’t expect
that he would discover Iceheart Pith, which he badly desired, right
here within the third island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The treasures which
Buddha Jueming made public are actually all here.” Ning instantly
guessed at the reason behind this. “It seems that Buddha Jueming
didn’t make public any of the treasures he acquired on the fourth
and fifth islands.” Anyone could tell that the treasures on the
later islands would be even more valuable and useful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Choose.” The
Purgatory God, upon seeing Ning go into a daze, urged Ning to hurry
up. “There are nine types of treasures here. You can choose three
of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nine types of
treasure?” Ning was startled. There were nine regions in total. The
Iceheart Pith region had a single Iceheart Leaf growing atop it.
Although Iceheart Leaf was valuable, the large amount of flowing
Iceheart Pith was something which Ning desperately desired as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can I choose the
Iceheart Pith?” Ning suddenly asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Iceheart Pith?”
The Purgatory God frowned as he looked at Ning. “Iceheart Leafs
crystallize above the Iceheart Pith. You should choose the leaf; the
leaf is the crystallized essence of the pith. All nine regions have
crystallized essences of certain things; you should choose them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But I want the
Iceheart Pith. Can I have it?” Ning asked. He definitely had to
choose the Iceheart Leaf, but what of the Iceheart Pith?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Purgatory God
frowned. “The Iceheart Pith is the foundation; because it exists,
Iceheart Leaf can grow. After an Iceheart Leaf is harvested, more
will grow after a long period of time. You can choose Iceheart Leaf,
but the underlying Iceheart Pith…how could I possibly give it to
you?”

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning instantly felt
his heart clench. Iceheart Pith was the foundation of the leaf?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With the pith gone,
there will be no more leaves in the future.” The Purgatory God
looked at Ning. “Many other Empyrean Gods will enter the Myriad
Mountains Island. I can’t just let one of the treasures disappear
due to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But I heard that the
person who left, Jueming, was given more than just a single Iceheart
Leaf,” Ning suddenly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Purgatory God’s
face changed slightly. He cursed softly, “Damn that Jueming. Why
did he have to blabber about the treasures?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, your words are
correct.” The Purgatory God looked towards Ning. “Jueming entered
Undermoon Lake long, long ago. He was able to make it all the way to
Myriad Mountains Island in one try, and was only the second person to
make it here. Back then, there were many Iceheart Leafs, and so
giving him twelve didn’t make much of a difference. But as time
flowed on, the Empyrean Gods who entered this place were all tempered
and strengthened. More of them entered Myriad Mountains Island…and
as a result, the amount of treasures stored here began to run low.
That’s why the reward was changed to be a single leaf.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since you also made
it all the way here on your first try…if you want twelve leaves,
I’ll give them to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Purgatory God waved
his hand. Whoosh. Instantly, the Iceheart Pith region began to
ripple, as though some sort of restrictive spell had just been
dissipated. One platter after another began to appear, each holding
an Iceheart Leaf. There had to be at least ten thousand of the leaves
within the great Iceheart Pith region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That many?” Ning
was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is it? If every
single Empyrean God takes away twelve leaves, then a thousand of them
would take over more than ten thousand, yes?” The Purgatory God
snorted. “I have to be sparing with these treasures. The only
reason why I’m willing to offer you twelve is because you made it
here on your first trip without failure. Twelve of the leaves
wouldn’t be a problem, but the Iceheart Pith…that’s the
foundation. Forget about it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood. These
Iceheart Leaves all came from the Iceheart Pith before him; to
acquire the pith was highly unlikely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Actually…” Ning
suddenly said, “I only need a small amount of Iceheart Pith. Let’s
say…a few dozen square meters of it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A few dozen square
meters?” The Purgatory God stared. “You call that a ‘small
amount’?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt a surge of
delight in his heart. Judging from the Purgatory God’s attitude,
there was clearly some bargaining room here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are several
square kilometers of Iceheart Pith here. A few dozen square meters is
nothing,” Ning said hurriedly. Seeing the look on the Purgatory
God’s face, Ning knew that he was rather unlikely to agree. Ning
immediately said, “Just thirty square meters!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you know how deep
the Iceheart Pith goes?” The Purgatory God explained, “They are
nearly ninety meters deep. You want nearly 2700 cubic meters of it?
Completely impossible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just nine meters
deep and nine meters long,” Ning said hurriedly. “That’s all I
want…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Purgatory God
frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just a tiny bit of
Iceheart Pith and a single Iceheart Leaf.” Ning looked at the
Purgatory God. “I won’t take any of the other treasures. Earlier,
you said that I can take three of my choosing. All I want is a bit of
Iceheart Pith and a single Iceheart Leaf.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nine meters…”
The Purgatory God looked at Ning, hesitating.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked back at
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” The
Purgatory God nodded. “Since you made it all the way here on your
first try…and since nine meters won’t have an impact on the
foundation as a whole. Earlier, I told you that you can choose three
treasures; now, you’ll only be allowed to pick a single Iceheart
Leaf and some of the Iceheart Pith.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was overjoyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you have any
treasures to hold it?” The Purgatory God looked at Ning. Ning
quickly took out a green-jade bottle. The Purgatory God nodded, then
waved his hand. An invisible hand seemed to scrape out a small
‘crater’ in the Iceheart Pith, carving out a spherical portion
that was nine meters long and nine meters deep. The Iceheart Pith
floated straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come here.” Ning
willed it, and the Iceheart Pith instantly flew into the green-jade
bottle. He plugged it with a stopper, then waved his hand and
collected the Iceheart Pith flying towards him as well. Only then did
Ning let out a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had finally
succeeded. In truth, the other treasures here were of little interest
to Ning. He was neither an artifact forger, nor was he a pill
refiner, and he had no other skills that could make use of these
things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What he needed were
treasures and techniques that would increase his own strength.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Purgatory God
muttered to himself, “I really got ripped off this time. I’m
usually able to shoo away Empyrean Gods just by giving them three
Iceheart Leafs or equivalent treasures, but I ran into yet another
person who knew that Jueming acquired twelve. Jueming…what a
troublemaker.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shoo, shoo! Off with
you!” The Purgatory God stared at Ning. “Are you waiting for me
to show you off?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed, then
immediately left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Immortal
estate he was carrying. The second Ji Ning was within a meditative
room inside the estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve acquired the
Iceheart Pith.” Ning held the green-jade bottle in his hands, a
look of delight on his face. “Fortunately, the Purgatory God was
rather easygoing and easy to negotiate with. He wasn’t too
stubborn. Otherwise, things would be quite troublesome.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, as soon as
Ning saw that the Purgatory God had only been willing to give him a
single Iceheart Leaf when Buddha Jueming had acquired twelve, Ning
had immediately sensed that the Purgatory God was tampering with
things a bit. This was because there was definitely no way that all
of the other Empyrean Gods had merely received just a single leaf
when they entered Myriad Mountains Island. The Purgatory God
definitely had a certain amount of discretionary power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Perhaps he wouldn’t
be allowed to give an Empyrean God too much, but he could definitely
choose to give them a bit less if he chose. And so, Ning decided to
give negotiation a try…and he succeeded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nine meters long,
nine meters deep. Iceheart Pith is a bit ligher than I expected,”
Ning mused to himself. “This amount of Iceheart Pith weighs roughly
300,000 kilograms or so.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Iceheart Pith could
float atop water. However, this amount sufficed for his needs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My thirty-six clones
need a total of 180,000 kilograms. This is enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After acquiring the
necessary treasures, Ning no longer hesitated. He immediately took
out a different, red-jade bottle. The red-jade bottle contained
Ninefire Lava within it. Ning had prepared 50,000 kilograms of it for
his journey to Undermoon Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to begin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning pulled open the
stopper to the green-jade bottle and the red-jade bottle. He placed
them atop the floor, then sat down in the lotus position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning floated up
into the air by roughly thirty meters, then the True Immortal energy
within his body began to activate. Slowly, a formation-diagram
created from an enormous amount of energy began to form below Ning.
As the energy surged, the diagram began to shine with golden light.
The formation of golden light formed a sphere of nearly three hundred
meters that was like an enormous screen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A large amount of runes
flowed atop it as Ning’s energy flowed through it in an
incomparably marvelous manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After a full hour, Ning
finally finished manifesting the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fire formation
has finally manifested.” Ning let out a sigh of relief. He took out
a Great Firmament pill to replenish his energy, then once more began
to manifest a second formation. In the air above Ning’s head, a
second formation of similar size began to slowly manifest. As Ning
continued to materialize it, the formation slowly began to glow with
black light. The formation continued to improve in power, until it
became like black jade in appearance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three hundred meters of
golden light below him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three hundred meters of
black light above him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now that the Icefire
Formation has formed…it is time to refine the Jindan.” Ning
opened his eyes and stared towards the two distant bottles. The
red-jade bottle and the green-jade bottle began to release the
Ninefire Lava and the Iceheart Pith within them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A total of 7,500
kilograms flew out from each. Ning was worried that he would run out,
and so he brought out a bit more than he needed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The streams of Ninefire
Lava and the Iceheart Pith transformed into two spheres that hovered
before Ning. One was a sphere of Ninefire Lava, while the other was a
sphere of Iceheart Pith. Within the two spheres, Ninefire Lava and
Iceheart Pith slowly bubbled and frothed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh. The essence
within the Ninefire Lava sphere began to automatically and slowly be
drawn downwards, being absorbed into the golden light diagram. As for
the sphere of Iceheart Pith, its essence was similarly being drawn up
into the black light diagram above Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After absorbing the
essence of these two treasures, both diagrams dramatically increased
in power. They now contained an unfathomable, mysterious power that
began to flow into Ning’s body, mingling within the Pure Yang
Jindan inside of Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two diametrically
opposed types of energy, fire from Ninefire Lava and ice from
Iceheart Pith, both came from treasures that were created by the
primordial chaos. They held tremendous, marvelous power within them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a comfortable
feeling.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense that
the Pure Yang Jindan within his body was being baptized and
transformed by the unspeakably marvelous power of ice and fire. This
was an extremely comfortable feeling, and the Jindan was slowly
beginning to transform. Despite how slow the process was, Ning could
clearly sense every single part of the change.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Despite being slow,
after two or three days, the transformation would be quite shocking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to the
records I read of the Icefire Jindan Smelting method, it will take
roughly a month to upgrade my Jindan to the second tier. This is a
slow process of nourishing and transforming the Jindan that cannot be
rushed.” Ning tamped down the eagerness and excitement he felt,
allowing the two giant formations to slowly extract energy from the
two types of items to smelt his Jindan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He believed that a
month from now, his Pure Yang Jindan would reach the second tier. He
would be a half-step into the Daofather level of power. This was a
qualitative transformation, a fundamental transformation. Once his
Jindan transformed, the soul within the Jindan would also be
empowered at a rapid pace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll wait for a
month.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One clone trained in
the Icefire Jindan Smelting method, while the other left the smaller
island and reached the larger island; Myriad Mountains Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entrance to Myriad
Mountains Island also had a black stone stele before it. This one was
covered with a diagram of flames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The stone stele in
front of Volcano Island contained the staff-arts of Snowfiend. I
imagine that this stone stele contains the the halberd-arts of the
Purgatory God.” Ning was still quite intrigued; although he had
battled against the Purgatory God for a long period of time, that was
a wild fight that made it difficult for him to truly understand the
true essence and nature of his opponent’s techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood before the
black stone stele, staring at the flame diagram. Soon, his mind was
drawn into it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a blurry region,
a human-shaped creature was brandishing two halberds. The creature
started with elementary stances, but slowly began to advance through
the many deeper variations on the twin halberds technique. It started
simple and became complicated; started slow and became fast. In the
end, it formed into the most terrifying stance which the Purgatory
God had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long time later,
Ning’s mind escaped the stone stele. He revealed a look of approval
on his face. “I gained quite a bit from viewing the entire
technique, from start to finish. My twin swords are still a bit
inferior by comparison.” Ning had gained certain insights that
would allow him to perfect the [Brightmoon] sword-art further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First, Myriad
Mountains Island.” Ning swept it with his gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This vast island was
filled with mountains. Some pierced high into the clouds, some were
as slender and sharp as knives, some were short, some were
strange-looking. There were at least ten thousand mountains here, and
none of the mountains were linked together. To see more than ten
thousand solitary mountains…this truly was a strange sight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder which
Empyrean Gods are on this island.” Ning immediately walked towards
the depths of the island.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_17___Relentless_Until_De"></A>
Chapter 17 - Relentless Until Dead
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to what
the Purgatory God said, this island is named ‘Myriad Mountains
Island’.” Ji Ning smiled, the Seven Dragon Gods and Empyrean God
Roughpeak by his side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Myriad Mountains
Island? Not bad, not bad.” Empyrean God Tyranodragon stared with
his large bronze eyes towards the surrounding area. “These
mountains are like spears that are jabbing towards the heavens.
Interesting, interesting. Myriad Mountains Island…a fine name!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughpeak had returned
to his normal, relaxed, graceful demeanor. Looking at his
surroundings, he said with delight, “I didn’t expect that I’d
be able to see the third island so soon. I had thought that I would
be satisfied with just seeing the second island. Haha…perhaps,
junior apprentice-brother Darknorth, you’ll be able to make it all
the way out in one try.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He just might.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth,
we believe in you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all chortled with
laughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, didn’t
dare to make any boasts. The nine of them walked forward together.
Although the island was quite large, they were able to advance
through it at tremendous speed, thanks to spatial compression
techniques they used. After walking for just a short while, they had
already travelled millions of kilometers. They could vaguely make out
the sound of laughter and jesting in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This caused Ning and
the rest of the nine to exchange curious looks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems as though
there are quite a few people here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go take a
look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They immediately headed
towards the direction of the voices, and as they drew nearer the
voices became clearer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent,
excellent! Big brother Feiyou, your song was excellent. Let me sing
as well!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Undermoon Lake, how
truly carefree, <BR> Drinking fine wine, how truly sublime, <BR> No
worries at all, no worries at all, <BR> A nap I’ll take, and I’ll
sleep till I wake!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The coarse, rough voice
boomed out like thunder, carrying a certain cadence and tempo to it.
Upon hearing this, Ning couldn’t help but blink. This was
‘singing’? What a perfectly awful song!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, Ning and the rest
of the nine reached the region where the voices were coming from.
They saw a bonfire blazing in the midst of a desolate, wild area, and
skinned haunches of animal meat were currently being roasted above
the bonfire. A large amount of glistening oil dripped down from the
meat, falling into the flames and emitting crackling sounds. The
fragrance of the meat had long ago wafted out to the nine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dozens of animals were
being roasted in unison, and around the bonfire there were men and
women who were either sitting or standing and singing. Most of them
were dressed in furs, and they all looked quite relaxed and content.
There were also some dressed in robes, but they looked similarly
casual and relaxed. They were all either holding wine gourds or wine
bottles in their arms as they gulped down wine and chomped away at
their meat, laughing and shouting with abandon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha, you guys
truly do have it sublime. You even have meat to eat!” Empyrean God
Witherdragon laughed loudly and charged towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I knew that it had
to be big brother Feiyou over there. All of you who followed big
brother Feiyou have had meat to eat and wine to drink. I, on the
other hand, have been starving!” Empyrean God Tyranodragon charged
over as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Seven Dragon
Gods ran over, with Ning and Roughpeak following behind them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why are there so
many Empyrean Gods here?” Ning was secretly shocked. He saw nearly
a hundred Empyrean Gods present!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seven Dragon
Gods? You’ve all finally arrived!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The seven of you
insisted on waiting at Volcano Island for so long, saying that you
were going to rely on yourselves to make it here. What, have you
finally succeeded?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahahaha, brother
Witherdragon! Come, eat!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lively Empyrean
Gods joyfully welcomed the seven. The Seven Dragon Gods had been on
Volcano Island for a very long period of time, nearly an entire chaos
cycle. Thus, all of the Empyrean Gods present knew the seven of them!
More than half recognized Empyrean God Roughpeak as well. As for Ji
Ning…none here knew him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me make the
introductions,” Witherdragon said in a loud voice. “This is my
good friend, Darknorth! I’m quite ashamed to say this, but we
relied on brother Darknorth to make it here from Volcano Island. As
soon as he entered Undermoon Lake, he charged straight through all
impediments to make it to this location, battling through all three
guardians.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, brother
Darknorth! Let me toast you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You were able to
battle your way to Myriad Mountains Island in one try? Admirable!”
Instantly, the many Empyrean Gods all turned to look towards Ning.
They all had a different look in their eyes, and each of them
voluntarily offered Ning a toast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning began to drink and
chat with these Empyrean Gods. Slowly, he began to understand what
was going on here. Aside from the nine of them who had just entered,
there had been a total of ninety-eight Empyrean God present. However,
the vast majority of them had followed other Empyrean Gods to this
location. They had all given up their hopes of making it through
Undermoon Lake on their own, which was why they had chosen to follow
others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only nine of the
ninety-eight had truly relied on their own power to make it to this
place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These nine were
‘Skyriver’, ‘Oddwitch’, ‘Cloudscar’, ‘Feiyou’,
‘Eastvoid’, ‘Seasonstep’, ‘Coppersong’, ‘Zhenbu’, and
‘Autumnwing’. These nine Empyrean Gods had all mastered the likes
of taiji-force, infiniforce, thunderforce, sharpforce, and other
forces to the fourth level. They were powerful enough to make it past
the Purgatory God, which was why quite a few Empyrean Gods were
willing to follow them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is my old
friend Feiyou.” Witherdragon led Ning over to meet with Feiyou.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth,
you truly are formidable. You actually made it here on your very
first try. This is incredibly rare! Even I had to spend tens of
thousands of years on Volcano Island before I made a breakthrough
that allowed me to reach this place,” Feiyou said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth,”
Witherdragon said with a laugh, “This old friend of mine, Feiyou,
can’t live without meat or wine. Thus, he always carries an
estate-world treasure with him that he fills up with many wild beasts
to feast upon. Wine can be distilled from the natural energy of
Heaven and Earth, but meat can only come from rearing livestock.
Thus, the Empyrean Gods around my old friend Feiyou will always have
quite the comfortable life. Just look at them. All of them are
drinking wine and eating meat. I can’t even describe how content
they look! By contrast, I don’t even remember when was the last
time the seven of us tasted meat on Volcano Island.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed as well.
This Feiyou truly was a remarkable figure. The Empyrean Gods had all
come to Undermoon Lake to adventure, and all of them were filled with
heroic aspirations. Thus, even if they were to bring some wine and
meat, they would only bring a little bit, as it would all eventually
spoil and rot away. There was no way to keep meat from spoiling over
the course of ten million years. Thus, after spending enough time in
Undermoon Lake, the only way to find meat to eat was to do what
Feiyou did; prepare an entire minor world full of livestock and wild
beasts to eat. Only then would there be a steady source of meat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth,
don’t laugh at me, I beg,” Feiyou said with a laugh. “My
willpower is weak, and I delight in wine and meat. I can endure being
unable to make any progress in my cultivation, but I simply can’t
be without wine and meat. Nothing to eat, nothing to drink…what’s
the point of Immortality if that’s the case?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even in the Three
Realms, I’ve heard of your famous name, big brother Feiyou. In
fact…you have a nickname these days: ‘Relentless Until Dead’,”
Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Relentless Until
Dead?” Feiyou stared, then began to roar with laughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, Relentless
Until Dead.” The nearby Witherdragon nodded. “This kid did indeed
say that he would only stop drinking wine and eating meat when he
died. This is why he was nicknamed ‘Relentless Until Dead’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After drinking and
eating for quite some time, the Empyrean Gods ended up splitting off
into two groups. One group was formed from the ten who had made it
here on their own power, Ji Ning included, and the second group was
formed of all the rest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at the nine
before him. Of the nine, seven belonged to the Nuwa Alliance, while
the other two most likely were of the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone who entered
during the Primordial Era belonged to the Nuwa Alliance. It wasn’t
until later on during the era of the Three Realms, when the Lord of
All Fiends came back after Mother Nuwa departed, that the Seamless
Gate’s Immortals and Fiends began to enter this place as well.
Thus, there were naturally far fewer Seamless Gate members in
Undermoon Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They all seem to be
extremely good friends with each other.” Ning mused to himself, “If
they knew of the storm going on outside…there would probably be no
way for them to remain as friendly as they are now. They treat each
other as brothers, holding nothing back at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because of how friendly
the Nuwa Alliance members and Seamless Gate members on the third
island were to each other, Ning, Roughpeak, and the Seven Dragon Gods
decided to temporarily withhold information regarding the war
outside. None of the others knew of the war, and here in Undermoon
Lake, there was no need for them to be made aware of it right away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth.”
The winged Empyrean God Autumnwing said, “The nine of us sought you
out because we need to tell you something.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning was
puzzled. He immediately began to listen carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The path to the next
island is incredibly dangerous, and it is filled with terrors. Myriad
Mountains Island, however, is much safer, and there’s no ‘millenial
invasions’ like on the first two islands.” Autumnwing looked at
Ning. “But Undermoon Lake won’t let us just live here forever in
peace and relaxation. Undermoon Lake isn’t meant to serve as a
place for rearing useless people, after all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Normally, Myriad
Mountains Island is completely safe; it’s rare for a single
dangerous event to happen in even a hundred million years.
But…whenever a new Empyrean God enters the island…” Autumnwing
looked at Ning. “Then a terrifying calamity will descend upon
Undermoon Lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A calamity?” Ning
was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Empyrean God
Oddwitch narrowed his eyes. He said in a gravelly voice, “Right. A
calamity! Whenever a new Empyrean God arrives, the calamity will soon
come as well. A short period of time from now, an army of demons will
descend upon Undermoon Lake. When that happens, the only choice will
be for the ten of us to meet them in battle. As for the other
Empyrean Gods, they aren’t qualified to take part because we
brought them here. If they take part in battle, they will enrage
Undermoon Lake…and they will all die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, then asked
curiously, “An army of demons?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prior this this, you
encountered a yaksha and Snowfiend; they are all considered ‘demons’.
What we will encounter, however, is an entire army composed of such
demons.” Oddwitch continued, “An army will attack, and only the
ten of us are permitted to defend. It will be a truly
life-threatening battle, and in the past, there have generally been
deaths amongst our ranks. In fact, on one occasion four Empyrean Gods
ended up dying! There’s only been a single time where none of us
died.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thus…if things
unfold as they normally do, one or two of the ten of us will die.”
Feiyou looked towards Ning. “We’re telling you this now so that
you will mentally prepare yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In truth, the
invading army is Undermoon Lake’s way of forcing us to remain
vigilant and not be too lazy and relaxed here on Myriad Mountains
Island. We must often go visit the wooden bridge and temper
ourselves.” Empyrean God Cloudscar sighed. “Only by constantly
tempering ourselves and constantly growing stronger will we have a
chance to survive once new Empyrean Gods arrive and bring calamity
with them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cloudscar looked at
Ning. “Brother Darknorth, because all ten of us have to work
together to fight against our many foes, teamwork is absolutely
critical. Before we can work together, we need to understand how
strong you are and what you are skilled in. Only then can we come up
with a good strategy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The most powerful of
us nine is big brother Feiyou. We’ll let him spar with you first.
You don’t need to hold back at all. Only by understanding what
areas you are strong in and what areas you are weak in will we be
able to work together,” Cloudscar said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…I’m not
really the strongest. Cloudscar is the most agile, while Zhenbu is
the most ferocious. I simply have the most stable frontal attacks.”
Feiyou let out a laugh. “Brother Darknorth, are you ready? Once you
are ready, I’m going to attack.”

Chapter 18 - Wuji Births Taiji
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the vast
wilderness, the white-robed Ji Ning stood facing the fur-clad
Empyrean God Feiyou. Off in the distance, more than a hundred
Empyrean Gods were watching them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although Myriad
Mountains Island doesn’t suffer from the ‘millenial invasion’,
it suffers from an even more terrifying calamity whenever a new
Empyrean God arrives. The Empyrean Gods who can make it to this place
are all tremendously powerful…and yet, almost every single time,
some will die when the calamity arrives.” Empyrean God Roughpeak
shook his head and sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only a deadly threat
like this can stir us into becoming more powerful. The stronger you
become, the greater your chances will be of making it to the next
island,” Empyrean God Witherdragon said solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the third
island. The fourth island was next. As for the fifth island, there
were no dangers there; upon reaching it, one would be permitted to
leave. Thus, all of the Empyrean Gods who had made it to the third
island were extremely powerful. As for the ones on the fourth island,
they were just one step away from leaving this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tribulations on the
third island weren’t meant for the Empyrean Gods who had given up
to face; they were meant for the stronger Empyrean Gods who had made
it here under their own power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful, brother
Darknorth.” A pair of short black halberds appeared in Feiyou’s
hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Short halberds?”
Ning was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to the
reports he had read, during the Primordial Era, Empyrean God Feiyou
didn’t use short halberds as his weapons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here in Undermoon
Lake, when watching the Purgatory God, I ended up discovering weapons
that suited me even better than my old ones.” Feiyou looked at
Ning. “Although the Purgatory God and I both use twin halberds…I’m
much more formidable than him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After you.” A pair
of blood-red swords appeared in Ning’s hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hundred-plus
spectating Empyrean Gods all held their breaths. Through this fight,
they would be able to find out exactly how powerful this
newly-arrived Empyrean God Darknorth was! If he was truly powerful,
they would all stand a better chance of surviving once the calamity
came.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course, the calamity
posed no danger to the Empyrean Gods who had given up, but it was
deadly to the other Empyrean Gods who had brought them here. They had
watched many of their benefactors die over the years, and they hoped
that less would die this time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. Feiyou
transformed into a streak of light, flying towards Ning. Ning also
transformed into a streak of light, going forward to engage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twin swords
collided against the twin halberds in midair. Upon exchanging blows,
Ning was shocked: “Eh? Empyrean God Feiyou’s short halberd
technique is identical to the Purgatory God’s?” Thanks to his
earlier experience battling against the Purgatory God, it was fairly
easy for Ning to deal with Feiyou’s attacks. In turn, Ning put his
sword-arts on full display. This spar was mainly meant so that the
other nine Empyrean Gods would have a good understanding of Ning’s
abilities, allowing them to cooperate better once the calamity came.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A queer, unpredictable
sword-light lashed out, flashing towards Feiyou’s neck.
Fortunately, the short halberd managed to block in time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yet another bizarre
streak of sword-light, this one black. It scraped upwards towards
Feiyou’s body, but Feiyou managed to once more block it with a
clever twist of his halberd.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Darknorth
fellow…what a strange, fast sword-art he has.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His sword-art is
both fast and unpredictable. The Dao of the Sword really is
well-suited to launching attacks.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, quite
formidable. This sword-art alone is enough to allow him to overcome
the Purgatory God.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cloudscar, Eastvoid,
Seasonstep, and the others all sighed in amazement. Although they had
all made it past the Purgatory God as well, none of them walked upon
the Dao of the Sword! From Ning’s sword-arts, they were able to get
a sense of how deadly and dangerous an expert of the Dao of the Sword
could be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Roughpeak and
the Seven Dragon Gods, their eyes shone as they watched. Although
Ning had brought them to this place, they had never truly seen Ning
fight with full power as he was right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two clashed
together then separated, landing on the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Feiyou said excitedly,
“Brother Darknorth, although I was at a disadvantage, that was just
the warmup. We were just getting a bit familiar with each other.
Now…I’m going to fight for real.” After speaking, Feiyou’s
aura changed in a subtle manner. Transforming into a streak of light,
he once more charged towards Ning, and as soon as they exchanged
attacks, Ning could sense that Feiyou’s short halberd techniques
had changed…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was no longer the
technique the Purgatory God had used. It was an even more exquisite
technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning was
skilled in attacking, for a time Ning was unable to seize the upper
hand again. Clearly, the amount of time Feiyou had spent on this
island had resulted in him perfecting his short halberd technique to
a level that was far superior to Ning’s sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formidable,
formidable.” After battling for a short while, Ning laughed. “Big
brother Feiyou, I’m wondering how strong your protective divine
abilities are?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After speaking, Ning no
longer moved to dodge. He allowed his opponent’s halberds to land
on him as he sent his own swords howling towards Feiyou. Feiyou was
so terrified that even the look on his face changed. He hurriedly
pulled back his halberds to block Ning’s attacks instead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
Feiyou was repeatedly knocked backwards. He called out in a loud
voice, “Is this the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ninth Cycle of
the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art],” Ning chortled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s CHEATING!”
Feiyou was furious. If Ning was a bit weaker than him, then he
would’ve still been able to suppress Ning, even though Ning had the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art] guarding his body. But since the two were
equal in power…for Ning to be able to focus solely on offense meant
that he had an enormous advantage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is your master?”
Feiyou roared. “He actually let you train in the [Eight-Nine Arcane
Art], and you even reached the Ninth Cycle!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My master? Daofather
Subhuti.” Ning chortled happily. “Jealous? Envious?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather Subhuti?
You have such bullshit luck!” The more Feiyou fought, the angrier
he became as he was being beaten into an increasingly sorry state.
“Enough, enough! I already know that you have a powerful protective
divine ability. Stop abusing it, alright?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing that the point
had been made, Ning stopped ‘cheating’. He began to fight
normally, no longer relying on the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] to protect
him and instead using his swords to block the enemy’s attacking
halberds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sort of fight was
much more interesting, anyways.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t know that
brother Darknorth had actually reached the Ninth Cycle of the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art]. This is going to be wonderful.” Oddwitch
chortled merrily, “When the demon army comes, brother Coppersong,
we won’t need you soak up all the damage all by yourself like a
target dummy, like we normally would. This time, brother Darknorth
can work together with you to take them on.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the face of an army
of demons, they would indeed need Fiendgods with incredibly tough
bodies to withstand the front-line blows for them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The muscular
Coppersong, his entire body shimmering with an ancient copper aura,
said in a low voice, “The [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] which brother
Darknorth has trained in is the number one divine ability below the
True God level. Although I’ve had some fortuitous encounters, my
divine body isn’t a match for brother Darknorth’s. This time,
brother Darknorth will have to serve as the vanguard for taking on
the enemy’s attacks.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My word! Coppersong,
you big dumb lunk…you’ve learned how to take advantage of
others?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually
understands the principle of letting someone else charge in front of
him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The others all laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Coppersong stared at
them. “I had to do that because none of you have tough enough
divine bodies. In the past, I served as the vanguard because I had no
other choice, and was just barely up to the task. However, Ji Ning’s
divine body is even tougher than mine. That’s the Ninth Cycle of
the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] we are talking about! His body is akin to
a supreme Pure Yang Treasure. Even a True God or Daofather would find
it difficult to destroy such a body.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In both the
Primordial Era and the era of the Three Realms, very few have been
able to reach the Ninth Cycle of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]. Every
single person who succeeded was not only tremendously talented but
also doted upon heavily by a True God or Daofather. There’s no need
for someone like that to enter Undermoon Lake, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s true.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There really is no
need for someone who a Daofather holds in such favor to enter
Undermoon Lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were quite
puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking, the
people who entered Undermoon Lake during the Primordial Era and the
era of the Three Realms were people who felt that they had no chance
of becoming a True God or Daofather. This was why they were willing
to risk everything here in Undermoon Lake. In addition, not even
emerging from Undermoon Lake was a guarantee that one would succeed.
Buddha Jueming, for example; a long time passed after his departure
from Undermoon Lake before he became a Buddha.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, Undermoon Lake
really didn’t make much of a difference! Everyone who came in was
just gambling with their lives. As for the truly supreme geniuses
like Lu Dongbin, Redsnow, and Sun Wukong, none of them would actually
enter such a place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, although
the likes of Feiyou, Oddwitch, and the others had been fairly
ordinary in strength when they had entered, thanks to Undermoon Lake,
they had been trained to the point where they all verily gleamed with
talent and power. The nine of them had all reached the fourth level
of forces such as taiji-force. In the Three Realms, they would be
viewed with great importance by the True Gods and Daofathers. From
this, one could see how effective Undermoon Lake’s training regime
was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a colossal
explosion could be heard. The shockwave caused the earth to crack
like the shell of a turtle, and the nearest mountain began to tremble
as well, causing many boulders to fall down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of this
collision caused all the distant spectators to be badly shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How fierce!”
Feiyou retreated a long distance, staring towards Ning in shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You blocked it?!”
Ning was shocked as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What happened just
now? Y-you…how did you suddenly make your sword-arts increase in
power by that much?” Feiyou was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just now, I filled
my sword with fourth-stage heartforce,” Ning explained. “With
heartforce supporting my attack, the strength naturally increased
dramatically.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Buyou was stunned.
“Fourth-stage heartforce? You’ve not only reached the fourth
stage of swordforce, but also the fourth stage of heartforce?
And…but…even if you have reached the fourth stage of heartforce,
how could you pour it into your sword? Did you come up with a
heartforce sword-technique?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartforce was an
invisible, ephemeral thing. Even major powers were often bedeviled by
the question of how to apply it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And you?” Ning was
puzzled as well. “Just now, your halberd techniques…” He
clearly had released a maximum-strength blow; he had unleashed
swordforce, heartforce, and even the [Starseizing Hand]. Although he
had knocked Feiyou backwards, Feiyou had still successfully blocked
the attack. Ning had seen the blurry image of a taiji diagram appear
before Feiyou, and it felt as though his attack had been trapped into
an endless vortex.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s a new
technique that I just came up with,” Feiyou said with a laugh. “My
infiniforce has reached the fourth stage, while my taiji-force has
only reached the second stage. However…the infinite Wuji gives
birth to the supreme Taiji. Infiniforce and taiji-force can be joined
together, and so I came up with this technique that does just that,
which is why it is so defensively powerful.”<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="#Top_of_Section0003_xhtml">1</A></U></FONT>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but sigh in awe. Impressive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He naturally knew that
some of the supreme types of force could be merged together. For
example, timeforce and spaceforce could join together. Redsnow had
managed to join them together into spacetime-force, which was why
Subhuti was so delighted with him and had taken him on as his
disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, only certain
matching, suitable forces could be joined together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, there
would be no way to join swordforce together with saberforce. They
simply didn’t have anything to do with each other; there was no way
to forcibly join them together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wuji gave birth to
Taiji, and so the two could join together perfectly. Even though
Feiyou had only reached the second stage of taiji-force, upon joining
these two types of force together the results were quite shocking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s why I said
that I was the stablest and most unshakable of the nine. I can
withstand even the attacks of Empyrean God Zhenbu, who has the most
ferocious attacks of us all.” Feiyou looked at Ning, then let out
an amazed sigh. “But in terms of ferociousness, you are a bit
superior to even Zhenbu. Impressive, quite impressive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said hurriedly,
“Heartforce is different from other types of energy. There’s no
way to sustainably attack using heartforce; if I attacked repeatedly
with it, I would only be able to launch a bit over ten attacks.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh…” Feiyou now
understood. He shook his head. “A pity…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still, your power
surpasses my expectations. We need to make some careful
arrangements…and then, the only thing for us to do is wait. Roughly
ten days or so from now, the demon army of Undermoon Lake will
attack.” Feiyou let out a laugh. “When the time comes, then ten
of us shall work together to engage our foes!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> 1. This phrase, ‘Wuji
births Taiji’, is one of the most famous phrases in Daoism, and you
can find out more in the ‘basic primer to Daoism’ on Wuxiaworld.
Wuji means ‘infinity’ or ‘limitless’, while Taiji means ‘the
supreme’. The full saying is, Wuji gives birth to Taiji, which
gives birth to (the duality of) Liangyi. The duality is known as Yin
and Yang, and the transformations of Yin and Yang are known as the
(four phenomenon) Sixiang, which are reflected within the world as
the (eight trigrams) Bagua. You can think of it as 0 =&gt; 1 =&gt; 2

Chapter 19 - An Army of Demons
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sparring match Ji
Ning engaged in after arriving at Myriad Mountains Island resulted in
Oddwitch, Zhenbu, and the others being filled with joy. Although all
of them looked quite relaxed and carefree, the truth was that they
all knew a calamity was about to arrive…and it was almost
guaranteed that at least one of them would die. They all felt an
invisible form of pressure in their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At a time like this,
the stronger Ning proved himself to be, the happier they would be!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on, one day
at a time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ten Empyrean Gods
all prepared quietly for the battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the nine
Empyrean Gods were currently discussing battle strategies within a
palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? We aren’t
allowed to use formations?” Ning was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course not.”
Oddwitch said calmly, “If you use formations, the demon army will
use formations as well. They vastly outnumber us, which means we’ll
be at a major disadvantage! This is hard-earned experience, taught to
us by those who came before us. If we don’t use formations, the
demon armies won’t use formations either.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How strange.” Ning
was puzzled. Why was it that if they didn’t use formations, the
demons wouldn’t use formations either?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why is this?” Ning
didn’t understand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Put yourself in the
position of the creator of Undermoon Lake and you will understand.”
Zhenbu laughed. “The creator of Undermoon Lake wished to temper us,
making us become more powerful. If we rely on formations, such as the
Seven Planets God, then in truth only a single Empyrean God will
actually be fighting, with the other six just responsible for pumping
enough divine power. This is against the goals of the creator of
Undermoon Lake, and so he naturally would not be willing to allow us
to rely on formations. He wants us to rely on our own power to battle
against our foes, using these struggles to temper ourselves.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly
understood. Laughing, he said, “Come to think of it, I really
wonder why the creator of Undermoon Lake spent all this effort in
building this place up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re quite
curious as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, why did he do
this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine that only
Jueming, who managed to escape, knows the answer. Darknorth, you’ve
just recently entered from the outside world; has Jueming ever spoken
of what the creator of Undermoon Lake wants?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine Empyrean Gods
were all puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head.
“Buddha Jueming has completely sealed his lips regarding the
affairs of Undermoon Lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He became a Buddha?”
Seasonstep called out in surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seven Dragon
Gods mentioned it earlier. Didn’t you hear them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was daydreaming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You? An exalted
Empyrean God? Daydreaming?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The calamity’s
drawing near, you know…I can’t help but think about the demon
army attacking. What, I’m not allowed to daydream?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No formations would be
allowed. They would have to risk their lives individually. The main
thing they had to be careful about was staying close to each other,
so that once one of them fell into a dangerous situation the others
could immediately help out. Only by supporting each other would they
be able to fight against the demon army invasion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
twenty-one days had passed after Ning’s arrival at Myriad Mountains
Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since the tenth
day, the ten Empyrean Gods had begun to live together, prepared to do
battle at all times. On this day, a cold wind blew through the skies,
which remained as blurry as always. The bright moon could still be
seen hanging up in the heavens. And finally…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AWOOOOOOO!!!!” A
distant, earth-shaking howl could be heard coming from the west side
of Myriad Mountains Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ten figures
simultaneously flew out of the palace like streaks of light, arriving
at the peak of the nearest mountain. The ten of them were like the
gods of this place as they turned their gazes in unison towards the
distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They’ve come,”
Feiyou said in a low voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They’ve finally
come.” Zhenbu licked his lips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember,
Darknorth.” Oddwitch looked at the nearby Ning. “Don’t charge
too far up ahead. Although you have the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] and
can charge into their ranks…once you are all by yourself and
surrounded by their army, with no one to help you out and the demon
king assaulting you…you’ll die shortly afterwards.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The demon army had many
demons that were comparable to ordinary Empyrean Gods in power. They
also had demon commanders who were equivalent to the ten of them in
power…and a demon king who was even mightier than all of them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more Empyrean Gods
took part in battle, the more demons and demon commanders would take
part as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because ten Empyrean
Gods would take part in this battle, ten demon commanders would take
part as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have to be
beware the demon commanders. Each of the ten are comparable to us in
power. Those countless damnable minor demons are particularly
irritating. Although they are weak in sole combat, they can tie you
down and have a major impact on how much power you can unleash. We
have to stay close to each other and support each other. No matter
what, we can’t let the demons split us apart.” Coppersong
couldn’t help but remind Ning yet again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He understood. Everyone
had told him this repeatedly, as the nine of them had all experienced
this calamity before. It was precisely because they had experienced
this before that all of them were so worried that Ning would mess up!
During a critical, life-and-death moment like this…a single error
would result in certain doom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thud! Thud! Thud!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ground was
trembling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ten Empyrean Gods
stared off into the distance. They saw a terrifying, awe-inspiring
horde of demons appear off in the distance. These demons had
completely dark-green skins, and they wielded sabers, spears,
warforks, and other types of weapons. Some of the demons were the
particularly muscular commanders who were each many meters tall. The
demon commanders had skin that was a dark-red color.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those big ones are
the demon commanders.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look; that one over
there with the long horns? That’s the demon king.” Feiyou and the
others provided guidance to Ning. In truth, Ning had more or less
come to the same conclusion on his own, as the two horns were nearly
three meters long, and the creature had the most powerful aura of
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AROOOO!!!” The the
demon king was carrying a golden gourd around his waist and wielded a
black longstaff in his hands. Raising his head, he let out a fierce
roar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“ARROOO ARROOO!!!!”
The horde of demons roared as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ten Empyrean Gods
all watched with solemn expressions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Far off in the
distance, the Seven Dragon Gods, Roughpeak, and the rest of the
Empyrean Gods watched nervously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The calamity has
come yet again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope all of them
will survive this one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their hands were tied.
If they were to take part in the battle, the only result would be
that even more demons would appear. Thus, their only choice was to
stay on the sidelines and watch. The only reason they were even able
to come to Myriad Mountains Island was because they had followed more
powerful Empyrean Gods here…but in almost every single calamity, at
least one of them would die! To them, these dead Empyrean Gods were
their benefactors!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In a similar manner,
the Seven Dragon Gods and Roughpeak didn’t wish for Ning to die.
None of them wanted for any of the ten to die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope brother
Darknorth and the others will all live,” Witherdragon said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon their leader
Feiyou issuing the order, the ten Empyrean Gods who stood at the peak
of the mountain all transformed into streaks of light. They flew tens
of thousands of kilometers towards another, rather strange-looking
mountain. The reason why this place was known as ‘Myriad Mountains
Island’ was because there truly was a myriad of different mountain
peaks that stabbed high up into the skies!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The mountain that Ning
and the rest of the ten had chosen was one which was a perfect fit
for them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They weren’t able to
set up formations, but at least they would be able to select the
terrain of their choosing! A well-chosen region could help to ensure
that the demon armies wouldn’t be able to join together and
completely surround them, which would make the battle even more
difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My brothers!”
Feiyou roared loudly, “Let’s survive to drink together again!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Survive to drink
together again!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Survive to drink
together again!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other nine, Ning
included, all howled furiously as they stared at the distant,
impending demon army. Their hearts were all filled with a desire to
slaughter! They had no choice; they had to kill. If they didn’t,
they would die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The demon army drew
closer…ever closer!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A million kilometers.
Six hundred thousand kilometers. Three hundred thousand kilometers!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the weakest demon
was comparable to an ordinary Empyrean God. They moved with
astonishing speed, quickly charging forward towards the ten.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AROOOO!!! Slaughter
them all, my children!” The demon king bellowed in a loud voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, all the
demons grew even more excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Feiyou let
out an explosive shout of his own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“KILL!” The nine
Empyrean Gods had all drawn their weapons long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOOM!!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was like a tidalwave
smashing into dry rocks. The ten Empyrean Gods, their backs to the
mountain walls, were instantly flooded by wild attacks from the
countless demons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly began to
use the [Brightmoon] sword-art with his twin swords, deflecting the
oncoming spears, warforks, machetes, and other weapons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light flew
forward in a strange, unpredictable manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A demon’s head went
flying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang! The sword-light
scraped down the side of a machete, chopping a pudgy demon in half.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every so often, Ning
would also execute the ‘Soleheart’ stance and the ‘Yin-Yang’
stance, his two defensive stances. When suffering attacks from so
many demons, maintaining a strong defense was clearly quite
important. Otherwise, once the demons managed to close in on him, he
wouldn’t even have enough room to use his sword-arts. He would be
finished if that happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to what
big brother Feiyou and the others said, we have to wipe out these
ordinary demons as fast as possible. The faster, the better! Although
they are weak, it’ll be these little demons who end up sending us
into hell at critical moments.” Ning didn’t dare to be
overconfident. Although he had the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] protecting
him…if he was to be completely surrounded and bound, then the demon
king would be able to easily suppress him and draw him into that
golden gourd.
</P>

Chapter 20 - Half-Step Daofather
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The demon king wielded
a long black staff in his hands. Surrounding him were the ten
dark-red demon commanders! They simply watched from afar, allowing
the many demons under their commands to surround and assault the ten
Empyrean Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the others
knew that each time, the leaders of the demon army would allow the
ordinary demons to attack first for a time. Only later would the
demon commanders and demon king attack. Thus, the initial period of
time when only the ordinary demon soldiers were attacking was
extremely critical; they had to seize that period of time to wipe out
as many of the ordinary demons as they could.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was a wild, berserk
battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Every so often,
Ning would ram forwards, relying on his tough divine body to smash
into the demons and knock them asunder. At other times, he would use
a sword-art that would transform his swords into a black hole,
guiding the demons off to one side. In short, he used every method he
could think of to ensure that the demons would not be able to
completely surround and restrain him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Intriguing.” The
demon king pointed towards the distant Ning with a slender,
knife-like claw. “Look at that new Empyrean God. His sword-arts are
quite powerful, and he’s killing the fastest.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This divine body is
quite tough. Our children’s weapons and attacks are negligible to
him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His sword-arts are
quite odd.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The demon king and the
dark-red demon commanders chatted amongst themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to what
Purgatory said, this new Empyrean God is named Darknorth.” The
demon king chuckled. “Number three, go and play with him a bit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
Instantly, a muscular demon commander who was wielding a shield in
each of his two hands charged forward towards Ning. The ordinary
demons all parted before this demon commander, clearing a path for
him. Soon, he closed in on Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, be
careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknoth, be
careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s the
twinshield commander!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other nine Empyrean
Gods hurriedly sent mental messages over to Ning. Ning felt a sense
of shock in his heart as well. Because Feiyou and the other Empyrean
Gods had experienced multiple battles against the demon king and his
commanders, they had naturally memorized the appearances of quite a
few of them. Each of the commanders had their own unique traits, and
this one, the ‘twinshield commander’, possessed enormous strength
and was extremely skilled in defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of the demon king’s
commanders, the twinshield commander is probably the best counter to
me.” This thought flashed through Ning’s mind as the dark-red
twinshield commander came charging towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” Twin shields
in hand, the demon commander rammed towards Ning. These two shields
protected almost every single inch of his body. No matter how
formidable Ning’s sword-arts were, there was no way for him to
touch this foe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heavenbreaker
stance!” Ning charged forward as well, his twin swords becoming as
heavy as mountains. He sent them smashing downwards with an aura of
power like Pangu cleaving apart Heaven and Earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two swords smote
down upon the shields, but the demon commander was still able to
maintain his charge towards Ning with shields raised. Clearly, Ning
didn’t have any advantages in terms of strength. The many ordinary
demons around him also joined in the fight, wildly assaulting Ning
and causing his movements to turn chaotic. Now, he truly understood
why the demons he had so easily killed were said to be truly deadly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While Ning was forced
to concentrate on the demon commander, the ordinary demons continued
to launch stabbing strikes against him, making his life miserable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three heads, six
arms!” Ning’s body momentarily blurred as he executed the [Three
Heads, Six Arms] divine ability. Instantly, six streaks of
sword-light began to fly about, sweeping the area around him clear of
lesser demons while completely stalemating the twin bucklers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Number four, you go
as well,” the distant demon king instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dark-red demon
commander referred to as ‘number four’ also had six arms. Each of
his six arms held a whip, and he let out a howl as he charged towards
Ning. His arrival instantly put Ning into an even more dangerous
situation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ning was just
fighting against this ‘number four’ by himself, he would be able
to easily defend against him. In fact, he would even hold the
advantage. But right now, the twin shields were the primary threat,
while the six whips of ‘number four’ coiled about his swords,
making it difficult for Ning to execute his sword-arts. At the same
time, the lesser demons continuously charged forward, trying to trap
and constrict Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“ARUUUUUUU!” The
two demon commanders and many lesser demon furiously assaulted Ning
like a wave that was about to drown him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The person nearest to
Ning was the most muscular of the ten Empyrean Gods, Empyrean God
Zhenbu. Letting out a mighty roar, he slaughtered a path through his
opponents and charged straight towards the twinshield demon
commander. The twinshield commander had been in the middle of
launching an attack against Ning, and so was only able to use a
single shield to defend against the valiant Zhenbu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“F*ck off!”
Zhenbu’s longspear pierced out, and a mighty whirlpool appeared at
the tip of it. It latched onto the bottom of the shield, tugging it
straight into the heart of the whirlpool. Zhenbu then gave the spear
a mighty tug.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This attack contained a
strange force that was both upwards and downwards. Even the
twinshield commander was unable to withstand it, and he was sent
flying into the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perfect.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light flashed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Starseizing Hand]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swordforce
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartforce!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Brightmoon] sword-art,
Blood Drop stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was Ning’s
fastest sword of all. As the twinshield commander flew into the air,
an opening was revealed in his defenses. Ning saw it and immediately
stabbed his sword into the demon commander’s chest. “Arghh!”
The twinshield commander glared furiously at Ning, then vanished into
thin air. Even his shield vanished with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well struck!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One down.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other nine Empyrean
Gods instantly celebrated. They had never imagined that Ning, forced
into such dire straits, would actually be able to slay the twinshield
commander.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, as soon as he
been forced into that dire situation, Ning had immediately prepared
to unleash his full power. However, in a situation like that, he
would at most be able to force the enemy back a bit. Fortunately,
Zhenbu had also charged over, forcing the twinshield commander to
reveal a flaw in his defenses and giving Ning the chance to launch a
full-strength attack to kill him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Beautiful.” Zhenbu
looked towards Ning, laughing loudly, “Even if I didn’t
intervene, a puny demon like that wouldn’t have been able to do
anything to you, brother Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, felt a
complicated feeling in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, ever since he
had arrived at Myriad Mountains Island, Ning had felt lumps in his
throat whenever he looked at these nine Empyrean Gods, especially
Zhenbu and Autumnwing, who belonged to the Seamless Gate. This was
because he knew very well that their two alliances had already
entered a deadly war in the outside world! But here in Undermoon
Lake, none of the Empyrean Gods knew of the war. These nine Empyrean
Gods in particular had undergone many calamities together; they had
long ago begun to view each other as brothers for life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It doesn’t matter.
They might be of the Seamless Gate, but they are both my brothers,”
Ning mused to himself as he stared at the heroic Zhenbu, who had been
so concerned about him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the twinshield
commander was slain, the six-armed demon commander hurriedly
retreated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant demon king
frowned upon seeing this happen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm?” The demon
king ordered with a frown, “Attack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eight demon
commanders instantly grew excited. The demon king gently stroked the
golden gourd by his waist, then hoisted his black longstaff with a
cold smile and strode towards Ning. “The rest of you can deal with
the other nine. Leave this Empyrean God Darknorth to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empyrean God
Darknorth is doomed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Doomed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The demon commanders
all charged towards their respective targets. Aside from Ning, whom
they weren’t familiar with, they knew the Empyrean Gods quite well.
They were able to choose whichever target suited them the most, but
the Empyrean Gods didn’t have that luxury; they were being
surrounded and attacked by too many demons! They were also far slower
than the demon commanders in movement speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful. They are
all coming.” Feiyou let out a loud roar. This was the critical
moment; when the demon commanders all attacked in unison, the
Empyrean Gods would easily be at risk of death or injury!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The demon commanders
battled furiously against their respective Empyrean God opponents,
with crowds of lesser demons assisting them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, however…he
was under the attack of the most terrifying demon of them all. The
demon king.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You actually killed
number three.” The demon king wielded the long black staff in his
hands, filled with an overpowering aura that caused even Ning to feel
pressure. The demon king strode forward with wide steps, causing the
earth to shake. “I want to see exactly how strong you are. All of
you, step aside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The surrounding
demons all gave way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The demon king suddenly
leapt into the air, soaring straight towards Ning with both hands
around his staff, delivering a mighty, smashing blow towards Ning’s
head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang. The
three-headed, six-armed Ning sent all six of his swords into an
upwards block.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOOOOOM!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A deep hole appeared in
the ground, with Ning having been smashed straight underground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the demon king,
he held the long black staff in a single-handed grip as he charged
towards that hole with an aura of astonishing power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! A streak of
sword-light flew out from the ground, with Ning ensconced within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What an incredible
aura.” Ning’s heart was shaking. This demon king was far too
powerful, much stronger than Ning himself. Ning had used all six
swords in order to block a single strike from the enemy, and one of
the swords had been reinforced by heartforce. But it was useless! He
had still been smashed underground. Clearly, the difference in power
between them was enormous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The demon king leapt
high into the sky, soaring through the air as he chased after the
fleeing Ning. In terms of power or speed, the demon king was
definitely superior to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was knocked
everywhere; high, low, left, right…but thanks to the [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art] protecting him, the demon king remained unable to harm
Ning. What Ning had to do was to use every tool available to him to
ensure that his foe wouldn’t be able to trap or bind him. Ning’s
sword-arts were still quite formidable, and thanks to his six arms
the lesser demons were unable to even move close to him. This made it
so that the demon king didn’t have a chance to use the golden gourd
to absorb Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Being dominated and
trampled like this pisses me off. This demon king is way too strong.”
Suddenly, Ning’s face changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shit!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Faced with attacks from
nine demon commanders and many lesser demons, Feiyou, Zhenbu, and the
rest of the nine were trapped in a quagmire. Even Ning, when facing
off against two demon commanders and many lesser demons, had been in
a dangerous situation. Although the demon king seemed powerful, he
was simply very fast and very strong; as long as one was able to
withstand his attacks, one would only be knocked flying; there was no
risk of dying to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the last
calamity, it had been Feiyou who had withstood the demon king’s
attacks. In terms of defensive techniques, he was actually far
superior to Ning, and so he was able to withstand even the demon
king.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During this
calamity…the demon king had sought out Ning. Clearly, he didn’t
want to deal with the troublesome Empyrean God Feiyou, whose defenses
were airtight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As time passed, the
positions of the other nine Empyrean Gods grew increasingly dire.
Being at a constant disadvantage would, sooner or later, lead to
catastrophe. Based on their past experiences, only after one of the
Empyrean Gods died would these demons relax a bit with their attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ten Empyrean Gods
each had their own abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Cloudscar
had amazing agility techniques that vastly surpassed the techniques
of Ning and the rest of the other nine. Surrounded by an army of
demons, he was still like an unpredictable cloud that manifested and
dissipated at will. He moved about constantly, continuously launching
attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Feiyou’s
forte was defense. Not even the demon king was able to do anything to
him, and he was naturally in quite a stable position right now as
well. However, his attacks were weak. When surrounded and trapped, it
was difficult for him to assist the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After battling for a
long period of time…Empyrean Gods Eastvoid and Zhenbu fell into
danger! Although the other Empyrean Gods had helped them out two or
three times, there was no way they could be there every time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shit!” Zhenbu let
out a furious roar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These damned
demons.” Eastvoid was growing frantic as well. Both of them
specialized in attacking, and so they were in similar, incredibly
dire straits right now. Many scars had already appeared on both of
their bodies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eastvoid and Zhenbu
are almost done for,” Feiyou said through a frantic mental roar as
he did his best to charge towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Feiyou? Don’t even
think about going over there.” A demon commander who wielded
clanking chains let out a bizarre laugh as he sent his chains lashing
outwards, forcibly preventing Feiyou from moving past him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth!”
Oddwitch sent out a frantic mental shout as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The demon king sent out
yet another smashing staff blow, knocking Ning aside. Ning grew
frantic as well. “There’s no way for me to move close to them.”
He was barely able to keep himself safe from the demon king as it
was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! A blade scraped
past Eastvoid’s waist. A gaping wound instantly appeared, and fresh
blood came spurting out from it. Moments later, a wave of divine
power flowed over the wound and quickly healed it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My divine power is
almost depleted,” Eastvoid sent mentally. Each time his body was
injured, a large amount of divine power would be used up to heal it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eastvoid.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Eastvoid.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other Empyrean Gods
were all frantic. Once his divine power was used up…no one would be
able to help him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the quiet Still
Room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Down below, there was a
golden light formation of three hundred meters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Up above, there was a
black light formation of three hundred meters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was seated in the
meditative position between the two. Spheres of Ninefire Lava and
Iceheart Pith were floating in front of him, and a large amount of
the essence of the two was flowing into the two diagrams. The two
spheres had already shrank significantly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll have to halt
for now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning willed it, and
both great formations slowly vanished into thin air. As for the two
spheres of Ninefire Lava and Iceheart Pith, they flew back into their
respective jade bottles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he landed
on the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although my Pure
Yang Jindan still needs upgrading…I have no choice but to halt for
now. After the battle, I’ll continue the upgrade process.” Ning
took a look inside his body. The gleaming, spinning golden pellet
Jindan within his body had an aura that was already tens of times
more powerful than it had been previously. The Jindan region inside
his body had also dramatically expanded, and a torrent of powerful
and pristine Pure Yang energy was flowing through it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Icefire Jindan
Smelting technique was a process that was extremely slow and
extremely gentle. As the Pure Yang Jindan absorbed more and more of
the icefire essence, it would constantly improve and evolve. But of
course, it could be halted at any time as this was a very gentle,
slow type of transformation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The difference between
a Daofather’s Jindan and a True Immortal’s Jindan was like the
difference between Heaven and Earth!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Daofather’s Jindan
was on the same level as one of Pangaea’s first-tier True
Immortal’s Jindan. If Ning was able to upgrade to a second-tier
Jindan, he would be half a step into the Daofather level of power.
After having worked on it for more than twenty days, he was actually
quite close to completing the upgrade process; it could already be
considered a second-tier Jindan. But of course, only after a few more
days of refining would it truly reach its maximum potential.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s take a look
and see how powerful this second-tier Jindan is.” Ning willed it,
and he instantly vanished from the Immortal estate, appearing within
Myriad Mountains Island in the world outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Myriad Mountains
Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battle between the
Empyrean Gods and the demons had reached a fevered state. Ning had
just been knocked flying away…and suddenly, a second Ning appeared
out of nowhere. The sudden appearance of a second Ning caused all of
the Empyrean Gods present, as well as the many Empyrean Gods watching
from far away, to gawk in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two Empyrean God
Darknorths?!”

Chapter 21 - That Sword!
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the two Ji Nings
appeared in midair, the only one who wasn’t surprised was the demon
king. He had learned from Snowfiend long ago that Ning had two
clones, and this was actually the reason why he had given Ning the
‘special treatment’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your clone has
finally appeared.” The demon king laughed loudly. “I’ve been
waiting quite a while.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! He charged
straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the Nings flew
straight towards him with [Three Heads, Six Arms] activated. Six
streaks of sword-light lashed out as this Ning engaged the demon king
in close combat. As for the other Ning, the Ning who had just
appeared…a total of 729 top-grade Pure Yang swords appeared around
him, slowly undulating up and down. His Pure Yang energy, far more
pure and powerful than the energy of the True Immortals of the Three
Realms, flowed outwards through his body, filling each and every one
of those Immortal swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s energy was
simply too pure. The solidified energy sword that was created by the
[Greater Thousand Swords Formation] was thus improved dramatically as
well. All of the energy from the many swords levitating around Ning
flowed towards his chest, merging into a single jade sword that
appeared before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The demon
king, who had just knocked aside the other Ning, suddenly felt a
feeling of shock in his heart. He turned to take a look and saw the
jade sword. He immediately sensed an invisible aura of menace coming
from that sword, causing him to feel stunned. “That flying sword
actually makes me feel as though I’m in danger. How can this be?
How can he be so powerful?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That flying sword…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The power of that
sword-formation…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lesser demons, the
demon generals, Feiyou and the rest of the Empyrean Gods…everyone
last one of them was stunned. There was no way to suppress or retract
the aura of a sword-formation, and the jade sword was the
crystallized essence of sword-ki itself; waves of power emanated
outwards from it! This caused all of the demons and Empyrean Gods to
feel a nameless fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning…had already
reached a qualitatively higher level of existence than they had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!” Ning pointed.
Whoosh! The jade sword left behind a solitary, arcing scar in the
skies. It transformed into a crescent streak, and the jade sword,
covered by black sword-light, turned to strike at the demon king. All
of the demons and Empyrean Gods present could sense the solitary,
desolate beauty of the crescent streak…and could also sense the
terror that it brought.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had both
fourth-stage swordforce and fourth-stage heartforce, and both gave
him power comparable to the most supreme of Empyrean Gods. Ning’s
[Starseizing Hand] also gave him power that was close to that of a
supreme Empyrean God by itself. And prior to his Jindan evolving,
when Ning used 729 top-grade Pure Yang swords in the ninth-level of
the [Greater Thousand Swords Formation] formation, he similarly was
capable of unleashing power that could only be matched by the most
supreme of Empyrean Gods and True Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fourth-stage
swordforce, fourth-stage heartforce, the [Starseizing Hand], and the
ninth level of the [Greater Thousand Swords Formation]; all of them
were on the same level. Although the [Starseizing Hand] and the
[Greater Thousand Swords Formation] were slightly weaker by
comparison, they were still on the same general level as the other
two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now…!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that Ning’s
Jindan had begun to evolve, his Pure Yang energy had become tens of
times purer than before. Without any question, the jade sword formed
through the crystallization of this pure energy via the [Greater
Thousand Swords Formation] was now tens of times more powerful than
before as well! It had already surpassed the apex of power possible
Empyrean Gods; it had stepped into the Daofather level! In fact, in
power and presence alone, it was a bit more powerful than Redsnow’s
‘Seven Planets God’ or even Sword Immortal Evergreen’s
Daofather golem! It was comparable to Ning using the perfect Heaven
Punisher!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fast!” The demon
king’s face changed dramatically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The jade sword shot
towards him at incredible speed. After Ning’s energy had been
upgraded and purified, his jade sword’s speed had been greatly
enhanced as well. The demon king hurriedly brandished his longstaff,
seeking to block…but the jade sword covered by black sword-light
was quite bizarre. It slashed out in a strange, ghostly manner,
arcing past the longstaff and scraping through the demon king’s
body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The demon king,
longstaff in hand, just stood there blankly. And then, his body began
to fall apart. He had already been bisected by that sword attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I lost.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The demon king’s
bisected body quickly reformed, but he still stared blankly at Ning.
In fact, the entire battlefield turned completely silent. Those
frantically attacking lesser demons and demon commanders had come to
a halt as well. They all raised their heads, staring at their demon
king in disbelief. They also stared at the white-robed youth who was
surrounded by a countless cluster of levitating swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine Empyrean Gods
raised their heads to stare at Ning as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth…” They
all felt stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seven Dragon Gods
and the many other Empyrean Gods off in the distance were all
completely dazed as well. They were only able to watch, not fight…and
they all stared at the white-robed youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We lost. I lost.”
The demon king looked at the two Ji Nings. One of them vanished,
leaving behind the other one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The attack of the demon
army could indeed be described as a calamity or as a tribulation. To
survive it, there were two options. The first was to endure for long
enough and wait for the demon king to order the retreat. The second
was to slay the demon king; in this case as well, the demon army
would disperse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, during all of
the previous tribulations, they had relied on the first method to
succeed. They had supported each other and had managed to endure the
deadly calamity with difficulty. Normally, one or two Empyrean Gods
would die. This was because so long as a single one died, the demon
army would slowly begin to lower the pace and power of its assaults.
The creator of Undermoon Lake’s goal was to temper Empyrean Gods,
after all, not to wipe all of them out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, they had
relied on the first method…but this time, Ning had slain the demon
king!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empyrean God
Darknorth. Ji Ning.” The demon king looked at Ning. “After
entering Undermoon Lake, you made it all the way here in one try…and,
from what I can tell, even the countless demons under my command who
guard the ‘Demon Icepass’ won’t be able to hold you off for
long. You should already have the power to make it to the fourth
island. After you make it there, the only one you have to worry about
is the final guardian. Your talent and your power is far superior to
Jueming’s; there is a very high chance that you will be able to
survive and depart from Undermoon Lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Work hard, young
man.” The demon king looked at Ning, a deep, long smile on his
face. “When you reach the fifth island…you’ll find a surprise
in store for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Children, let’s
go!” The demon king turned and left. The demon commanders and
lesser demons all whistled through the air after him, but as they
left quite a few gave Ning curious glances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The demon army had come
like a tidalwave. Now, they receded like the waves as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eastvoid and Zhenbu let
out sighs of relief, but they were still frightened as they thought
back to what had nearly happened. The other Empyrean Gods all landed
on the ground as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.”
Eastvoid walked over, a smile on his face. “Thank you. You saved my
life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And mine as well.”
Zhenbu also grinned, then patted Ning on the shoulders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Admirable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, I am in
complete awe of you now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine Empyrean Gods
had previously viewed Ning as someone on their level, but now they
were filled with the utmost of admiration towards Ning. It must be
understood that Redsnow’s ‘Seven Planets God’ or Ning’s ‘Rahu
God’ and ‘Heaven Punisher’ all primarily relied on the power of
a formation, on the combined energy of many other Immortals and
Fiendgods. Only then were they capable of getting close to the
Daofather level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since Pangu
established Heaven and Earth, there were extremely, extremely few
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals who were able to reach that level of
power on their own. They could be counted on one hand! Every single
one was truly a favored son of the heavens. But of course, the only
Empyrean God who had ever actually slain a True God or Daofather had
been Houyi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, aside from the
unequalled Houyi, Ning now stood at the absolute pinnacle amongst the
countless Empyrean Gods of the Three Realms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the private room
inside the Immortal estate. A white-robed Ning appeared out of
nowhere, immediately levitating into midair to continue training in
the [Icefire Jindan Smelting] technique. Slowly, the giant formation
of golden light appeared below him, as did the formation of black
light above him. The red-jade gourd and the green-jade gourd once
more released Ninefire Lava and Iceheart Pith, and Ning once more
began to slowly refine his Jindan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His Pure Yang Jindan
had yet to be upgraded to the limit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After this battle,
Myriad Mountains Island once more became calm and tranquil. Both of
Ning’s bodies focused on upgrading their Pure Yang Jindans to the
second tier. By the time both of them had reached their maximum
potential, more than a month and a half had passed since the demon
army’s attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I plan to head to
the fourth island,” Ning said. “Prior to this, the demon king
spoke of the ‘countless demons guarding Demon Icepass’. What’s
this all about?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing his words,
the other nine Empyrean Gods all laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So you are finally
heading out?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given your power, Ji
Ning, it is indeed true that you have a chance of traversing Demon
Icepass.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve been waiting
for you to say these words for a long time now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them laughed as
they spoke. Feiyou hefted his gourd of wine, then said, “On the
other side of Myriad Mountains Island is yet another floating wooden
bridge. This floating wooden bridge passes through an endless chasm
of ice, which has countless demons hidden within it. The number of
demons in that place are far more than the number you saw in the
demon army that attacked. What you need to do is continuously fight
your way through them, to do your best to wipe them all out. You have
to fight for a hundred years. After doing so, the demon king will
decide whether or not you are qualified to enter the fourth island,
based on how many demons you have slain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fight for a hundred
years?” Ning was surprised. The last three times, he merely had to
defeat the respective guardians. But this challenge, the fourth
challenge, actually required him to battle for a hundred years?”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 22 - I Don’t Regret It
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Empyrean
God Oddwitch said in his hoarse voice, “Because you need to
constantly battle, there’s no way you can just use up all your
divine power as you please; you need to conserve it and use it
sparingly. Darknorth, when you challenge the pass, you’ll have to
rely on your swordforce when you fight. Swordforce comes from the
very essence of the sword itself, and so it is endless and
inexhaustible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning nodded. If he
truly did have to fight for a century, then most of his Ki Refining
techniques would be useless. This was because the amount of energy
consumed by the ninth-level [Greater Thousand Swords Formation] was
quite high. Although his second-tier Jindan gave him far more Pure
Yang energy than he had before, far more than any ‘ordinary’ True
Immortal had, it still wasn’t possible for him to inexhaustibly
release jade swords. He would only be able to unleash them for half a
day at most, much less a century.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To battle for extended
periods of time, he would have to rely on swordforce! As for divine
abilities…Ning wouldn’t even dare to use [Three Heads, Six Arms],
much less the [Starseizing Hand]; that would use up divine power at
far too fast a rate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only way Ning would
be able to fight for a century would be if he was able to ensure that
the amount of divine power he used up was no more than the amount he
was able to naturally replenish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So challenging Demon
Icepass means overcoming an endless swarm of lesser demons?” Ning
asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Almost all of them
will be lesser demons,” Empyrean God Autumnwing said. “A demon
commander will only spawn on occasion, and the demon king will appear
once towards the end. However, when the commanders or the king
appears, they will appear by themselves! The lesser demons, however,
will come in an endless horde; there simply is no way you can
possibly massacre them all. No matter how many you kill, more will be
reformed and manifested.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Actually, aside from
battling for a century, there’s one more method,” Eastvoid said
with a laugh. “The demon king once told us that if you can fight
your way all the the way to the end of Demon Icepass and step onto
the other island, that would of course be considered success as
well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yeah, but how?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, that’s
simply impossible. With so many demons attacking you, you wouldn’t
be able to make it there in even a thousand years, to say nothing of
a hundred.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all chimed in with
their opinions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning agreed with their
opinions as well. Each of the islands was separated from the others
by an enormous amount of distance. Even the Ruyi Soulsnake Shuttle
would have to fly for a long period of time when unimpeded. When
battling countless demons, one would only be able to advance at a
very slow pace. A thousand years? Not even ten thousand years would
necessarily be enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning,” Feiyou
said with a laugh, “Battling for a hundred years is actually quite
beneficial to us. I’ve undergone more than a thousand of those
hundred-year battles, but each time I didn’t kill enough to
proceed…but those wild battles caused me to continuously improve
and perfect my short halberd techniques. In fact, I was even able to
develop my technique, ‘Wuji Births Taiji’ and merge those two
types of force together. I trust when my taiji-force reaches the
third stage, I’ll be able to make it past.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Feiyou’s infiniforce
had reached the fourth stage, whereas his taiji-force was only at the
second stage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. It is of
tremendous benefit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first
hundred-year battle is particularly helpful. The later ones become
less and less helpful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ll know when
you give it a try.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After chatting with the
nine for a period of time, Ning learned quite a few things about
challenging Demon Icepass. After making it past the gorge, only one
step would remain before he could leave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth.”
Empyrean God Eastvoid suddenly spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning looked
towards him. He could sense that Eastvoid seemed to be hesitating.
“What is it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eastvoid hesitated for
a while, then finally said, “I very nearly died during this demon
invasion. I now see the truth of things. My talent and my abilities
were fairly ordinary for Empyrean Gods of the Primordial Era. Even
though my time in Undermoon Lake has increased my power dramatically,
I’m still at risk of dying during every single demon invasion. As
for Demon Icepass, I have no hope of making it past it. My current
level of power is a limit for me. Just now, the demon king himself
said, and I myself believe, that you are the first person after
Jueming to have an extremely high chance of making it out of this
place. I want you to help me out…and take me out with you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are going to
give up?” Ning was surprised. Everyone who made it to Myriad
Mountains Island had been allowed to choose a treasure. But anyone
who gave up would have to give up the treasure as well! And since
they were indeed quite close to being able to leave, there weren’t
many who were willing to give up at this point.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve seen through
to the truth of things, past the allure of treasures. If Undermoon
Lake wishes to retake those treasures, let it. I really want to
leave. I want to see my master, my fellow disciples, my own
apprentices.” A reminiscent look appeared within Eastvoid’s eyes.
In the past, when he lived surrounded by all his loved ones, he
didn’t realize what a pricelessly wonderful life he had. But now,
after spending countless years here in Undermoon Lake, he deeply
missed his master and the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth…help me
out.” Eastvoid looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you’ve made up
your mind, Eastvoid, then I’ll naturally agree to your request. It
won’t cost me anything at all,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll leave as
well,” Empyrean God Cloudscar said. “I can understand how
Eastvoid is feeling. Like him, I’ve been trapped here for far too
long. It’s been a long, long time since I’ve improved in power at
all. Although my agility techniques are good, my attacks are indeed
fairly weak; I’m far from reaching the level of power necessary to
go through Demon Icepass, much less the final guardian. Darknorth,
you have a good chance of escaping this place. I’m willing to
follow you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My dear, old
brothers…all of you want to leave this place?” Feiyou was rather
saddened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother Feiyou.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We…simply see no
hope for us at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the nine Empyrean
Gods present, there were actually five who were willing to follow
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were Eastvoid,
Cloudscar, Oddwitch, Skyriver, and Zhenbu. They no longer saw any
hope for success for themselves. Given that even the demon king had
said that Ning had an extremely high chance of leaving this place,
and with the jade sword attack Ning had revealed filling them with
trust in him…they truly wished to follow Ning and escape this
place, reuniting once more with the loved ones that they hadn’t
seen in so long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, the nine
all felt a bit saddened as well. As they began to make their
farewells, Ning suddenly fell silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine didn’t
notice at first, but eventually they began to realize that something
was off with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, what’s
wrong?” Feiyou asked, “Although I am saddened by my five brothers
leaving, I can understand their feelings. Why is it that you have
suddenly…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Zhenbu.” Ning
suddenly spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Zhenbu looked
towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I cannot take you
with me,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Zhenbu was stunned, as
were the other eight Empyrean Gods present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What about the other
four?” Zhenbu looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can take them. I
can’t take you.” Ning gritted his teeth, forcing the words out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But why?” Zhenbu
wasn’t angry, only puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, what the
hell are you saying?” Coppersong had the worst temper of the nine,
and he immediately grew angry. “When you found yourself in a
dangerous situation during the demon army invasion, big brother
Zhenbu risked his own life to go save you. Although you were powerful
enough that it didn’t make a difference, for you to help him out
costs you nothing at all!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough!” Feiyou
snapped at Coppersong, then looked at Ning in a solemn manner.
“Darknorth, I can sense that you have secret troubles of your own.
What is it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning took a deep
breath. “Alright, I’ll tell. I’m going to talk, and none of you
are going to interrupt me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The nine
Empyrean Gods all nodded. They could all sense that Ning was about to
tell them something important.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll need to start
my story from the war that destroyed the Primordial Era.” Ning
began to speak, starting his tale from the Lord of All Thing’s plot
to have the two chaosworlds ram into each other. He continued his
tale all the way to the present, where the Seamless Gate and the Nuwa
Alliance had once more become locked into a life-and-death battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the nine Empyrean
Gods listened, their eyes bulged out so far that they very nearly
popped out. On multiple occasions, they wanted to ask Ning questions,
but in the end they didn’t interrupt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…And now, you
understand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a sigh.
“Zhenbu battled by my side, and he was even willing to save me at
the risk of his own life. I truly view him as a beloved brother of
mine. But…although the Empyrean Gods of the two alliances are
brothers here in Undermoon Lake, in the outside world the Nuwa
Alliance and the Seamless Gate are embroiled into a war of
annihilation. All of the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals, and in
fact even all of the Celestial Immortals, will be forced to make a
choice; they will be forced to choose an alliance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a war of
annihilation, a war for survival.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although there are
many secrets involved, the workings of fate have already revealed to
us that only one side can survive; either the Seamless Gate, or the
Nuwa Alliance.” Ning continued, “Even the True Gods and
Daofathers must pick a side. As for the Four Ancestors of the River
Source, who have yet to choose…they are only able to stay on the
sidelines for now. When the final Endwar comes, they’ll have to
make a choice as well. The two alliances absolutely won’t allow any
powers to remain on the sidelines and potentially wipe out the
exhausted victor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you are
Empyrean Gods. If we were to return to the Three Realms…do you
think you’ll be able to escape this war?” Ning swept the nine
with his gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Zhenbu…if you were
to return to the Three Realms, which side would you choose?” Ning
looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Zhenbu opened and
closed his mouth several times. Finally, he said in a low voice, “My
master, my brothers, my friends…all of them are with the Seamless
Gate. Of course I would choose the Seamless Gate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why…why does it
have to be like this…why has this storm descended…” The nearby
Autumnwing found this hard to believe. “Everything was perfectly
peaceful…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“None of us have ever
been able to control the destiny of the Three Realms. When the war
that ended the Primordial Era occurred, it wasn’t a long period of
time had passed that we realized the Lord of All Things, an alien
Outsider, had been the one to instigate it. There are definitely
secrets behind this castastrophe as well…but they aren’t for the
likes of us to understand.” Oddwitch let out a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Feiyou suddenly said in
a low voice, “Darknorth, I’ll leave with you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother Feiyou?”
Ning was shocked. “All you need to do is make a breakthrough in
taiji-force and you’ll be able to make it past Demon Icepass. In
fact, you even stand a good chance of leaving Undermoon Lake on your
own.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now that a storm has
swept the Three Realms, no one can simply act selfishly for
themselves. Yes, if we hide in Undermoon Lake, we’ll be able to
avoid this storm,” Feiyou said, a look of agony on his face, “But
many of my fellow disciples already died during the war that ended
the Primordial Era. I avoided one storm already. This time…I can’t
keep hiding. I’m going to face this storm alongside my brothers and
my fellow disciples.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go back as
well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And I.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The storm has
descended. Every little bit of extra power counts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the nine Empyrean
Gods, seven belonged to the Nuwa Alliance. Feiyou, Jibu, and
Coppersong had been planning on staying, but now they decided to
return as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">News of the storm
quickly spread throughout Myriad Mountains Island…and the Empyrean
Gods who viewed each other like brothers had to make their choice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three days later, every
single Empyrean God of the Nuwa Alliance elected to follow Ning. As
for the twelve who belonged to the Seamless Gate, all of them
remained on Myriad Mountains Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t wish to
one day be forced to kill them in the outside world.” Ning stood
before the floating wooden bridge. He murmured softly, “I’d
rather have them stay here at Undermoon Lake and wait for this storm
to pass. No matter which side wins, they wouldn’t go so far as to
act ruthlessly against such a small number of survivors.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning felt
quite miserable in his heart, he had already made his decision. He
had no regrets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He stepped onto the
floating wooden bridge.
</P>

Chapter 23 - A Hundred Years
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Demon Icepass was
unfathomably long…and with each step Ji Ning took, an unbelievable
number of demons fell before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At every moment in
time, Ning was striking out with his swords using his full power. He
would only succeed if he killed enough demons within the allotted
timespan. Empyrean God Feiyou had managed to battle for a hundred
years, but he wasn’t able to kill enough of the demons. Now that
the Three Realms had been embroiled in war, it was hard to say when
the Endwar would begin. Thus, Ning had to move quickly! Experiencing
a hundred-year battle once was enough; he didn’t want to fail and
have to try a second time or a third time!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, Ning
didn’t dare to slacken off for even an instant. Every single one of
these countless demons had the power of an Empyrean God. Fortunately,
they didn’t use any formations, and so at any given moment Ning
only had to deal with the dozens of demons closest to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time slowly flowed on.
In the blink of an eye, nearly a hundred years of frenzied battling
had gone past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a gorge that had
been completely frozen solid by ice, a white-robed youth was battling
frenetically with a pair of twin swords in his hands. His sword-light
flickered around as fast and unpredictably as lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light flashed,
and a demon was cleft in twain from the waist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light stabbed
forward, and a demon’s head instantly exploded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light curved
outwards, causing three nearby demons to collapse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His sword-arts are
becoming increasingly fast. Of all the Empyrean Gods I’ve witnessed
since the creation of Undermoon Lake, his sword is the fastest.”
The demon king stood atop one of the two icy canyon walls above the
gorge. He stared downwards at the thronging, ant-like horde of demons
that were surrounding and attacking Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sort of battle had
already gone on for a century.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. When he first
entered the icepass, his sword wasn’t this quick.” The Purgatory
God, body wreathed in flames, spoke out. “He’s advancing almost
nonstop, and his sword-arts are becoming increasingly powerful. If I
were to fight him again, I would probably be effortlessly defeated.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His sword truly is
fast. How did it become so fast? From what I can tell, it must have
reached the speed of light, right?” The hideous sea yaksha spoke
out as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, very nearly.
Even if it isn’t at lightspeed, it’s not too far from it.”
Snowfiend agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The guardians of
Undermoon Lake spent most of their time together, albeit the
Purgatory God, Snowfiend, and the sea yaksha merely kept clones of
themselves here at Demon Icepass. They were all quite curious about
Ning, and so they naturally wanted to watch him battle through Demon
Icepass.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His sword’s speed
is very close to the limit set by the Heavenly Daos.” The demon
king nodded. “My guess is that he must have learned a particularly
powerful sword-art. Otherwise, there’s no way he would be able to
advance in such a fashion without embarking on any wrong paths of
cultivation at all. Normal Empyrean Gods, no matter how powerful they
are and no matter what weapons they wield, are quite far from the
limits of the Heavenly Daos.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.”
Snowfiend, the Purgatory God, and the sea yaksha all nodded in
agreement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Golden Sunstreak]
and the [Ninehorn Lightning Serpent] had both reached the limits of
the Heavenly Daos, allowing Ning to move 300,000 kilometers in an
instant! Normally, even major powers were much slower than this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, experts were
naturally capable of wielding weapons much more quickly than they
moved. Generally speaking, their goal was to do their best to close
in on the limits of the Heavenly Daos!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword speed,
however, had already come very close to those limits!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course…it was
also possible to go faster than the limits of the Heavenly Daos!
Those who mastered the [Five Treasures], for example, would be able
to strike with their swords at a speed that was faster than the speed
of light. The missing deity Houyi, as well; his arrows were the
fastest in the Three Realms, capable of killing that Golden Crow
‘Emperor of Monsters’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s about time.”
The demon king nodded, then shouted loudly, “Withdraw!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His shout echoed within
the frozen gorge. All of the demons heard it, and with a series of
whooshing sounds, they all withdrew in unison like the tides. They
all parted in two directions, entering the frozen mountain walls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning was a
bit surprised. They withdrew?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had been battling
for a hundred years. This was the first time the demons had
withdrawn, and he wasn’t quite ready for it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A figure flew
down from the skies. It was the demon king, that golden gourd still
on his waist. The demon king landed on the floating wooden bridge. He
shook his head, the two enormous curved horns shaking as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Demon king.” Ning
looked at the demon king.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The century has
concluded.” The demon king rested his long black staff over his
shoulders and said lazily, “You’ve really killed quite a few
demons.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Am I permitted to
pass through Demon Icepass? Can I go to the next island?” Ning
asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The demon king looked
at Ning. Chortling, he said, “Although I really would like to play
with you a bit longer…you really have killed quite a few demons.
Your sword is too fast.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning blinked, then
laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His sword was fast?
This entire time, he was worried that the number of demons he killed
wasn’t enough, and so as he fought he repeatedly told himself,
‘faster, faster, faster!’ The faster his sword was, the more he
would be able to kill! And given that Ning was training in the [Five
Treasures] sword-art, a sword-art that surpassed the limits of the
Heavenly Daos, he had made numerous breakthroughs during the past
century of slaughter. He had gained repeated insights, and thus he
had gained a deep understanding of the extremely esoteric fourth
chapter of the [Five Treasures]. As Ning learned more, his sword
became faster and faster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You may pass through
Demon Icepass and reach the fourth island; Kilostar Island,” the
demon king said. “But before you do so, I’ll lead you to a place
to choose a treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Upon
reaching the third, fourth, and fifth islands, there would be a
chance to choose a treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And those Empyrean
Gods you are carrying with you; since they are going to give up, have
them hand their treasures over to me,” the demon king said calmly.
“Empyrean Gods who give up are not qualified to obtain any
treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded. He knew this all along, and Feiyou, Oddwitch, and the others
had long ago handed their treasures over to Ning, letting him hand it
over on their behalf.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A day later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kilostar Island was
also divided into two islands, a small island and a larger island.
The small island was the place where the treasures were placed, while
the larger island was the place where the Empyrean Gods lived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go ahead. Your
talent and your sword-art are both quite impressive; the only thing
standing between you and freedom is the final challenge.” The demon
king smiled as he looked at Ning. “It’s been countless years, but
Jueming was the only one to leave. I hope you will become the
second.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, then
turned and walked onto the floating wooden bridge towards the larger
island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just now, Ning had
chosen three treasures and, thanks to his strenuous negotiating,
acquired eight of each! However, these three treasures were not of
much use to Ning, at least for now. For example, if Ning hadn’t
acquired the [Icefire Jindan Smelting] technique, he wouldn’t have
known how to use Iceheart Pith and Ninefire Lava. Right now, he
didn’t know any techniques that could make use of these three
treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kilostar Island.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning walked towards the
larger island, unable to hide the excitement he felt. This was
already the fourth island; he was very close to reaching the exit!
Once he reached the fifth island, he would be able to leave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister…wait for me.” Ning felt a deep desire to be
reunited with her swell up in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately calmed
himself down, then proceeded into the island. He chose a random
boulder at the borders of the island, then sat down in the lotus
position. He began to go through his memories and insights from the
hundred years of battle. During that century, he had been constantly
fighting; although he had gained some insights into the [Five
Treasures], he hadn’t had a chance to systematically examine these
insights in depth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that prior to entering Demon Icepass, Ning had only trained for a
total of roughly two hundred years! Prior to the war for the Grand
Xia, Ning had actually been focused on establishing a foundation for
himself. The Black-White College, Mount Innerheart’s Tristar
Crescent Abode…those places had all served to help him lay down a
formation by teaching him many techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nihilum Zone, the
war for the Grand Xia, the Realmwar, roaming the Three Realms and
challenging swordsmen…it was only during this period of time that
he was truly improving on his foundation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During this century,
Ning had advanced at an incredible pace. Soon after entering
Undermoon Lake, his swordforce had reached the fourth stage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time, however, he
had spent a full century battling in Demon Icepass, and every single
moment of that century was spent in nonstop combat. For someone like
Ji Ning who was skilled in martial combat to begin with, this was a
form of tempering that he had never before encountered. In truth,
even the likes of Feiyou and the other Empyrean Gods who had lived
for countless years all felt that Demon Icepass was tremendously
beneficial to them, to say nothing of Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning closed his eyes.
The [Five Treasures] sword-art constantly flickered through his mind
as many different scattered insights began to join together, allowing
him to understand it better and better. The [Brightmoon] sword-art
was continuously improving as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kilostar Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A gray-robed man was
walking alone through the island. He murmured to himself, “When
shall I be able to leave this prison? Even if I give up and return
those treasures, they still won’t let me leave. I have to follow
some other Empyrean God, but if that person dies, I’ll die as well.
Only if that Empyrean God succeeds will I be able to leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But after all these
years, Jueming remains the only one who has succeeded. And before
Jueming made the attempt, who felt completely confident that he would
succeed?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dawn. The moon is
rising.” A powerful desire to leave could be seen in the gray-robed
man’s eyes. Suddenly, he blinked and turned to stare off into the
distance. Far away, atop a boulder covered with gouges and marks, was
a white-robed youth seated in the lotus position.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 24 - Kilostar Island
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gray-robed figure
instantly felt puzzled. “Who is he? I know all the Empyrean Gods on
Kilostar Island. Hell, I know most of the Empyrean Gods of the entire
Three Realms. But this white-robed youth…” Although quite
puzzled, he knew that here in Undermoon Lake, there were only two
possible reasons for Empyrean Gods to be here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first was they had
fought a path through the challenges. The second was that they had
followed someone who did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s new. Does
this mean…he just made it through Demon Icepass?” The gray-robed
man felt shock in his heart. He watched as Ji Ning sat there
meditatively, not daring to disturb him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He waited for a total
of twelve days.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, Ning opened
his eyes. All of the scattered insights he had gained over the course
of a century had been unified, and his understanding of the sword had
risen once more. In fact, Ning was able to vaguely sense a bit of
what complete mastery of the [Five Treasures] should look like.
However, he always felt as though he was a bit off, as though he was
searching for flowers within a great fog. He was unable to truly
understand and fully master the entire [Five Treasures].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m still a bit
off.” Ning sighed to himself. “If I could advance a bit more and
fully understand the [Five Treasures], thus gaining full mastery over
a sword-art that surpasses the limits of the Heavenly Daos…I’d
probably be able to leave Undermoon Lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The complete [Five
Treasures] was something which even True Gods and Daofathers would
find desirable. But alas, the price of learning this consummate
sword-art was simply too high; learning it meant forgetting all
insights into all other Daos. Very, very few major powers were
willing to pay such a price…and few of the ones who might be
willing had true talent for the Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s talent for the
sword, however, was indeed quite high. Lu Dongbin and Daofather
Subhuti had judged him correctly when they had named him a born Sword
Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chunyi greets you,
fellow Daoist.” The gray-robed man appeared next to him with a
smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empyrean God
Chunyi?” Ning laughed. “I am Darknorth. I’ve heard of your
illustrious reputation long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Chunyi’s
real name was Li Chunyi. He, too, was an Empyrean God who had risen
to prominence during the era of the Three Realms. However, he
eventually vanished, with no one knowing where he had gone. Ning had
memorized all of the ‘missing’ Empyrean Gods like him, and in his
visit to Undermoon Lake he had already seen five of the Empyrean Gods
who had gone ‘missing’ from the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not every Empyrean God
would announce their entry into Undermoon Lake, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empyrean God
Darknorth,” Li Chunyi said, “I’ve never seen you on Kilostar
Island before. Can it be that you just made it past Demon Icepass?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Admirable,
admirable!” Li Chunyi’s eyes shone, and he immediately seemed
much friendlier. “You need to battle for a hundred years to make it
past Demon Icepass, an extremely dangerous affair, especially when
that demon king assaults you alongside countless lesser demons. The
slightest bit of carelessness can lead to instant death. Even if one
is strong enough to survive for a hundred years, it’s still hard to
gain the demon king’s approval. Kilostar Island…over the course
of countless years, only a total of nine Empyrean Gods have been able
to make it here on their own power, and that’s including you,
Empyrean God Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just nine in total?”
Ning asked, “How many of them are currently on the island?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Previously, there
were three. With your arrival, fellow Daoist Darknoth, there are now
four,” Li Chunyi said. “It’s been countless years, but only
Reverend Jueming was able to leave this island. Four of them have
died as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon saying the word
‘died’, Li Chunyi hesitated a moment, then said, “Fellow Daoist
Darknorth, there’s something I should tell you. Of the four
Empyrean Gods who died, three of them died when attempting to advance
through the wooden bridge, as they were too weak to succeed. One,
however…died here on the island itself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Died on Kilostar
Island?” Ning was puzzled. “Prior to this, I chatted with the
demon king for a bit. I heard that the forces of Undermoon Lake won’t
launch any attacks on Kilostar Island. How could someone have died?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…Empyrean God
Greatdream was the killer,” Li Chunyi said in a low voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empyrean God
Greatdream?” Ning’s eyes narrowed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God
Greatdream. Of course Ning had heard of this person. One of the
Empyrean Gods who had gone ‘missing’ but actually entered
Undermoon Lake was Greatdream. The reason why Greatdream had given
himself the sobriquet of ‘Greatdream’ was because he was the
personal disciple of the Seamless Gate’s Godking! The Godking was
extremely harsh and cruel when training disciples, and Greatdream was
filled with tremendous ambitions. Upon hearing that Jueming had
become a Buddha, he had made up his mind to enter Undermoon Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right now, the ones
on the island who made it here under their own power are Empyrean God
Greatdream, Empyrean God Sealthroat, and Empyrean God Sin,” Li
Chunyi said solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empyrean God
Greatdream belongs to the Seamless Gate, while Empyrean Gods
Sealthroat and Sin belong to our Pangu Chaosworld. Logically
speaking, since the Seamless Gate has joined the Three Realms long
ago, they should be peaceful to us. And indeed, after Empyrean God
Greatdream entered Undermoon Lake, he’s worked to befriend all of
the Empyrean Gods here. He constantly worked hard to improve himself,
spending ten million years to make it to Kilostar Island.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Li Chunyi said
solemnly, “Back then, there were four who made it to Kilostar
Island on their own; Empyrean God Greatdream, Empyrean God
Sealthroat, Empyrean God Sin, and Empyrean God Ninedawn. The others
here had all given up and been carried here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empyrean God
Greatdream continued to befriend everyone, and he became particularly
friendly with Empyrean God Ninedawn. But who would’ve thought that
Empyrean God Greatdream was actually such an insidious person…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He caught Empyrean
God Ninedawn completely offguard with a sudden attack and killed
him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Li Chunyi shook his
head and sighed. “Back then, Empyrean God Ninedawn was actually the
strongest of the four, and he had the best chance of making it out.
But just like that, he died by the hands of a despicable, petty man
like Empyrean God Greatdream. The sneak-attack caused a huge
disturbance and we all immediately hastened towards the two, but we
were too late…just one step too late. Both Empyrean God Sin and
Empyrean God Sealthroat were utterly enraged and they sought to slay
Empyrean God Greatdream, but he continually hides within his Immortal
palace. In addition, a large number of Empyrean Gods are following
and protecting him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually attacked
his own friend?” Ning found this unbelievable. “But why? Did
Empyrean God Ninedawn do something to him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was beginning to
feel fury in his heart as well…because Empyrean God Ninedawn was
actually one of the primordial humans!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The primordial humans
numbered a tribe known as the ‘Dawnsun clan’ amongst their ranks.
The nine most powerful Empyrean Gods of this clan were named based on
age as Onedawn, Twodawn, Threedawn…all the way through Ninedawn.
These were humans who had followed Suiren in his earliest campaigns,
and Ning had always felt tremendous admiration for these primordial
human Empyrean Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Who would’ve thought
that one would die to Empyrean God Greatdream of the Seamless
Gate…and due to a sneak attack at that!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Others are still
willing to follow Empyrean God Greatdream despite what he did?”
Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His followers are
all members of the Seamless Gate,” Li Chunyi said. “He publicly
proclaimed that during the war that destroyed the Primordial Era,
many of his beloved friends and brothers had been slain by Ninedawn,
and so his heart has always been filled with endless amounts of
hatred and rage. Although some of the the other members of the
Seamless Gate didn’t approve of his actions, they belong to the
same side, after all. When Empyrean Gods Sealthroat and Sin led their
armies to attack Empyrean God Greatdream, the Empyrean Gods of the
Seamless Gate still chose to stand on Greatdream’s side. They
couldn’t just stand there and watch him be killed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come. Let me guide
you to meet Empyrean God Sin and Empyrean God Sealthroat,” Li
Chunyi said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, they arrived at a
palace where many Empyrean Gods were gathered. Surrounding this
palace was a number of Immortal estates as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha, it’s quite
lively here!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many Empyrean
Gods!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seven Dragon Gods!
You made it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder brother
Feiyou.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than a hundred
Empyrean Gods came out to welcome Ning and his followers. Ning was
accompanied by an amazing number of followers, and when Li Chunyi saw
all of them emerge, he was badly shocked as well. He had guessed that
Ning must’ve brought some followers with him, but he never would’ve
thought that Ning would bring this many. Since everyone Ning brought
was of the Nuwa Alliance, they were naturally quite welcome in this
place, and in fact many of the people in the palace all knew the
newcomers. Some were extremely close friends!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long while later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the top of a
mountain peak, three figures sat down to drink wine and chat. These
three were three of the four primary Empyrean Gods of Kilostar
Island…Empyrean God Darknorth, Empyrean God Sealthroat, and
Empyrean God Sin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those are all magic
treasures the various Empyrean Gods brought with them.” Empyrean
God Sealthroat was a callous-looking silver-haired youth, and he
pointed at the distant Immortal estates around the palace. “That
vile miscreant Greatdream’s murder of Ninedawn caused an enormous
outcry throughout all of Kilostar Island. Everyone was worried about
being ambushed, and so when they cultivate they will normally retreat
into their own Immortal estates. Within those estates, others can’t
easily enter, and so things are much safer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn that
Greatdream.” Empyrean God Sin clenched his winecup, a murderous
look in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, you must
be careful.” Empyrean God Sin said in a low voice, “Sealthroat
and I have tussled with Greatdream quite a few times in recent years,
and we understand him quite well. Greatdream publicly proclaims that
he killed Ninedawn out of hatred, but based on what Sealthroat and I
have discovered…he’s simply an incredibly self-centered,
narrowminded person. Ninedawn had the best chance of us all of
leaving Undermoon Lake, which is why he befriended then murdered
him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’ll kill whoever
has a good chance of leaving,” Empyrean God Sealthroat said
solemnly. “In fact, he even tried to kill me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s because you
are a fool.” Empyrean God Sin snickered. “He murdered Ninedawn,
but you wanted to give him a second chance?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I just wanted to get
a clear look at his true nature,” Empyrean God Sealthroat said with
a sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And I imagine you
did.” Empyrean God Sin snickered again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, the demon
king said that of those who have come after Reverend Jueming, you
stand the highest chance of leaving Undermoon Lake, correct?”
Empyrean God Sealthroat looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. When he
had ‘released’ the many Empyrean Gods he had been carrying, some
of them naturally began to talk about him to their old friends.
Feiyou and the others had actually asked Ning for permission to talk
about him, and Ning had given it as he had felt that there was
nothing to hide. Thus, Feiyou and the others had naturally bragged
and boasted quite a bit about Ning, allowing the other Empyrean Gods
here to learn a bit more about him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You stand a high
chance of leaving, and so it is very likely that Greatdream will act
against you,” Empyrean God Sealthroat said. “Although he doesn’t
know exactly how powerful you are yet, I imagine that he’ll hear of
you in time. In fact, as more time passes, he’ll probably get a
clear sense of how formidable you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have to be wary
of him. He’s quite insidious and very powerful. He was very close
to Ninedawn in power, and is a bit stronger than the two of us. Over
the course of all these years, he’s continued to improve in power.
Perhaps in the future, it’ll be possible for him to escape
Undermoon Lake as well. You have to be on your guard against him,”
Empyrean God Sealthroat warned repeatedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning’s eyes
narrowed. “There’s something I haven’t told you yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” The
two both looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A storm has already
descended upon the Three Realms…” Ning told the tale to the two
Empyrean Gods, and upon hearing it the two became both furious and
frantic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I knew that the
Seamless Gate was a pack of untamable savages. They all deserve to
die!” Empyrean God Sin roared angrily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is the situation
outside really so grim?” Empyrean God Sealthroat was worried as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said calmly,
“Empyrean God Greatdream has slain senior Ninedawn, and there’s a
chance that he might be able to escape Undermoon Lake. Once he does,
he’ll become a threat to our side. In the future, he might make a
breakthrough to become a Daofather.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other two nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine you two
also wish him dead, right?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want him dead.
Even in my dreams, I want him dead. Ninedawn was my dear brother; we
battled together amongst the other primordial humans as our race rose
to power. For him to die so unfairly…!” Empyrean God Sin ground
his teeth. “But it’s useless. I know that you want to help us,
Darknorth, but Empyrean God Greatdream is extremely cautious, and he
has a large number of Empyrean Gods by his side as he hides himself
within his Immortal estate. How are we supposed to kill him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s true.
Although you’ve brought a group of new Empyrean Gods, giving us an
absolute advantage in numbers, they are hiding within their Immortal
estate and relying on it to defend against us.” Empyrean God
Sealthroat shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How will we know if
we don’t try?” Ning said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have an idea?”
The other two grew excited. They had long ago been filled with the
desire to kill the despicable Greatdream, but they didn’t have the
chance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll give it a
try,” Ning said. “We can’t force things, though; we’ll have
to use a softer method.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth,
Greatdream isn’t easy to deal with. Don’t try to use a ‘soft’
method and end up losing your life to him,” Empyrean God Sin warned
nervously. He was afraid that Ning would deliver himself up for
slaughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prior to this
conversation, Ning felt detestation towards Greatdream and would’ve
killed him without hesitation if the opportunity came. However, he
wouldn’t have gone out of his way to hunt Greatdream down! But upon
hearing that Greatdream was very powerful and stood a good chance of
escaping Undermoon Lake, a killing intent entered Ning’s heart. If
Greatdream left and broke through to become a Daofather, he would
become yet another powerful general for the Seamless Gate. Although
it wasn’t guaranteed that he would become a Daofather after
escaping, Ning wasn’t willing to take the risk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The people trapped
within Undermoon Lake were outside the confines of the Three Realms
and so couldn’t sense the Heavenly Daos. Thus, their only choice
was to work on other types of force, mastering the likes of
taiji-force, infiniforce, thunderforce, and more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, upon leaving
Undermoon Lake they would be able to once more sense the Heavenly
Daos of the Three Realms. There truly was a good chance of breaking
through to become a Daofather. Jueming, the only person to escape,
had succeeded. Ning wasn’t willing to see the Seamless Gate gain a
new major power, a ‘Daofather Greatdream’.

Chapter 25 - Infiltration
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Half a day later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed youth was
walking by himself atop a lonely path that was surrounded by a few
flowers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Suddenly, a
muscular, golden-armored man appeared. The man said with a laugh, “My
name is Dong’e. Who are you?” He was quite curious, as he knew
all the Empyrean Gods on Kilostar Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empyrean God
Dong’e?” Ji Ning laughed. “My name is Darknorth. I just arrived
at Kilostar Island.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just arrived? I was
wondering! I know all the other Empyrean Gods on Kilostar Island.”
Empyrean God Dong’e laughed loudly. “I know almost all the
Empyrean Gods of the Three Realms as well, but I’ve never heard of
you. It seems you must’ve broken through in the past few ten
million years or so. You are here alone; did you succeed in
challenging Demon Icepass?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Precisely.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, come! Let me
take you to meet Empyrean God Greatdream.” Dong’e was quite
excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empyrean God
Greatdream?” Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong’e laughed,
“Greatdream is someone else who relied on his own power to overcome
Demon Icepass and make it to this place. He’s quite powerful…”
He continued to chat with Ning as they walked, while Ning put on a
show of knowing nothing at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a black
Immortal estate located halfway up a mountain. A black-robed man
emerged from it, staring downwards. A second Empyrean God Dong’e
appeared next to him as well. Dong’e had many different clones that
were on watch in many areas in order to prevent Empyrean God Sin and
Empyrean God Sealthroat from launching a sneak attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” The
black-robed man said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greatdream,”
Empyrean God Dong’e said hurriedly, “I ran into an Empyrean God
that I’ve never seen before and do not recognize. After chatting
with him, I learned that he just recently became an Empyrean God in
the Three Realms. He relied on his own power to pass through Demon
Icepass and make it to Kilostar Island. Now, there will be four
powerful Empyrean Gods on this island. Most importantly of all, this
Empyrean God is a human. We can pull him over to our side…and in
fact, he might be an Empyrean God of the Seamless Gate to begin
with!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The
black-robed man nodded and said happily, “If we can gain another
supporter, that would be a good thing. Bring him over here, I’ll
prepare an appropriate welcome!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Dong’e
nodded and immediately left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed man
grew pensive. Humans…the strongest race of the Three Realms.
Monsters were a close second. When the Lord of All Fiends brought the
many experts of the Seamless Gate back to the Three Realms, the two
sides had made peace and had even joined together to become one big
family. There were many experts of the Seamless Gate who roamed the
Three Realms, copulating with humans and monsters and leaving behind
their lineage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was why many
humans and monsters had ‘Fiendgod blood’ in them. God blood
represented the lineage of the Gods of the Pangu Chaosworld, while
Fiend blood represented the mighty Fiends of the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fiendgod blood was in
the veins of many humans and monsters because of so many years of
interbreeding. In truth, it was impossible for the humans of Ji
Ning’s era to not have at least some of the blood of the major
powers of the Seamless Gate in their veins. But of course, humans had
closer blood ties to the major powers of the Pangu Chaosworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given that the Three
Sovereigns of Mankind were firmly on the Nuwa Alliance’s side,
humans were generally members of the Nuwa Alliance as well. However,
humans were incredibly numerous. With so many of them also having the
blood of the Seamless Gate in their veins, most humans didn’t view
the Seamless Gate with much enmity, and so many ended up being
recruited into the Seamless Gate. In the Grand Xia, for example,
quite a few Celestial Immortals had been drawn into their orbit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Humans…monsters…many
of both races had been recruited. This was why Dong’e thought that
it was entirely possible for them to recruit Ji Ning. In fact, it was
even possible that Ji Ning was already a member of the Seamless Gate!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” A cold look
flashed through the black-robed man’s eyes. “I don’t care if
you are a member of the Seamless Gate or not. Anyone who poses a
threat to me must be killed. Undermoon Lake…I’m the only person
that needs to be able to survive it. As for the others? Hmph. The
ideal outcome is for you all to die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Empyrean God
Greatdream had entered Undermoon Lake, the storm had yet to begin
within the Three Realms. The Seamless Gate and the Nuwa Alliance
hadn’t yet separated into enemy camps, and many on both sides were
close to one another. Keeper Everwood, for example, was on extremely
good terms with Patriarch Subhuti and Daoist Three Purities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was why Empyrean
God Greatdream actually didn’t care too much about whether or not
Ning was a member of the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All he needed right now
was an excuse!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he killed Empyrean
God Ninedawn, he had to come up with the excuse of ‘taking revenge
for his slain brothers and friends’. Otherwise, even if the
Empyrean Gods of the Seamless Gate still chose to stand with him,
they wouldn’t put their hearts into it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An hour later, Ning
reached Greatdream.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Very, very few
Empyrean Gods can make it to Kilostar Island under their own power.
Over the course of endless years, only nine of us have succeeded.”
Empyrean God Greatdream acted in a very friendly manner, taking Ning
by the hand. “Come, come! Let’s have a good chat!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed and
nodded. As they walked together, shoulder-to-shoulder, the other
Empyrean Gods of the Seamless Gate all behaved towards Ning in a very
friendly manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sit.” Empyrean God
Greatdream laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Greatdream sat
down in the lotus position next to a main pillar on the second floor
of the palace. The two had a jade table between them, covered with
winecups and two canteens of Immortal wine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s been so long
since any new Empyrean Gods have arrived,” Greatdream said with a
sigh. “Life in Undermoon Lake is far too lonely. For a new Empyrean
God to arrive is one of the happiest things in my life here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder how many
people here on Kilostar Island made it through their own power?”
Ning lifted up a winecup as he spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Before you came,
three.” Greatdream laughed, “I’m one, Sin is another, and
Sealthroat is the third. Those two belong to the Pangu Chaosworld,
while we belong to the Seamless Gate. That’s why we generally don’t
live together in the same place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said with
surprise, “Why’s that? The Pangu Chaosworld and the Seamless
Chaosworld were both destroyed long ago. This is now the era of the
Three Realms, and both sides are members of the Three Realms. Why
must there be a need for conflict?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are blood
feuds, I suppose.” Greatdream shook his head. “Both sides have
seen many loved ones die during the war that destroyed the Primordial
Era. The hatred between us…it’s ensured that neither side has
truly been able or willing to view the other as part of the same
family. The experts of the Primordial Era in particular; many of them
harbor hatred in their heart. The only reason there is peace is
because both sides are very powerful. If one side was to weaken, the
other side would soon move to destroy them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
Greatdream’s words made some sense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be fooled by
the long peace. The number of major powers on both sides who have
truly become close friends, lifelong friends, can be counted on one
hand. Only the likes of the Keeper of the Everwood is capable of
becoming extremely good friends with the major powers of the Pangu
Chaosworld.” Greatdream shook his head. “A gulf continues to
remain amongst most of the major powers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Things aren’t so
bad for you. You made your breakthrough in recent years, after all.
Both the Seamless Gate and the Pangu Chaosworld would view you as
their progeny,” Greatdream said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the eyes of the Nuwa
Alliance, the denizens of the Three Realms were the progeny of the
Pangu Chaosworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But in the eyes of the
Seamless Gate, the denizens of the Three Realms were also the progeny
of the Seamless Chaosworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both sides felt
themselves to be the masters of the Three Realms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And in truth, neither
side was wrong per sé. The Three Realms had been created, after all,
when the two mighty chaosworlds had collided and clashed against each
other!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are some
grudges between myself, Sin, and Sealthroat. There’s no need for
you to get mixed into it.” Greatdream chatted with Ning for quite
some time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but secretly sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No wonder…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No wonder Empyrean God
Sealthroat had intentionally given Greatdream a chance to attack him,
so as to authenticate Greatdream’s true nature. Greatdream truly
was far too formidable; even though Ning had come to kill him, after
chatting with him for so long, Ning couldn’t help but feel that he
really was quite a decent person and someone worth befriending.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He lives up to his
reputation as the personal disciple of the Godking. His powers over
the human heart are quite formidable,” Ning mused silently to
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After chatting for a
long while, Greatdream suddenly let out a laugh. “Haha, we’ve
chatted for quite some time. It seems the two of us really are born
friends! Still, I imagine you need some rest. Have you brought any
Immortal estates with you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can set it up
within the surrounding area, then rest inside,” Greatdream said.
“It’ll be safer inside.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Inside the Immortal
estate? Are there hidden dangers within Kilostar Island?” Ning was
surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh. The hatred
stemming from the Primordial Era…but enough of that. Enough of
that. Just be careful.” Greatdream smiled, then led Ning out from
the palace. Just as they reached the palace stairway…suddenly, and
without any warning signs, he sent a streak of light to stab towards
Ning’s waist, seeking to slay Ning by chopping him in half.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Greatdream
no longer appeared friendly or amiable. The only thing within his
eyes was an icy, murderous intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Anyone capable of
posing a threat to me must die!” The murderous intent he had kept
suppressed in his heart exploded forth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Screeech. When the
blade slashed across Ning’s chest, it screeched as though it was
scraping against a magic treasure. In fact, some sparks flew
outward…but ning wasn’t harmed at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned his head to
look at Greatdream. Ning’s eyes had turned cold as well, and his
right hand transformed into a blurry streak of sword-light that
chopped towards the man.

Chapter 26 - Destruction
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was true that Ji
Ning had made this trip with the intent of killing Empyrean God
Greatdream, but in his heart he didn’t have absolute faith in what
Empyrean Gods Sin and Sealthroat had told him. Based on the reports
he had seen prior to entering Undermoon Lake, those two were unlikely
to be petty, vindictive liars, but Undermoon Lake had a way of
changing people. In addition, Ning had become extremely to Empyrean
God Zhenbu and other Seamless Gate members on Myriad Mountains
Island, and so he wouldn’t act against the Empyrean Gods of the
Seamless Gate in a casual manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was why he gave
Greatdream a chance to sneak attack him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He wanted to see for
himself exactly what type of a person Greatdream was. Perhaps
ordinary Empyrean Gods wouldn’t dare to allow others to sneak
attack them, but Ning had the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] protecting him;
he held no fear of Greatdream at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And in the
end…Greatdream really had launched a sneak attack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh. Ning used the
[Starseizing Hand], using his fingers as swords and filling them
fourth-stage swordforce, causing a blurry black light to appear at
his fingertips. In almost the same instant that Greatdream attacked
him, Ning launched a counter-attack. They were very close to each
other…and this attack of Ning’s was simply far too fast!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was a sword-strike
that had absolutely reached the speed of light! In addition, to save
time, Ning didn’t even pull out any magic treasures, instead simply
striking with his sword-fingers. This was because he wanted to strike
as fast as possible!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
Greatdream hurriedly tried to dodge, but the distance between them
was too short, and this sword was too fast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A huge, gaping wound
appeared on Greatdream’s flank. Blood poured out of the wound, but
Greatdream transformed into a bloody streak of light and began to
flee, having no desire to fight whatsoever. “This Empyrean God
Darknorth…I gave him a full-power strike, but I wasn’t able to
harm his body at all. What sort of protective divine ability has he
trained in? Could it be the legendary [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Attempting a sneak
attack against an Empyrean God practitioner of the [Eight-Nine Arcane
Art]…poor bastard!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were very few
practitioners of the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] in the Three Realms to
begin with. The number of Empyrean Gods that had reached the Ninth
Cycle were even fewer and could be counted on one hand…but Ning was
one of them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Ning’s right
hand explosively increased in size to become many hundreds of meters
long as he chased after Greatdream.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Greatdream’s evasion
abilities, however, were quite astonishing. He managed to escape
Ning’s attack. Although Ning’s sword was very fast, the rate at
which his right hand could increase in size was, comparatively
speaking, much slower. With a boom, Greatdream evaded Ning’s attack
as Ning’s sword-fingers slashed past the pillars and walls of the
palace. Instantly, a pillar collapsed, the walls shattered, and half
of the entire palace began to collapse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?!”
A group of Seamless Gate members were outside the palace in small
groups. All of them turned their heads to stare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They saw Empyrean God
Greatdream fleeing from the palace, soaked in blood. Filling his
voice with divine power, he shouted out frantically, “Darknorth
ambushed me! He came to kill me! Empyrean God Sin and Empyrean God
Sealthroat sent him here to kill me!” He had decided to first shift
the blame to Ning, then worry about the rest later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ambush? Kill?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These Empyrean Gods of
the Seamless Gate all knew that their side had been tussling against
the other side for quite some time now. The enemy side had always
wanted to slay Greatdream, and so none of them questioned his claims
now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And in truth,
technically speaking, Greatdream’s words were true. Ji Ning really
had come to kill him! Except…it was Greatdream who ambushed Ning
first.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble the
formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the
twenty-plus Empyrean Gods began to join together into formations,
joining together to form a trio of Seven Planets Gods and a single
Three-Eyed Demon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed Ning
stared at the three Seven Planets Gods and the Three-Eyed Demon
before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, you
actually came to ambush Empyrean God Greatdream?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You really are
seeking out your own death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all glared at
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said calmly, “If
I said that it was Greatdream who ambushed me, would you believe it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I ambushed you,
why is it that you are completely unharmed while I am deeply
injured?” One of the Seven Planets Gods roared furiously. This one
had a face quite similar to that of Greatdream’s. “You actually
swindled your way into our ranks to ambush me. Quite bold! Everyone,
attack! Wipe him out and let Sin and the others know that anyone who
dares to attack us will be killed. If one comes, one will die; if ten
come, ten will fall!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because these Empyrean
Gods of the Seamless Gate stood alongside Greatdream, they had been
fighting against the forces of Sin and Sealthroat for many years now.
They had always been at a disadvantage due to their lower numbers and
thus nursed deep grudges.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you were to join
together and hide within the Immortal estate…I might not be able to
do anything to you.” Ning mentally shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, more than
seven hundred Pure Yang swords appeared around him. The pure energy
from Ning’s Jindan flowed into the swords, then was transformed and
manifested as an incomparably sharp jade sword that appeared before
him. Ning just glancd at the three Seven Planets Gods and the
Three-Eyed Demon before him, and the jade sword instantly launched an
attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” The enemy
forces came charging straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of raw power,
none of the Seven Planets Gods were comparable to the one which
Redsnow commanded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Three-Eyed
Demon, it was the weakest of the four, and by a wide margin at that.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that during the Crimsonbright Realmwar, Evergreen’s Daofather golem
had been able to suppress the Seven Planets God…but Ning’s
perfect Heaven Punisher had been able to suppress the Daofather
golem! Now that Ning had a Pure Yang Jindan that was similar to that
of a weak Daofather’s, his sword was incredibly powerful when using
the most terrifying stances of the [Brightmoon] sword-art. The past
hundred years of battle had only caused his sword-arts to become even
deadlier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of this
sword-strike he had just launched was actually much more powerful
than that of even the perfect Heaven Punisher he once commanded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” The Seven
Planets God that Greatdream commanded let out a furious roar. He
wielded a pair of enormous scimitars in his hands, and he sent them
chopping downwards towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The jade sword arced
through the skies in a solitary, beautiful line.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Greatdream
sought to block it, the jade sword was simply too fast, and he was
just a bit too slow. It must be understood that the demon king was
just as fast and strong as the Seven Planets God, but even he was
unable to block Ning’s jade sword. And after a century of battle,
the current Ji Ning had improved tremendously compared to the Ji Ning
of the past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash. The jade sword
slashed downwards across the body of the Seven Planets God.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go, go!” Ning
stared coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The many Immortal
swords around him undulated, allowing his energy to flow through and
coalesce into two more jade swords that immediately flew towards the
enemy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good heavens.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can he be this
powerful?! How can an Empyrean God be this strong?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In almost the blink of
an eye, the three Seven Planets Gods and the Three-Eyed Demon were
all destroyed. The Empyrean Gods that had been within the formations
were terrified. Greatdream, in particular, found this all impossible
to believe; how could this person be so powerful? This was a level of
power that caused him to feel despair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spare us!”
Greatdream called out hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Slash! Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the jade swords
was spent, but the other two continued to fly forwards. All the
Empyrean Gods they flew past were chopped apart into multiple pieces.
These Empyrean Gods immediately began to heal themselves and flee in
terror…but alas, they were quickly ground up into tiny slices of
meat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Ning
stretched out with his two hands, which instantly swelled in size.
They seemed to become two enormous black clouds that slammed towards
the remnants of the Empyrean Gods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s two gigantic
cloud-sized hands clapped together multiple times, with all of the
Empyrean Gods trapped within them. He clapped them into dust. Just a
few claps later, their divine power was completely used up and they
all perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than twenty
Empyrean Gods…had died, just like that!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, if all of
them had hidden themselves within their Immortal estate and relied on
the formations of the estate to protect themselves, there would’ve
been nothing that Ning could’ve done. Perhaps Ning’s Rahu
Formation was capable of breaching the combined defenses of more than
twenty Empyrean Gods who were jointly resisting him within a
formation, but Ning didn’t have any other Immortals following and
assisting him at present. All he had was the Pure Yang Jindan within
his body, and so Ning was ‘only’ as strong as a perfect Heaven
Punisher, with his sword-arts being more profound than before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But they had instead
chosen to exchange attacks with Ning?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That was suicide…and
so they really had died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The person who kill
you was me…Ji Ning,” Ning murmured softly to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At his level of
heartforce, Ning knew exactly when to kill and when not to kill. He
had already made the decision in his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After killing
Greatdream and the others, Ning only let out a sigh and shook his
head. He remained as calm and collected as ever as he began to return
to the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s Empyrean
God Darknorth over there!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Isn’t Darknorth
supposed to be with Sin and the others?” Quite a few of the
Empyrean Gods were confused. Ning had only informed Sin and
Sealthroat of his decision to attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, two more figures
appeared. They were Empyrean God Sin and Empyrean God Sealthroat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s good to see
you back.” The two of them both felt relieved upon seeing him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I told you I’d be
fine,” Ning said. He had the power to defeat all of the enemy’s
Empyrean Gods at the same time; of course he would’ve been fine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How’d it go?”
Sealthroat immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dead,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sealthroat and Sin both
revealed looks of wild joy on their faces. Sin mumbled to himself,
“Wonderful. No matter what we tried, we weren’t able to do
anything to him. He was simply too crafty…but now, he’s dead.
Wonderful, wonderful!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All dead,” Ning
elaborated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All…dead?” Sin
and Sealthroat revealed looks of disbelief on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They really couldn’t
believe what they had just heard. In fact, that very day the two of
them paid a personal visit to the place where the Seamless Gate’s
forces had gathered. They stared at the collapsed palace, at the
shattered ground, at the scars of battle…but there wasn’t a
single enemy Empyrean God in sight. Only then did they truly believe
that Ning had done what he said he had done.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“More than twenty
Empyrean Gods. All dead. How?!” Sin was filled with confusion.
“There were so many of them. Most were comparatively weak, but they
had the absolute advantage in raw numbers. Even if they just joined
together into simple Seven Planets Gods, they would become incredibly
powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you can’t
understand it, don’t bother trying to. Darknorth had his own
methods for succeeding. All we know and need to know is that he is
very powerful. No wonder the demon king said that he is very likely
to succeed in leaving Undermoon Lake.” Sealthroat couldn’t help
but sigh and smile in amazement while praising Ning. “This is
perfect. If Greatdream was the only one to die, the other Empyrean
Gods of the Seamless Gate would’ve posed a headache as well,
forcing us to constantly be on our guard. Now, however, we have
nothing to fear.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.” Sin
nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Greatdream had already
become a person of the past. What Ji Ning cared about the most right
now was the final challenge! He was just one step away from leaving
Undermoon Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third day since his
arrival on Kilostar Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dawn moon had risen
into the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the other side of
Kilostar Island, Ning was standing with the other two, staring off
into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sin pointed towards the
distance. “Look, over there! That’s the Path of Blades. It is the
final challenge. If you are able to walk the Path of Blades, you’ll
make it to the fifth island and be able to leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Path of Blades?”
Ning stared at the distant wooden bridge. The wooden bridge led to a
place that was filled with countless enormous knifes, swords, and
spears that stood upright and erect.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_27___The_Final_Challenge"></A>
Chapter 27 - The Final Challenge: The Path of Blades
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How strong is the
guardian of this ‘Path of Blades’? Anything special to watch out
for?” Ji Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the final
challenge. Ning understood that the guardian definitely had to be a
terrifyingly strong figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Sin and
Empyrean God Sealthroat exchanged a glance, then they both laughed.
Sin then turned to Ning. “The foe you will encounter on the Path of
Blades…is yourself!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Myself?” Ning was
flabbergasted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Sin
explained, “When you challenge the Path of Blades, the enemy that
appears will look exactly like you and have the exact same divine
body, the exact same divine abilities, the exact same Immortal
energy…the exact same everything. In fact, if you use sword-arts,
he’ll choose to use sword-arts as well. The only difference is…the
sword-arts that he uses will be the sword-arts of Undermoon Lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt shocked. His
greatest advantage was that his Pure Yang Jindan had reached the
second tier…but on the Path of Blades, this would give him no
advantage at all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“On the Path of
Blades, you will strictly be competing in pure combat techniques,”
Sealthroat explained with a sigh. “I would compete in spear-arts,
while you will be competing in sword-arts! Only if your sword-arts
are sufficiently profound will you be able to defeat your foes. In
addition, on the Path of Blades, there will be a total of ten such
opponents. All of them will have the same divine body and same
abilities as you, but the sword-arts they use will be different. The
later guardians will have increasingly profound sword-arts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Path of
Blades…it has ten guardians that are akin to ten of you. Only by
defeating these ten copies of yourself will you be able to reach the
fifth island and leave Undermoon Lake,” Empyrean God Sealthroat
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slowly.
Defeat himself? Ten increasingly powerful versions of himself?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He now understood how
difficult it would be to traverse the Path of Blades. Ning no longer
felt that confident in his ability to defeat it. The reason why he
was much more powerful than the other Empyrean Gods was thanks to his
Jindan and his [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], but now both advantages had
been stripped for him. If this was purely a competition of
sword-arts…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, the
hundred years he had spent battling in Demon Icepass had resulted in
his sword-arts improving dramatically! And after reaching Kilostar
Island, he had trained for another ten-plus days, resulting in him
getting the vague sense that he was closing in on complete mastery of
the [Five Treasures], with his sword-arts reaching the speed of
light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What level of
sword-arts will be necessary to overcome the Path of Blades?” Ning
no longer felt confident.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth,
you are the one who the demon king said has the highest chances of
surviving and leaving Undermoon Lake. All of us will be watching you
with hope,” Empyrean God Tyranodragon said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you can leave,
we’ll be able to leave as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If brother Darknorth
wishes to leave, it won’t prove to be too difficult a task!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than two hundred
Empyrean Gods were here, gathered around a campfire that was
currently being used to roast skinned animals. They all looked
towards Ning with scorching gazes, because in their heart, this
‘Empyrean God Darknorth’ stood the highest chances of succeeding
out of them all. All of them had been trapped here for far, far too
long; in their innermost hearts, they deeply desired to be able to
leave this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright, alright!
Don’t give Darknorth too much pressure.” Empyrean God Feiyou
boomed out, “Do you really think Undermoon Lake is so easily
escaped from? Let Darknorth take things slowly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. We won’t
rush him. We’ve been waiting for so long already; another ten
thousand years or even another million years is nothing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m personally in
no rush, but the outside world is in a state of chaos. The earlier we
can leave, the better. If we take too long, the war might have ended
already. If we go out early, at least we’ll be able to help out a
bit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The commotion continued
unabated. As for Sealthroat and Sin, the two Empyrean Gods had
reached Ning’s side. Sealthroat said softly, “Darknorth, to tell
you the truth, this Path of Blades…Sin and I have been challenging
it for many, many years. No matter how hard I try, I’m unable to
overcome the seventh opponent, while Sin has been stymied by the
sixth opponent. Each of the ten guardians is more powerful than the
last, and I have four more remaining before I can leave, while Sin
has five! Our chances of improving are quite minute…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s true.” Sin
let out a sigh as well. “I’ve only defeated half of the ten
guardians; five more are left! I truly have no confidence in myself
anymore. In truth, Ninedawn stood a very good chance. He had already
reached the eighth guardian, with only two more to go after beating
that one. But alas, he ended up dying in the hands of Greatdream.
Greatdream was more formidable than the two of us as well; he had
already reached the eighth of the guardians as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He could
sense that Sin and Sealthroat no longer had enough faith in
themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t know how
long it would take for the two of us to leave on our own.”
Sealthroat looked at Ning. “These two hundred Empyrean Gods have
entrusted their hopes to us, but the two of us can’t do it. It’s
all up to you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, it really
is up to you.” Sin looked at Ning as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can only promise
to do my best. I’m not certain that I can succeed either,” Ning
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, right…”
Sealthroat advised, “Remember, if you are able to defeat the ninth
guardian, immediately withdraw and come back to Kilostar Island.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why?” Ning was
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Because if you can
defeat all ten guardians in one go, you’ll immediately be sent
towards the fifth island,” Sealthroat said hurriedly. “But what
of the two hundred Empyrean Gods over here? They are all waiting for
you to lead them out of this place. If you can defeat the ninth
guardian, you should take them all with you when you go challenge the
tenth guardian.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, right, right!
It’s said that Jueming gained a sudden insight when challenging the
Path of Blades, and so made it all the way past the final three
guardians without giving anyone advance notice. He immediately left
without being able to take a single Empyrean God with him.” Sin
said angrily, “Jueming was too selfish!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps it wasn’t
his fault,” Sealthroat said. “It’s possible that he was so
excited by his sudden insight that he lost track of how many
guardians he had defeated. He just continued to fight until they were
all gone…and by then, there was no way back for him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Sin just
let out a contemptuous snort. Clearly, he nursed quite the grudge
against Jueming.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no point
in saying all these things.” Sealthroat smiled as he looked towards
Ning. “Darknorth, the two of us can’t do it. It really is up to
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tomorrow, give it a
good shot. But of course, don’t actually go through all ten stages
at once. Hold back a little,” Sin said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I can defeat nine
of the guardians, I would return and celebrate.” Ning shook his
head. He didn’t feel confident.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The next day. More than
two hundred Empyrean Gods ushered Ning towards the edge of Kilostar
Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, be
careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come back after
beaing nine of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, staying
alive is wha really matters. Don’t end up losing your life!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean Gods all
gave him their various instructions and exhortations. In the past,
there truly had been a number of Empyrean Gods who had died on the
Path of Blades. Ning, however, wasn’t worried. The Empyrean Gods
would encounter guardians that were identical to them, which meant
that when they fought against their doppelgangers, a single
successful blow on either side might destroy the other. Things were
different for Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he faced off
against a guardian, both of them would be protected by the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art]. This meant that neither of them would be
capable of killing the other. This meant that the Path of Blades was
actually the safest challenge of all for him. However, although it
was safe, to actually defeat all ten guardians…this would be a
very, very hard task.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go now.”
Ning waved at them, then stepped onto the floating wooden bridge by
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than two hundred
Empyrean Gods watched as Ning walked through the wooden bridge and
vanished into the distant Path of Blades.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Three Realms
have been swept into a storm. I really want to get out as soon as
possible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s all up to
Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean Gods all
began to grow nervous. Prior to this, they had all been joking around
loudly with each other, but that was just for the sake of keeping the
mood relaxed. Now that Ning had actually gone forward to challenge
the Path of Blades, all the Empyrean Gods felt the pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ji Ning was only
capable of defeating five or six of the guardians, then it would
probably be difficult for him to succeed within the next ten million
years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eyes of the
Empyrean Gods were filled with hope, desire, nervousness, and
uneasiness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They weren’t afraid
of death, but they simply couldn’t stand knowing that their
masters, brothers, loved ones, and family members were facing a
terrible war while they were living safe lives here at Kilostar
Island. They wanted to leave. They truly wanted to leave!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The long wooden bridge
led directly towards the Path of Blades.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Path of Blades was
filled with enormous upright swords, spears, sabres, and other edged
weapons. They were planted into the ground and pointed upwards
towards the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white-robed youth
suddenly came to a halt midway through the path…because in front of
him had just appeared a golden-robed youth that looked just like him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that me?” Ning
was slightly startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m the first
guardian. Take a look at that sword over there.” The golden-robed
youth pointed towards a nearby sword that was at least thirty
thousand meters tall. Phantom illusions actually began to appear on
the surface of the sword, illusions of a humanoid that was executing
a complete set of profound sword-arts, going from simple to profound,
from start to finish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The sword-arts that
appeared on that sword are the sword-arts that I will use.” The
golden-robed youth looked at Ning. “You can view these sword-arts
three times. After doing so, the sword-arts will vanish and we shall
fight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning felt
delight. This really was an unexpected surprise. He was actually
being given a chance to view the opponent’s sword-arts? Sin and
Sealthroat hadn’t told him of this. Most likely, the two had wanted
to give him a pleasant surprise. There was no point telling him in
advance, after all, and letting him find out on the spot would bring
a bit of joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning carefully stared
at the enormous sword that had been plunged into the endless ice
around them. The sword-arts appearing on the sword were continuously
being displayed. Three sessions took nearly twelve full hours, at
which point in time it all came to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a curious
sword-art.” Although Ning sighed in approval, he didn’t panic in
the slightest, because this first guardian’s sword-art posed no
threat to him at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Done?” The
golden-robed youth asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then receive my
attacks.” The golden-robed youth’s body suddenly blurred,
manifesting a total of three heads and six arms. Six swords appeared
in his hands as well as he pounced towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A strange feeling was
in Ning’s heart, because this sort of battle tactic was quite
similar to his own, and this person looked identical to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
His sword-art moved at the speed of light, and it was overwhelming
superior. Although Ning’s opponent had increased his power with the
[Starseizing Hand], his sword was still knocked flying by Ning’s
sword-light chop. However, thanks to the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art], the
doppelganger’s body was completely unharmed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your sword-art is
far superior to mine.” The golden-robed youth landed on the wooden
bridge and nodded. “I am thoroughly convinced by my defeat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. The
golden-robed youth disappeared into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
advance forwards, making his way deeper into the Path of Blades. Each
time he encountered a new guardian, a nearby sword would begin to
display a set of sword-arts for him to view. Each time after he
viewed the sword-arts, Ning would feel somewhat inspired, and he was
able to further perfect his [Brightmoon] sword-art. However, his
[Brightmoon] sword-art was already incredibly powerful, as it had
incorporated the essence of the [Five Treasures] within it.
Sword-light that struck at light speed was incredibly formidable. The
word ‘fast’, all by itself, could be superior to countless tricks
and techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was able to battle
all the way to the eighth guardian on his first try.

Chapter 28 - The Mournful Sword
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-robed youth
standing before Ji Ning had very gentle eyes.. He looked towards Ning
in a very affectionate way, as though he was looking his most beloved
lover.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For some reason, Ning
felt vaguely threatened as the eighth guardian stared at him. Still,
he didn’t say anything. Instead, he turned to look at the enormous
sword that was next to him. Sword-arts had already begun to appear on
its surface. As he had battled his way past the guardians, the
sword-arts he had encountered had become increasingly formidable and
had provided more and more insights to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, Ning could
sense that all of these sets of sword-arts were guiding him towards
the limits of the Heavenly Daos, as if they were teaching him how to
reach and surpass those limits. Although there were many types of
sword-arts in the Three Realms, aside from the [Five Treasures] which
had surpassed the Heavenly Daos, no sword-arts had inspired him and
helped him as much as these ones had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The major power who
created Undermoon Lake definitely had an extraordinary background.
The sword-arts he has left behind have been tremendously beneficial
to me, but he’s also done the same for the other Empyrean Gods,
some of whom use spears, staves, scimitars, and other weapons. No
matter what weapon is used, the Path of Blades will produce a
different, matching guardian.” Ning was stunned by the
implications.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This further reinforced
the truth to Ning that the primordial chaos truly was filled with all
possibilities. The Three Realms was nothing more than a single little
chaosworld within the infinite primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To sit at the bottom of
a well and stare at the tiny portion of sky that was visible and
believe it to be the entirety of the heavens…that would truly be a
joke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since he was weak, he
had to work hard and train hard to make himself become strong. Ning
celebrated the fact that he had been able to come to Undermoon Lake
and become more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This sword-art is
quite marvelous, quite special…” As Ning watched, a look of
veneration appeared in his eyes. “Lingering affection? Longing? The
name of this sword-art should be the ‘Longing Sword’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-arts were
displayed on the sword three times, then vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two swords appeared in
the hands of the golden-robed youth. He lowered his head to look at
the swords, his gaze very gentle. In a soft voice, he said, “It’s
time to fight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded, a pair of swords appearing in his own hands as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-robed youth
smiled slightly, a beautiful, intoxicating smile. He then transformed
into a gentle breeze, and his sword-light was like a gentle breeze as
well. It seemed incomparably soft and harmless, but Ning could sense
a tremendous threat emanating from it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he hadn’t had the
chance to view the complete sword-art three times from start to
finish, he probably would’ve been at a huge disadvantage. However,
Ning now knew this sword-art, the ‘Longing Sword’, with
incomparable clarity, giving him a much better chance of dealing with
it. Twin swords in his hands, he sent his own sword-light howling
forth at the speed of light, using the ghostly and unpredictable
‘Shadowless’ stance to launch a frenetic series of attacks!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sometimes, his swords
would be tremendously ferocious that they would actually move a bit
slower. The fact that his swords alternated being fast and slow made
them even more unpredictable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clearly, Ning’s
sword-arts were far deadlier than they had been when he had first
embarked upon the Path of Blades. And indeed, Ning had reaped much
from his battles against the seven previous guardians.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blood Drop stance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His sword-art suddenly
transformed into the fastest attack of all, the Blood Drop stance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the enemy’s
sword-art was like an endless, bottomless web that completely trapped
and tied down Ning’s two swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Longing…” Ning
was gaining more and more insights into this set of sword-arts. At
the beginning, he had only been able to rely on what he had seen on
the giant sword. Now, upon actually fighting against a person
identical to himself in all respects who used this sword-art, his
insights were different. Ning gained an even better understanding of
how some of the killer blows of this sword-art truly worked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Compared to it, my
[Brightmoon] sword-art isn’t fluid enough.” Ning’s sword-art
began to change as well, becoming even more unpredictable and
ephemeral.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shadowless stance,
Blood Drop stance. The two joined together into a more perfect whole,
and fewer and fewer flaws appeared when he attacked and withdrew.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The
golden-robed youth frowned. Instantly, his body blurred for a moment
before he manifested three heads and six arms, beginning to assault
Ning with six swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately used
[Three Heads, Six Arms] to engage as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A streak of sword-light
landed upon the golden-robed youth’s neck, knocking his sword aside
and forcing him back five steps before he was able to stabilize
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-robed youth
stared at Ning, then said in a low voice, “Your sword is faster
than mine, but the intrinsic essence of your sword-art…it’s a bit
inferior to mine. You have passed my challenge, but the ninth
guardian’s sword has also reached the limits of the Heavenly Daos,
while the essence of his sword-art is also superior to yours.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Really? Being
stronger than me is a good thing.” Ning grinned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful.” The
golden-robed youth disappeared into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a sigh of
relief. He had finally succeeded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not hesitating at all,
Ning continued to advance. A short while later, he saw the ninth
guardian. Upon seeing him, Ning could sense the essence of utter
despair surging towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That invisible
essence and aura is only growing more and more powerful.” Ning
couldn’t help but sigh to himself. “I hear that at the fifth
stage of swordforce, ‘Sword God’, one doesn’t even have to
attack; the invisible sword-intent radiating out from you will be
more than enough to force enemies to feel utter despair. The Path of
Blades…not only is it guiding me towards a path that surpasses the
Heavenly Daos, it’s also guiding me towards the fifth stage of
swordforce.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eight guardian’s
‘Longing Sword’ already had a hint of that quality to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ninth guardian,
just by standing there, was already radiating a strong aura of
despair. Clearly, he was even more formidable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, compared to
someone who had truly reached the fifth stage of swordforce, ‘Sword
God’, the ninth guardian was still far, far inferior.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was nothing more
than a guidepost! His mission was to plant a seed in Ning’s heart,
a seed which perhaps would eventually take root and grow in the
future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look at the
sword-art.” The ninth guardian said these words very calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled, then
looked at the sword-arts on display upon the giant sword nearby. As
he watched, his face slowly began to change. Every single stance,
every single stroke…it all caught Ning’s full attention, tugging
on the deepest, innermost thoughts in his heart. The more he analyzed
this sword-art, the more powerfully Ning was affected by it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his past life, Ning
was tormented by illness. His heart had been filled with resentment.
In this life, after being reborn, his father Ji Yichuan and his
mother Yuchi Snow had filled Ning’s heart with love, warming it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father. Mother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwingn Lake. Ning
was lying atop that wooden boat, floating atop the lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That instant when Yu
Wei had died. He had felt such despair that he himself had nearly
died as well. His parents were gone. Even Yu Wei was gone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was thanks to his
experiences that this sword-art resonated so deeply with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sword-art caused
Ning’s heart to be filled with a dark, dreary feeling. Deep in his
heart, he was filled with the utmost of despair!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister isn’t dead yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once I leave this
place, I’ll be able to save her. Our family can be reunited.”
Ning mumbled these words to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword-arts had
already finished their display on the sword. As for the ninth
guardian, he stared at Ning in astonishment, because he could sense
the intent radiating from Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is the name of
this sword-art?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the ninth
guardian he had encountered, but this was the first time that Ning
had asked for the proper name of a sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mourning,” the
ninth guardian said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mourning…mourning…”
Ning suddenly let out a laugh. “How appropriate. I’ve mourned in
the past…but here and now, I’m filled with hope.” After
finishing his words, Ning turned and walked away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You aren’t going
to fight?” The ninth guardian called out after him in surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not a match
for you right now. Next time I come, I’ll defeat you.” Ning’s
figure quickly disappeared into the distant wooden bridge, causing
the ninth guardian to gawk in amazement. Still, he didn’t chase
after Ning, because the two of them had identical bodies and
abilities; if Ning was intent on leaving, there was no way he could
even catch up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually didn’t
even fight.” The ninth guardian was completely puzzled. “And just
by viewing the sword-art, he felt certain that he was no amtch for
me. For him to make that claim means that he should’ve mastered
more than half of that sword-art and discovered the truly formidable
aspects to it. But despite all that, he shouldn’t have chosen to
completely avoid fighting me…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unless…there’s
only one possibility! After viewing the sword-art, his heart was
inspired and so he wanted to go back to calm himself down and
meditate on his insights.” This was the ninth guardian’s guess.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew very well that
given how formidable Ning’s protective divine ability was, even if
Ning lost the fight he wouldn’t have been in danger of dying. This
meant that the only reason Ning would refuse to fight would be if he
simply didn’t want to! Why wouldn’t he want to fight? The only
explanation was that he was worried that a battle would disrupt his
insights!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The guardian’s guess
was correct.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This set of sword-arts,
the [Mourning] sword-art, had indeed resonated with Ning. In fact,
after viewing it three times, Ning had learned most of it! His own
heart had been filled with many new insights, and Ning was worried
that if the battle became too frenzied, he would lose some of those
insights. Thus, he instead decided to give up the fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While flying back, Ning
continuously reflected on that sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the first set
of sword-arts on the Path of Blades that had truly resonated with
him. This was because the feelings and emotions the sword-art
embodied were feelings that he himself had experienced. He knew those
feelings very well, and so he almost instantly understood the nature
and the truth of this sword-art! This was a set of sword-arts that
was even more perfect than his own [Brightmoon] sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kilostar Island. The
end of the wooden bridge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than two hundred
Empyrean Gods were standing there, craning their necks to stare at
the bridge while waiting nervously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder how many
guardians Darknorth made it past.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If he’s able to go
through nine of them in one try, or even all ten, that would be
wonderful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please don’t let
him be so impatient as to beat all ten. As soon as he beats nine, he
needs to come back and take us all with him as he challenges the
tenth. That’s the ideal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the Empyrean Gods
waited eagerly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Sin and
Empyrean God Sealthroat’s chances of succeeding were too low. Right
now, their only hope was Ji Ning. All of them chatted amongst
themselves about how formidable Ji Ning was and how certain he was to
succeed. Right now, their greatest fear was that Ji Ning would only
be able to defeat five or six guardians. If that happened, it would
be a long, long time before he would be able to successfully
challenge the Path of Blades.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look!” Suddenly,
Empyrean God Roughpeak pointed towards the distance. He had been
seated by himself the entire time, quietly staring off into the
distance. He had been alone on the snowy island for so long that he
had gotten used to being by himself. He still, however, deeply
desired to leave this place and so he had been staring unblinkingly
towards the bridge. As soon as Ning’s figure had appeared off in
the distance, he had been the first to notice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s coming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning’s coming
back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them grew
excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the distant
white-robed youth flew across the wooden bridge, all of the Empyrean
Gods rose to their feet to welcome him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning landed. Upon
seeing the eager looks on the faces of the many Empyrean Gods, he
felt an enormous, invisible pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How did it go?”
Empyrean God Sin asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I beat eight of the
guardians. For now, I’m not a match for the ninth guardian,” Ning
said. He knew very well that every single guardian was capable of
perfectly executing their respective sword-arts. Since the ninth
guardian was able to perfectly control [Mourning], at present Ning
truly wasn’t a match for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You beat eight of
them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Two more remain?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Empyrean
Gods present were dazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To tell the truth, deep
in their hearts, the Empyrean Gods all felt at least slightly
disappointed. Beating eight meant that there were still two more to
go! Those final two guardians were like a pair of tigers that blocked
the road; Ji Ning would probably need quite a bit of time in order to
overcome them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they were
slightly disappointed, they were still fairly calm. In fact, they all
secretly let out sighs of relief. Thank goodness that Ning was more
powerful than Greatdream and Ninedawn, at least. Ning’s utter
domination of the twenty-plus Empyrean Gods of the Sealmess Gate had
stirred all of their imaginations, causing them to fantasize a bit
too much about his strength.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You beat eight of
them? Not bad, not bad. Greatdream and Ninedawn only defeated seven
of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only two left. Soon,
you’ll be able to make it out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Empyrean
Gods said words of encouragement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning naturally knew
what all of the Empyrean Gods were hoping for. He immediately
explained, “I need some time to meditate and train for a period of
time. I’m going to head off now.” After speaking, he immediately
transformed into a streak of light and flew away at high speed. He
returned to his living region, set down his Immortal estate, then
entered it and began to meditate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He needed time. Time to
meditate and go over his insights.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A large number of ideas
began to swell like a mental tidalwave. The insights he had gained on
the Path had truly excited him. He didn’t have any time at all to
waste on chatting with those other Empyrean Gods; what he needed was
to meditate and absorb all of these new ideas, nonstop!

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Sin and
Empyrean God Sealthroat walked forward shoulder-to-shoulder, staring
at the beautiful Immortal estate located on the distant mountain
peak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth was only
able to defeat eight guardians this time, and the last two are even
more powerful…I’m afraid that it will be many, many years before
we’ll be able to leave.” Sealthroat let out a sigh. He had
challenged the Path of Blades many times, and so he knew very well
that although it seemed as though ‘only’ two were left, a person
could easily end up spending a million or ten million years on each
of the final two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, Greatdream
had defeated five guardians upon reaching Kilostar Island. Countless
years had passed, but he was only able to defeat two more during that
period of time! As for the final two guardians Ji Ning would be
facing…they would be the most powerful guardians of all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Sealthroat and
Sin, they had been here for even longer periods of time, but the
amount of improvement they were able to make was miniscule. They were
only able to defeat one more guardian now compared to when they had
first reached Kilostar Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s not
necessarily so.” Sin shook his head. “We’ve been on Kilostar
Island for a long period of time and we’ve only improved a bit, but
that’s because spent far too much time on the previous islands.
Almost all of our potential was already squeezed out of us, and we’ve
pretty much increased as much as we can in power. Of course we would
find it very hard to improve any further! Darknorth, however, made it
all the way here in one try after entering Undermoon Lake. He still
has much potential left, and his potential was always much greater
than ours to begin with. Don’t forget, Reverend Jueming managed to
suddenly defeat the last three guardians all at once, thanks to a
sudden insight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sealthroat was briefly
startled. He nodded. “Your words make sense. Our potential has been
squeezed dry and we are almost at our limit, but Darknorth is
different.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Honestly, I’ve
been puzzled this entire time,” Sin said with a sigh. “He was
able to fight his way to Kilostar Island in one try. This sort of
talent and ability…in the Three Realms, he definitely would have
been one of the most supreme of Empyrean Gods. In fact, the True Gods
and Daofathers should view him as being very important, as he stands
a very good chance of joining their ranks. Why is it that he was
willing to risk Undermoon Lake?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Sealthroat
sighed as well. “I was also puzzled.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s talent had
been acknowledged even as far back as the Conclave of Immortal
Destiny by the likes of Lu Dongbin and Subhuti.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were both able to
tell that Ning was born with tremendous talent for the Dao of the
Sword! And indeed, Ning didn’t disappoint Subhuti with his rapid
rise in power. He had improved at a tremendously fast rate, and the
fact that he had reached the fourth stage of heartforce was an
unexpected surprise to Subhuti. By now, the top-tier major powers of
the Nuwa Alliance viewed Ning in the exact same way as they had
viewed Lu Dongbin during the Primordial Era.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…the
difference was that Lu Dongbin had the luxury of time to slowly build
up a powerful foundation, then make his breakthrough to instantly
become a top-tier Daofather.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his case, the storm
had already descended, and the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals of
both sides had already begun battling each other. The battles were
becoming larger and larger, and once the final battles for karmic
luck were concluded, the Endwar that would determine the destiny of
the entire Three Realms would commence. The amount of time Ji Ning
had was simply too little. This was one of the greatest regrets which
Subhuti and the others had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Despite their regrets,
however, they also felt that there was a chance that Ji Ning would
gain a sudden flash of insight during one of the many conflicts in
this storm and perhaps break through to become a True God or
Daofather! Thus, if Ning hadn’t trained in the [Taowu Eighteen
Fiendgods], Subhuti would not have permitted Ji Ning to enter
Undermoon Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, thanks to the
dangers of Undermoon Lake, Ning had gained more and more experience,
growing and improving so rapidly that he was now just a step away
from complete mastery of the [Five Treasures].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter what the
reason is for it, Darknorth’s entry into this place was a blessing
for us.” Sin sighed with emotion as he looked at the distant
Immortal estate. “We now have a chance of leaving.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. When
Darknorth returned from the Path of Blades, he barely said anything
to us. He immediately went into seclusion. As I see it…he probably
gained quite a few insights,” Sealthroat said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even I reaped great
gains from my first attempt at the Path of Blades, to say nothing of
Darknorth.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Hopefully,
he’ll be able to improve enough that he can complete the Path of
Blades.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait and see.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two Empyrean Gods
were both filled with hope.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They truly had no faith
in their ability to overcome the Path of Blades. After countless
years, they remained trapped at the midway point. They were still far
from being able to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Darknorth is
in secluded meditation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope he’ll be
able to improve dramatically as a result.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seven Dragon Gods
stared at the distant Immortal estate as they chatted amongst
themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the Empyrean Gods
on Kilostar Island were focused on that Immortal estate and the
person meditating within it. These Empyrean Gods had all given up
long ago; even Sin and Sealthroat, who were qualified to attempt the
Path of Blades, were far from being able to succeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All their hopes rested
with Ning. They did not, however, dare to give Ning too much overt
pressure…and so they simply hoped silently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They dreamed of
returning to the Three Realms and once more seeing those colorful,
varied worlds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They dreamed of seeing
and reuniting with their loved ones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even though returning
meant that they would be in danger of dying…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They felt no fear!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because there
was something they feared even more than dying; living without hope.
To these Empyrean Gods who had given up, life in Undermoon Lake was
almost zombie-like; there was no hope at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The beautiful Immortal
estate was quite spacious inside. Ning’s sword-training pavilion
was many kilometers in circumference, and the pavilion was studded
with many lustrious gems that gathered in the light and energy of
Heaven and Earth, making it dazzling to behold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed youth,
Ji Ning, was wielding a sword in his hand and executing sword-arts
with it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His sword-light drifted
forward gracefully in an ephemeral, unpredictable manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a sword-art that had
reached the speed of light, the sword-light created by the art was
nothing more than after-images; the sword itself was in front of
those blurs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning had
reached an astonishing level in his sword-arts, his power was
extremely measured and reserved. Ning’s sword-light scraped past a
gourd of wine placed on a nearby table, missing it only by a single
inch, but the gourd didn’t move in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even an ordinary
Houtian-level human who was skilled in the sword would knock the
gourd flying at such a close distance with the wind generated by his
sword. But the power of Ning’s sword was so reserved that it did
not!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that when Loose Immortals, Earth Immortals, and even Celestial
Immortals struck out with their swords, the power of Heaven and Earth
would be unleashed, causing a great disturbance. Even for Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals, being able to infuse their sword with
tremendous destructive power while keeping it so reserved that it
wouldn’t injure anything an inch beyond the target was incredibly
rare!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, however, had
succeeded! His sword-arts had clearly reached the ‘grandmaster’
level in the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light howled
forth, filling the area with an aura of melancholy and despair. Ning
was currently using [Mourning].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As far as despair went,
his greatest moment of despair was when Yu Wei had shattered the
bottle of Shennong’s medicine, then shattered her own soul and
committed suicide! This was because the moment before she had done
this, Ning had been filled with joy, delight, and hope. However,
disaster had suddenly struck. Yu Wei’s actions, followed by her
suicide, had completely struck Ning dumb.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His parents had left.
Yu Wei had then left as well. In that moment…Ning’s heart had
indeed been filled with utter despair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As far as sadness and
pain went…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His saddest, most
agonizing moment was when he had personally consigned Yu Wei into the
Infinity Hells due to his decision. That was the most painful moment
of Ning’s life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was a man of deep,
powerful emotions. Thus, just by viewing the sword-art he was able to
understand more than half of it. Upon actually using it and
practicing with it, he gained many new insights and made nonstop
breakthroughs, the profound secrets of the sword-arts continuously
filling his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nine days after his
attempt at the Path of Blades.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mourning…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although it’s
despair, it’s not utter despair,” Ning murmured to himself within
the courtyard. His heartforce had reached the fourth stage, and so
although he entered a mournful, saddened state whenever he executed
this sword-art, he was able to immediately go back to normal upon
halting in his training. There was no way he would allow a sword-art
to control him and his emotions. But of course, someone whose mental
will wasn’t strong enough might actually go mad if he trained too
excessively in this technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The aura of being
mournful…it perfect this sword-art. Although in terms of
profoundness, this sword-art actually is inferior to the [Five
Treasures], the ‘mournful’ essence it contains seems to give it a
spirit of its own that is linked to it. The sword-art and the essence
aura are a perfect whole, as though they were meant to be together.”
Ning quickly came to this evaluation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Five Treasures]
surpassed the Heavenly Daos themselves; in terms of technique, it was
naturally far superior.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning was
tremendously talented in the Dao of the Sword, the real reason why he
was able to make his sword attack at the speed of light was because
he had the mental strength to be willing to sacrifice all other
insights for the [Five Treasures], making it the foundation of his
techniques. Ning’s own sword-art, the [Brightmoon] sword-art,
didn’t actually have a particularly powerful ‘essence’ or
‘aura’ about it, but it was still quite powerful; clearly, this
was because it had surpassed the [Mourning] sword-art in many ways,
in terms of skill and technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, [Mourning] had
its own strengths as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had an essence, an
intent of its own that was one with the actual techniques. In fact,
the intent of the technique reinforced every single stance, giving it
marvelous power. For example, it was clearly inferior to Ning’s
sword-arts in terms of technique, and yet it too was capable of
reaching the speed of light! In fact, in many areas it was superior!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for intent…if the
intent of this sword-art could be further strengthened, it was
completely capable of gaining a true ‘soul’ of its own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ordinary humans had
three types of energy within them; their ‘vital energy’, their
‘ki’, and their ‘soul’. For a sword-art to merely have an
‘intent’ wasn’t that impressive; when a sword-art gained a true
‘soul’, it would truly rise to a new level…the fifth level of
swordforce. Upon reaching that level, even without actually drawing
the sword, one would be able to cause major powers to feel despair in
their hearts and perhaps even flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, actually
reaching the fifth stage of swordforce was far too difficult. In the
entire Three Realms, the number of experts in either camp who had
reached this level could be counted on one hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Mourning]
sword-art…I’ve mastered it,” Ning mused to himself. “If I
were to challenge the Path of Blades again, I trust I would be able
to defeat the ninth guardian. But the tenth? I’m probably not
strong enough yet!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The best solution is
to merge [Mourning] and [Brightmoon] together, giving my [Brightmoon]
sword-art an intent of its own as well,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Brightmoon]
sword-art was derived from the essence of the [Five Treasures]; even
though it didn’t have a will or an intent of its own, it was still
on the same level as [Mourning]. Once it truly gained an intent of
its own, it would vault to a completely new level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“By then, I’ll be
able to effortlessly defeat the ninth guardian. As for the tenth
guardian…I’ll have a chance as well.” Ning nodded slowly. “Then
let me first perfect [Brightmoon].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Brightmoon] was
something that Ning had created himself and had been constantly
perfecting. Now that he had mastered [Mourning], he was going to
infuse the intent and will of [Mourning] into [Brightmoon]. Although
this was going to be difficult, it was something he would be able to
do.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If [Brightmoon] was a
technique which someone else had created, it would have been
impossible for Ning to do this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was just another
example of how creating one’s own sword-technique could make a huge
difference.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My heart is in
mourning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My will is in my
sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let them both become
one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning completely
understood the profound mysteries of [Mourning]. Using it as his
blueprint, Ning began to infuse its intent into [Brightmoon]. Even
though he encountered some problematic issues, given enough time he
would be able to break through them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After a year and three
months in seclusion, Ji Ning finally walked out of his Immortal
estate.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_30___Sword_Art_Mastered"></A>
Chapter 30 - Sword-Art Mastered
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One year and three
months. More than two hundred Empyrean Gods had been watching Ji
Ning’s Immortal estate during this period of time, but Ning had
remained in seclusion, not emerging. None of them dared to enter and
disturb him, but every day there were many Empyrean Gods who were
watching his estate. To these Empyrean Gods who had lost almost all
hope, Ning was the only hope remaining.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He came out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth came out”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as Ning emerged
from his estate, other Empyrean Gods immediately noticed it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning first waved his
hand to collect his Immortal estate, then walked towards the group of
Empyrean Gods and used his divine power to say mentally, “Fellow
Empyrean Gods, there is something I would discuss with all of you.”
Instantly, Empyrean God Sin, Empyrean God Sealthroat, and the others
all emerged from their own Immortal estates. Soon, all of the
Empyrean Gods were gathered here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My fellow Empyrean
Gods, I gained certain insights during this meditation session and
improved significantly,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, all of the
two hundred-plus Empyrean Gods grew excited. In fact, some even began
to softly mumble to themselves. To them…escaping this place was
more important than life and death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am completely
confident of being able to defeat the ninth guardian. However…I
can’t make the same claim when it comes to the tenth guardian,”
Ning said. “However…I will definitely make it to the tenth
guardian on this attempt through the Path of Blades. Are you all
willing to join me on this trip?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course we are.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Willing, willing!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Darknorth, you truly are formidable. It’s only been a year, but
you’ve improved so dramatically.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re all
willing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean Gods all
hurriedly assented in unison with excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wasn’t surprised
that all the other Empyrean Gods were going to accompany him. They
had chosen to give up long ago, after all! But when Sin and
Sealthroat actually spoke out as well, Ning couldn’t help but ask,
“Sin, Sealthroat, are the two of you sure you want to follow me?
You’ve already made it this far in Kilostar Island; you are only
one step away from freedom.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That step is simply
too long a step to take.” Sealthroat shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Both of us
gave up long ago,” Sin said with a laugh. “We couldn’t even
match up to Ninedawn and Greatdream, and it’s been a long, long
time since we’ve improved at all. Based on our experiences during
the Primordial Era, for us not to improve at all despite the passage
of so many years means that we’ve probably reached our limit.
There’s no way for us to improve any further. If we don’t go with
you, we will probably be trapped here forever, unable to escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sealthroat nodded as
well. “Darknorth, you said it yourself; nowadays, fewer and fewer
people will be willing to enter Undermoon Lake, and the number that
can reach Kilostar Island will be smaller still. If we don’t go
with you, we probably won’t see another new Empyrean God here at
Kilostar Island for the next trillion years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded,
understanding their feelings. “Alright. If that’s the case, then
let’s have everyone follow me. I don’t dare to claim complete
confidence, but I’ll definitely work hard.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These Empyrean Gods
hadn’t imagined that their opportunity would come so quickly. After
initially experiencing excitement and nervousness, they quickly
collected their Immortal estates and allowed Ning to collect them
without fighting back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In midair. Ning stared
down at Kilostar Island. Previously, it had been extremely bustling
and lively, but now it was completely silent. All the Empyrean Gods
had departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My [Brightmoon] has
advanced by yet another level. This is the perfect time to find
someone to test it against.” Ning transformed into a streak of
light, flying far off towards the horizon. He soon arrived at the
borders of Kilostar Island, then flew forward while following the
floating wooden bridge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He advanced forward,
through the Path of Blades. He reached the place he retreated from
last time, then stared at the ninth guardian who was seated in the
lotus position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You came.” The
golden-robed youth looked at Ning, his eyes filled with an aura of
despair. “I’ve waited quite some time. I hope you won’t
disappoint me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After speaking, the
golden-robed youth rose to his feet, a pair of swords appearing in
his hands. He said calmly, “You already had a chance to view the
sword-art last time. This time, let’s just fight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning also knew that
each person was only given a single chance to view each sword-art. If
you failed at the Path of Blades, you would be allowed to try again,
but you would never be able to view the sword-art again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” A pair
of twin swords appeared in Ning’s hands as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two quickly charged
towards each other, and sword-light began to howl through the air.
The golden-robed youth’s sword-arts were incredibly fast. Although
they seemed to be filled with endless mourning and despair, they were
also incredibly deadly and vicious. As for the two streaks of
sword-light in Ning’s hands, they transformed into a pair of black
holes that completely blocked out the golden-robed youth’s attacks.
Every so often, Ning was even able to launch a counter-attack or two.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is defense the only
thing you can do?” While attacking, the golden-robed youth barked
at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First break through
my defense, then talk.” Ning was very calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To him, the ninth
guardian was merely someone he was going to gain further experience
from. Ning wanted to see what the differences were between his own
mastered [Mourning] and [Mourning] as wielded by the ninth guardian.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This battle went on for
a full hour.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ninth guardian
revealed all of his abilities for Ning to see, and as a result Ning
was able to discover a few imperfections in his own mastery of
[Mourning]. When cultivating in a type of sword-arts, every person
would put their own distinctive twists on it, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to finish it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword-light
suddenly changed as he went from defending to attacking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light howled
forth with incredible, extraordinary speed, seeming to cover the
skies with its might. The ninth guardian was so startled he
immediately used [Three Heads, Six Arms]. Ning, however, did the
same. An infinite amount of sword-light seemed to blast forward like
an inexhaustible, seamless flow of water, carrying an aura and intent
of mournfulness within it. In but a single breath’s worth of time,
the ninth guardian was knocked flying backwards. He fell onto the
ground, rolling over several times before managing to clamber back to
his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You win.” The
ninth guardian grinned. “Darknorth, the only one standing between
you and escape is the final guardian, the tenth guardian. Be
careful.” After speaking, he vanished into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning grinned as well.
When he used full power, his opponent had only been able to just
barely hold on for a breath’s worth of time. Ning was quite
satisfied with this result.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! He advanced
deeper into the Path of Blades at incredible speed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sky was completely
dark in this part of the path. The countless titanic spears, blades,
and swords that were jutting out from the ice on each side of the
wooden bridge were glowing with dim light. Without their light, it
would probably be completely pitch-black here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How odd,” Ning
mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, a black-robed
youth appeared in the distance. He was seated in the lotus position,
and when Ning arrived he opened his eyes to look towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those eyes…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They contained a
deathly silence within them. They seemed to have no life within them
at all, just utter despair, enough to freeze one’s heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“View the sword-art,”
the black-robed youth said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned his head to
look at the sword-art which had appeared on the nearby giant sword.
As with before, the entire sword-art was displayed from start to
finish, from simple to complex. As Ning watched, he began to feel
stunned. Even after watching three times, Ning didn’t recover from
his dazed state.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough.” The
black-robed youth rose to his feet, a pair of swords appearing in his
hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning came back to his
senses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is this
sword-art?” Ning immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The name of this
sword-art is Seversoul!” The black-robed youth replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seversoul?
Seversoul…? The name is just like the sword-art itself…it really
does sever the soul.” Utter agony filled Ning’s heart when he
just visualized that sword-art. He knew, however, that there was no
way for him to truly master this sword-art, because the essence and
intent of this sword-art was the ruination of the soul that would
come when one experienced true, absolute, eternal despair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, had no
way of forcing himself to feel this sort of absolute despair! The
techniques of this sword-art were also far superior to that of the
[Mourning] sword-art; in fact, it was no weaker than Ning’s own
[Brightmoon] sword-art. It was only surpassed by the [Five Treasures]
sword-art itself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come,” the
black-robed youth said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, swords
appearing in his hands as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their two figures
became blurred as they started to fight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two mighty sword-arts.
One was filled with the intent of mourning, its sword-light flowing
out in a consecutive stream. It had been created by distilling the
essence of [Five Treasures], [Mourning], and many other techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other was filled
with the essence of a ruined soul and utter despair. Its profoundness
and marvelousness came from the creator of Undermoon Lake, who had
intended it. Although it was different from the [Five Treasures], it
was also quite shocking and brilliant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two continuously
battled, advancing and retreating.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They actually fought to
a complete standstill. Both sword-arts had their own strengths; both
could be described as having reached the apex of skill possible for
the fourth stage of swordforce. If their swords moved any faster,
they would have surpassed the limits of the Heavenly Daos. If the
intent of their swords was any deeper and stronger, they would have
reached the Sword God stage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So the sword can
actually be used in a way like this.” Ning had viewed this
sword-art three times prior to this. Upon seeing how the tenth
guardian actually wielded this sword-art, he instantly gained a much
deeper understanding of some of its mysteries. New insights regarding
the [Seversoul] sword-art began to fill his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was an intrinsic
difference between Ning and the tenth guardian.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tenth guardian was
only capable of unleashing this single sword-art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, was
capable of learning from the tenth guardian and fusing what he
learned into his own [Brightmoon] sword-art. Although the learning
process resulted in him occasionally being put at a disadvantage,
Ning’s overall level of power was slowly, steadily beginning to
rise. His sword-art became even more unpredictable and ephemeral, and
it became faster and more powerful as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The battle continued
for a day…two days…three days…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Neither side used any
divine abilities. They were solely competing in sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The insights Ning had
gained into this sword-art were merging together nonstop in his mind,
then inspiring him further. This sort of feeling, the feeling of of
nonstop improvement, was quite intoxicating…but he had still
essentially reached the limit possible for him at his current level
of sword-arts. Any improvements he was now able to make would be
minute. He would at most be able to put the tenth guardian at a
disadvantage, but the tenth guardian would still be able to launch
occasional counterattacks as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was suddenly
stunned, and his sword-light turned sluggish for a moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! A streak of
sword-light crashed against his body, knocking him flying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why did you stop?”
The tenth guardian stood there, a frown on his face. Ning’s
sword-art was clearly on a slightly higher level than his. If they
continued to fight without Ning making any improvements at all, he
would’ve permitted Ning to go into the fifth island. However, he
could sense that Ning was still slowly improving, and his sword-arts
were slowly transforming. Thus, he didn’t stop the fight and
instead continued to battle against Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because the
purpose of Path of Blades was to temper and train Empyrean Gods. If
Ji Ning was still improving, then of course the guardian wasn’t
going to halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning had suddenly
come to a halt…this puzzled the tenth guardian.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there atop
the wooden bridge, a dazed look in his eyes. In his mind,
however…there was a disturbance that felt like Pangu cleaving apart
Heaven and Earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Seversoul]
sword-art worked in a way that was completely different from the
[Five Treasures] sword-art. Ning’s [Brightmoon] was derived from
the essence of the [Five Treasures], and so as Ning gained more and
more insight into [Seversoul] and began to fuse it with the essence
of the [Five Treasures] within [Brightmoon]…with a boom, he
suddenly understood. He blew through the last bottleneck preventing
him from mastering the [Five Treasures].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prior to this, it was
as though a thin curtain of mist had been preventing him from seeing
the final parts of it clearly. But now…Ning broke straight through
that final barrier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Five
Treasures]…” Ning shut his eyes, the many profound mysteries
within his mind rapidly beginning to join together. All of the
insights he had gained into the [Five Treasures] were merging into a
perfect whole at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had mastered the
entire [Five Treasures]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no doubt
about it, no questions left in his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So this…this is
what it means to surpass the Heavenly Daos.” Ning opened his eyes
to stare at the dark skies surrounding him. He lightly flicked out
with a finger, and it seemed to create a ripple as though it had
touched something.
</P>

Chapter 31 - The Fifth Island
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, Ji Ning
always believed the Heavenly Daos to be the rules by which the Three
Realms operated. To surpass the Heavenly Daos would therefore mean
breaking through of the control and functioning of the Three Realms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now, upon making
the actual breakthrough and fully comprehending the [Five Treasures],
Ning truly understand what it really meant to surpass the limits of
the Heavenly Daos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heavenly Daos…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They weren’t just the
Heavenly Daos of the Three Realms. They were the Heavenly Daos that
existed in all places!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Pangu Chaosworld
and the Seamless Chaosworld all had Heavenly Daos that belonged to
them. Every single chaosworld had Heavenly Daos that differed from
each other! Even within the endless primordial chaos itself, the
Heavenly Dao of Primordial Chaos was omnipresent, including places
such as Undermoon Lake, Prisonworld 17, or the Void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An invisible layer of
laws permeated and covered the primordial chaos and everything within
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These laws laid out
many restrictions; for example, the fastest speed possible was the
speed of light! Time could only go forward, not backwards! The
so-called ‘temporal inveresion’ spell was nothing more than a way
to view the past; it didn’t actually cause time itself to reverse!
There were also restrictions on how powerful thunder, fire, wind,
water, and other things could be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were laws. They
were shackles that had been placed on every single creature and
being. It was thanks to these shackles that the various chaosworlds
could function in a stable, coherent manner. Without them, the likes
of the Pangu Chaosworld and the Seamless Chaosworld may well have
exploded and been destroyed long before colliding into each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were countless
living creatures in the universe, and some of the most dazzling
figures were capable of shattering these shackles and reaching a
higher level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now…Ji Ning’s sword
had broken through the shackle on speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Invisible laws.
Invisible shackles. They exist everywhere.” When Ning flicked out
with his finger, it actually moved faster than the speed of light,
resulting in an interaction with those invisible shackles of law. If
he hadn’t truly broken through, he wouldn’t even be able to sense
those shackles at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even the major
powers are under the control of the Heavenly Daos of the Three
Realms. Only people like Mother Nuwa have truly ascended beyond the
Heavenly Daos.” Ning sighed to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chaos Immortals and
World Gods had all used raw, overwhelming power to burst through
those shackles and ascend to a new level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was very far from
that level for now; he was only able to transcend in terms of the
speed of his sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In terms of sword
speed…I stand at the pinnacle of the entire Three Realms!” Ning
mused to himself, “And in sword-arts…I should be ranked amongst
the top three.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Who was the number one
Sword Immortal of the Three Realms?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a matter that
had always been under contention.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Fuju had been
publicly acknowledged by everyone in the Three Realms as the number
one Sword Immortal, but he had died. Right now, many venerated
Daofather Holyflame. Daofather Holyflame was actually just like Ning;
he had only reached the fourth stage of swordforce, but had mastered
the [Five Treasures]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were still a few
other major powers in the Three Realms who had reached the fifth
stage of swordforce. However, although fifth-stage swordforce was
capable of unleashing astonishing power and dazzling skill, it was
still constrained in speed by the Heavenly Daos to be merely as fast
as the speed of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the difference in
speed was too great, all the technique in the world would be useless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Holyflame
clearly had ‘just’ fourth-stage swordforce, but there were still
many experts who believed him to be the number one Sword Immortal of
the Three Realms. It was simply that there were some who would still
dispute it. As for the likes of incredibly powerful figures such as
Swordfather Darklight of the Three Realms, they had reached the fifth
level of swordforce, but none would say that he was the number one
Sword Immortal of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The essence of the
sword lay in the word ‘speed’, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Take the simplest
possible motion; a direct stab. If it was launched faster than the
speed of light, its power would become ridiculously great. Enemies
would find it hard to even block such attack. Speed was where the
true essence of the sword lay!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Dongbin had felt
that Ning was a born Sword Immortal, while Patriarch Subhuti viewed
Ning with tremendous favor, but neither of the two would have ever
imagined that in just three hundred short years, Ning’s sword-arts
would rise to such a level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason why Ning
could advance so rapidly was primarily due to the tempering effect of
being within Undermoon Lake. Ning’s other clones in the Three
Realms were also working on the [Five Treasures], but they were
incredibly far off from being able to master it! Clearly, this
special environment and these life-and-death challenges brought
results that were completely different from one quietly training on
one’s own. In the Three Realms, there were no sword-arts like
[Mourning] or [Seversoul] to help guide the way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I can reach the
fifth stage of swordforce, I would become the undisputed number one
Sword Immortal of the Three Realms.” Ning’s heart was filled with
excitement, but he also knew that reaching the fifth stage of
swordforce would probably not be much easier than reaching the fifth
stage of heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tenth guardian
stared at Ji Ning making a gesture with his finger. His face couldn’t
help but change as he murmured softly to himself, “…Surpassed the
limits of the Heavenly Daos?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sorry to keep you
waiting.” Ning smiled as he walked over. He was in an excellent
mood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had increased in
power dramatically, which meant that he would be able to better steer
his own destiny within this great storm. In addition, he would be
bringing out more than two hundred Empyrean Gods with him, and Ning
knew exactly how badly they all wanted to leave this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s see how
powerful you’ve become.” With a swoosh, the tenth guardian
transformed into a streak of light and attacked Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to amble
forward slowly, seeming to feel that he had matters under perfect
control. No matter how marvelous his foe’s sword-art was, its speed
was still constrained by the Heavenly Daos. When the enemy’s streak
of sword-light closed in on him, Ning simply reached out with his
right sword, sending it forward in a viperous strike. This was an
extremely simple but incredibly fast stab.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Brightmoon] sword-art,
Blood Drop stance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tenth guardian
attempted to block, but Ning’s sword-light still managed to scrape
past the defending sword and stab the tenth guardian’s forehead.
The tenth guardian’s head was pushed backwards as he was knocked
into the air before stabilizing himself and once more landing on the
ground. A very complicated look was on the tenth guardian’s face,
and he mumbled to himself, “He surpassed the limits. He has indeed
surpassed the limits. A sword as fast as this…how are you supposed
to block it? There’s no way to block it at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once one’s swordforce
reached the fifth stage, one’s sword-arts would also become
incredibly marvelous…and yet, compared to fourth-stage swordforce
combined with the [Five Treasures], it was still inferior.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was due to a
single word: Speed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This word was enough to
cause countless experts to feel despair, enough to cause even major
powers to be willing to abandon all their other Daos to train in the
[Five Treasures].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve won.” The
tenth guardian looked at Ning, a hint of anticipation in his dead
eyes. “This sword-art…is it the [Five Treasures] of your Three
Realms?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve heard of
the [Five Treasures] as well?” Ning was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those Empyrean Gods
in Undermoon Lake often spoke of it.” The tenth guardian looked at
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, it’s the
[Five Treasures].” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tenth guardian had
a very complicated look on his face. Sighing, he said, “I guard the
Path of Blades and am a master of many sword-arts, spear-arts,
saber-arts, and other combat arts. But not one of them has surpassed
the limits of the Heavenly Daos. To lose to you…I willingly
acknowledge my defeat.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are the guardian
for all of the weapons?” Ning was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course. The other
nine guardians you encountered were actually all me as well.” The
tenth guardian laughed. “However, each time I’ll only use a
single type of sword-art. Enough…you’ve won. You can now go to
the fifth island. Once you go there, you’ll be allowed to leave
Undermoon Lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” The tenth
guardian smiled, then disappeared without a trace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The surrounding
darkness vanished as well, allowing the bright moon to once more
appear in the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he
transformed into a streak of light and advanced forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After flying for
roughly an hour, he was vaguely able to make out an enormous,
beautiful island up ahead. This island was studded with miniature
lakes that were dazzling to behold. Some of the lakes seemed to be
formed from flames, some were filled with golden light, some were
filled with red light, and some were jade-green.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All sorts of lights
sparkled and flashed, making it truly look like an Immortal realm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the end of the
wooden bridge stood a gray-robed, silver-haired man who was smiling
at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Upon seeing
the distant silver-haired man, Ning was quite puzzled. “He…doesn’t
seem to be a living creature.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the final
lake in Undermoon Lake, ‘Moonfall’.” The silver-haired man
smiled as he looked at Ning. “Empyrean God Darknorth, you are the
second Empyrean God to overcome the Path of Blades and reach this
location…and your power is even greater than Jueming’s was. But
enough of that…come, follow me. I’ll take you to the treasures.
This will be the last place where you can choose a treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He was
allowed to choose three items from each of the final three islands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just a short while
later, he finished making his choice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had already
searched the memories of the prisoners of Pangaea, and he knew the
value of the treasures before him. He knew which treasures the major
powers of the Three Realms would drool over. Ning had no need of
them, but he would be able to give them to allied major powers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hand over the
treasures of Empyrean Gods Sin and Sealthroat,” the silver-haired
man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here, take.” Ning
had already prepared them. He handed them over, then said in a
puzzled manner, “Is there no need to hand over the treasures of
Empyrean Gods Greatdream and Ninedawn?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Greatdream had killed
Ninedawn, while Ning himself had killed Greatdream. All the treasures
were thus in his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The treasures of
those you killed belong to you, of course.” The silver-haired man
continued, “Follow me to a place. Afterwards, you’ll be able to
leave Undermoon Lake.”

Chapter 32 - Lifeblood Oath
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning secretly sighed
to himself. So the items of those he killed belonged to him? Clearly,
Undermoon Lake didn’t forbid internecine warfare. Perhaps this sort
of internal struggle was an even more grueling and cruel form of
tempering for the survivors. In truth, the sea yaksha alone had slain
thousands of Empyrean Gods. From this, one could tell that Undermoon
Lake’s process of selection was innately brutal to begin with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning followed the
silver-haired man forward through the fifth island, Moonfall Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moonfall Island
emanated an aura of shockingly great age.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other four islands
were all quite ordinary, but Ning had the sense that this island was
different. It seemed as though this island contained an inconceivable
type of power within it that was easily capable of obliterating him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The major power who
created Undermoon Lake…he went through tremendous effort to select
and train Empyrean Gods. Why?” Ning mused to himself, “Does he
merely want to temper us, then release us? Not very likely. There has
to be an important reason behind it all. Mmm…let me go to the final
area first. I’ll be able to leave afterwards, which means that this
final area will make everything clear.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later, Ning and
the silver-haired man winded their way through a mountain path,
arriving at the mountain peak. At the very top of this peak was a
palace that was built from seemingly ordinary-looking rocks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is Moonfall
Shrine.” The silver-haired man pointed towards the shrine before
them. It looked ordinary; in fact, it looked rather old, ragged, and
in bad shape. However, despite it’s seemingly poor condition, it
was actually the heart of the entire Moonfall Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In front of the shrine,
there was a stone tablet that shone with golden light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Move all of the
Empyrean Gods you brought with you to this place,” the
silver-haired man instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded, then willed it. Instantly, a large group of figures appeared
around him. It was the two hundred-plus Empyrean Gods. Sin,
Sealthroat, the Seven Dragon Gods, and the rest all stared curiously
around them. Quite a few of them revealed looks of surprise and joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This isn’t
Kilostar Island.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a new
island.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This has to be the
fifth island. We are going to leave! We’ll be able to leave!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean Gods
instantly grew excited. They also noticed Darknorth and the
silver-haired man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, this is
the fifth island, right?” One of the Empyrean Gods called out to
him, and the others all looked towards him as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled and nodded.
“This is the fifth island, Moonfall Island.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, in the
future, if there’s anything you need, just say the word. Even if it
costs me my life, I won’t shy back!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, some
thanks cannot be expressed with words.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean Gods were
all quite excited. Some of them were actually crying. To them, it was
as though Ning had given them a second life. All of them were
Empyrean Gods…they would naturally remember the debts they owed
others. If Ning asked them to help in the future and they refused, it
would negatively impact their Dao-hearts. Only a small number of
truly demonic, fiendish figures were capable of ignoring the debts
they owed others without having their Dao-hearts being affected at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough,” the
silver-haired man said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A surge of invisible
power swept out from the shrine. It was like an invisible palm that
slapped down upon the bodies of the Empyrean Gods. All of them were
flattened into the ground, with only Ning being unaffected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at this
scene, stupefied. The Empyrean Gods were completely scared senseless
as well. This was two terrifying! There were more than two hundred of
them, but they had been smacked into the ground without being able to
resist at all…and this was not simply a forceful strike of raw
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If it was a forceful
strike of raw power, the Empyrean Gods would have been drilled into
the ground like nails, leaving behind deep holes. But instead, all of
them were knocked prone, face-down into the ground. Clearly, in that
moment, they were as weak as mortals against this sort of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The major power who
created Undermoon Lake truly was formidable. His abilities are beyond
what I can imagine,” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The only reason you
are able to leave is because you followed Darknorth,” the
silver-haired man said calmly. “Now…each of you shall go
one-by-one and place your palms atop the golden stone tablet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” “Yes.”
“Yes…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments ago, the
Empyrean Gods had all been extremely excited. But now, they were all
incredibly nervous and cautious, not daring to act rashly for fear of
losing their lives.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Sin was at
the very front, and so he was the first to step forward and press his
hand against the golden stone tablet. In the instant that he did so,
his body completely froze and became unmoving. This sight caused all
the Empyrean Gods to grow nervous. Ning, upon seeing this, became
nervous as well…but worrying was of no use. The aura emitting from
the shrine alone was enough to effortlessly murder him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-haired man
gave Ning a glance. He could sense Ning’s worry, and so he said
calmly, “Don’t worry. He’s fine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After roughly ten
breaths worth of time, Sin finally regained consciousness. He
retracted his palm, a look of disbelief flashing over his face as he
stared at the golden stone tablet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Beat it!” The
silver-haired man snapped.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sin finally came back
to his senses and hurriedly stepped back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Next!” The
silver-haired man instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the other
Empyrean Gods were quite uneasy, they had no choice but to go
forward. Sin said to them, “It’s fine. There’s no danger.”
Only then did the Empyrean Gods feel slightly less nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single Empyrean
God went forward in turn, pressing their hands on the stone tablet.
Each of them froze for ten seconds before regaining consciousness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After a long period of
time passed, all of the Empyrean Gods finished touching the golden
stone tablet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Put them all away.”
The silver-haired man looked towards Ning. Upon hearing his words,
Sin and the others let out sighs of relief. Ning waved his hand, once
more drawing the Empyrean Gods into his Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Darknorth, you go as
well. Place your hand atop the tablet,” the silver-haired man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning walked forward,
gently resting his hand against the golden stone tablet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A surge of invisible
power filled his mind and his soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I swear on my very
life itself…” No longer under his control, Ning’s soul began to
swear an oath on its own. However, Ning remained fully aware of what
was happening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This…this was a
lifeblood oath!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Life oaths were very
complicated. Not just anyone could simply speak a life oath. For
example, in the Three Realms, there were no major powers who could
force themselves to swear lifeblood oaths! Generally speaking, only
Chaos Immortals and World Gods would perhaps be capable of
voluntarily making themselves swear lifeblood oaths. Aside from them,
all others would need to rely on special objects.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the chaos-kingdom of
Pangaea, the largest clans and sects would generally have a treasure
similar to this golden stone tablet, which would be used to force the
sect disciples to involuntarily swear lifeblood oaths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once a lifeblood oath
was sworn, there would be no way for the oath-swearer to divulge any
secrets that he was sworn to secrecy about.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, when Ning
tried to soulscour some of them, he discovered that some of their
thought-bubbles with divine abilities and techniques within them were
covered by countless complicated runes. There was simply no way to
see inside those memories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no way to
violate a lifeblood oath whatsoever!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning came back to his
senses, then stared at the golden stone tablet. He said softly, “No
wonder Buddha Jueming only gave a bit of information regarding some
of the treasures, but was completely silent regarding Undermoon Lake.
So it was due to this lifeblood oath.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lifeblood oaths could
be used to strictly restrict any and all information from being
spread about something.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for items like
Iceheart Leafs, they weren’t unique to Undermoon Lake. They existed
in the outside world as well, which was why it was permitted to
discuss them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After you leave, you
won’t be able to discuss most things pertaining to Undermoon Lake,
but you will be permitted to recommend that more Empyrean Gods
enter,” the silver-haired man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“More enter?” Ning
secretly shook his head. Impossible. The chances of surviving
Undermoon Lake were far too low. This sort of ‘training’ and
‘tempering’ was utterly terrifying, despite its effectiveness.
Ning had indeed made it out alive, but he didn’t feel confident
that others would be able to similarly survive it. In addition, the
Three Realms were facing a major calamity; hundreds of Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals, when joined together into a formation, were as
strong as a Daofather! At a time like this, there was no way he would
possibly work to convince more Empyrean Gods to enter this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. Enter the
shrine,” the silver-haired man said with a smile. “After you
leave it, I’ll deliver you away from Undermoon Lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
immediately walked towards it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The shrine was ancient
and tattered, but the aura of power it had emanated earlier had made
Ning understand that it wasn’t as simple as it looked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He stepped through the
doorway.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Upon
entering, Ning swept the place with his gaze. This shrine truly was
too simple and plain. It was completely empty, with almost nothing
inside it. There were stone pillars and stone walls, but no
decorations or furnishings of any kind. The shrine was just a few
hundred meters long, and he was able to see every corner of it
clearly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a blurry,
deep azure light emerged from every part of the shrine. Every single
rock emanated this aura of deep azure light, and the countless rays
of light swirled around Ning’s body. Soon, a ‘cocoon’ of deep
azure light had appeared within the shrine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-haired man
watched quietly from outside. A hint of a smile appeared on his face
as he murmured softly to himself, “I hope you won’t disappoint
Master.”
</P>

Chapter 33 - Transmission
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wrapped within that
cocoon of deep azure light, Ji Ning shut his eyes. It was as though
he was asleep. A surge of enormous power was currently being
transmitted straight into his soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I swear on my very
life itself that within a thousand years of becoming an Elder God, I
must leave the Three Realms. I must reach ‘Vastheaven Palace’
within a chaos cycle and inform a Welcomer of Vastheaven Palace that
World God Northrest was slain by the three Wujiao Godbeasts.”
Ning’s soul was no longer his control as he was forced to swear yet
another lifeblood oath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This caused Ning to
feel quite irritated. This sort of sensation, of being forced to
swear a lifeblood oath, was extremely unpleasant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning instantly
realized the real purpose behind the creation of Undermoon Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“World God?” Ning
mused to himself, “The creator of Undermoon Lake was actually a
World God. However…he seems to have died.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This lifeblood oath
isn’t that bad. I have to leave within a thousand years of becoming
an Elder God, but I’m a long way off from that level. And I have a
full chaos cycle to reach Vastheaven Palace. However…where exactly
is it? What type of a place is it?” Ning was quite puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he had
soulscoured the memories of the prisoners inside Prisonworld 17, he
had never before heard of this ‘Vastheaven Palace’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, judging from
the lifeblood oath he had just been forced to swear, World God
Northrest had to be a member of Vastheaven Palace! He was killed but
wanted to find someone to send a message, which meant that Vastheaven
Palace should be powerful enough to take revenge for him! But of
course, this was just logical reasoning; it was also possible that
other stories were hidden within this seemingly-simple message.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as Ning was
pondering this question, an enormous amount of information began to
flood into Ning’s soul. Ning was instantly sent into a half-dazed
state, as the enormous flood of information made it almost impossible
for him to think.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After six full hours,
Ning finally regained his consciousness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, still within that
tattered-looking shrine, finally regained his freedom and mobility.
The cocoon of azure light that had wrapped around him had completely
vanished. Ning just stood there blankly, not moving at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First the stick,
then the carrot?” Ning muttered to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had first been
forced to swear a lifeblood oath, but then he was given the real
reward. Two major techniques now existed within Ning’s memories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first was a
Fiendgod Body Refining technique, [Forlorn World God]. The second was
a divine ability, [Nine Elements Annihilation]. Both were for
Fiendgod Body Refiners to train in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, the creator
of Undermoon Lake, World God Northrest, was himself a Fiendgod Body
Refiner. This naturally meant that he was more skilled in this
respect, which was why he only permitted Empyrean Gods to enter this
place. Empyrean Gods were more moldable; those who had relied on
other techniques to become True Gods would be much less moldable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Forlorn World God] was
a technique that was unfathomably superior to the [Crimsonbright
Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. It was an extremely detailed and
exquisite technique that could guide someone all the way to becoming
a World God!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, just
having the technique wasn’t enough; actually training in it was the
key part. For example, even though Ning had the [Crimsonbright
Diagram of the Nine Heavens], he had yet to break through to become a
True God. But no matter what…this unfathomably profound Fiendgod
Body Refining technique pointed out with tremendous clarity a path
for Ning to walk. There was simply an enormous difference between a
profound technique and a simple technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, a person
who perhaps only had a 1% chance of becoming a True God when training
in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] might have a 10%
chance of reaching that level when training in [Forlorn World God].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empyrean God. True
God. Elder God. World God.” Ning was filled with eagerness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the other
technique, it was a divine ability. [Nine Elements Annihilation].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an extremely
old divine ability that was spread throughout the primordial chaos.
Meant for Fiendgods to train in, one could say that it’s power was
quite ordinary…but one could also say that its power was almost
limitless!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason for this was
because the [Nine Elements Annihilation] involved a total of nine
fundamental, basic elemental runes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These elemental runes
were very simple, like the basic strokes in Chinese characters; a
dot, a slash, a vertical line, etc. But those simple strokes could
came together to form the words for a word, the words could come
together to form a language, and the language could give birth to
profound idioms, poems, songs, and novels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The same was true for
this divine ability, the [Nine Elements Annihilation].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These nine elemental
runes could join together in countless ways, forming increasingly
complicated and increasingly perfect divine tattoos!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, the
foundation of the [Starseizing Hand] was its Starseizing Tattoos. As
for these nine elemental runes, their potential for growth was nearly
limitless, as they could be joined together in increasingly
complicated, profound, and powerful divine tattoos, which would be
used to unleash divine power to execute divine abilities.
Theoretically, the power of these runes could allow this divine
ability to surpass the [Starseizing Hand] and countless other divine
abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This ‘unlimited
power’ was only in theory. For example, there were countless people
throughout human history who had learned Chinese characters, but
almost none had been able to master it to the level of writing poems
and stories that would be passed down for generations. The same
principle was true for the [Nine Elements Annihilation]; it was
extremely widespread amongst the powerful experts of the primordial
chaos, but very, very few were actually able to develop truly
outstanding divine tattoos based on it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although it will be
hard, based on the description that I saw, quite a few World Gods
within the primordial chaos use and train in this technique,” Ning
mused to himself. “This is a key. A key that will allow me to
potentially unlock and develop a truly dazzling divine ability.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“World God Northrest
truly went to great lengths.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The refining
technique is one that can allow my power to rise nonstop, while the
divine ability theoretically has no limit to its maximum combat
power. The more talented one is, the more powerful this divine
ability will become.” Ning was extremely moved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-haired man
was still standing outside the shrine. When Ning walked outside, the
silver-haired man said with a smile, “Now that you have these two
techniques, you are different from all other living creatures within
the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You knew?” Ning
frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master died, leaving
all the matters within Moonfall Island to me to control. Of course I
know,” the silver-haired man said with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then I ask you…where
is Vastheaven Palace?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t know.”
The silver-haired man shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You don’t know?”
Ning was puzzled. “Was your master World God Northrest? Was he the
creator of Undermoon Lake? Was he from Vastheaven Palace?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-haired man
nodded. “My master was indeed World God Northrest, and he was one
of the top-tier World Gods within the primordial chaos. If it hadn’t
been due to the three Wujiao Godbeasts joining together and trapping
him, how could he have died? He was caught in a trap and surrounded,
nearly dying in body and soul. Just a tiny bit of his soul managed to
escape, and he plunged through one dangerous region after another,
eventually ending up here. Because of all the dangerous regions he
went through as he fled, not even he himself knew the path back to
his original sect. This the reason why Master gave you a full chaos
cycle in the lifeblood oath for you to find Vastheaven Palace. That’s
a tremendous amount of time! If you aren’t able to find it in a
full chaos cycle and end up being devoured by your oath, you have no
one to blame but yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was quite calm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A full chaos cycle!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That was the amount of
time needed for an ordinary chaosworld to be born and then perish. It
was countless trillions of years! He had only lived for a bit more
than three hundred years. He felt no pressure at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After Master reached
this place, he used the remainder of his strength to build Undermoon
Lake,” the silver-haired man said with a cold laugh. “You should
be able to tell how powerful my master had been. Even the small
amount of power he had left was equal to the amount of power an
ordinary World God would have.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He understood now.
World God Northrest came from Vastheaven Palace and was a figure of
incredible power…but disaster struck and he fled with heavy
injuries. Unwilling to just die like that, he had created Undermoon
Lake as a place to choose a suitable Empyrean God to send a message
to his comrades for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fortunately, World
God Northrest didn’t force me to swear an oath to take revenge for
him,” Ning chuckled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You?” The
silver-haired man shook his head and sneered, “The three Wujiao
Godbeasts are three Godbeasts that were born from the primordial
chaos with the power of Elder Gods. Later on, thanks to many
fortuitous experiences over their countless years of roaming through
the primordial chaos, they all reached the World God level. When they
join together, they are a match for even my master; how could someone
like you possibly kill them? All you need to do is deliver the
message. When you do that, my master’s many friends will take
revenge for him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. Fine,
then. Northrest, the three Wujiao Godbeasts…all of that was very
distant from him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is Vastheaven Palace
very powerful?” Ning asked curiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It…should be.”
The silver-haired man was slightly hesitant. “Master created me
here, so I don’t know much of Vastheaven Palace. I trust that after
you leave the Three Realms and begin to roam the endless primordial
chaos, you should be able to find information regarding Vastheaven
Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why is it that the
written language of Undermoon Lake seems to be a bit different from
the written language of the Three Realms?” Ning asked. He had
noticed long ago that the language here was absolutely identical to
the written language used by the chaos-kingdom of Pangaea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a common
language that is used throughout the primordial chaos,” the
silver-haired man explained.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 34 - Departure? The Void Stairway
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning instantly
understood. The chaos-kingdom of Pangaea was far more powerful than
the Three Realms, and it also had much closer connections to the rest
of the primordial chaos. It made sense that the language it used was
the same language as was used throughout the rest of the primordial
chaos. The Three Realms, by contrast, was rather segregated from the
rest of the primordial chaos. It was only when the odd alien Outsider
invaded that the Three Realms would gain some more information about
the greater primordial chaos.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh, forget it.
Vastheaven Palace, Pangaea, World God Northrest, three Wujiao
Godbeasts…all of that is way beyond my level for now. Even the
lifeblood oath I swore only takes effect once I become an Elder God;
only then would I have to leave the Three Realms.” Ning was quite
calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, he had
gained great benefits from Undermoon Lake. The Three Realms was in
the midst of a war, and Ning’s home, along with those he cared
about, were all in the Three Realms. Nothing else mattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Becoming an Elder God
was no easy feat either. Even becoming a True God would be very
difficult, to say nothing of becoming an Elder God; all of that would
definitely take an extremely long period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It has been
countless years. Only two people have acquired these two techniques
from Undermoon Lake; one was Jueming, and the other is you.” The
silver-haired man looked at Ning. “Don’t disappoint Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For my own sake as
well, I wouldn’t dare,” Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go. I send
you away from Undermoon Lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-haired man
immediately led the way forward. Ning let out a sigh of relief; he
was afraid that the already-deceased World God Northrest had other
schemes for him as well. In truth, Northrest was far too powerful,
and his abilities were simply unfathomable. Most likely, even Mother
Nuwa, back when she had first broken through to become a World God,
wouldn’t necessarily have been a match for him. Ning naturally was
like an ant compared to the man, to be used or abused as needed.
Fortunately, everything was going to be fine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And of course, Mother
Nuwa had entered the endless primordial chaos long ago to go
adventuring; it was entirely possible that she had reached a shocking
level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moonfall Island was
truly beautiful. The silver-haired man led Ning through it until they
arrived at the center of a grassy region. The center of the grassy
region had a calm, curvy lake within it. The surface of the lake was
so smooth that it looked like a giant piece of jade. When Ning and
the silver-haired landed next to it, their landing caused a bit of
wind which stirred up tiny, rippling waves on the surface of the
lake, making it look even more mesmerizingly beautiful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once you enter that
little lake, you’ll leave Undermoon Lake,” the silver-haired man
instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go in, then
appear outside?” Ning pointed at the lake. When he had first
arrived, he had smashed headfirst into the waters of Undermoon Lake,
then appeared within the world of Undermoon Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. When you
emerge, you’ll appear above the lake of water that is below the
enormous moon.” The silver-haired man nodded, his gaze locked onto
Ning. “Don’t forget your lifeblood oath.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course.” Ning
chuckled and nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
curved lake, his heart filled with joy. Finally…he was finally
going to leave!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Senior
apprentice-sister!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wait for me!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Plop. Ning dove into
beautiful pond, causing a series of ripples and waves to appear.
Spacetime began to twist, teleporting Ning to a different place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense
spacetime fluctuating around him as his surroundings became blurry to
behold. Clearly, he was being transferred somewhere at high speed.
Suddenly, the area around him began to tremble slightly, causing Ning
to feel rather puzzled. When he had been transferred to Undermoon
Lake, the process had been very smooth and had lasted only a moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When his surroundings
began to stabilize, Ning took a look around and was able to clearly
see the environment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” He was
completely surrounded the Void. Within the Void, there were a series
of steps that seemed to be endless, leading him deeper up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“W-where is this?”
Ning was completely dazed. According to what the silver-haired man
had said, he should’ve been brought back in the air above the
waters of Undermoon Lake…but there wasn’t even a drop of the
waters of Undermoon Lake here. All it had was the infinite Void and
those seemingly endless stairs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where exactly am I?
Where have I been transferred to?” Ning was extremely cautious. It
was easy to die of carelessness in a strange and unfamiliar place.
“That silver-haired man didn’t lie to me, and I wasn’t able to
fight back against him in Undermoon Lake; if he wanted me dead, it
would’ve been easy for him to kill me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If this was his
doing, he could’ve simply said that he was going to send me to a
special place. I wouldn’t have been able to fight back at all;
there’s no need to lie to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In other words…that
silver-haired man probably didn’t expect this either.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt his heart
lurch. “Is it…that World God Northrest died so long ago that
holes appeared in his transmission tunnel, causing an error in my
teleportation?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nothing in the world
was truly eternal. Even chaosworlds would eventually wither and day,
and even World Gods like Northrest would one day be killed. It wasn’t
impossible for his teleportation matrix to develop problems.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wasn’t I supposed
to go back? Where have I been sent to?” Ning calmed himself down,
then first used heartforce followed by coresense to investigate this
place. But it was all useless!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those stairs…? If
there’s a set of stairs here, this should be a specific,
constructed location.” Ning carefully advanced up the stairs,
following them upwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning moved incredibly
quickly. Just a short while later, he saw an enormous stone tablet
levitating atop the stairs ahead of him. The stone tablet was covered
with countless carvings of sword-stances, and the sword-intent
surging forth from each and every carving caused Ning’s heart to
turn cold. The power of this sword-intent surpassed even the [Five
Treasures].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What terrifying
sword-intent…there’s no way a True God or Daofather could’ve
devised this. Could it be a World God? Was it World God Northrest?”
Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was in no rush to
advance. He slowed down to take a careful look at the nameless
sword-art before him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he was to leave now,
who knew if he would ever be allowed back? He had to seize the
opportunity to carefully inspect this sword-art. He had mastered the
[Five Treasures] and stood at the very peak of skill in the Three
Realms, but the Dao contained within this sword-art was simply too
unfathomably powerful. Most likely, it was something that only a
Chaos Immortal or World God could develop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning ended up spending
more than three months pondering that stone tablet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Urgh.” Ning’s
face turned ashen, blood beginning to leak down his nostrils. The
blood inside his body was bubbling and roiling about.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t keep
studying it. It’s beyond my limits.” Ning was secretly shocked.
“I wonder who left behind this sword-art? Was it World God
Northrest? No matter who it was, this sword-art…it definitely
surpasses any other sword-art of the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, the only
World God the Three Realms had ever seen was Mother Nuwa. She didn’t
use the sword, and so there was naturally no way that the Three
Realms would have any techniques that could compare to this one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to go.” Since
he could no longer study it, Ning had no choice but to continue to
advance upwards through the staircase through the Void. Just a short
while later, he encountered yet another stone tablet. This one was
also covered with sword-stances, and it also did not have a name to
it. However, this sword-art was diametrically different from the
previous one…and yet, its power wasn’t one whit weaker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning spent another
three months carefully analyzing this technique, resulting his
understanding of the sword rising even more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As the saying goes,
beyond the heavens there is always an even greater Heaven.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Anyone who believes
the major powers of the Three Realms to be the most powerful figures
in the universe is as narrow-sighted as a frog within a well. The
endless primordial chaos has far, far too many powerful experts
within it.” Ning’s skill in the sword was continuing to grow, but
he was beginning to grow increasingly humble. He understood that
there were many who were far more powerful than him. The creator of
the sword-art on this tablet would be able to slay him with a single
blow of the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The staircase through
the Void seemed endless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued his path
through the staircase. He actually encountered a total of
ninety-eight stone tablets, each of which possessed a sword-art that
was so unfathomable and profound that Ning’s horizons were
continually broadened. His skill in the sword had skyrocketed, and
Ning had even gained some insights and ideas about reaching the fifth
stage of swordforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fifth stage of
swordforce, Sword God. Ning had previously believed that it
represented an unfathomably dense essence of emotions, and so when
one reached this level, one’s sword-art would gain a soul of its
own. This was what Ning believed, and it was also what most of the
major powers of the Three Realms believed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now, after viewing
the ninety-eight profound sword-arts left behind by this alien major
power, Ning understood the truth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Having emotions in
one’s sword-art was of secondary importance! For example, Ning’s
[Brightmoon] sword-art had originally possessed no emotional aura,
but Ning had still been able to reach the fourth stage of swordforce,
right?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The emotions simply
aided the swordsman in becoming further intoxicated by the sword,
allowing him to unleash even more of its potential.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, what really
mattered the most was understanding the sword and the essence of the
sword! Of course strong emotions would be needed to upgrade one’s
swordforce from being ‘sentient’ to having an actual ‘soul’,
giving it extraordinary power, but that was just a side effect. What
really mattered was truly understanding the sword; upgrading one’s
understanding was the true foundation that needed to be laid.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I completely
focused on infusing deep emotions into my sword-arts, I would’ve
embarked on a wrong path.” Cold sweat covered Ning’s forehead.
Only now, after seeing so many profound sword-arts, did he understand
what his own path would be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was clear and
obvious that the ninety-eight sword-arts atop the stone tablet had
surpassed the fifth level of swordforce and reached an even higher
and more unfathomable level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve finally
reached the end.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After viewing the
ninety-eighth stone tablet, Ning saw an end to the stairway through
the Void. At the end of the stairway lay an ancient shrine that
looked like it had been completely formed from green jade. The shrine
emanated an invisible aura of power and majesty.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 35 - End of the Road for World God Northrest
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning understood that
the person who left behind this sort of sword-arts was powerful
enough to, even in death, have complete control over whether or not
Ning would live or die here. Thus, Ning didn’t hesitate. He walked
straight towards the jade shrine at the end of the stairways through
the Void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The jade shrine was as
beautiful as beautiful could be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The shrine’s walls
were made out of jade, possessing a semi-translucent quality about
them. Just drawing near the walls of the jade shrine made Ning feel
peaceful at heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This shrine…”
Ning swept it with his gaze as he entered. The shrine had almost
nothing inside it, much like the last one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the very center of
the shrine, there hovered a prayer mat that glowed with golden light.
Far in front of the prayer mat lay an ancient, unadorned stone dais
that had a slender sword atop it. The sword was three feet long but
just one inch wide. This sword was completely blood-red in color, and
its surface was covered with many cracks and scars. The cracks and
scars covered every inch of the surface of the sword, making it look
as though the sword might completely shatter at any moment. In fact,
there were three particularly noticeable chunks missing from the edge
of the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a sword that
was so badly damaged, it looked as though it was going to fall apart
at any moment. But the sword…the sword was the source of the aura
that filled the entire shrine! When Ning looked at the sword, he felt
even more pressure than he did when he gazed upon Human Sovereign
Fuxi. Without any question, this was a sword that vastly surpassed
any Protocosmic spirit-treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Chaos treasure?”
Ning momentarily became quite excited, but moments later he frowned.
“Even if it is a Chaos treasure, this sword…it’s been damaged
to an incredible extent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After inspecting the
place for a long time, Ning noticed that the prayer mat of golden
light was woven from a Chaos ingredient known as winterheart grass.
Similar types of prayer mats existed in the Three Realms, and those
who sat upon it would feel their hearts becalmed. But in terms of
price, it was merely comparable to a Protocosmic spirit-treasure. To
someone like Ning, who had all the treasures of Prisonworld 17 in his
hands, it really wasn’t that important.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a mysterious
place. It has a long staircase leading through the Void with a shrine
at the end of it, and the shrine seems built to house and venerate a
sword that’s almost been destroyed.” Ning was secretly puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only items in the
entire shrine were the prayer mat, the stone dais, and the divine
sword. Neither the prayer mat nor the stone dais were particular
special. Although the sword had an utterly shocking aura, it was
unspeakably damaged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning was still
pondering how to further investigate this shrine with care, a ripple
of power suddenly flew out from the sword, landed on the ground, and
transformed into a golden-armored female general. The golden armor
was covered with many blood-colored patterns.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Empyrean God
Darknorth…Ji Ning?” The golden-armored warlady looked at Ning and
spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are…?” Ning
instantly understood. Since this person knew his name, she was
probably the one who arranged for him to come here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am the
sword-spirit of ‘Violetjewel’, the divine sword that was wielded
by World God Northrest.” The golden-armored warlady pointed at the
tattered-looking sword. “That’s Violetjewel right there. You may
address me as ‘sword-spirit’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This golden-armored
woman was just the spirit of the treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You should have been
sent out of Undermoon Lake, but I arranged for you to be led here
instead,” the warlady said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is this place?”
Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is still
Undermoon Lake,” the golden-armored warlady said. “However, it is
an independent, stand-alone dimension within Undermoon Lake. Before
you entered, no one aside from myself knew that it existed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was puzzled. “Are
you saying that Reverend Jueming wasn’t allowed in here either?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. You are the
only living person who has entered since Master died,” the warlady
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then why did you
bring me in here?” Ning was growing increasingly puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Because of the [Five
Treasures] sword-art,” the warlady said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Five
Treasures]?” Ning was startled. “Are you keeping a constant watch
on the actions of the Empyrean Gods within Undermoon Lake? Is that
how you learned of the [Five Treasures]?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-armored
warlady revealed a hint of a smile. This caused Ning to feel
surprised and even a bit dazzled. Previously, she had maintained an
emotionless look on her face. Her smile, however, was like the
blooming of a flower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was my master who
created the [Five Treasures]. How could I not know of it?” The
smile on the warlady’s face had a hint of pride to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your master created
it?” Ning was stunned. Right. Although Daofather Fuju had claimed
to others in the Three Realms that he was the one to create it, after
soulscouring the memories of the prisoners of Prisonworld 17, Ning
had come to understand how truly impressive it was for a sword-art to
exceed the limits of the Heavenly Daos. It definitely wasn’t
something that the likes of a Daofather such as Fuju would’ve been
able to create. So…it had actually been created by World God
Northrest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning was
puzzled as well. “Even prior to ‘developing’ the [Five
Treasures], Daofather Fuju had been a top-tier Daofather. Given his
power and ability, why would he need to lie? Did he lie to keep some
sort of secret hidden?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you know
Daofather Fuju?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Fuju’s
death was a mystery. Countless major powers in the Three Realms had
wished to investigate it and understand it, but none had been able to
discover anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather Fuju?”
The golden-armored warlady blinked. She then looked at Ning with a
smile on her face that wasn’t really a smile. “Of course. After
you listen to what I say, you’ll understand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Many years ago, the
shattered remnants of my master’s soul borrowed from the power of
Violetjewel in order to frantically flee, eventually arriving within
your Three Realms. Upon reaching this place, he was no longer able to
flee any further. Oh; back then, your ‘Three Realms’ didn’t
exist. It was still the Primordial Era, so the world was the Pangu
Chaosworld back then,” the warlady said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fortunately, Master
had fled so frantically that those three Wujiao Godbeasts were unable
to catch up to him. Upon arriving, Master could sense that there was
an Elder God in the Three Realms who could potentially pose a threat
to him…the person you all refer to as Mother Nuwa! Although back
then she was still just an Elder God, she had already reached the
very peak of power possible for an Elder God. She was far more
powerful than the other Elder Gods back during the Primordial Era, so
powerful that even Master felt a faint sense of danger emanating from
her. If they really were to go all-out in a fight…it’s hard to
say if he would’ve been able to slay Nuwa, but he himself
definitely would’ve died.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
listen with curiosity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If Master was at
full power, he wouldn’t have worried about Nuwa at all, of course.
But back then, he had only a tiny shred of his soul left! Although he
would still be able to unleash the power of a World God, he wouldn’t
be able to sustain it for long; naturally, he didn’t wish to take
the risk of battling Nuwa. Thus, Master created this world, Undermoon
Lake, within the vast primordial chaos.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-armored
warlady continued, “Master’s injuries were simply too heavy. His
divine body had completely crumbled apart, and he had only a shred of
his soul left. Even his truesoul was beginning to break apart. The
only thing Master could do was to slow the rate at which his truesoul
was disintegrating, because once it completely broke apart he
would’ve died.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master established
Undermoon Lake for the purpose of enticing Empyrean Gods to come to
this place. He didn’t want to let those three Godbeasts continue to
live carefree lives, to let them get away with what they had done.
Thus, he wanted to arrange for someone to go deliver a message to
Vastheaven Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master wasn’t
going to be able to live long enough to deliver the message himself.
He had to train someone else, an Empyrean God, to do it for him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eventually, one
day…Daofather Fuju wandered into the primordial chaos and was
discovered by my master. And so…my master took possession of his
body,” the golden-armored warlady said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes widened
as he stared at her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“P-possessed?” He
was completely stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
golden-armored warlady nodded. “After establishing Undermoon Lake,
Master’s top priority was slowing the speed at which his truesoul
decayed, or perhaps even stop and reverse the process! Master still
wanted to live, after all, and so he came up with a method to use the
physical body to nourish the truesoul. Upon wandering the primordial
chaos, he just so happened to run into Daofather Fuju.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master wouldn’t
have been confident in his chances of possessing Nuwa, but Daofather
Fuju…he was nothing more than an ordinary Daofather. Master was
naturally able to possess him with ease.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After possessing
him, Master entered the Pangu Chaosworld. He revealed just a bit of
his power, showing off fifth-stage swordforce, resulting in his
status within the Pangu Chaosworld skyrocketing,” the
golden-armored warlady explained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt a twinge of
fear. So even back during the Primordial Era, Daofather Fuju had been
possessed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master had no desire
to teach any students; all he cared about was coming up with a way
that would halt the collapse of his truesoul, and perhaps even heal
it. But…no matter what he tried, no matter how much effort he
expended, he was unable to stop his truesoul from crumbling. He was
only able to rely on the energy of his fleshly body to slow the rate
of decay. Thus, during the war that destroyed the Primordial Era,
Master didn’t really try all that hard, precisely because he didn’t
want to get into a serious fight with tough experts like the Lord of
All Things, the Lord of the Demonheart, or the Lord of All Fiends. If
he did, he would’ve died even faster.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, Ning
understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No wonder. No wonder
Daofather Fuju was the undisputed number one Sword Immortal of the
Three Realms, but was quite ineffective in teaching disciples,
producing not even a single powerful student. By contrast, the likes
of Old Man Yuan and Daofather Subhuti had multiple students who
became Daofathers. So it was all because World God Northrest had no
real interest in teaching disciples at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Primordial Era
ended. The Three Realms were born.” The golden-armored warlady
continued. “Master finally gave up. He understood that there was no
way he could prevent his truesoul from disintegrating. And so, prior
to his death, he made the final arrangements.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He left behind five
mountain peaks within Sword Immortal world, then left behind the
complete [Five Treasures] within those mountain peaks, all for the
sake of training a successor, someone who could go and send a message
to Vastheaven Palace for him, or perhaps even take revenge on his
behalf,” the golden-armored warlady said. “Master was a Fiendgod
refiner, and so he required that his successor be a Fiendgod refiner
as well. Back then, Master didn’t really care if his successor was
an Empyrean God or a True God. Any Fiendgod refiner who mastered the
[Five Treasures] would be allowed into the fifth mountain…and in
truth, the so-called ‘legacy’ within the fifth mountain was
actually a spatial corridor that led to this place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned. So
the fifth mountain led to this place?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master understood
that few-to-no Empyrean Gods who were truly, outstandingly talented
would elect to enter Undermoon Lake, which was why he left behind the
fifth mountain and allowed all of the geniuses of the Three Realms to
view it,” the golden-armored warlady said. “Master wished to find
a good successor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He left behind the
[Five Treasures] and the five mountains, then left. All by himself,
he entered the primordial chaos to wait for death to come to him. His
truesoul completed its disintegration…and Master died a true
death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but sigh upon hearing this. An almighty World God had struggled and
fled, unwilling to give up…but in the end, there had been nothing
he could do. And so, he had left behind the [Five Treasures] and
other things, then peacefully went to wait for death to descend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder Daofather
Fuju’s body was discovered in the primordial chaos, but it was
impossible to tell how or why he had died.” Ning sighed. Such a
powerful figure had died, just like that…and Fuju himself had been
possessed during the Primordial Era.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was indeed a
mystery that was impossible for the Three Realms to solve.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If this golden-armored
warlady hadn’t exposed it all, who would’ve found out? Not even
Mother Nuwa would’ve been able to find out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And so, after
countless years…you’ve arrived.” The golden-armored warlady
looked at Ning.
</P>

Chapter 36 - Heartseep Technique
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning felt a surge of
joy in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Northrest had
spent a tremendous amount of effort to train a proper successor. The
things he had prepared for this successor would no doubt be much
better than the items he had left behind on Moonfall Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The most precious
item within all of Undermoon Lake is the item which master was able
to rely upon in order to escape, despite being surrounded, assaulted,
and wounded so badly that only a shred of his soul remained. It is
this sword.” The golden-armored warlady pointed at the slender,
terribly damaged blood-colored sword. Ning was stunned; this was it?
This broken-looking sword?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if it was powerful
in the past, it was completely ruined now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t
underestimate it. Don’t be deceived by its bad condition.” The
golden-armored warlady sneered, “Not all the treasures in your
Three Realms combined would be as valuable as this ‘badly damaged
sword’ in front of you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was shocked. Not
even all the treasures in the Three Realms combined?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The most precious
thing within your Three Realms is its ‘Worldcore’, which will
only manifest after the Three Realms is destroyed. But even the
Worldcore is vastly inferior in value to this sword.” The
golden-armored warlady let out a sigh. “Even in as bad condition as
it currently is, it’s far beyond the limits of your imagination.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s that
powerful?” Ning was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Powerful?” The
warlady laughed coldly, “World Gods and Chaos Immortals are all
extremely powerful. They rove throughout the primordial chaos, and to
them, it’s not that hard to use a technique to hasten the
destruction of a chaosworld and then extract the Worldcore from it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World Gods and Chaos
Immortals did indeed have the power to destroy a chaosworld. For
example, the great war of the Primordial Era had been instigated by
the Lord of All Things, but if it had been instigated by a World God,
Mother Nuwa probably wouldn’t have even had the chance to make a
breakthrough. Everyone would’ve been effortlessly dominated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although Worldcores
are valuable treasures to Chaos Immortals and World Gods, they can
acquire them with a bit of effort. But this sword…” The
golden-armored warlady let out a sigh. “It’s enough to drive any
World God mad with lust, to the point of risking their own lives for
it. Master had to rely on the help of many friends from Vastheaven
Palace, combined with his own personal power, in order to acquire it.
For the sake of this sword, Master paid an indescribable price…but
it was all worth it, because in the end he acquired this sword,
Violetjewel.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s that
precious?” Ning stared at the badly damaged sword, extremely
puzzled. “What is the story behind it? You should know, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I do not.” The
golden-armored warlady shook her head, a bit embarassed. “When
Violetjewel carried Master’s soul-sliver with it as it fled, it was
so badly damaged that even its original sword-spirit was destroyed.
Master ended up placing Violetjewel within Undermoon Lake. Once the
sword was given some time to settle down and stabilize, it was able
to slowly give birth to a new spirit - me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now understood. It
made sense. For example, the master of a treasure could wipe out its
treasure-spirit and then allow a new treasure-spirit to be born.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, before he
died, Master told me everything that he could. All the necessary
arrangements were made.” The golden-armored warlady looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Judging from what
you are saying…this sword should be even more powerful than a Chaos
treasure?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Powerful?” The
golden-armored warlady said, “The so-called ‘Chaos treasures’
of your Three Realms are generally meant for Elder Gods and Ancestral
Immortals. World Gods could fight barehanded and have power
equivalent to that of a Chaos treasure! They use far more powerful
weapons. As for this sword…even amongst the weapons used by World
Gods and Chaos Immortals, it is one of the absolute best of weapons.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned. “If
that’s the case, would I even be capable of binding it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After soulscouring the
memories of the prisoners of Pangaea, Ning had learned a few things.
In Pangaea, True Gods and True Immortals would generally use
Protocosmic spirit-treasures, while Elder Gods and Ancestral
Immortals used Chaos treasures. As for the King of Pangaea, he
supposedly used an even more terrifyingly powerful treasure which
could only be bound by someone who was at least at the Elder God or
Ancestral Immortal level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for this
tattered-looking sword…if it was one of the absolute best weapons
that could be used by World Gods and Chaos Immortals, how could a
mere Empyrean God/True Immortal like Ning possibly bind it?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Generally speaking,
one has to have the power of a World God to bind this weapon.” The
golden-armored woman warlady at Ning. “However, since Master left
this sword for you, he must have done it for a reason. In Vastheaven
Palace, there is a certain unique and secret binding technique that
is recorded within the [Eight Directions Secret Scroll]. Although the
records were casually written down, they described something that is
extraordinarily marvelous. This technique is known as the ‘Heartseep’
technique. Through using the ‘Heartseep’ technique, you can bind
this sword. Once you do, you’ll be able to retract its aura and
change its appearance and coloration. Otherwise, everyone would be
able to tell at a glance how extraordinary this weapon is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. The aura
of this badly damaged sword was even more terrifying than Human
Sovereign Fuxi’s aura. Its power would indeed be obvious to anyone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ordinary Pure Yang
treasures and Protocosmic spirit-treasures had auras of their own,
but after they were bound the auras could be suppressed, making them
seem like normal weapons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the
Heartseep technique.” The golden-armored warlady waved her hand,
causing a bamboo scroll to appear in midair before her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s like how we
do it in the Three Realms.” Ning chuckled. The Pangaea
chaos-kingdom and the Three Realms recorded down techniques in
differing manners. After World God Northrest had possessed Daofather
Fuju, he had chosen to do as they did in the Three Realms and
recorded techniques down within bamboo scrolls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning accepted it in a
very practiced manner, then sent his coresense into it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A large amount of
information began to flood into his mind, but after just two breaths
worth of time, it came to an end. This was a fairly simple technique,
but despite its simplicity, it would be hard for even World Gods or
Chaos Immortals to intentionally devise an idea like it. This
technique…the principles behind it were quite interesting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When royal figures died
on Earth during the early ages, they would have jade treasures buried
with them. Because those treasures would be covered in dirt and mud
for hundreds or thousands of years, once they were excavated they
would still be imprinted with some dirt or mud which would have
seeped into the jade itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It wouldn’t be very
practical to come up with an idea to actively ‘seep’ dirt and mud
into jade on Earth unless one used extremely high-tech methods, akin
to how World Gods and Chaos Immortals would be able to use their
tremendous power to forcibly bind this sword. However, given a long
enough period of time, just keeping jade in constant contact with mud
would eventually cause the mud to ‘seep’ into the jade. This was
the essence of the ‘Heartseep’ technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” Ning’s
face changed. “It needs that long? A thousand years?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is a thousand years
really that long?” The golden-armored warlady looked towards Ning,
puzzled. “For you, an Empyrean God and a True Immortal, to spend a
mere thousand years binding a priceless treasure like this and
complain about how long it takes…? This technique is already quite
formidable, and the amount of time is already quite short.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning grew frantic. He
didn’t have the time needed to slowly bind the treasure. The
outside world had already descended into a state of calamity, and he
had already spent more than a century in Undermoon Lake. He naturally
wanted to leave as soon as possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can I take this
sword back with me? Can I slowly bind it in the outside world?”
Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-armored
warlady shook her head. “You can try. If you can move it, go
ahead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Puzzled, Ning
immediately walked forward and reached out to grab the terribly
damaged sword. Since the warlady wasn’t going to stop him, this
shouldn’t prove dangerous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as Ning’s
palm descended upon the sword, an invisible burst of power blasted
out, knocking Ning backwards and sending him flying away like a
meteor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later, he
flew back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“B-but…” As Ning
once more walked into the jade shrine, he stared in astonishment at
the badly damaged sword. It clearly was in terrible shape, but it
still possessed incredible power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you take it out
without binding it, once the Elder Gods and Ancestral Immortals of
the Three Realms notice it you’ll be doomed.” The golden-armored
warlady shook her head. “I heard you say in Undermoon Lake that the
Three Realms has entered a state of war between two main allied
camps? If you go out and end up losing that treasure to the major
powers of the Seamless Gate, you’ll become a sinner in the eyes of
all your allies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood what
she was saying…but was he really going to be trapped here for a
thousand years?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You only have two
clones here.” The golden-armored warlady chuckled. “Two
absolutely identical clones. Techniques like these always produce
more than just two, right? I imagine you have other clones in the
outside world at all. If that’s really the case, then they should
be able to deal with any emergent situations in the outside world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed. In the outside
world, Ning had sixteen ‘true bodies’ and eighteen Primaltwin
bodies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition…this
sword has suffered tremendous damage. Just look at it; it’s almost
fallen apart. Only its energy source remains undamaged. It shouldn’t
be that hard to bind it; five hundred years if you are fast, a
thousand years if you are slow.” The golden-armored warlady
explained, “Oh, right; aside from this treasure, Master has left
behind other techniques for you to receive. He spent tremendous
effort recording them all down for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As she spoke, the
warlady waved her hand. Instantly, one bamboo scroll after another
began to materialize in the air, coming together to form a small
mountain of scrolls!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Some of his
techniques could not be transmitted, due to the rules of Vastheaven
Palace. The others, the ones that he was permitted to teach, are all
here.” The golden-armored warlady pointed towards the small
mountain of bamboo scrolls.
</P>

Chapter 37 - The Sole True Body
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One of your clones
can focus on using the Heartseep technique to bind the sword while
the other can begin the slow process of memorizing all these
techniques,” the golden-armored warlady suggested.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two white-robed youths
appeared within the jade shrine. One stood silently in front of the
mountain of bamboo scrolls, with every single scroll emanating
ripples of power. The other walked next to the divine sword, moved
the prayer mat closer to it, then sat down by himself and quietly
began to use the Heartseep technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Using the Heartseep
technique was quite simple, but there was one prerequisite; one had
to have a basic understanding of heartforce!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Northrest
knew for certain that his chosen successor would have a basic
understanding of heartforce. It must be understood that most of the
True Gods and Daofathers of the Three Realms had reached the second
or third stages of heartforce. Truly powerful experts all generally
had at least some mastery of heartforce. Anyone capable of mastering
the [Five Treasures] would definitely have some level of
understanding of heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As noted by the
instructions included with the Heartseep technique, heartforce was
ephemeral and formless, yet extraordinarily marvelous and effective.
The Heartseep technique, in and of itself, was a special way of
applying heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heartforce had
reached the fourth level. Based on his calculations, he would need a
thousand years to bind the sword. If his heartforce had only been on
the first or second level, the amount of time needed would’ve been
even greater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s invisible
heartforce seeped into the body of the Violetjewel sword. It entered
the sword effortlessly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heartforce
could sense that within Violetjewel, there was a blurry region that
was filled with countless cracks and scars. Clearly, Violetjewel had
been damaged tremendously. Within the blurry region, there was a
complex, octahedral crystalline structure. Every single face of the
octahedral crystal was covered with extremely complicated runes. The
runes were far, far more complicated than anything Ning had ever
encountered, even the nine chaos seals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The surface of the
octahedral crystal was covered with a layer of flowing light that
prevented Ning’s heartforce from penetrating through it in the
slightest, but he was still able to sense the unearthly power that
lay hidden within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the power
source of the Violetjewel sword! The most central core of it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So long as the core
remained intact, even if the entire physical sword was destroyed, it
could one day be repaired.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to begin.”
Ning’s heartforce was like an invisible hand within the sword. It
began to form countless dots of starlight, all of which joined
together to form slender threads. The many starlight threads swirled
around the octahedral crystal, beginning to ‘seep’ into it as
instructed by the Heartseep technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two white-robed youths;
one seated atop a prayer mat next to the sword on the stone dais, the
other standing in front of a mountain of bamboo scrolls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on nonstop.
In the blink of an eye, four months passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve finally
finished memorizing them all.” Ning was finally able to relax.
Although these powerful techniques included the ninety-eight sword
arts on the stone tablets, other powerful sword-arts, Fiendgod Body
Refining techniques, Ki Refining techniques, special secret arts, and
powerful divine abilities…Ning was still somewhat disappointed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These techniques would
all be of some use to him after he became very powerful, upon
reaching the Elder God or even World God levels. But as for right
now? They were of no use at all in improving his current level of
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had been hoping that
he would be able to find a way to upgrade his second-tier Jindan into
a first-tier Jindan. But alas…he had hoped in vain. There was
nothing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disappointed?” The
golden-armored warlady smirked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t be
bothered to lie to a treasure-spirit. He nodded. “A bit. The Three
Realms are in a state of war right now, after all. If it wasn’t for
the war, I wouldn’t be in a rush to increase my level of power, but
the war has already arrived. None of these techniques can help me
increase my power within a short period of time. I was hoping that I
would be able to improve slightly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I knew you’d be in
a rush.” The golden-armored warlady revealed a slightly smug look
on her face. “When I saw that look on your face when you heard how
long it would take to bind the sword, I understood how frantic you
were to leave. Thus…I played a little joke on you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Joke?” Ning was
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The three most
important techniques aren’t actually in any of those bamboo
scrolls.” The golden-armored warlady pointed at the mountain of
scrolls. Ning’s eyes instantly lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look.” She pointed
at the nearby walls of the jade shrine. Instantly, the
semi-translucent walls became filled with various diagrams as
countless images of sword-stances appeared. With the restrictive
spell removed, the aura of the sword-intent within the stances came
surging outwards, causing Ning to shudder uncontrollably.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master was a World
God of the sword. This is the most powerful technique Master acquired
while wandering the endless primordial chaos, a nameless sword-art
that has utterly Heaven-shaking power. The reason why Master stood
amongst the most top-tier of World Gods was primarily due to this
sword-art,” the golden-armored warlady said. “Master wrote down
everything he had memorized about the sword-art here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ninety-eight
sword-arts on the stone tablets outside were developed by Master
after he gained insight into this nameless sword-art. After you
master them, you can begin to study the nameless sword-art,” the
warlady said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now look at this.”
Another stone tablet suddenly appeared in her hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the
‘talisman of welcome’ which Master personally forged.” The
golden-armored warlady looked at Ning. “After you bind it, it will
become part of you. Once you die, the talisman will shatter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Talisman of
welcome?” Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. In the
endless primordial chaos, there are countless Elder Gods, Ancestral
Immortals, and even World Gods who would desperately desire to
acquire this talisman,” the golden-armored warlady said. “According
to what Master said, Vastheaven Palace is a very powerful
organization within the primordial chaos, and all of the experts
within it refer to each other as brothers; there’s no such thing as
‘masters’ or ‘disciples’ in their ranks. Any and every member
of Vastheaven Palace is a brother to the others.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you want to join
Vastheaven Palace, you have to be welcomed in by a formal member of
Vastheaven Palace.” The golden-armored warlady explained, “At
Vastheaven Palace, there is a ‘Welcomer’ who is perennially
responsible for welcoming new members. If any outsiders wish to join
Vastheaven Palace, they have to pass the many tests which the
Welcomer gives, at which point they will be welcomed into Vastheaven
Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aside from this
option!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Every formal member
of Vastheaven Palace is permitted to welcome a single new member into
their ranks.” The golden-armored warlady continued, “World God
Northrest never welcomed any other experts into the palace. Before
dying, he fashioned this ‘talisman of welcome’ for your sake,
which means that so long as you can reach the Elder God or Ancestral
Immortal level, you will be qualified to join Vastheaven Palace.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing this, Ning
remained quite calm, although he did of course feel anticipation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Vastheaven Palace?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">World God Northrest had
fled so frantically that even he himself didn’t know the way back.
Thus, he had given Ning a full chaos cycle to locate Vastheaven
Palace. Who knew where the place even was?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The nameless
sword-art and the talisman of welcome are both extremely important.”
The golden-armored warlady looked at Ning. “There was a scroll
within that pile over there that would be quite useful for you, but I
intentionally took it out and kept it from you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah?!” Ning was
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take a look.” The
golden-armored warlady waved her hand, producing yet another bamboo
scroll. “I know that you have a body-duplicating technique, so I
felt certain that this bamboo scroll would be very useful to you. Heh
heh…I intentionally made sure it was the last one you see.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quickly accepted
the scroll.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nameless sword-art?
He would have to master the other ninety-eight sword-arts before he
could study in it. That was not going to happen for a long, long
time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The talisman of welcome
from Vastheaven Palace? That wouldn’t matter for an even longer
period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the last
scroll.” Ning accepted it, then immediately sent his coresense into
it. Instantly, information began to flood towards him as a technique
entered his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ‘One True
Body’ technique?” Ning murmured to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a secret art!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By relying on the [One
True Body] technique, bodies that all came from the same source could
be merged together into one! The underlying principle of this
technique was based off the rationale that, since all bodies and
clones stemmed from the same source, they all had hidden connections
that could be used to join them together again. Thus, a major power
in the primordial chaos ended up creating this technique, the [One
True Body].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third stage of the
[Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods] allowed for its eighteen clones to merge
into one, but also allowed it to split apart again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the [One True
Body] secret art, it could merge together separate clones to form a
‘true body’, but upon doing so it would no longer be able to
split the clones apart again!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This, compared to the
[Taowu Eighteen Fiendgods], was its weakness; its inability to split
up again. However, [One True Body] could be used without any material
requirements.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is useful to you,
yes?” The golden-armored warlady laughed as she spoke. In the
future, she would follow Ning, and so she naturally felt
intrinsically friendly towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After his bodies merged
together, they wouldn’t be able to split apart again…but why
would he even need to split them apart? It was enough for his power
to increase by an explosive amount!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When all his clones
merged together, the power of his soul, his ki, his divine power, his
heartforce, and his divine body would all skyrocket. If him
possessing a second-tier Jindan made him a ‘half-step Daofather’,
once he merged all of his clones together he would become equivalent
to an actual Daofather.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This wasn’t just
useful; this was exactly what he needed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Life in this standalone
dimension was quite peaceful. One of Ning’s bodies focused on
binding the extraordinarily powerful sword, while the other spent
every single day meditating on the sword-arts recorded on the
ninety-eight stone tablets. The sword-arts recorded into the bamboo
scrolls were nothing more than images, after all, whereas the
sword-arts left behind on the stone tablets had been personally
carved into them by World God Northrest. They were filled with his
boundless intent, making it so that meditating on them was many tens
of times easier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One year passed. Ten
years. A hundred years…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword-arts and
cultivation base began to silently rise. For someone like Ning who
had already mastered the [Five Treasures], it was entirely possible
to meditate on these sword-arts left behind by a powerful World God.
Although he wouldn’t be able to forcibly master all of them, he was
still able to meditate on them one part at a time. And as time went
on, he began to understand more and more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was one of the
things which Ning would rely on in the future to truly roam the Three
Realms with his sword-arts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But as Ning lived this
peaceful, fulfilling life of cultivation in this standalone region,
the Three Realms…had been thrust into a state of complete and utter
turmoil!
