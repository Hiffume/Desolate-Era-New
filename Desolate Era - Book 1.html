		Chapter 1 - The Land of the Dead
	</H1>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Walk faster!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve already
		died and become a ghost. Faster!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are a prince?
		You ruled over tens of millions of citizens and thirty thousand
		armored horsemen? In the Netherworld Kingdom, you human princes are
		nothing!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Smack!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Smack!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A tall,
		powerful-looking demonic soldier, his face mean and vicious, snarled
		angrily as he lashed out with his whip repeatedly. The whip flashed
		like lightning, striking on the bodies of the souls of the dead. He
		struck the ghost who had been arrogantly proclaiming that he was a
		prince several dozen times, only stopping when the ghost’s soul had
		almost dissipated.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I should’ve died.
		So that means…this is the Netherworld Kingdom?” Ji Ning appeared
		out of nowhere. He couldn’t help but stare with curiosity at the
		unfamiliar surroundings. When he heard the arrogant boastings of the
		prince, Ji Ning couldn’t help but feel suspicious; “Ten million
		citizens? Thirty thousand armored horsemen? In the modern Earth,
		where would one find thirty thousand armored horsemen?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Faster!” The
		massive, glowing minotaur demon soldier stared at Ji Ning and brayed.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning followed the
		rest of the regiment.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless men in white
		clothes formed into a line, like a long, sinuous dragon, as they
		slowly moved forwards. At the end of each line, more people in white
		would suddenly appear. Some of these white-dressed people would shake
		their heads and sigh. Some would weep. Some would brag and curse.
		Some would stare in astonishment.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My father is the
		Devil King of the Great Snowy Mountain. How dare you strike me! I’ll
		eat you! Grrr!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop hitting me!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ghosts who had just
		reached the Netherworld Kingdom didn’t know they were dead. Many of
		them were roaring in anger as they were beaten, but quickly, they
		were beaten to the point of understanding…that they were dead. No
		matter how glorious they had been in the past, in death, they now had
		nothing.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed quickly. Ji
		Ning walked for a very long time in that endless line of ghosts. He
		didn’t dare to say anything. If he spoke, he might be whipped by
		that minotaur. He had walked in a daze for a long time already.
		Fortunately, ghosts didn’t get hungry or thirsty.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One day, after a long,
		long period of dazed walking.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning!” A
		thunderous sound seemed to echo in the world. The countless ghosts
		all raised their heads to stare at the sky. Ji Ning stared at the sky
		as well. From the horizon, an enormous black cloud began to roll
		over, and atop that cloud was an enormous minotaur god who was
		glowing with black light.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This enormous minotaur
		god was over a hundred thousand meters tall. He was like a massive
		mountain. The black cloud he was on quickly flew over from the
		horizon.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Atop the
		massive black cloud, the minotaur god stared downwards, his eyes
		shooting out twin lofty golden rays of light, covering the entire
		area below and illuminating the body of Ji Ning, who stood there like
		an idiot.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The glowing light from
		the eyes of the minotaur god wrapped around Ji Ning’s body, and Ji
		Ning disappeared from within the ranks of the ghosts. Those ordinary
		minotaur soldiers were all silent, none daring to make a sound. All
		of the ghosts were in a state of shock. Only a long time later did
		they recover.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the boundless
		black clouds, the titanic minotaur god stood.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He stretched out his
		hand, and on top of his palm was a tiny little dot. Ji Ning.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was totally
		shocked.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">God.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous minotaur
		god was standing in front of him, and he was standing on its palm?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” The
		minotaur god peered down at the tiny little speck in his hands.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have come at the
		orders of the Lord of Cui Palace to come receive you.” The minotaur
		god spoke to the tiny speck in his hands, and then with a wave of his
		hands, Ji Ning was placed into an empty void area. The minotaur god
		then rose his black cloud and quickly disappeared into the horizon.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Fengdu City of
		the Ghost World.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a quiet study,
		there was a bookshelf and a table next to it. A blue robed man in his
		middle years was flipping through a book.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning stood there in
		front of him.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why does the Lord of
		Cui Palace wish to see me?” Ji Ning was wondering. He had no idea
		who this Lord of Cui Palace was and had never met him. He was just an
		ordinary person. How could he possibly know any Immortals? If he had
		a powerful background, then he wouldn’t have been tormented by his
		illness his entire life. So why had that Lord of Cui Palace sent the
		minotaur god to bring him here?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He summoned me, but
		then he doesn’t speak to me.” Ji Ning sneaked a glance around the
		room.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The study was very
		simple. The only decoration was a single painting.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s…” Ji
		Ning looked at it carefully. This was the painting of a girl. Her
		feathered clothes were filled with natural grace, and the smile on
		her lips was even more enigmatic than those on the Buddhas in the
		temples on Earth. In the blink of an eye, Ji Ning became enamored
		with studying that painting. The woman in this painting, in terms of
		appearance or hair or clothing, was extremely alluring.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The blue
		robed man raised his head and glanced at him, glancing at the
		painting in surprise. “I didn’t expect that he would have such
		powers of perception.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wake up!” The blue
		robed man shouted quietly.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world of vacant
		pondering which Ji Ning had been in just now was totally shattered,
		and he was totally woken up. Only now did he remember that he was in
		the Lord of Cui Palace’s place.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of Cui Palace
		had closed his book and was looking at him. Ji Ning’s expression
		instantly changed. This was because from his current position, he
		could see the words within the hands of the Lord of Cui Palace: “Book
		of Life and Death.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of Cui Palace
		was reading the Book of Life and Death?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve just been
		reading about your life.” The Lord of Cui Palace smiled towards Ji
		Ning.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was startled.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His life?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His previous life
		appeared in his mind like a dream. His father was a leading
		researcher in a bioscience program. His salary was extremely high.
		His mother was an ordinary teacher. His life should’ve been great
		since he had been born into such a family, but unfortunately, he
		suffered from constant diseases. The doctors all said that it would
		be a miracle if he would live to fifteen or sixteen.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Therefore, he couldn’t
		go to school, nor could he play around with his peers. Every day,
		just by walking for half an hour, he would feel exhausted. His weak
		body, constantly tormented by illness, caused his childhood to be
		very lonely. He had heard long ago in the hospital that others were
		discussing how he should die in his teens. This sort of terrifying
		feeling of knowing your death was coming soon had tormented his
		childhood, causing him to be even more of a loner.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, he had his
		books and the internet.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The books and the
		internet gave him a ‘mental world’ which allowed him to avoid the
		fate of having a twisted personality. Through books and the internet,
		he ravenously acquired knowledge about the world, and his heart
		slowly grew calm, making him more rational in the way he viewed the
		world.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew that in the
		world, there were children who were even worse off than him. After
		all, he still had his parents and he had enough to eat.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was searching for
		his value in life. He couldn’t just stay here and wait to die,
		right? While he was alive, he had to do something. And thus, he had
		asked for a hundred thousand Chinese dollars from his parents and
		began to do business online. He originally had wanted to make his
		life more interesting, but unexpectedly, he really had incredible
		achievements.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After many years, he
		had earned an enormous fortune.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But despite that, his
		illness constantly reminded him that he wouldn’t be able to live
		for much longer. As his parents didn’t need him to support them, he
		felt that leaving the money there would be a waste. Thus, before
		dying, he handed out all of his money, giving it to the poor and sick
		children throughout the country.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t change my
		own destiny, but I can change the destiny of those countless poor,
		sick children!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the deepest
		desire in Ji Ning’s heart!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After handing out all
		of his money, he hadn’t expected that one day, while he was taking
		a walk in the streets outside the hospital with his parents, he had
		simply died.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your life was bitter
		since you were born.” The Lord of Cui Palace said softly. “But
		bitterness didn’t twist you. Instead, it spurred you on to
		astonishing accomplishments. You not only made a huge sum of money,
		but more importantly…you gave it all away!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eighteen years of
		age. Dead.” The Lord of Cui Palace sighed. “For one to be willing
		to sacrifice one’s self to rescue a stranger is quite rare.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning said, “Palace
		Lord, you praise me too much. If I had lived a long life, I might not
		have been willing to do this. According to the doctors, at most I
		would’ve lived another three months. For me to trade those three
		months of life to allow a little girl to gain dozens of years in her
		life was worth it!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of Cui Palace
		laughed, and then casually flipped open the Book of Life and Death.
		His gentle voice carried an infinite majesty. “Ji Ning, in your
		life, you saved over ten thousand people. Your merits are great. For
		your reincarnation, you shall be reborn into…the Heaven Realm!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Heaven Realm.”
		Ji Ning murmured quietly.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of Cui Palace
		sighed, “Only those who accumulate great karmic merit can enter the
		Heaven Realm. On Earth, it is very hard for one to reach this level.
		Knowingly or unknowingly, by giving up your vast fortune and helping
		all of those children, you accumulated enormous karmic merit.
		Otherwise, you probably wouldn’t be able to enter the Heaven
		Realm.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Palace Lord, what do
		you mean?” Ji Ning was confused.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“People are born pure
		and without malice.” The Lord of Cui Palace said. “Children are
		totally pure, but later on, the vagaries of life cause them to
		change…if you were to have helped adults, you might’ve helped
		some kind people, but it is hard to say who is kind and who is evil.
		If you had helped evil people, it would’ve reduced your karmic
		merit.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning now realized
		what he meant.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Book of Life and
		Death had preordained that you would only live to be sixteen.
		However, because of your accumulated merits, you were allowed to live
		until age eighteen.” The Lord of Cui Palace sighed.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” Ji Ning was
		shocked. “Are you saying that the fates contained within the Book
		of Life and Death can be changed?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course they can
		be changed. Why can’t they be changed?” The Lord of Cui Palace
		laughed. “For me, adding a hundred years to a person’s life is
		nothing. Even if Heaven wanted you to die, it would still give you a
		chance, much less the Book of Life and Death. A person’s destiny is
		preordained, true, but it can be changed later on.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning now understood.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was true.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ancients said, “If
		Heaven commits a sinful act, one can go against it; but if you do a
		sinful act, then you will not be allowed to live.” If Heaven wanted
		you to die, it would still give you a chance at life. The Book of
		Life and Death was nothing more than pre-ordained destiny, which one
		could try and change afterwards.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I believe there are
		many people who accumulated great merit. Palace Lord, why did you
		summon me alone?” Ji Ning asked, puzzled.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of Cui Palace
		laughed. “Because…you and I are from the same hometown.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From the same
		hometown?” Ji Ning was stunned. “Are you also from…”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. According to
		the words you ‘modern’ people use, I’m also from Earth!” The
		Lord of Cui Palace laughed. “But that was back in the era of the
		Sui and Tang dynasties.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Sui and Tang
		dynasties?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was extremely
		excited. “I heard those ghosts say that they were ‘princes’ or
		‘devil kings’. None of them are from Earth.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is normal from
		them to not be from Earth. In the infinite universe of space-time,
		there are three realms; the Heaven, the Netherworld, and the Mortal
		Realms.” The Lord of Cui Palace explained. “Heaven refers to the
		Heaven Realm! The Netherworld refers to the underworld, the
		Netherworld Kingdom! Mortal, refers to the Mortal Realm. In the
		Mortal Realm, there are over three thousand major worlds and
		trillions of minor worlds…the three thousand major worlds are all
		extremely vast, and have Immortals and Devils hidden within them. As
		for the trillions of minor worlds, all of them are much smaller and
		have much lower populations. Our hometown, the Earth, is one of those
		minor worlds. Up until now, there are still only a couple billion
		people.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Every moment, in
		those three thousand major worlds and trillions of minor worlds,
		there are countless deaths, and the spirits all come here to the
		Netherworld Kingdom! Tell me, how many ghosts does the Netherworld
		Kingdom have?” The Lord of Cui Palace looked at Ji Ning.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was shocked.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">My God!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three Realms?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Mortal Realm was
		enormous. The Earth was just one of a trillion minor worlds. As a
		human of Earth, in the past, he always thought the Earth was the
		center of the universe! But now, he realized…that the Earth was
		just one of a trillion minor worlds, and couldn’t even be
		considered one of the three thousand major worlds. In an instant, he
		had a sense of loss and disorientation.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Three thousand major
		worlds, a trillion minor worlds. Of course there’s many people who
		have high merit. But it is rare that there is someone from my
		hometown who has accumulated such high merit, and what’s more, your
		pre-ordained fate was a short life. For you to be able to reach such
		a level despite that is very rare! I just happened to have some free
		time, so I wanted to meet you, my fellow Earth man.” The Lord of
		Cui Palace. “You are going to reincarnate soon. Let me tell you
		about the Six States of Reincarnation.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Six States of
		Reincarnation refers to Devas, Asuras, Humans, Animals, Preta Ghosts,
		and Hell Beings.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Lord of Cui Palace
		explained, “Those who are born as Devas and Asuras are all
		considered to be in the ‘Heaven Realm’.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Humans and Animals
		are part of the Mortal Realm.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Preta Ghosts and
		Hell-beings are in the Netherworld Kingdom Realm.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Heaven Realm is
		the place where you are about to be reborn in.” These words
		immediately caused Ji Ning to grow alert. The Lord of Cui Palace
		sighed, “This is the best place to be. When you are reborn into the
		Heaven Realm, nature itself will give birth to you as a Deva! Only
		someone who is born naturally by the heavens can be described as a
		‘immaculate lifeform’.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Born by nature? Not
		by a mother?” Ji Ning was absolutely shocked.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course.” The
		Lord of Cui Palace laughed. “Otherwise, how could you be considered
		an ‘immaculate lifeform’? Strictly speaking, the heavens and the
		earth will be your parents!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After being born
		into the Heaven Realm, you will train at an astonishing pace. You
		will easily be able to enter the Celestial Court and become a soldier
		or a general of Heaven.” The Lord of Cui Palace sighed emotionally.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning rubbed his
		eyes.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A soldier or general of
		Heaven?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was going to become
		a soldier or general of Heaven?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Devas have another
		advantage; once you turn sixteen, you will regain all your memories
		of your previous lives.” The Lord of Cui Palace sighed. “The only
		reason I met you this time was because you had high merit and are a
		fellow countryman. I didn’t expect that when you came here…you
		would’ve been spellbound by the painting of Nuwa, the creator of
		humans. Your insight and perception is indeed very high. For the sake
		of helping you to become a standout soldier of Heaven, I’ll give
		you some help.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was absolutely
		delighted. Help him? Help him out?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stare at the
		painting of Nuwa.” The Lord of Cui Palace pointed at the painting
		on the wall.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning looked at it.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So that woman in the
		painting was the goddess Nuwa?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The person on this
		painting is the most holy and most compassionate primordial goddess,
		Miss Nuwa.” The face of the Lord of Cui Palace turned solemn. “Ever
		since Pangu died after creating the universe, only she, Miss Nuwa,
		has reached Pangu’s level. Miss Nuwa is capable of destroying the
		universe, but also capable of healing it. She can even create new
		life. Of the countless races, the human race is the most spiritual
		one, and it was created by Miss Nuwa. She has understood 84,000
		truths, and without question, she is the most invincible, powerful
		presence in the Three Realms.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The highest in the
		Three Realms?” Ji Ning was stunned.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nuwa created humans,
		and Nuwa repaired the world. He had long ago heard of these myths.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This painting is
		used for the visualization technique, but there’s no way you can
		see the secrets hidden within it.” The Lord of Cui Palace laughed.
		“Although you are about to become a Deva and a heavenly warrior and
		will also be trained in this, let me first teach you a bit of the
		visualization technique and fulfill the karmic bonds that brought us
		together.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Lord of
		Cui Palace.” Ji Ning bowed so low, he almost reached the ground.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to thank me.
		It is nothing more than a visualization technique. It isn’t some
		sort of secret training method, or a magical technique of the
		Immortals or the Devils.” The Lord of Cui Palace pointed a single
		finger at Ji Ning’s forehead.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning felt his brain
		suddenly explode, and an enormous figure of Nuwa appeared in his
		mind.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wake up.” The Lord
		of Cui Palace looked at Ji Ning. “Remember. Often visualizing her
		will definitely allow you to train your soul. But of course, you are
		about to be reborn and you’ll need to drink Grandma Meng’s
		Elixir. You will temporarily lose your memory. When you turn sixteen,
		you will remember this visualization technique. But that’s enough.
		It will definitely be enough to let you become an outstanding figure
		in the army of Heaven! With this visualization technique, you will
		have a chance to train to become an Immortal. If you wish to become a
		Celestial Immortal, you will suffer many trials…I hope that you
		will succeed, and in the future, we will meet again in the Celestial
		Court.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s heart was
		filled with excitement.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The army of Heaven?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Becoming an Immortal?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He really looked
		forward to it all.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” The Lord of
		Cui Palace waved his hand.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning disappeared.

	</H1>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“By order of the Lord

		Springs, brother.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In mid-air, a woman
		dressed in purple was flying while holding Ji Ning by his hand.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning stared around
		him.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just a moment ago, he
		had been in the palace of the Lord of Cui Palace. How did he suddenly
		appear in mid-air?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dare I ask, who
		exactly is the Lord of Cui Palace?” Ji Ning was puzzled. “I heard
		that before reincarnating, I should meet with the Judges of the Dead,
		who would investigate my past and present lives, then send me to be
		reincarnated?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Didn’t you already
		see a Judge?” The violet clothed woman laughed. “As the Custodian
		of the Book of Life and Death, naturally the Lord of Cui Palace is
		the First Judge of the Dead! Since he personally came to judge you,
		of course the other common judges don’t need to come judge you.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Netherworld
		Kingdom, the highest authority was that of the Yamas of the Ten
		Halls, the ten Kings of Hell. Immediately beneath them was the First
		Judge of the Dead, the Lord of Cui Palace, ‘Cui Jue’.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His great fame had long
		since spread throughout the three Realms.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Mortal Realm was
		vast beyond compare. It had three thousand major worlds and trillions
		of minor worlds. Every single living creature, before they were born,
		would have their good deeds and evil deeds assessed by the Judges.
		What an enormous task this was! Thus, the entire Netherworld Kingdom
		had trillions of Judges who were responsible for judging the dead
		souls of the trillions of worlds. But Cui Jue was the leader of all
		of the Judges, and was titled the First Judge. He was the true
		Custodian of the Book of Life and Death. His power was so great that
		he was virtually on the same level as the Ten Kings of Hell.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look. The Road to
		the Yellow Springs.” The woman pointed to a vast road ahead of
		them, which had countless ghosts slowly trudging along in a line. “If
		you follow the road, you will quickly arrive at the Bridge of
		Despair. After you pass the Bridge of Despair and drink Grandma
		Meng’s Elixer of Forgetfulness, you can go be reborn.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman waved her
		hand.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s body was
		suddenly surrounded by golden light, which sent him flying straight
		down into the front of the line, allowing him to ‘cut in line’.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The minotaur soldiers
		next to the line, upon seeing the violet clothed woman high up in the
		air, didn’t dare to say a word. They even arranged for one of the
		minotaur soldiers to escort Ji Ning and were extremely courteous to
		him.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Yellow Springs Road
		was full of mist. Countless souls were making their way through it,
		and Ji Ning was one of them.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s that?” Ji
		Ning stared in front.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In front of him, the
		mist was very thick. Any souls that entered there disappeared and
		never came back.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go on. In front is
		the Bridge of Despair.” The nearby minotaur soldier said amiably.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning nodded. Not
		hesitating, he stepped forward, entering that dense fog.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He suddenly felt as
		though spacetime had changed.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is this?” Ji
		Ning stared at his surroundings in confusion. In front of him was a
		small, winding road. Ghostly forms could be hazily made out. In front
		of him, only a few dozen ghosts could be seen. In front of this
		little road was a river with rapid, turbid water.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That should be the
		legendary Bridge of Despair.” Ji Ning headed forward.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How strange.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clearly, countless
		people entered here. But how come after I stepped in, so few people
		can be seen?” Ji Ning was quite baffled.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How could he know that
		here at the Bridge of Despair, time flowed differently than in the
		outside world.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the saying goes,
		‘For each day that passes in Heaven, a year passes in the mortal
		world.’
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed here at the
		Bridge of Despair at an even more extravagantly fast pace. A single
		day in the Netherworld Kingdom would equal countless years here in
		the Bridge of Despair.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah! Ah!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m sorry!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ji Ning walked onto
		the Bridge of Despair, he saw that the other side of the bridge had a
		pool of blood. The pool of blood had all sorts of poisonous bugs,
		poisonous snakes, and vicious dogs that wildly bit at people. Most of
		the ghosts simply walked past the pool of blood, but some fell
		straight into it. Clearly, these people were burdened by great sins,
		and found it impossible to avoid the terrifying pool of blood.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you knew what
		would happen today, would you have acted so previously?” Ji Ning
		shook his head, then stared at the other side. “So beautiful.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next to the River of
		Forgetfulness was countless beautiful flowers.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not too far from the
		bridge was a precious gem which flashed the light, creating many
		different images. This was the legendary ‘Gem of Three Lives’,
		referring to the ‘previous life’, the ‘current life’, and the
		‘next life’.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not too far away from
		the Gem of Three Lives was a stone dais. This was the ‘Dais of
		Viewing Home’. After the souls passed the dais, they arrived at
		Grandma Meng.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Grandma Meng was a
		seemingly very ordinary old grandmother. She held a bowl of water in
		her hands, handing it over to each soul to allow them to drink from
		it. After drinking it, the souls would become sluggish and seem to be
		in a trance, as they automatically began to walk towards one of the
		six tunnels of rebirth behind Grandma Meng.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Deva. Asura. Mortal.
		Animal. Preta Ghost. Hell.” Ji Ning stared at the infathomably deep
		tunnels behind Grandma Meng.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I won’t drink, I
		won’t drink, I don’t want to forget, I don’t want to forget…”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many ghosts struggled.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But no matter how much
		they struggled, they were forced by an invisible, inexorable force to
		move forwards. When they arrived next to Grandma Meng, they were
		forced by the invisible force to drink Grandma Meng’s Elixir. No
		matter how they screamed or howled, they still drank it…and after
		drinking it, no matter how strong their emotions were or how deep
		their memories were, they forgot it all. By then, they were no longer
		themselves.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m entering the
		Heaven Realm. Although I’ll recover my memories at age sixteen, but
		by then, will my memories of the sixteen years of life in the Heaven
		Realm will take precedence, or would the memories of my previous life
		take precedence? By then, would I still be me?” Ji Ning felt a hint
		of grief.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He understood.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this life, he only
		lived eighteen years. In the Heaven Realm, during those sixteen
		years, he would be far more powerful than in this life. Most likely,
		his current memories would be secondary.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But what can I do?”
		Ji Ning was already bound, and he moved forward under that force’s
		control.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ghosts ahead of him
		all drank from Grandma Meng’s Elixir. In six more ghosts, it would
		be his turn.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grandma Meng’s
		Elixir.” Ji Ning stared at Grandma Meng.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Grandma Meng suddenly
		raised her head.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the first time
		Ji Ning had seen Grandma Meng raise her head. Grandma Meng stared far
		away into the skies, and then her ancient voice said in fury,
		“Impudent!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The skies seemed to
		shatter and the earth seemed to break. The surrounding skies suddenly
		began to fracture, and the surrounding mist began to break down and
		dissipate, exposing the countless ghosts in line in the outside
		world. The fractures in space transformed a large number of ghosts
		into dust. Like bubbles that were popping, countless souls began to
		disappear, all of them screaming in misery.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Boom!” “Boom!”
		“Boom!” “Boom!” “Boom!” In mid-air, countless black
		dragons could be seen flying about, each one of them seeing as
		enormous as a massive, sinuous mountain chain. Ji Ning seemed to be
		able to see even those heart-freezing dragon scales. The countless
		dragons were wandering about, having fun in the skies, and then each
		of the black dragons vomited forth multiple streams of black
		lightning. Instantly, trillions of bolts of black lightning slashed
		down, every single one of them causing the heavens and the earth to
		break apart.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Life and Death
		Formation of the Calamity Dragons? How is it that you dare to attack
		the Six Paths of Reincarnation? This is a grave sin!” Grandma Meng
		shouted with unbridled fury. Transforming into a beam of light, she
		flew towards the tens of millions of black dragons in the sky.
		Instantly, those countless black dragons surrounded Grandma Meng.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world was
		fracturing, and the muddied waters of the River of Forgetfulness
		began to form waves. Any ghosts that touched those waters were
		instantly dissipated. The Bridge of Despair shattered, and the ghosts
		atop the Bridge of Despair fell directly into the River of
		Forgetfulness. As for the Six Paths of Reincarnation, those
		immeasurably deep tunnels were beginning to shake as well, and light
		was gleaming from within their depths.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh oh.” Ji Ning
		stared in terror at the calamity he was witnessing. At the same time,
		he could sense that invisible binding force dissipate.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll risk it!”
		When the binding force dissipated, Ji Ning was both surprised and
		pleased. Half hopping, half-flying, he jumped directly towards the
		‘Mortal Realm’ tunnel. The Six Paths of Reincarnation each were
		located in different places. Because most people entered the Mortal
		Realm, the Mortal Realm’s tunnel was directly behind Grandma Meng
		and was the closest one to Ji Ning. Naturally, Ji Ning chose to jump
		down into that tunnel.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The surrounding ghosts
		were all jumping down into the various reincarnation tunnels.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One ghost dared to try
		and rush towards the most distant, Heaven Realm tunnel.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom…
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A bolt of black
		lightning struck down. That ghost, who hadn’t managed to dodge in
		time, instantly dissipated, along with several other nearby ghosts.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What exactly had
		happened in the Netherworld Kingdom? Those countless black dragons
		that had been circling about in the air, those trillions of black
		lightning bolts that had wildly struck downwards…that terrifying
		scene had shocked Ji Ning. But he understood that as an ordinary
		ghost, there was no point in worrying too much about it. In addition,
		right now, he didn’t have any time to worry about it, because his
		head hurt!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning sensed that his
		head was in tremendous pain, as though something was frantically
		grabbing onto and tearing at it.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His neck hurt, and his
		body was suffering tremendous pressure.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, he felt at
		ease, and then, he felt a bone-piercing cold. At the same time, a
		breath of fresh air entered his mouth. This was the first ‘breath’
		which Ji Ning had taken since dying.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wow!” After taking
		a deep breath, Ji Ning immediately let out a cry.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cry of an infant.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A son! It’s a
		son!” Although his hearing was a bit distorted, he could still
		understand what was just said.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh. I’ve been
		reborn.” Ji Ning instantly understood.

		Chapter 3 - Birth
	</H1>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning opened his eyes
		and saw that he was being held by a giant who wore a set of white fur
		clothes. Ji Ning instantly understood that this person was a ‘giant’,
		only because right now, he was an infant being held by this man.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can leave now.”
		The man said.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The three
		maids said respectfully.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The man holding Ji Ning
		in his arms should be his father. Although he had just gotten a son,
		he still seemed like a piece of glacial ice, very hard to get close
		to. He wore a set of beautiful fur clothes, while those three maids
		also were dressed in animal fur. Clearly, they were of much poorer
		quality.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The room was quite
		empty. The wall, the dresser, the seats, the bed, all of them were
		carved from marble. The carvings were quite exquisite and gave off an
		ancient, beautiful nobility. Atop the bed was a six or seven meter
		long enormous beast fur, with the fur hanging down to the floor. At a
		glance, one could tell that this fur was no doubt extremely
		expensive. Atop that bed, there was a red-faced young woman.&lt;!-more-&gt;
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even the chairs and
		the dressers were carved from marble. The room itself should be made
		from marble as well. Father and those three women are all dressed in
		animal fur. It seems this world doesn’t have a high level of
		civilization.” Ji Ning secretly said to himself.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Son.” Despite
		holding his infant son in his arms, that man still seemed very cold,
		without a hint of a smile on his face. Only, his eyes betrayed his
		excitement.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning suddenly had
		the feeling that a mysterious cold energy entered his body. It was
		very comfortable, and then, quickly, it passed away.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yichuan, how is my
		son doing?” The woman on the bed hurriedly asked.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As expected, his
		body’s quality is ordinary.” Ji Yichuan said softly.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The woman on the bed
		had faint tears in her eyes. “Let me hold him.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The man carried the
		child over in his arms.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be good.” The
		young woman looked at the infant, her eyes filled with love.
		“Yichuan, our child was injured in the womb. Although he ate those
		natural treasures, it only repaired some of the damage. We haven’t
		done right by our child.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had been injured in
		the womb?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Natural treasures?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It seemed as though his
		parents in this world weren’t ordinary people.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Despite having just
		given birth to a child, his mother had easily been able to get off
		the bed. She was also dressed in a white fur, and was in her
		husband’s arms as they walked out of the room.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can clean up in
		here.” His father, Ji Yichuan, said to those three maids.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The three
		maids said respectfully.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the door, on
		the hallway, there was a big, snow white dog. Its fur was as long as
		cotton, and it appeared very docile. When its gaze fell upon Ji Ning,
		it was filled with excitement and love.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the wide courtyard
		outside the room was a giant, pitch-black coiling python which was
		lining the outside of the courtyard. It had circled around in
		multiple loops, and its head was raise to a height of dozens of
		meters. Its body was covered with dark, heart-stoppingly cold scales.
		The giant python slowly lowered its head and drew near.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good God!” Ji Ning
		was frightened. That snow white dog was fine. He had seen plenty of
		dogs in the past. That snow white one was just a bit bigger.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But this coiled,
		enormous monstrosity? Was it even a snake?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Coiled around in
		endless circles, and its raised head alone was dozens of meters high.
		The entire thing had to be two or three hundred meters long. Such an
		awe-inspiring beast was actually in front of his own family’s
		house? This…this was simply…
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Son.” Ji Yichuan
		didn’t pay any attention to his son’s feelings, or perhaps in
		this world, people were used to these things already and didn’t
		feel they were strange. Ji Yichuan pointed at the snow white massive
		dog in front of them. “This is your Uncle White. He is your
		father’s lifelong friend, and he’s saved your life. You must
		treat him as you would treat me.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The snow white hound
		looked lovingly at Ji Ning. Ji Ning could almost physically feel the
		deep love which the snow white hound bore him.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had to call a dog,
		‘Uncle White’?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yichuan, the child
		was just born and doesn’t understand anything yet. Is there a point
		to telling him these things?” The young woman said while holding
		the child.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if he doesn’t
		understand, this is his first time meeting with Little White.” Ji
		Yichuan raised his head to stare at the massive python. “Brother
		Black!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hiss…
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This enormous black
		python which definitely would’ve made countless nations go insane
		suddenly transformed into a black mist, and then reformed into a
		black-haired middle-aged man. The black haired man smiled towards the
		infant. “Yichuan, I still remember how when you first showed your
		budding talent, I agreed to follow you. I didn’t expect that in the
		blink of an eye, you would have a son. Child, don’t be afraid. I am
		your Uncle Black.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go outside.”
		Ji Yichuan said. “Grandpa and the others are outside waiting as
		well. Brother Black, it’s best if you return to your regular form.
		I know it is very uncomfortable for you to be in human form.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hiss…
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black haired man
		nodded, and then he once more transformed into a black fog which
		quickly returned to that massive, coiled black python. The massive
		black python immediately slithered towards the outside. Its enormous
		body moved very quickly. Slither, slither, slither. It easily passed
		the walls and disappeared.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning felt that he
		was still in a state of shock.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although this might be
		normal to people of this world, to Ji Ning, a man from the Earth,
		this was simply too stunning. A 200-300 meter long black python had
		suddenly transformed into a black haired man, and had said that he
		was his ‘Uncle Black’?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Monster!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that the
		snow white hound is also a monster?” Ji Ning had the feeling that
		this world was more amazing than he could imagine.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Husband and wife held
		the child together as they walked out into the corridor, while by
		their side was the snow white dog. Once they reached the end of the
		corridor, they walked onto a stone paved road which led to a garden.
		Within the garden, there was a thick layer of snow. Many black
		armored guards were standing there unmoving, while in the center,
		there were several dozen people standing. These several dozen people
		all possessed all sorts of miraculous bizarre beasts, venomous pests,
		and flying beasts.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning instantly
		understood. It wasn’t that his father was special. It was that the
		people of this world all raised strange beasts. Taming them was a
		common habit.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems in the
		future, I’ll have to get used to making friends with monsters.”
		Ji Ning quickly adjusted to this new reality and began to observe
		those several dozen people. These several dozen people all seemed
		ferocious as tigers or panthers. Virtually all of them were dressed
		in beautifully cut animal furs. Only the three women were dressed in
		silk or cloth garments.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This secretly startled
		Ji Ning.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It seemed that not
		everyone in this world wore animal furs. Silk and cloth already
		existed here. Judging from the location where the three women were
		standing, they were of fairly common rank within those dozens of
		people. Clearly, the quality of those silk or cloth clothes weren’t
		any higher than the lavish, exquisitely cut animal furs.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-haired old
		man standing in front walked over. “Come, Yichuan. Let me hold the
		child.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grandfather.” Ji
		Yichuan nodded, then took the child over from his wife’s arms and
		delivered him to the old man.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This child truly is
		beautiful.” The silver-haired old man’s face was filled with joy.
		He said in praise, “Yichuan, now that you have a son, I will no
		longer worry as much. I’ve been the lord of our prefecture for
		already eighty years. According to the rules of our clan, a person
		can only be a Prefecture Lord for no more than a century. I only have
		twenty years left as Prefecture Lord. Previously, I wanted you to
		succeed me in the position of the Prefecture Lord of the West
		Prefecture of our Ji clan, but you insisted on focusing on walking
		the path of the Immortals. Now that you have a son, as I see it, in
		the future, he can be the next Prefecture Lord.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The next Prefecture
		Lord?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was surprised.
		It seemed as though his status was quite high, and this clan should
		be a special one as well. Those extremely obedient female servants
		and those unmoving, black armored guards all were a testament to his
		clan’s power.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother!” A
		sudden angry shout.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Who would dare to be so
		disrespectful to the Prefecture Lord?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning looked in the
		direction of the noise. He saw a red-haired old man who emanated heat
		walk over. The man had a eye-catching red earring in his right ear.
		Wait. It wasn’t a red earring. It was a little red snake the size
		of a finger. He was actually wearing a snake in his ear?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old man with the
		snake in his ear walked forward, growling, “The matter of the
		succession to the position of Prefecture Lord can’t be so casual as
		this. In addition, who knows what sort of ability that little fellow
		would have?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yichuan’s son’s
		ability would naturally…” The silver-haired old man was extremely
		confident. At the same time, a sudden surge of heat entered Ji Ning’s
		body, then quickly dissipated.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yichuan!” The
		silver-haired old man stared in astonishment towards the grandson he
		was so proud of.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How could he not be
		shocked.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the son of Ji
		Yichuan, famed as the ‘Raindrop Sword’. The majestic Raindrop
		Sword, all by himself, had exterminated countless monsters hidden in
		deep lakes and high mountains. The countless tribes under the control
		of their West Prefecture of the Ji clan all knew of the Raindrop
		Sword. In fact, more people knew of him than knew who the Prefecture
		Lord was.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As long as his child
		ate some precious treasures while in the womb, the infant would
		naturally have the finest possible growth conditions.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother.” The
		snake elder laughed. “It seems Yichuan’s son is quite average.
		How can the West Prefecture of our Ji clan, which commands so many
		tribes, have a weak little fellow take over the important position of
		Prefecture Lord? How can the people of the Ji clan possibly submit to
		him? How can the countless tribes be willing to submit to him?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prefecture Lord.
		This little fellow, it seems, isn’t suited to the position of being
		the next Prefecture Lord.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The important
		position of Prefecture Lord cannot be so casually given away.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those few dozen people
		present were all high level members of the West Prefecture of the Ji
		clan. Many began to speak.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shut your mouth.”
		Ji Yichuan frowned. As he swept the area with his icy gaze,
		instantly, many of the clan members fell silent.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the snake elder
		said angrily, “What a huge temper. This is the West Prefecture of
		the Ji clan! What, we can’t even talk here? Your son as the
		Prefecture Lord…if your son was qualified, then given the great
		merits you yourself have rendered to the West Prefecture of the Ji
		clan, we definitely wouldn’t say anything. But your son is so very
		average. You still wish him to be Prefecture Lord? The countless
		tribes under the banner of the West Prefecture of the Ji clan must
		fight together in territorial battles, and also must struggle against
		the Diremonsters in the deep mountains and the lakes. How can a weak
		Prefecture Lord make the clan members willingly submit? How can he
		make those tribes submit? If the West Prefecture isn’t
		awe-inspiring, then how will we struggle for power against the
		surrounding organizations, and how will we go to the mountains and
		the lakes to slay the Diremonsters?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will naturally be
		the one to kill the Diremonsters of the lakes and the mountains!”
		Ji Yichuan’s voice was cold as ice.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You sure are tough.
		You live up to your reputation, Ji Yichuan. So you’ll go kill all
		of the Diremonsters hiding in all of the mountains and lakes by
		yourself? Then I, Ji Lee, will say this to you. If you can kill a
		hundred Diremonsters, then I will no longer dispute with you over who
		will become the next Prefecture Lord of the Ji clan’s West
		Prefecture. I’ll let your son take it over.” The snake elder
		sneered.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Yichuan stared at
		him.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single
		Diremonster was extremely sly and powerful. How could they be so
		easily killed? Even killing ten of them would be a miracle, much less
		a hundred.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough. The child
		was just born and can’t take all this stress.” The silver-haired
		elder stared at them, then ordered, “Tonight, we’ll hold a
		celebratory banquet at the Snowfall Hall. For now, everyone can
		leave.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The serpent elder was
		the first to respond, and he did so loudly. He immediately led more
		than half the people away with him, with the rest quickly returning
		to their own places as well, leaving this garden.

	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The banquet at Snowfall

		covered with stars. Ji Yichuan and his wife took their infant back
		home.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoah.” Ji Ning
		blearily opened his little eyes and saw the night sky filled with
		stars.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ah.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had fallen asleep.
		He had actually fallen asleep mid-way.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There had been
		fascinating performances, with musicians, drummers, and barefoot,
		fur-clad female dancers filling the hall. This was very different
		from Earth’s performances, but it was still very pleasing to the
		eye. However, he was still just an infant. Halfway through, he was
		simply too sleepy and thus he immediately fell asleep.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yichuan.” Yuchi
		Snow said with a hint of anger while walking in the snow. “At the
		banquet, why did you say that you would let our son go seize the
		golden sword? Don’t you know how hard that is?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was able to
		accomplish it.” Yichuan frowned.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are the most
		powerful member of the West Prefecture of the Ji clan. You were able
		to do it as a youth, but in the thousand year history of the Ji
		clan’s West Prefecture, how many have been like you?” Snow was
		angry. Normally, she was very gentle, but anything which involved her
		son made her anxious. “And today, when the Prefecture Lord raised
		the question of having our son becoming the next Prefecture Lord,
		five overseers had agreed. Only a single additional overseer was
		needed. All you had to do was convince a single overseer…with six
		overseers in agreement, then our son would have easily been able to
		become the next Prefecture Lord. Why go seize the golden sword?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seizing the golden
		sword was simply too hard.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan shook his head
		and sighed. “You don’t understand.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What don’t I
		understand?” Snow said angrily.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You haven’t been
		at the West Prefecture for a long time yet. You don’t understand
		the intricacies hidden within.” Yichuan explained. “The ten
		overseers of the West Prefecture are divided into the Prefecture
		Lord’s side and Ji Lee’s side. There are three centrists. If we
		were to draw another overseer into our orbit, the price would have
		been too high.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So what if the price
		is high?” Snow said unhappily.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, if we paid an
		enormous price, we could let our son become the Prefecture Lord.”
		Yichuan frowned. “But if our son is incapable, even if he is
		allowed to take the position of Prefecture Lord, he’ll just suffer
		countless miseries, unspeakable miseries. That will be a form of
		torment!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuchi Snow was stunned.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t want my
		son to be miserable.” Yichuan continued slowly. “Thus, I brought
		up seizing the golden sword.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If my son possesses
		astonishing insight and talent and is able to strengthen rapidly,
		then naturally, he’ll be able to seize the golden sword. No one
		would say a single word of dissent if he were to take over the
		Prefecture Lord position after doing so.” Yichuan said. “But if
		my son is unable to seize the golden sword, then he can just live a
		life of leisure. I, Yichuan, will protect him his entire life and let
		him live without any cares.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow seemed to have
		understood.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Becoming Prefecture
		Lord didn’t necessarily mean a life of ease. If an expert became
		the Prefecture Lord, then naturally, his rule would be stable. But if
		someone incapable took the position…even if he was forcibly
		installed, he would just be miserable.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yichuan, I was wrong
		to blame you.” Snow said softly.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan just lowered
		his head and rubbed his son’s face. “His eyes are wide open. This
		kid woke up long ago.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, Yichuan. What
		name should we give him?” Snow suddenly asked. “I asked you when
		I was pregnant, but you weren’t happy with any of the names. Now
		that he’s been born, we have to come up with a suitable name.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let his name come
		into the world alongside him.” Yichuan said. “How could I not be
		careful about it? I hadn’t made up my mind in the past, but just
		now, I suddenly thought of a name…let’s call our son ‘Ning’,
		meaning ‘calm’. No matter whether his life is normal or exciting,
		no matter if he is weak or becomes an expert, let him maintain a
		calm, peaceful heart.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning?” Snow
		murmured. “Ji Ning. Ji Ning…”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The infant in his
		mother’s arms stared with wide eyes. Was this the name which the
		First Judge, the Lord of Cui Palace, had preordained that he would
		have in the Book of Life and Death? Or was it a true coincidence?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this life, he would
		be named Ji Ning once again?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most powerful
		member of the West Prefecture of the Ji clan was the Raindrop Sword,
		Ji Yichuan.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second was the
		‘Tiger Demon’, Ji Lee.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Lee’s
		Prefecture.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations and
		felicitations, father.” A middle-aged man with several dozen braids
		in his hair said. “That Yichuan was so arrogant and blind that he
		actually said he would have his son go seize the golden sword…the
		West Prefecture has been in the hands of our Ji clan for generations.
		Not a single person has taken the Prefecture Lord position through
		seizing the golden sword.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old man with
		flaming red hair and that scarlet snake in his ears slapped his hands
		together. “When I was young, I should’ve become the Prefecture
		Lord! But at that time, I was simply too much of a show-off and ended
		up losing to my big brother, Ji Young. That old bastard Young ended
		up taking the Prefecture Lord position and has been in that position
		for eighty years!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eighty full years!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve been waiting
		all this time. Every day has been a crucible.” Lee ground his
		teeth. “I didn’t expect that his line of descent would produce
		someone like Yichuan! He truly is a glorious, outstanding talent.
		Fortunately, fortunately, Yichuan is only interested in training to
		become an Immortal and doesn’t care about becoming the Prefecture
		Lord. Yichuan was simply too arrogant today. He actually chose such a
		path for his son.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems it is the
		will of Heaven that we take the Prefecture Lord’s position.” The
		middle-aged man said excitedly.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be hasty.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lee shouted. “When I
		was young, that loss I suffered taught me…that a person can’t be
		too happy before one has actually succeeded! What we need to do is
		prepare!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, do you mean
		to say…” The man asked.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lee was frowning in
		concentration.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time slowly passed. The
		middle aged man sat off to one side, not daring to disturb him. He
		knew his father was thinking.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right!” Ji Lee
		suddenly said in a soft voice. “That’s what we’ll do!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The middle-aged man
		looked at his father. “Father, what is your plan?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In order to seize
		the golden sword, one must defeat all of the youths of the tribes and
		the descendants of the Ji clan.” Lee said in a low voice. “Although
		there are few clan members, they are able to acquire a large amount
		of treasures and secret manuals, while although there are many youths
		in the tribes, very few will get any treasures. But despite that, in
		the quadrennial Golden Sword Ceremony, out of every five or six
		ceremonies, only once will a Ji clan member win.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The middle-aged man
		nodded. “There are simply too many tribe members. There will always
		be an extremely talented person who emerges. However, no matter how
		great their talent, we won’t teach them the truly powerful arts of
		the Ji clan. We’ll only teach them some of the lesser arts.
		Although those youths of the tribes might be powerful during the
		Golden Sword Ceremony, after seventy or eighty years, the most
		powerful exponents are those of the Ji clan.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What I mean to do
		is…” Ji Lee said in a whisper. “Select a few outstanding youths
		from the tribes and give them a large amount of treasures and
		resources and train them. Without my training, those tribal youth
		talents are already so powerful. Once they receive my training, they
		will definitely skyrocket in power and become even mightier! I refuse
		to believe that the son of Yichuan will be able to defeat all of them
		and seize the golden sword.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Right.” The
		middle-aged man hurriedly nodded.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Usually, the treatment
		of the tribal youths and of the Ji clan members were totally
		different.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ji clan youths were
		of one family. Naturally, the Ji clan would treat them much better.
		But in dealing with the youths of the tribes, they would have to both
		draw them close and also control them well! But this time…he would
		use all of his talent to cultivate the most promising youths!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, if you do
		this, then Ji Yichuan’s son will definitely lose.” The
		middle-aged man said confidently.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” Lee
		laughed. “Remember. Plant some of our people by Yichuan’s side. I
		want to know how rapidly Yichuan’s son grows in power. Only knowing
		one’s own power and one’s opponent’s power will one gain
		victory!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes!” The
		middle-aged man’s eyes were shining.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuchi Snow gently
		placed her son down atop the warm bed.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, be a good boy
		and sleep tight.” Snow gently kissed her son’s face, then lay
		down on the bed as well.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A pained look was on
		Ning’s face.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He wiped the corner of
		his lips. He had just drank breast milk. What a weird sensation.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The events of the past
		twenty four hours were simply too shocking, too unbelievable. First,
		he had passed the Bridge of Despair, but then, just before he was to
		drink Grandma Meng’s Elixir, a great upheaval had occurred in the
		Netherworld Kingdom. It was as though the world was about to shatter.
		He had been lucky enough to react in time and jump into the Mortal
		Realm’s tunnel, and had been reincarnated into this world.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A snow white hound who
		was his ‘Uncle White’?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A several hundred-meter
		giant black python that could raise its head up to the level of a
		house, and also transform into a black-haired middle aged man, who
		was his ‘Uncle Black’?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And now, he was
		supposed to seize some golden sword and become some Prefecture Lord?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hey guys, did you think
		about asking me how I feel about all this?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bah. Infants have no
		human rights.” Ji Ning licked the milk from the corner of his lips
		while pondering. Still, a hint of excitement was in his eyes. “Time
		to train!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The very first day he
		had arrived here, he had sensed that his clan was a powerful one. How
		could a clan capable of commanding countless tribes be ordinary? But
		clearly, the position of Prefecture Lord had aroused interest from
		all sides. That old fellow with the red snake in his ear wasn’t
		weak either. He dared to argue against the Prefecture Lord and
		squabble with Ning’s father.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Screw it!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was still just an
		infant. There was no reason for him to worry about all these things.
		Right now, the most important thing was to train. Train in the
		visualization technique - Nuwa Painting.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nuwa Painting,
		according to the Lord of Cui Palace, was something which would allow
		him to be an outstanding figure, even if he had been born into the
		Heaven Realm and had joined the Celestial Host, much less here in the
		Mortal Realm. In the Mortal Realm, it definitely would be the most
		top tier of visualization techniques. Such a precious technique that
		had been deeply engrained into his mind was the most powerful source
		of support he would have in this world.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his past life, he
		had been tormented by illness for eighteen years. He had been
		exhausted just by strolling for half an hour. He had simply had
		enough of that powerless sensation! The sensation of being powerless
		in the face of death! He had enough! Enough! Enough!!! He would take
		his destiny into his own hands, and that destiny was to follow the
		path that the Lord of Cui Palace had spoken to him of: Training to
		become an Immortal!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Training to become an
		Immortal was the only choice he would make!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning closed his eyes
		and began.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hint of natural
		energy slowly began to enter Ji Ning’s body. It was being attracted
		into his consciousness and began to strengthen his soul. But because
		only a tiny amount of natural energy was being absorbed, neither
		Yichuan nor Snow noticed at all.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The visualization
		technique was capable of absorbing natural energy?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was simply
		incredible.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason was, this
		wasn’t an Immortal training technique, nor was it a Immortal magic
		technique. If it was an Immortal training technique, it would wildly
		devour the surrounding natural energy. But the visualization
		technique, despite absorbing just a bit of natural energy…was
		already quite incredible.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh. Tiny
		threads of elemental energy constantly entered Ning’s infant body.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Natural energy
		repeatedly entered his body and cleansed his body. Infants were born
		pure. Only after experiencing life would they be sullied by the dirt
		and grime of the world. But right now, Ning’s body had very few
		impurities within it. With the natural energy repeatedly cleansing
		him, he quickly became incomparably pure, as pure as a newborn!

	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rays of the spring
		sun shone down with lazy warmth.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A red-lipped,
		pale-faced child was standing with arms stretched out, while a
		fur-clad young lady was quickly and carefully helping him get dressed
		in his fur clothes. Another young lady was waiting next to him with a
		basin of water and a bowl with rough salt.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In my past life, I
		was always sick and dressed myself. I didn’t expect that in this
		life, I would not only be perfectly healthy, I would also have
		servants to take care of me.” Ji Ning had been served by people
		since he was born. When he sometimes automatically began to dress
		himself out of habit, the two terrified maids, ‘Spring Grass’ and
		‘Autumn Leaf’, immediately fell to their knees, trembling in
		absolute terror.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Give it to me.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now dressed, Ning took
		over the black bowl of rock salt and headed outside the room. He
		walked to a nearby fountain, then began to use those white, tough
		pieces of rock salt to ‘brush his teeth’.&lt;!-more-&gt;
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a disaster this
		era is. There are no toothbrushes. I have to use my hands to brush my
		teeth! And there’s no tooth paste, only rock salt!” Ning quickly
		finished brushing his teeth. Actually, he wasn’t sure why, but he
		was extremely clean ever since he was born, and he didn’t have any
		mouth odor. There was no need for him to brush his teeth, but his
		mother forced him to do it anyways.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gargle.” Ji Ning
		raised his head, then spat out a mouthful of water, then handed the
		basin to the nearby maid, Spring Grass.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The maid, Autumn Leaf,
		then offered him a blue stone bowl for washing his face. Ji Ning
		quickly washed his face, then wiped the water off with a cloth.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Autumn Leaf.” Ning
		stared at her. “In your tribe, do you also use salt to brush your
		teeth?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he was already
		four years old and had read many books of the clan and had learned
		many things, he actually didn’t know much about the situation
		inside the tribes.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could that be
		possible?” Autumn Leaf had a slightly freckled face. “Even the
		table salt which we use in the tribes aren’t as white and as clean
		as this salt. How can we use it to brush our teeth? The men and women
		of the tribe just use water to rinse their teeth. Many will go their
		entire lives without brushing their teeth. And also, this sort of
		basin is extremely valuable and is usually used to boil soup. How can
		we use it to brush our teeth?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boil soup?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning rubbed his eyes.
		This basin could be used to boil soup?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go eat.”
		Ning turned his head and walked away, with the two maids behind him.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father. Mother.”
		Ning arrived in the main hall and immediately stood there and bowed.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His father, Ji Yichuan,
		was seated in front, while his mother was seated to the left. His own
		position was towards the right. In front of him was a black, marble
		table, with three big bowls on it. One contained steaming, aromatic
		meat, another had thick yet soft pastries, and the third was a bowl
		of hot water. This was his breakfast.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If this breakfast for a
		four year old was placed on Earth, it would probably be enough for
		three adults to eat. But in this world…every child could eat a
		tremendous amount of food. Ning was no different.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mmm, it tastes so
		good.” Ning grabbed a chunk of meat from the first bowl and ate it.
		Despite having the taste buds of an Earth human, he still felt the
		food was delicious. Ning knew…because his body was physically
		average, ever since he was young, he had been fed special food. The
		meat he ate wasn’t meat from ordinary beasts; it was meat from
		magical, monstrous beasts. In the tribes, monster meat was extremely
		rare and precious, but Ning was able to eat it every single day.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had special effects.
		It would make Ning stronger!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m done eating!”
		Ning ate very fast; it could be described as simply ‘scarfing the
		food down’. And then, with a gurgle, he drank all the hot water as
		well.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
		ran out, with Spring Grass and Autumn Leaf chasing after him.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow watched her son
		run away and laughed, “Although Ning was rather weak when he was
		born, that’s only because he was injured while in the womb. His
		potential is still very high. Look, every day, he’s able to eat so
		much monster meat. His body will definitely grow stronger.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan nodded as well.
		Monstrous beasts weren’t like ordinary animals. Monstrous beasts
		absorbed the natural elemental energy of the world, and their flesh
		contained that energy as well. Normally, children wouldn’t be
		hungry for two days if they ate it for breakfast, but Ning ate it for
		three meals a day. Clearly, he was able to absorb it all.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………………..
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two maids were
		carrying thick books behind Ning. Behind them were eighteen massive
		guards who wore scarlet red armor. The red armored guards had
		mysterious runes scrawled onto their armor, which faintly seemed to
		hum with a strange energy, causing all of them to emanate a powerful
		aura.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Crimson Guards were
		the most powerful soldiers of the Ji clan. The West Prefecture only
		had a hundred Crimson Guards who listened only to the command of Ji
		Yichuan.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan arranged
		eighteen Crimson Guards to protect Ning at all times. If Ning was to
		ever be outside the house, the eighteen Crimson Guards would stay
		right by his side.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To the training
		yard.” Ning’s journey was very smooth.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nobody dared to block
		his path!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The city of the West
		Prefecture was a great and massive city. Within the city was hundreds
		of thousands of citizens, and there were three major areas. They were
		the inner city, the military camp, and the training grounds.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The inner city was
		where the Ji clan members of West Prefecture lived. It was the
		central administrative area!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The military camp was
		the place where the soldiers controlled by the Ji clan of West
		Prefecture were stationed.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The training grounds
		was where the youths of the Ji clan and of the many tribes controlled
		by the Ji clan would come to train.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The inner city and the
		training grounds were connected by a straight line. Ning led his
		servants and guards directly towards the central training grounds.
		The vast training plaza currently had thousands on thousands of
		youths there training.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look, it is Ji
		Ning!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The only child of
		the Raindrop Sword? Ji Ning?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are his female
		slaves holding books? When those roving merchants came to my clan in
		the past to sell books, I heard that that the cost of each book was a
		thousand lambskins.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many of the youths in
		the training grounds were talking amongst themselves. There were many
		who had matured quickly, and thus knew that this child was the son of
		the number one expert of the Ji clan, Ji Yichuan, the ‘Raindrop
		Sword’. Many of the youths actually were quite fond of this child,
		because although Ji Ning came from a powerful and noble clan, he
		didn’t bully them at all. But no matter how fond of him they were,
		they wouldn’t dare tease him.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oof.” Ji Ning sat
		down on the chair, his eyes filled with excitement.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the previous life,
		he was often by himself, and so now, in his heart, he really enjoyed
		crowded, rowdy areas.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Give me the books.”
		Ning took a thick and heavy book from the hands of Spring Grass. This
		tome really was thick, roughly twenty centimeters thick, and it was
		bound by the soft skin of some monstrous beast. In this era where
		slavery still existed, books were quite precious. Ning, however,
		could casually flip through the books in their private library and
		even take a few out.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After being born, Ning
		had primarily done two things…
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first thing was to
		train in according to the visualization technique - Nuwa’s
		Painting. His soul had become strong and sturdy, to the point where
		he now had photographic memory. Just half a month ago, he had even
		been able to reach the level of dividing his mind into two.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What did dividing his
		mind in two meant? For example, he could simultaneously use his left
		hand to write an essay while using his right hand to paint a
		painting. It was as though his consciousness had been divided into
		two parts which didn’t interfere with each other.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, this wasn’t
		particularly miraculous. According to the books, those who trained in
		the path to become an Immortal could all use their minds to
		accomplish multiple things at once. They would be able to use several
		treasures to attack at the same time. The true brilliance of the Nuwa
		Painting was that Ji Ning was able to divide his mind in two after
		visualizing it for just two years.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second thing he had
		done was to read!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Half a year after his
		birth, when Ning was able to form some words, he had hugged a book
		and pointed at what looked lke some words in it and said, “This,
		this, this…” Spring Grass and Autumn Leaf, being personal maids,
		all knew how to read. Naturally, they didn’t dare to not reply.
		With their help and with guesswork, he soon learned how to recognize
		the words.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, his reading
		began!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the saying goes,
		‘spending time sharpening the knife makes the cutting go faster’.
		Although he was fully devoted to the idea of training to become an
		Immortal, Ning understood that sometimes, haste made for
		ineffectiveness. Reading was a way of ‘sharpening the knife’ to
		become an Immortal. First of all, he needed to understand what this
		world was like. He would also learn more about what it meant to
		become an Immortal, and what types of Immortals there were, and so on
		and so forth.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only after learning
		about this would he know what the best choice for himself would be!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After reading many
		books, Ning came to know that the Ji clan of West Prefecture was a
		small power located within the vast expanse of land ruled over by the
		Grand Xia Dynasty!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The territory ruled
		over by the Ji clan of West Prefecture stretched for three thousand
		kilometers from north to south and five thousand kilometers from east
		to west. There were countless tribes who lived on this land, and all
		of them were ruled by the Ji clan!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What’s more, this was
		nothing more than the Ji clan of West Prefecture.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ji clan was an
		ancient clan. It was divided into the Central Prefecture, the East
		Prefecture, the West Prefecture, the North Prefecture, and the South
		Prefecture. All five Prefectures combined made up the entirety of the
		Ji clan!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…the Grand Xia
		Dynasty was simply too large. Its territory was nearly limitless, and
		it was an ancient dynasty which was born during the ‘Fiendgod Era’.
		Over a trillion years had passed since the terrifying Fiendgod Era.
		For a dynasty to be able to last a trillion years was something which
		Ning found to be inconceivable.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ji clan was nothing
		more than a small power within the borders of the Grand Xia Dynasty,
		but to the countless local surrounding tribes, the Ji clan was
		definitely their absolute rulers!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This truly is a
		world where Immortals and Devils abound.” Ji Ning sighed mentally.
		“Ordinary mortal realms find it hard for an Empire to sustain for
		even a thousand years, but in this ancient world, an ancient, large
		empire is something which is beyond my imagination.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. It has been
		over two year since I was born, and I know very little about training
		to become an Immortal. It is time I begin.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had spent a year in
		the womb, and when he was born, it was winter, while a new year had
		come soon after that. Thus, he had lived in this world for over two
		years now.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That very night.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both sides of the main
		hall were filled with lit lamps, and the entire hall was extremely
		bright. His father continued to sit where he usually sat, with his
		mother on the left and Ning on the right. The table was still covered
		with meat as well as plates of vegetables and grains.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nom nom nom.” Ning
		blew through the meat on the table like a twister, and then raised
		his head up. “Father, mother!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrm, what is it?”
		Yichuan looked at his son, and Snow did as well.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although their son’s
		intelligence caused them boundless joy, it didn’t startle them too
		much, because in this vast world, there were plenty of people who
		were devilishly clever.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to train!”
		Ning said seriously. “I wish to train to become an Immortal!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing the serious look
		on her son’s face, Snow began to laugh. “Train to become an
		Immortal? Yichuan, our son wishes to train to become an Immortal!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal?” Yichuan
		looked at his son coolly. “Do you know what training to become an
		Immortal means?”

	</H1>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t know.
		Please instruct me, father.” Ning said respectfully.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, after having
		read so many books, Ning had learned about it long ago. But as a four
		year old child, there was no need for him to appear so devilishly
		intelligent.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then I will tell you
		and let you understand.” Yichuan’s voice was like ice. “First,
		let’s talk about the seven major stages.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first stage,
		Houtian. Lifespan of a hundred years.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second stage,
		Xiantian. Lifespan of two hundred years”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The third stage,
		Zifu, the ‘Violet Palace’. At this level, one will be addressed
		as Zifu Disciple. Lifespan of five hundred years.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fourth stage,
		Wanxiang, ‘Manifestations’. At this level, one will be addressed
		as Wanxiang Adept. Lifespan of eight hundred years.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fifth stage,
		Primal. Can be referred to as Primal Daoist.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The sixth stage,
		Void. Can be referred to as ‘Land Immortal’, or ‘Earth
		Immortal’. In the later levels of the Void stage, a heavenly
		tribulation will test them. If they fail, then they will die and
		their spirits will be extinguished. If a Primal’s body is destroyed
		but manages to escape with his soul, then he will become a ‘Loose
		Immortal’, whose power is roughly on par with the ‘Earth
		Immortals’.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The seventh stage,
		Celestial Immortal. Only at this stage can one be considered to have
		ascended beyond the Three Realms and no longer be formed by the Five
		Elements!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan stared at Ning
		after speaking. He wanted to see the look of awe and surprise on his
		son’s face…but Ning was just listening intently.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You say you wish to
		train to become an Immortal. Thus, I wish you to know how hard it is
		to become an Immortal.” Ji Yichuan’s voice sank down. “The
		first obstacle to becoming an Immortal…is to pass from the Houtian
		stage to the Xiantian stage!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What does Xiantian
		mean? Only a lifeform which was naturally born by the heavens and the
		earth can be described as a Xiantian lifeform. In the distant
		Fiendgod Era, there were Fiendgods that were born naturally by the
		heavens and by the earth and which possessed tremendous power from
		their birth. In addition, there are those who are reborn into the
		Heavenly Realms as ‘Devas’ or as ‘Asuras’. These Devas and
		Asuras are all birthed by nature itself, and thus by their very
		nature, they are a Xiantian lifeform. This makes it very fast for
		them to train, because only Xiantian life forms can train to become
		an Immortal!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is impossible for
		mortals to train to become an Immortal…but the Heavens always leave
		a thread of hope. Thus, in the past, benevolent elders created a set
		of training techniques which can allow the bodies of ordinary people
		become akin to the bodies of Xiantian lifeforms. Only then did it
		become possible for ordinary people to train to become an Immortal.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But for an ordinary
		person to become a Xiantian lifeform is against the natural laws of
		the universe, making it very hard! The success rate is lower than one
		in ten thousand! Tell me, is it hard or not?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
		listen.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiantian lifeform? If
		it wasn’t for that huge disturbance in the Netherworld Kingdom, he
		probably would have already reincarnated and become a Deva in the
		Heavenly Realms. Naturally, that would mean he would already be a
		Xiantian lifeform. However, currently he was a mortal…and indeed,
		for a mortal to reach the Xiantian stage was an extremely difficult
		path.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second great
		obstacle to becoming an Immortal…from the Xiantian stage to the
		Zifu stage!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only by establishing
		a Zifu, also known as a ‘Violet Palace’, can one continue to
		train as an Immortal. Establishing a ‘Violet Palace’ is like
		laying the ‘foundation’ when building a house, or seeding the
		fields in order to harvest the crops. The Violet Palace is the crop
		field and is the core for an Immortal. It is the basic underpinning
		of the path of Immortals! Only after one has truly established a
		‘Violet Palace’ in one’s body can one embark on the route to
		becoming an Immortal. And only then can one be titled a Zifu
		Disciple! For a Xiantian expert to establish a ‘Violet
		Palace’…perhaps one in a thousand will succeed. Tell me, is it
		hard or not?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right. It was hard.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time, he
		continued to listen carefully. The books of the Ji clan of the West
		Prefecture only described these two obstacles. They didn’t describe
		the obstacles after that.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In order to
		establish a Zifu and become an Immortal, one must possess a
		world-shaking power.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But becoming an
		Immortal, by its very nature, is against the laws of the universe.
		Thus, starting from the day you step onto the path of the Immortals,
		in other words from the day on which you establish your Zifu, you
		will be tested every three hundred years. Every nine hundred years,
		you will undergo a major tribulation. Thus, as the saying goes,
		‘Three centuries a calamity, nine centuries a tribulation.
		Calamities are easy to avoid, but tribulations are hard to escape!’
		A test every three centuries, and a tribulation every nine…after
		embarking on the path to becoming an Immortal, this will continue
		forever, unless you become a Celestial Immortal. Otherwise, the
		‘Three Calamities, Nine Tribulations’ will become your eternal
		fate.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three Calamities, Nine
		Tribulations?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three centuries a
		calamity, nine centuries a tribulation. Calamities are easy to avoid,
		but tribulations are hard to escape?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning truly was shocked
		by this. Unless one became a Celestial Immortal, everyone who trained
		in the path of Immortals would have to deal with a test every three
		centuries.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Yichuan and Yuchi
		Snow looked at their son. Right now, there was a look of shock and
		disbelief on their son’s face. Seeing the stunned look, Yichuan
		nodded slightly. He had finally managed to shock the little rascal.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our son is still
		very young. Why did you tell him all those things?” Snow said
		unhappily.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother.” Ji Ning
		lifted his head up, a smile on his lips. “It is fine.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Yichuan looked at
		him in surprise.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father.” Ji Ning
		laughed. “From mortal to Xiantian, from Xiantian to Zifu. These two
		obstacles alone…are extremely difficult. The ‘Three Calamities,
		Nine Tribulations’ are very distant and very far off. I don’t
		need to worry about them at all for now.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Yichuan
		nodded. “Your attitude isn’t bad. You are correct. Right now,
		there truly is no need for you to think about becoming a Zifu
		Disciple. That’s too far away for you. At the vast area around
		Mount Swallow, the strongest people in the countless tribes and in
		the Ji clan are only at the Zifu Disciple level. The path of the
		Immortals is a hard one. Even our massive Grand Xia Dynasty would
		perhaps produce only a single Celestial Immortal in the space of a
		million years.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded gently.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Netherworld
		Kingdom, the Ruler of Cui Palace had told him that the ‘Nuwa
		Painting’ would only give him a chance at becoming a Celestial
		Immortal, and that there were still many obstacles to overcome. And
		that was assuming that he was going to be a Deva and also a soldier
		in the armies of Heaven. From this, one could imagine how hard it was
		for one to become a Celestial Immortal. To escape the confines of the
		Three Realms and no longer be subject to the Five Elements wasn’t
		so easily done.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you still desire
		to train to become an Immortal?” Yichuan looked at Ning.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan nodded
		slightly. If the boy had been terrified just by hearing about this,
		Yichuan would have been disappointed. What he didn’t know was…how
		could Ning possibly be scared as easily as this? There was nothing
		without risk. Even walking on the street, one might be killed by a
		rock falling down from the skies. Even when eating, one might choke
		to death. Training to become an Immortal naturally would be extremely
		risky. It would be bizarre if it wasn’t.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…”
		Yichuan frowned. “You are too young, and training techniques are
		very complicated. If I was to transmit a high-class Immortal training
		technique to you and you trained in a wrong direction, it would harm
		your body. But ordinary Immortal techniques aren’t worth learning…”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father.” Ning
		said. “I wish to learn the Fiendgod Body Refining Technique.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? You know about
		Body Refining?” Yichuan was extremely surprised, and Snow began to
		laugh. “It seems our son has read quite a few books. He even knows
		that there are two main paths of Immortal training.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were two primary
		paths of training to become an Immortal.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first was in Ki
		Refining, refining ki energy! 99% of those who trained to become an
		Immortal chose this path. This path allowed one to use many
		mysterious Immortal treasures, create complicated golems, control
		large amounts of deadly magical beasts, develop powerful magical
		formations, and also use some extremely vile techniques…in a word,
		this was an extremely glorious and profound path.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other path was in
		Body Refining.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Supposedly, the three
		Realms had each given birth to many Fiendgods. All of them were born
		from nature itself and were powerful from their birth! As for the
		creator of the universe, Pangu, he himself was the mightiest of them,
		the Fiendgod of Primordial Chaos. He also possessed the most powerful
		body…and thus, a number of elders managed to develop this ‘Fiendgod
		Body Refining’ technique, which would allow the practitioners to
		possess bodies on par with Fiendgods. Indestructible bodies,
		possession of boundless strength, having three heads and six arms,
		regenerating from a single drop of blood, immortal and undying…these
		all belonged to the Fiendgod Body Refining method.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Reputedly, at the same
		level of development, a Fiendgod Body Refiner would be able to
		totally suppress his opponents!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Body Refining is a
		hundred times more difficult than Ki Refining.” Yichuan said
		seriously. “The Fiendgod Body Refining method allows one to possess
		the power of a Fiendgod. How powerful is that? Hard, very hard…”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, first I’ll
		train the body. Afterwards, I will develop Ki.” Ning said. “These
		two training methods can be simultaneously progressed in. By then,
		I’ll take whatever path I am most skilled in, which will be my
		primary path. In addition, weren’t you afraid that I am too young
		and that training in ki will damage my veins? The Fiendgod Body
		Refining technique doesn’t have this risk.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan and Snow
		glanced at each other.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It seemed their son had
		thought things through. Indeed, the Fiendgod Body Refining technique
		primarily exercised the entire body’s muscles and internal organs.
		As for the blood vessels? It didn’t have much to do with that at
		all. It must be known that Innate Fiendgods came in all types, and
		their veins were totally different from the veins of human beings.
		The benevolence of those ancestors had developed the Fiendgod Body
		Refining technique from the bodies of the Fiendgods. Naturally, they
		ignored the veins.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright!” Yichuan
		nodded. “The Fiendgod Body Refining method is incomparably
		precious. Our Ji clan in total has nineteen books on Fiendgod Body
		Refining scattered through our five prefectures. I will let you
		choose the one you wish to train in!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning was
		extremely excited.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Black.”
		Yichuan shouted towards the outside.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black-haired
		middle-aged man appeared from outside. His eyes faintly glowed with
		red light, and his eyes were rather long. It was the human form of
		that massive black python.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Black.” Ning
		hurriedly called out. Two years ago, when he was born, he had learned
		that this black haired man was a Diremonster who had already trained
		to reach the ‘Xiantian lifeform’ stage. Generally speaking,
		animals who had reached a certain level of intelligence would be
		called ‘monsters’. After beginning to absorb the energy of
		nature, since they didn’t possess special training techniques, it
		was even harder for them to train than it was for humans. Only when
		they broke through to become Xiantian lifeforms would they possess
		the ability to transform themselves!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-haired man
		smiled and nodded. “Yichuan, what do you need?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’d like to
		trouble you to make a journey to the library.” Yichuan said. “Bring
		the abridged versions of those nineteen training methods of the
		Fiendgod Body Refining techniques here. Ning wants to use them.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning wants to use
		them?” The black-haired man looked at Ning with a laugh. “Someone
		who trains with the Fiendgod Body Refining would have the power of a
		Fiendgod. It seems Ning is quite ambitious.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-haired man
		disappeared into thin air.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning took a deep breath
		as he waited. Uncle Black spoke the truth. He was indeed ambitious.
		The first reason was because he knew that due to his youth, his
		father probably wouldn’t allow him to train in Ki Refining.
		Self-study? Ning didn’t have the confidence. The second was that
		the Fiendgod Body Refining method had some very powerful benefits. To
		kill a Fiendgod practitioner was more than a thousand times more
		difficult than to kill a ki practitioner! Fiendgod Body Refining
		experts, at the same level, could totally dominate a Ki Refining
		expert!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had both strong
		self-preservation abilities and strong power. Just based on these two
		alone, Ning took a liking to the Fiendgod Body Refining method.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hu!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A gentle wind appeared
		out of nowhere, and the black-haired man appeared in the middle of a
		hall, a smile on his face. “Nineteen copies of abridged versions of
		Fiendgod Body Refining techniques.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning.” Yichuan
		looked at his son. “The abridged versions only have the first parts
		of each Immortal training technique, combined with a summary and
		description of the technique. Take a close look and see which one you
		want.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-haired man
		placed the nineteen tomes in front of Ning.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single tome was
		very thin. After all, these were abridged versions. Even if they were
		stolen, they wouldn’t pose a loss for the Ji clan. They couldn’t
		possibly place precious Immortal training copies in their entirety in
		the library, after all. However, even these abridged versions of the
		Fiendgod Body Refining weren’t freely available for others to see.
		This was why Yichuan had sent the black-haired man to make the trip.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nineteen tomes.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning began to read in

		breath. This was a critical choice! One which would determine his
		destiny!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He picked up a book and
		began to read.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Calamity Fiend]. To
		train it, one needed to cover one’s body with magic tattoos and use
		hellfire to temper one’s body. It was extremely painful. After
		covering the body with nine different types of magic tattoos and
		after having been tempered by hellfire 81 times, the body would
		totally transform and become that of a Xiantian lifeform, instantly
		acquiring boundless strength, the ability to belch hellfire, and
		immediately regrow a severed arm. This was an extremely hard yet
		extremely fast way of training. Theoretically, one only needed 81
		days in order to reach the Xiantian level.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Indestructible Blood
		Fiend]. The pain this caused was even greater than that of the
		[Calamity Fiend] training method. It required three years of magic
		tattoos, three years of a hellish, tormented existence.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Song of the Inferno].
		This required one to train next to a blazing inferno, then to be
		engulfed by a blazing inferno, and then finally to enter the lava of
		a volcano without being harmed at all. It required a person to become
		one with fire. Once a person could control the limitless power of
		fire, the one would be considered to have reached the Xiantian level…
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Reading these three,
		Ning began to frown.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why was it that these
		Fiendgod training methods were all so painful? It was worse than
		torture!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You foolish child.”
		Snow couldn’t help but speak out. “Only a few Fiendgod Body
		Refining methods are truly painful. Only five of these nineteen books
		are excruciating painful. The others aren’t nearly as bad. I didn’t
		expect that the first three you picked up…”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh!” Ning let out
		a sigh of relief.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan, seated nearby,
		said coldly, “Fiendgod Body Refining is far more difficult than Ki
		Refining. For a mortal to become a Xiantian lifeform is against the
		natural law of the world. To reach that level through the most
		difficult method, the Fiendgod Body Refining method…of course it is
		hard! In addition, these methods which require miserable agony and
		difficulties, although they are quick, can be considered heterodox
		methods which cannot be considered to have a good foundation.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded as he
		continued to read.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Vajra Buddhist
		Sutras]. This was a type of Buddhist Vajra training method.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Freeform Soul]. It
		required an extremely long period of time to train, but after
		reaching the Xiantian level, it allowed one to freely transform one’s
		body and filled one with life. Even if one was chopped into many tiny
		pieces, one would quickly reform. This was one of the topmost
		life-preserving types of Fiendgod Body Training.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Crimsonbright Diagram
		of the Nine Heavens]. Without question, the number one type of
		Fiendgod Body Training method!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes turned
		hungry, and he immediately stared at the [Crimsonbright Diagram of
		the Nine Heavens] and began to read carefully.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Crimsonbright
		Diagram of the Nine Heavens] had nine parts.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first three levels
		were for the Houtian stage.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The middle three levels
		were for Xiantian lifeforms.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The later three levels
		were for the Zifu stage.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It really is
		different. Those other training methods, at their peak, only allowed
		the trainees to become peak Xiantian lifeforms. But this
		[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] allows a person to reach
		the peak Zifu level.” Ning continued to read carefully despite his
		excitement.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon reaching the
		Xiantian level, one would be able to control water and fire, and also
		possess astonishing physical strength. One’s body would be light
		and agile, and all six of the senses would be sharpened. Severed
		limbs would regrow.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon reaching the Zifu
		level, one would be able to regenerate from a single drop of blood.
		Upon reaching the Wanxiang stage, one would have amazing powers, such
		as growing three heads and six arms, the Kuafu Sunchaser ability, or
		Shining Dragon Eyes ability. But of course, the prerequisite was that
		one would need to be trained in these magical powers.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fiendgod Body Refining
		adepts were able to easily suppress Ki Refining adepts of the same
		level.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the [Crimsonbright
		Diagram of the Nine Heavens] was able to suppress all other types of
		Fiendgod Body Refining techniques!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was publicly
		knowledged!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no dispute!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But training in it was
		extremely hard, the hardest of all. This, too, was undisputed!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That will be my
		choice!” After flipping through the remaining Fiendgod Body
		Refining books, without hesitating at all, Ning made his choice.
		“[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve chosen?”
		Yichuan looked at his son.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan said slowly,
		“Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens’. This is publicly
		acknowledged by everyone in the world as the most powerful Fiendgod
		Body Refining method. It is far more profound than the likes of the
		‘Song of the Inferno’, the ‘Vajra Buddhist Sutra’, or the
		‘Calamity Fiend’ techniques. And that’s just at the Zifu level.
		The later stages of it are even more profound. If you are able to
		become a Zifu Disciple, it would be very easy for you to advance to
		higher levels as well.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the most
		widely spread and most easily obtainable type of Fiendgod Body
		Refining technique.” Yichuan looked at his son. “But it is also
		the hardest!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had spent two years
		here in this world reading many books. He knew that refining
		techniques were extremely important! The more profound the training
		technique, the harder it was to train in. For the higher level books
		regarding the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] to be
		easily obtainable meant that it was all the more important for him to
		choose this one.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It has the greatest
		power! The undisputed best!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is the most
		widespread one!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is the most
		easily obtainable method!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan looked at his
		son. “It has countless merits, and just one flaw; it is extremely
		difficult! There hasn’t been a single member of the Ji clan of any
		of our five Prefectures who managed to reach the fourth part and
		become a Xiantian lifeform.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? Not a single
		member of the Ji clan in all five Prefectures has been able to use it
		to become a Xiantian lifeform?” Ning was shocked.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was fine if they
		didn’t reach the Zifu stage.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But not even one had
		reached the Xiantian lifeform stage?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Yichuan
		said. “Not a single one. Because it is simply too hard, far harder
		than you can imagine. But I must admit that it is the most mysterious
		and most powerful Fiendgod Body Refining method. Even in the legends
		of the Fiendgods, this technique is the most powerful one!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then this will be my
		choice!” Ning didn’t hesitate at all.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was born into the
		world with the likes of the [Nuwa Painting], one of the highest class
		visualization techniques which would allow him to stand out even
		amongst the armies of Heaven. With such a firm foundation, how could
		he not at least give it a shot? Even if he failed, that wouldn’t be
		a big deal. He could then choose to train in another technique.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine!” Yichuan
		revealed a rare smile on his face. He was very happy with his son’s
		resoluteness. “Then I will go get the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the
		Nine Heavens] for you.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, father.”
		Ning was filled with anticipation.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dark night.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The door to the room
		was closed, and inside the room, the arm-thick candles were
		flickering. There were only three people in the room. Yichuan, Snow,
		and their son, Ning.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was holding an
		extremely thick book with scarlet red letters and reading through it.
		This was the legendary, most powerful of techniques: [Crimsonbright
		Diagram of the Nine Heavens].
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It really is hard.”
		Ning was frowning as he read it.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Crimsonbright
		Diagram of the Nine Heavens] had several major obstacles.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first was the
		introduction. In order to begin training in it, one had to be able to
		sense the ‘Great Yang’ (the Sun) and the ‘Great Yin’ (the
		Moon) in the skies. Many other Fiendgod training methods required the
		absorption of elemental energy, such as fire, water, or electricity
		in order to build up power. But the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the
		Nine Heavens] required its practitioners to immediately begin sensing
		those two greatest of celestial bodies, and to absorb the energy of
		the Sun and the Moon.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many trainees simply
		couldn’t sense the Sun and the Moon at all. And this was just the
		first step!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Afterwards, by
		absorbing the energy of the Sun and the Moon, one’s entire body
		would become covered with divine tattoos. This was the second part!
		After the Divine Sun Tattoo and the Divine Moon Tattoo were
		completely formed, one could be considered as having completed the
		first level of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]!
		Actually, from this very first level, one could tell how unimaginably
		profound this technique was, because many of the other techniques,
		such as the [Calamity Fiend] technique, all relied on physically
		carving the magic tattoos onto one’s body.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But for the
		[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], those tattoos would be
		formed naturally, and the divine tattoos were of the Moon and the
		Sun!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once the first level
		was mastered, one was usually able to easily reach the third level
		without any problems.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But breaking through to
		the fourth level and becoming a Xiantian lifeform was even more
		difficult.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It required ‘Yin and
		Yang to Fuse, Water and Fire Become One’. Only then could one break
		past and become a Xiantian lifeform.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The later
		obstacles…those were too far off. There was no need to worry about
		them.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Finishing
		reading, Ning let out a long breath.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan and Snow looked
		at their son.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, please
		instruct me with regards to the mysteries hidden within the first
		level of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens].” Ning
		looked at his father.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understanding the
		[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] is very easy.” Yichuan
		said. “All you need to do is follow the instructions on the
		pictures. There are nine pictures to the first level. It is very
		simple.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He had
		read many books in this world, and when he flipped through it, he had
		quickly learned what the training method was. But he was worried that
		he might have missed some sort of profound meaning. After all,
		training was something he couldn’t be too rash about. Since his
		father had said that the instructions in this book were very clear,
		then it was time to start.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning closed his eyes
		and raised his fists, then bowed down…this was the first diagram:
		Bowing to the Sun and the Moon!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He carried out all of
		the movements in accordance with the pictures, seeming almost to move
		in accordance with a strange ritual dance, and his body carried
		within it a strange, ancient aura.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrm?” Yichuan was
		surprised.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His very first
		attempts at the movement are so accurate and so precise.” Snow was
		surprised as well. Although most people wanted to make the movements
		properly, they wouldn’t actually be able to do so as precisely as
		they wished. However, Ning had been training in accordance to the
		[Nuwa Painting] since his birth. His soul was very powerful, and he
		had extremely strong control over his body as a result. Given that he
		had also constantly been cleansed by the energy of nature and his
		soul was as pure as an infants, it was quite natural that he could
		easily make accurate movements.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s final movement
		was to sit down in a kneeling position, his two arms hanging down in
		front of him, as though one was resting on the sun while the other
		was resting on the moon.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Utter silence.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan and Snow were
		holding their breaths as well. They knew that it was the critical
		movement. The earlier dancing movements were only for the purpose of
		allowing one to sense the ‘Great Yang’ (the Sun) and the ‘Great
		Yin’ (the Moon). Whether or not Ning would be able to sense those
		two most exalted of stellar bodies…
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Despite this just being
		the introductory part to the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine
		Heavens], it had prevented countless people from training in it.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them knew
		that the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] was the hardest
		Fiendgod Body Refining method to train, and they knew that the chance
		of their four year old son being able to master the introductory part
		was very low. However, parents always hoped that their children would
		succeed. They waited, hoping for a joyous surprise to happen…

		Chapter 8 - The Moon in One Hand, the Sun in the Other
	</H1>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could feel his
		consciousness passing through multiple layers of the world’s
		obstructions, constantly going forward…after passing through
		countless layers, he entered an infinite, endless void. Deep within
		that infinite void was two incomparably enormous stellar bodies.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One was an enormous
		stellar body which had huge plumes of raging flames dancing on its
		surface. It seemed like an enormous ball of flame, and it illuminated
		the endless void.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other was covered
		with a layer of unending ice, with an enormous osmanthus tree in the
		middle of the ice. The stellar body’s cold light also illuminated
		part of the world.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These two ancient
		stellar bodies, one was the Solar Star (the Sun), the other was the
		Lunar Star (the Moon).
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too beautiful. Too
		incredible.” Ning was absolutely stunned. He felt that he could
		even ‘see’ those enormous plumes of flame and ‘see’ the
		enormous leaves of the osmanthus tree.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Others, when training
		in accordance with the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens],
		found it very hard to even hazily sense the Solar Star and the Star,
		but Ning could even ‘see’ the plumes of flame and the leaves on
		the osmanthus tree.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the hall.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan and Snow were
		watching in astonishment. They saw countless spots of starlight
		appear in the area around Ning. The countless spots of starlight were
		primarily gold and silver in color; scorching hot gold starlight and
		ice cold silver starlight. They swirled around Ning, not stopping in
		any location. Slowly, beneath Ning’s left hand, a miniature star
		formed beneath his left hand, and on it an Osmanthus Tree could
		vaguely be seen. This was the Lunar Star.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And on his right hand,
		there formed a fiery hot miniature star that was surrounded by a
		flying Golden Crow. This was the Solar Star.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Solar Star in one
		hand, and the Lunar Star in the other.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Surrounded by
		starlight, Ning’s face seemed so peaceful, so pious.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…this…”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan and Snow looked
		at each other, stunned.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Moon in one hand
		and the Sun in the other?” Yichuan couldn’t help but show his
		shock on his face, no matter how calm and collected he normally was.
		“The Osmanthus Tree was born on one, and the Golden Crow flies
		around the other?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The legendary, ‘Moon
		in one hand, Sun in the other’?” Snow stared fixedly at the two
		miniature stellar bodies which had formed in her son’s hands. “And
		even the Osmanthus Tree and the Golden Crow have appeared…”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two were in a state
		of absolute shock. They were not ordinary people. Naturally, they
		knew much more than the common person, and they had personally read
		the contents of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]
		before. They naturally knew what this scene portended. The [Scarlet
		Diagram of the Nine Shining Heavens] was extremely difficult to train
		in, and the training speed would normally be very slow.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were several
		types of ‘initiations’ one might see.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first type was
		called, ‘threads of starlight’. Only two threads of starlight
		would slowly enter the body. This was the poorest type of initiation
		and guaranteed that one would be extremely slow in training.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second type was
		called ‘clouds of starlight’. A large amount of starlight would
		surround the body and form a cloud. This was quite good, actually.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third type, was
		known as ‘a vortex of starlight, the Moon in one hand, the Sun in
		the other’. Countless flecks of starlight would swirl around the
		body like a vortex, while the left hand would form a ‘Lunar Star’,
		while the right hand would form a ‘Solar Star’. This was the peak
		result. But if the two miniature stars formed to be so realistic as
		to even show the ‘Osmanthus Tree on the Lunar Star, Golden Crow on
		the Solar Star’, then this would be the legendary perfect result.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, it wasn’t
		strange for this result to occur.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had trained using
		the [Nuwa Painting] visualization technique since he was born, a
		technique which even in the Deva realm would be a top class
		technique. He was even capable of dividing his mind. One could
		imagine how powerful his soul had become. And in addition, after
		being born, every day he had been nurtured and cleansed by natural
		elemental energy, rendering his body as pure as a newborn infant’s
		body, without any impurities. The purity of his body was on par with
		a Xiantian lifeform!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His body was as pure as
		a Xiantian lifeform’s.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His soul was so
		powerful that he could divide his mind.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With these two
		strengths combined, it was natural that he would have the utmost
		aptitude for Fiendgod Body Refining.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For my son to have
		this sort of natural gift…” Snow’s face had turned red, and she
		was so excited that her body was shaking. “Yichuan, the Moon in one
		hand, and the Sun in the other. Osmanthus Tree was born, and the
		Golden Crow flies! This is something out of the legends! Our son will
		definitely have great accomplishments when training in accordance to
		the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens].
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Yichuan
		was very excited as well.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When his son was born,
		he had sensed that his son’s arteries were very weak, and his bones
		were very ordinary as well. Although he knew that his son had been
		injured in the womb, he was still somewhat disappointed, because he
		knew…in this brutal, man-eat-man world, anyone who had no power
		would find it hard to live a good life. While he was alive, he could
		protect his son, but what if he died?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is my son! The
		son of Ji Yichuan!” Yichuan held his wife’s hand tightly, and the
		two stared with excitement and hope towards their son.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Which parents didn’t
		hope that their ‘children would fly like dragons’?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes were
		closed, and he continued to sit on his knees, holding his two hands
		in front of him limply, with the Lunar Star in one, and the Solar
		Star in the other.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those two miniature
		floating Solar Star and Lunar Stars were separately transmitting
		energy nonstop into Ning’s body. The power of the Sun and the power
		of the Moon were quickly absorbed by the ravenous cells in his body,
		and Ning’s entire musculature and bone structure were undergoing
		constant transformations.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swish…” A layer
		of ice suddenly appeared on the beast fur clothes which Ning was
		wearing.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But then, “Crackle
		crackle crackle.” The back of Ning’s clothes suddenly began to
		burn with fire.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both frozen and
		blazing.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This constant
		interchange was resulting in his furs starting to split apart.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrm?” Yichuan
		frowned. He pointed with a finger, and a ray of blue flowing light
		leaped out of his finger towards Ning’s back, and the already
		half-ragged fur clothes totally split apart and collapsed, leaving
		Ning’s back totally bare. On Ning’s tender, young back, there was
		silver light flashing on the left, while golden light flashing on the
		right.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the left, frozen
		side, the silver light was constantly flowing and slowly forming into
		a pattern.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the right, blazing
		side, the golden light was also constantly flowing and also formed a
		separate pattern.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Divine Tattoos!”
		Snow said softly. “The very first time he trains, he is already
		beginning to form the Divine Tattoos. Given this tattoo forming
		speed, in ten days or so the tattoo will have been fully formed. By
		then, the first level of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine
		Heavens] will be done.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Yichuan
		watched quietly.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed…
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Divine Tattoos on
		Ning’s youthful back continued to grow. One could faintly tell that
		the left tattoo was that of a rabbit, while the right side was that
		of a crow.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two great Divine
		Tattoos. The Divine Moon Tattoo was that of the Moon Rabbit, while
		the Divine Sun Tattoo was that of the Golden Crow.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hu.” Ning suddenly
		let out a long breath and opened his eyes. The Divine Tattoos on his
		back disappeared as well, and the two stellar bodies in his hands
		quickly dissipated. This caused Ning to be greatly startled. He had
		carefully read the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], and
		he knew exactly what it meant for him to have the Moon in one hand,
		the Sun in the other, especially with the Osmanthus Tree being born
		and the Golden Crow flying.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a powerful
		force.” Ning clenched his fists, feeling his body surge with power.
		“I’m just a four year old child and I’ve just been initiated
		into the Fiendgod Body Refining method, but I already am this
		strong.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a cold voice
		rang out.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Put on a change of
		clothes.” With a wave of his hands, his father Yichuan made a set
		of children’s fur clothes appear out of midair, then tossed it to
		his son.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning
		immediately grabbed it.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow was still looking
		at her son, her face filled with joy. The more she looked at him, the
		happier she felt. Her son was her pride and her joy. On the day he
		was born, she had been worried about her son’s future…but now,
		her son had demonstrated such inconceivable potential. As a mother,
		in her heart, naturally she felt filled with joy.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning.” Yichuan
		said calmly.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father.” Ning
		listened carefully.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your potential is
		extraordinary. However, if you wish to break through the bottleneck
		of ordinary lifeforms and become a Xiantian lifeform, and then embark
		on the road to becoming an Immortal, potential alone isn’t enough.”
		Yichuan looked at his son. “You need to receive the best
		instruction possible.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said respectfully,
		“Father, please instruct me.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snow.” Yichuan
		looked at his wife, Yuchi Snow. She nodded, and with a flip of her
		hand, two items appeared. One was a deep green gemstone, roughly the
		size of a fingernail. It was cut and very beautiful. The other was a
		flashing, rainbow-colored, fist-sized rock.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This deep green
		stone is known as a kalestone.” Snow smiled. “This is a naturally
		forming gemstone which contains a miniature dimension inside of it.
		You can use it as part of a ring and store small items in it, or you
		can hide and store it within your belt. All you need to do to make it
		yours is to bind it with blood.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kalestone!” Ning
		was overjoyed.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Training to become an
		Immortal was divided into two paths; the Body Refining path and the
		Ki Refining path.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Body Refiners belonged
		to the Fiendgod path and didn’t teach someone how to use magical
		treasures.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ki Refiners, after
		becoming Xiantian lifeforms, would be able to control a few low level
		treasures…but even the lowest of manufactured treasures had a
		minimum requirement of the user being a Ki Refiner of the Xiantian
		level. Thus, most Fiendgod Body Refiners would also concurrently
		train in Ki.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Heaven always
		gave people a chance.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were some
		naturally occurring objects which only needed to be bound by blood
		and didn’t have any strength requirements. kalestone was one of
		them!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bind it first.”
		Snow handed the kalestone and a shortsword over.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Mother.” Ning
		accepted them. He didn’t hesitate at all, as he gently pricked his
		finger with the edge of the shortsword. A single drop of blood fell
		onto the kalestone and was quickly absorbed, giving the kalestone a
		hint of a blood color.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get in.” Ning
		willed the shortsword in his hand to disappear, and it did, reforming
		and floating within the miniature dimension inside the kalestone.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come out.” The
		shortsword appeared in his hands.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How magical.” Ning
		was absolutely delighted.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew long ago that
		these naturally occurring dimensional gemstones existed. They weren’t
		like those manufactured treasures, which all had relatively large
		internal dimensions. The kalestone, as a naturally occurring object,
		had a much smaller internal dimension. Some were only the size of a
		fist or a head! These half-meter long ones were definitely an
		extremely precious treasure.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother.” Ning
		hurriedly said. “Please help me make a belt and put the kalestone
		inside of it.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Snow
		nodded. “The kalestone can be considered a treasure, but to our Ji
		clan, it isn’t something particularly valuable. Given your father’s
		status…a kalestone isn’t even worth discussing! However, the
		other treasure is something which your father only obtained after a
		life-and-death crisis!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow solemnly handed
		over the fist-sized rock which shone with the colors of the rainbow.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bind it.” Snow
		looked at her son.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stuck out his
		finger and once more pricked it gently with the shortsword. A single
		drop of blood fell onto that flashing rainbow stone. The blood was
		quickly absorbed, and inside the rock, countless red ‘arteries’
		could suddenly be seen. And then, the fist-sized rock turned into a
		liquid and flowed towards Ning.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s this?”
		Ning felt his entire body turn cold.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is like the
		kalestone. It is a naturally occurring treasure. The name of this
		treasure is the Goldstar Shirt.” Snow explained. “You can use it
		immediately after binding it. It will quickly enter and become part
		of your skin. With the protection of the Goldstar Shirt…nothing
		below the Xiantian lifeform level will be able to harm you with its
		attacks.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was shocked. “So
		powerful?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had never read of
		this in any of the books.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Grand Xia
		Dynasty, from the Fiendgod Era until now, has existed for countless
		of years, and the territory it rules over is vast. In the area around
		Swallow Mountain, our Ji clan reigns supreme. But in some of the more
		distant areas…there are clans that are even more powerful than our
		Ji clan.” Yichuan said. “In some of those ancient, mighty clans,
		some of the promising young youths, while they are still young, they
		will be given this Goldstar Shirt to help protect them.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled.
		Turning to look at his father, he felt a warm feeling in his heart.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His parents truly were
		very good to him.
	</P>

		Chapter 9 - Archery
	</H1>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although the
		Goldstar Shirt is a treasure, I can break through it with a casual
		finger poke.” Yichuan looked at his son. “These things are all
		external. In the future, you must have accomplishments in the
		Fiendgod Body Refining techniques, and in term, Fiendgods specialize
		in body power. What you need to do is to utilize all of your
		potential and all of your strength.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
		nodded seriously.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With the Fiendgod
		Body Refining, your strength will be great, your movements will be
		fast, your vision will be clear at great distances, your hearing will
		be more sensitive, and even your body’s recovery ability will be
		astonishing!” Yichuan looked at his son. “In order to transform
		these into true, mighty power…”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First of all, what
		you need is a weapon!” Yichuan said. “Your strength might be ten
		times greater than your opponent’s, but your opponent might be able
		to shoot you to death from afar with an arrow. That’s what makes a
		good weapon so powerful.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition, you
		must be good at actually wielding a weapon. For example, a swordsman
		who has no internal strength but who has reached the second level of
		sword mastery, ‘man and sword become one’, is capable of easily
		piercing the throat of a powerful yet inexperienced warrior. After
		all, no matter how much internal strength the warrior has, he can’t
		block the sharpness of a sword!” Yichuan said slowly.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood this
		logic of course.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A powerful but stupid
		brute who encountered an assassin who was good at wielding
		shortswords would die in a single exchange of blows!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A strong body was just
		one aspect. Skill and technique was what determined how much of your
		power would be actually utilized! For example, in his past life,
		those competitors in the kickboxing or jujitsu competitions all were
		roughly on the same level in terms of physical fitness; it was
		technique and battle strategy which determined their competiveness.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tell me, what do you
		want to learn?” Yichuan looked at his son.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son, think
		carefully.” Snow looked at her son as well.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, in their
		hearts, they had already mapped out a plan for their son. After all,
		as they saw it, their son was still too young, even though he was
		smart and capable. But they still wanted to ask their son what he
		wanted, so as to help him learn to think everything through. And
		then, they would tell him what they thought and let him reflect on
		the differences.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to learn
		three things.” Ning suddenly said.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First of all, I wish
		to learn archery.” Ning said.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was to walk on the
		Fiendgod Body Refining path. He would possess astonishing eyesight,
		and also enormous, heaven-granted strength. Naturally, he had to
		learn archery. The arrows released by a mighty Fiendgod were
		definitely capable of breaking past the sound barrier, and the power
		of its arrows was definitely far greater than the bullets of sniper
		rifles in his past life. He could kill his opponent from far away.
		And archery, according to the books he had read, wasn’t too hard to
		learn.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second, I want to
		learn how to use twin swords!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ji clan specialized
		in sword techniques!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His father Yichuan was
		nicknamed the ‘Raindrop Sword’. With a resource such as this at
		his disposal, he absolutely had to learn how to use swords!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Twin swords?”
		Yichuan frowned. “Continue.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Third, I need to
		learn agility-enhancing techniques and escaping techniques.” Ning
		said. “These are what I need.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he encountered a
		powerful opponent, he would flee!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only escaping
		techniques would allow a person to live longer. And the longer one
		lived, the more possibilities one would have.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow laughed. “Ning
		is headed in the right direction. However, I think it’s best if you
		first start with single swords…there isn’t a single twin sword
		expert in the entire Ji clan, and when training in swords, the
		greatest danger is in losing concentration. You must focus all of
		your concentration on a single sword. Only this will allow you to
		achieve greater accomplishments.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your mother’s
		words are correct.” Yichuan looked at his son.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, mother, I’ve
		been able to divide my mind since I was born.” Ning raised his head
		to look at his parents. He wasn’t able to explain about the [Nuwa
		Painting], and so he just had to claim that he was able to divide his
		mind since he was born.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Divide your mind?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan and Snow were
		both shocked.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you know what
		dividing your mind means?” Yichuan growled. “It isn’t as simple
		as multitasking. It means that your mind can simultaneously
		contemplate two separate matters without losing any effectiveness or
		causing any disruption.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I truly can divide
		my mind.” Ning said hurriedly.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then let’s give it
		a test.” Yichuan’s eyes began to glow with an astonishing light.
		With one hand, he pulled over two pieces of chalk. “Use these two
		rocks to write on the ground. With your left hand, write your
		mother’s name, while with your right hand, write my name. Write
		simultaneously!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, father.” Ning
		nodded.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning took the two
		pieces of chalk. It felt rather similar to the chalk he had used in
		his previous life. Immediately, he began to use his hands to write as
		instructed. Writing with the chalk actually felt quite natural.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua! Hua!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His left hand and right
		hand easily wrote at the same time, and what he wrote was the
		ancient, complicated script of this world. On one side, he wrote the
		name, “Ji Yichuan”. On the other, “Yuchi Snow.” His strokes
		were firm and very graceful.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, you…” Snow
		was stunned.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…” Yichuan
		was stunned as well.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder. No wonder
		you were able to train in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine
		Shining Heavens] so quickly.” Yichuan said slowly. “So our son’s
		soul is so powerful that he can divide his mind!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan looked at his
		son as though he were looking at a piece of priceless, unpolished
		jade. Extremely excited, he said, “I’ve only been able to reach
		the level of dividing my mind because I’ve trained for so long.
		However, I’ve focused on using a single sword since I was young…my
		path is set, and hard to change! But my son is able to divide his
		mind since birth…he is a born twin sword user. He will be able to
		use twin swords as though two people were wielding them and make his
		opponents feel like they are being attacked by two people at once.
		What’s more, those two people will have their hearts and intentions
		totally linked, increasing the effectiveness ten times over!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From today onwards,
		I will personally train you in using swords!” Yichuan looked at his
		son.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Early next morning.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thick natural
		energy of the world filled the hazy morning. Ning had already been
		brought by his father to the training grounds.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning.” Yichuan
		looked at his son, then pointed at a nearby fur-clad, bearded man.
		“This is the number one expert archer of the Ji clan of the West
		Prefecture. His name is ‘Blindfish’. His archery skills are
		extremely high. Blindfish, come, let the little fellow see what you
		are all about.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Blindfish
		said respectfully.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan walked in front
		of them towards four marble tablets, each one of them weighing
		several hundred pounds. Yichuan grabbed one of them, then threw it
		far away into the distance, and then grabbed another one and tossed
		that one as well. In the blink of an eye, all four of them were
		howling through the air.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These massive, heavy
		tablets were thrown with such force that they made the air howl. They
		were like four missiles, and had transformed into black dots in the
		sky.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrm.” A
		pitch-black greatbow appeared in the hands of the bearded man,
		Blindfish, along with four arrows. He raised his bow high.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Four arrows flashed
		through the skies, disappearing almost instantly as they chased after
		those four black dots. Pengpengpengpeng!!!!! Those four black dots
		totally disappeared.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gaped at the
		sight.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He gaped for a long
		time.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When father tossed
		those heavy stones, he threw them at least one or two kilometers and
		turned them into missiles?” Ning felt stunned. “And this
		Blindfish’s arrows…I felt like, in the blink of an eye, in less
		than a second, they arrived at that distance of a kilometer or two
		away. If we calculate it carefully…these arrows must have at least
		travelled at the speed of nearly two thousand meters a second.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The legendary god,
		Houyi, once sent out nine arrows in a row and shot and killed nine
		Golden Crows.” Blindfish laughed loudly. “Young master, I only
		possess some superficial skills.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master Blindfish,
		the rubble won’t hit or hurt anyone when it falls, will it?” Ning
		suddenly remembered to ask this question.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan shook his head.
		“Ning, your Master Blindfish is a Xiantian lifeform, and has
		infused his arrows with his own innate energy. When the arrows
		reached the tablets, they immediately blew the tablets into dust
		which will drift down slowly. How can there be rubble which would
		smash anyone?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
		shocked.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Formidable indeed.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From today onwards,
		every morning, you will come train with your Master Blindfish for an
		hour in archery.” Yichuan said. “This can be considered your
		morning exercises. Blindfish, sorry to trouble you.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To be able to teach
		the young master is Blindfish’s glory.” Blindfish laughed loudly.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan nodded, then
		turned and left.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire training
		yard was very quiet. Only Blindfish and Ning were there. Not even a
		servant was present.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
		Blindfish looked at Ning. “To an archer, the most important thing
		is his bows and arrows. The arrow is divided into three parts; the
		arrowhead, the arrow shaft, and the feathers. As for the bow, it is
		comprised of the bowstring and the body. Arrows can be made in large
		quantities, but bows are far more precious!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are two types
		of bows.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first type of
		bow is made from an elastic bow body and a tough bowstring. When
		drawing the bow, the body of the bow will curve…and that is where
		the power comes from, the curving of the bow’s body. This is the
		most commonly seen type of bow, and is a fairly simple type of
		archery. It is easy to produce, and ordinary archers use it.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second type of
		bow has a tough, inflexible bow body and an elastic bowstring. When
		pulling the bow, the bow’s body will essentially remain firm, while
		the bowstring will be pulled to an astonishing elastic length. This
		bow in my hand is that sort of bow!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blindfish handed the
		pitch-black greatbow in his hands to Ning.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning accepted this
		simple greatbow, and he instantly felt its weight. This greatbow was
		at least a hundred pounds heavy. He couldn’t help but stare at it
		carefully. The body of the greatbow was made from some sort of
		pitch-black metal which gleamed. The bowstring, however, was as thick
		as a finger, and carried a blue color. A terrifying fiendish aura
		could dimly be sensed as coming from the bowstring.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This bow body was
		forged from ‘thunderwind metal’ and is incomparably tough. But
		the bowstring is even more precious…it was made from one of the
		draconic tendons of a Diremonster that was slain, a Dragonsnake. It
		possesses astonishing elasticity. Even if my strength was ten times
		greater, I wouldn’t be able to break it.” Blindfish laughed. “The
		name I gave my bow is ‘Thunderdragon Bow’.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes shone as
		he listened. A bowstring made from the tendons of a Dragonsnake, a
		Diremonster?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, let’s begin
		to learn the proper stance.” With a flip of his hand, Blindfish
		produced an ordinary bow.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Standing shot
		stance, crouching shot stance, backwards shot stance, falling shot
		stance, running shot stance!” Blindfish looked at Ning. “Young
		master, your training will be divided into two segments. The first is
		the basic segment. The second is the mental segment.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the basic
		segment, you need to practice those five stances to the point where
		‘hand, eye, and arrow become one.’ You must always hit your
		target. Only then can you move to the next segment.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the mental
		segment, the stances are no longer important. The only thing you need
		is for your ‘mind and arrow to become one’. You no longer need to
		use your eyes to see. That’s simply too slow. You must rely on your
		mind! In the blink of an eye, you will draw your bow and fire your
		arrows upon your target as fast as lightning. In a truly critical
		situation, you only have a heartbeat to do what you need. Nobody will
		give you a chance to slowly aim. When you have mastered the mental
		segment, then you will have completed your apprenticeship.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning listened and
		nodded.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, according to
		Blindfish’s instructions, he began to train in the proper stance.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waist straight! Left
		arm extended!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s the correct
		posture for drawing the bow. Stay in that posture!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eyes! Eyes! Are your
		eyes blind?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as he began
		teaching in earnest, Blindfish began to roar at him. The ignorant
		Ning was like a piece of white parchment. Howled at again and again,
		Ning could do nothing but endure it and slowly learn.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A ten thousand meter
		high building is still built up from the ground floor. An expert
		archer had to start with the basics as well.

		Chapter 10 - Footwork
	</H1>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After practicing
		archery for an hour, the Sun had already begun to rise.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, child, I shall
		be the one to teach you footwork.” Yuchi Snow, clad in white furs,
		smiled as she looked at her son.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning said.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he had
		exercised to the point where his waist and his back were bitterly
		sore, because he had trained in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the
		Nine Heavens], his body’s regenerative speed was astonishingly
		high. Right now, his mind was clear, fresh, and full of energy.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In close combat,
		footwork is every bit as importance as sword techniques!” Yuchi
		Snow said solemnly. “When two people engage in a battle, the one
		with better footwork and agility can make it hard for the opponent to
		injure them, while they are able to easily injure the opponent.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He understood this
		logic.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Close combat didn’t
		just mean standing there like an idiot, waving swords and sabers at
		each other. It was constantly changing positions like an
		unpredictable shadow. In his past life, he had seen taekwondo and
		karate experts. Those most elite competitors all valued footwork
		highly, and their footwork was exquisite, capable of causing ten
		enemy punches in a row to miss, or at least have their power reduced
		greatly.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The importance of
		footwork was arguably even higher than that of attacking techniques!
		Because he had been tormented by illness in his past life, Ning truly
		and ardently enjoyed watching those competitions, which made him
		understand the importance of footwork in those taekwondo and karate
		competitions.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this world where
		spirits and monsters abounded, the basics were still the same.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Footwork was one of the
		most important things.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will teach you a
		footwork technique known as the [Shadewind Steps].” Snow said.
		“Don’t be fooled by its ordinary name. This is a very amazing set
		of footwork techniques. I am the only one who knows it in our Ji
		clan, and even amongst all five Prefectures, it is considered the
		highest type of footwork technique. Once you begin learning this
		footwork technique, you will understand how to dodge and move about
		in tight areas, while also learning how to easily flee.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First, carefully
		read the six basic movements.” With a flip of her hand, Snow made a
		thick yellow book appear out of nowhere.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning accepted it and
		began to read it carefully.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This book described the
		[Shadewind Steps] and its six basic movements. All six of the
		movements were exquisite and profound in their movements and usage of
		force and energy.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t just stare
		at it.” Snow pointed at a distant area. “Look over there.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned his head
		and saw wooden pillars. There must have been thousands of wooden
		pillars there, and they were all of different height and at different
		distances from each other. Above these wooden stakes was a number of
		beast capes, thousands of them which dotted the area like ropes.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That is known as the
		Thousand Star Array.” Snow said. “Through the usage of the
		Thousand Star Array, within ten years, you should be able to be able
		to reach the ‘Ruwei’ stage of the Shadewind Steps. If it wasn’t
		for the Thousand Star Array…you probably would have to spend a
		hundred times the amount of time.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Shadewind
		Steps] technique has three stages.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First, the basic
		stage.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second, the advanced
		stage.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Third, one with the
		world.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow looked at Ning.
		“Actually, all techniques, be it footwork, sword, saber, spear, or
		anything else, can be divided into these three stages. For example,
		the ‘advanced stage’ of sword technique is often described as
		‘one with the sword’.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have you memorized
		the mysteries of the six basic movements?” Snow asked.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow then walked
		towards the Thousand Star Array, then pointed at one of the very
		short pillars. “Go stand on top of this pillar.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning easily
		jumped onto the wooden pillar.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He instantly felt
		wobbly. The pillar wasn’t very thick, and there was only enough
		space for a single foot. Fortunately, after having trained in the
		[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], he had an extremely good
		sense of balance. This was the only reason why he was able to stand
		stably.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Listen to my orders.
		Whichever one of the six basic movements I ask you to use, that’s
		what you use.” Snow said. “The ‘advancing’ move!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately tried
		to charge forward and step atop another pillar in front of him, but
		when he brushed against a beast skin rope and, with a swish, he fell
		down to the ground.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember, whenever
		you are moving in the Thousand Star Array, you must not step onto any
		of the beast skins. Once you do so, you’ll have to start over
		again.” Snow said.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning ground his teeth.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He refused to believe
		it would happen again.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He once again hopped
		onto the short pillar, and then, using the ‘advancing’ move, he
		dodged past the beast skin and moved onto the next wooden pillar.
		However, he had used too much force. His body swayed for a long while
		before he was able to steady himself on that one foot again.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember, your
		movements must be like nails, driving a nail down with each step.
		When you land on the pillar, you must be nailed to it!” Snow said.
		“Each step cannot be too small or too large. It cannot be too light
		or too heavy. Just now, you swayed wildly. If this was a life or
		death fight, you would’ve been stabbed to death by an enemy who
		would’ve discovered a flaw in your attacks. Continue. The
		‘advancing’ move!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ‘advancing’
		step!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ‘sidestep’
		step!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ‘leaping’
		step!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ‘backwards’
		step!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ‘withdrawing’
		step!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ‘turning’
		step!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow snapped one order
		after another.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, all footwork
		techniques relied on these basic movements. But the differences
		between different techniques were like night and day in terms of
		skill. Some would make you move as fast as a bolt of lightning, while
		others would make you as agile and graceful as the wind, or perhaps
		as unpredictable as a spirit.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each footwork technique
		had its own mysteries, and naturally would have different effects in
		battle.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oof!” He hadn’t
		leapt high enough, and his back had brushed against the beast skin
		ropes, causing him to be unable to land onto the wooden pillar. He
		fell down.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not saying a word, Ning
		climbed back onto the pillar.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oof!” His knee
		hadn’t been bent enough.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oof!” He had used
		too much force.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On those thousands of
		wooden pillars, Ning was moving like a flash, wildly training in
		these six basic steps. Because of the obstruction of the beast skins,
		Ning’s body also had to undergo various contortions to dodge them.
		But no matter what postures he used, the most important thing was
		that his center of gravity had to be stable, and his feet had to be
		stable!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother, how long
		will I train like this for?” Ning had fallen so many times.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son, start
		from the shortest pillar and move through all 1008 wooden pillars,
		then jump down from the tallest one! You are not to touch any of the
		beast skins on the way!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you are able to
		complete this within the time it takes for one to take ten breaths,
		then you will have mastered the ‘basic’ level of this footwork.”
		Yuchi Snow laughed.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned when
		he heard this. “What? In ten breaths? Such a short period of
		time…even on running on the flat ground, I wouldn’t be able to do
		that in ten breaths.” 1008 wooden pillars, all of which had to be
		traversed. That was a distance of a thousand or so meters. It would
		take him a while to travel that distance at a full run.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Later, Ning, when
		you have finished mastering the first level of the [Crimsonbright
		Diagram of the Nine Heavens], you would be able to travel a thousand
		meters on the ground in ten breaths.” Snow laughed.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…” Ning was
		speechless.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Moving in the
		Thousand Star Array as though you were on the ground…only then
		would you have mastered the ‘basic’ stage.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then what about the
		second, ‘advanced’ stage?” Ning couldn’t help but ask.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow pushed one of the
		nearby beast skin ropes, which began to collide with the other beast
		skins. Soon, the thousand plus beast skins were all swaying against
		and hitting each other in a totally wild, chaotic manner.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second stage,
		the ‘advanced’ stage, requires you to once again start from the
		lowest pillar and move through all 1008 pillars, then jump down from
		the tallest one, in the span of ten breaths, without touching any of
		the beast skin ropes. However…for the ‘advanced’ stage, all of
		the beast skins will be striking each other.” Snow looked at Ning.
		“Once you can do that, you will have mastered the ‘advanced’
		stage.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But but but…how is
		that possible? If all the beast skins are swaying about, how will I
		dodge them? There would probably only be a split second for me to
		dodge the beast skins and also jump onto the wooden pillars. And in
		such a short time frame…” Ning felt that this was simply too
		hard, impossibly hard.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That is why I said
		that with the help of the Thousand Star Array, you should need ten
		years to reach the ‘advanced’ stage of the [Shadewind Steps].”
		Snow said. “From now until lunch time, you will continuously
		practice here at the Thousand Star Array.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then what about the
		third stage, ‘one with the world’?” Ning couldn’t help but
		ask.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow looked at Ning and
		laughed. “That’s on an entirely different level. Once you reach
		it, you’ll understand.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How powerful is it?
		You can at least explain it.” Ning asked.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. If I have
		to describe it…even ten thousand arrows raining down on me at the
		same time wouldn’t be able to injure me at all.” Snow looked at
		her son.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ten thousand arrows
		at the same time?” Ning instantly imagined a thick cluster of
		countless arrows raining down, but none of them able to touch him.
		This was inconceivable. A human’s body occupied a certain amount of
		space, after all. If those countless arrows filled the skies,
		logically speaking, there should be no way to dodge them.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow smiled. “Don’t
		be discouraged. Most of the peak Houtian experts of the various
		tribes are only able to reach the first, ‘basic’ stage.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiantian lifeforms
		are usually able to reach the second, ‘advanced’ stage.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Most Zifu Disciples
		are able to reach the third stage of ‘one with the world’. But of
		course, some extremely talented Xiantian lifeforms are able to reach
		the level of ‘unity with the world’…such as your father!”
		Snow said.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father?” Ning was
		surprised and delighted.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your father’s
		footwork has reached the level of ‘one with the world’. And even
		in swordplay, which is harder to train in than footwork, your father
		has reached the ‘one with the world’ level.” Snow laughed.
		“That is why your father is the undisputed number one expert of the
		Ji clan’s West Prefecture. That’s why his prestige awes all of
		the countless tribes.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart
		immediately swelled with a heroic feeling. Whatever his father could
		do, he himself could definitely do, especially since he had the [Nuwa
		Painting] and the wisdom from his past life!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Continue!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ‘advancing’
		step!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ‘turning’
		step!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ‘leaping’
		step!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s small, young
		frame carefully flashed about the Thousand Star Array, occasionally
		falling down.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After lunch.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having eaten to
		his fill and rested for a while, Ning was pulled to the training
		yards once more by his father. The afternoon spring Sun was
		dazzlingly beautiful, and its rays were very comfortable.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father.” Ning
		looked at his glacier-like father, clad in a blood-red beast fur. His
		heart was filled with awe. His father had killed even Diremonsters
		such as Dragonsnakes. In terms of strength and skill, his father had
		already reached an extremely high level. Even some Xiantian lifeforms
		had come to ask to be taken as his father’s disciple and learn his
		sword techniques.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His father had nine
		primary disciples, three of which were Xiantian lifeforms. But his
		father only taught the nine disciples once every month.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning? He would be
		taught every day!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From today onwards,
		I will teach you how to use the sword.” Yichuan looked at his son
		and said in a cold voice, “The sword is not the bow, nor is it like
		footwork.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Archery training
		only requires one to become familiar with it. Once one’s strength
		increases and one’s vision improves, naturally, one will be able to
		fire more powerful arrows!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although footwork is
		important, it is still supplemental…to kill an opponent, you still
		have to use your sword in the end!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swords are
		considered short weapons! They are light and agile, with two edges.
		Their usage is more precise and profound than that of sabers; whether
		by slashing, by stabbing, by chopping, by scraping, or by tapping,
		one can easily kill the opponent. Sometimes, a person who is training
		incorrectly can even hurt himself. It is the truest weapon of war.”
		Yichuan looked at his son.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could feel his
		blood boiling, and he was extremely eager. His eyes were shining.
		“Father, what sort of sword technique will I learn?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword technique?
		Wait a few more years!” Yichuan said coldly.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait a few more
		years?” Ning was confused.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan said coldly,
		“The movements of the sword are birthed by your body! If you wish
		to use the sword well, then first, you must control your body well.
		First, you must train in boxing. After your body and your arms are
		extremely agile and you can fully control your strength, then your
		body will be ready to learn sword techniques!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But preparing your
		body isn’t enough.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You must also
		prepare your ‘mind’ for learning the sword!”

	</H1>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, listening to
		this, felt totally confused, as though his head was covered by mist
		and clouds. “Father, you say that I must prepare my body before I
		can train with a sword. I can just barely understand that. But I must
		also prepare my ‘mind’? What does that mean?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be

	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan looked at his

		towards Ning. “First, closely read through this boxing manual.
		There are sixteen stances in this boxing technique. It contains the
		simplest yet most fundamental of methods to allow one’s body to
		exert strength. Once you have mastered this boxing technique, your
		entire body will act as you will and you will be able to exert
		strength with ease.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The sword is born
		from your body. If not even your body acts as you wish it to, how can
		your sword act as you wish it to?” Yichuan looked at his son,
		worried that his son would bite off more than he could chew. “First,
		you must calm your mind.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood the
		logic that ‘sharpening the knife didn’t slow down the cutting
		process’.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, father.” Ning
		said as he lowered his head to begin reading the book. He began to
		closely review the mysteries of boxing described in the book. The
		book was quite thick, but actually, it was because it was made from
		animal leathers, which made every page very thick.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After memorizing the
		profound secrets, he began to train. His father constantly gave him
		advice and pointed out his mistakes, or even demonstrated himself so
		as to help Ning understand.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, the
		[Shadewind Steps] also contained some principles on exerting force,
		but the [Shadewind Steps] were primarily about using force in the
		legs. Because he had some prior experience now…Ning learned
		relatively quickly.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two hours later.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rest a while.”
		Yichuan looked at his sweaty son. “In the future, you will spend
		two hours every day training your boxing, unless and until I judge
		that your body is prepared to train with the sword.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Preparing your body
		to train with the sword is just one aspect.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You must also
		prepare your ‘mind’ to wield the sword.” Two black metal swords
		appeared in Yichuan’s hands, and he tossed them to his son. “Take
		them!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning took the two
		swords.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan pointed to an
		empty area. Hu. A metallic puppet appeared out of nowhere, wielding a
		single saber.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a puppet.”
		Yichuan said. “Ki Refining practitioners of the Immortal way are
		often good at producing these puppets. This one is just a very
		ordinary puppet, with the power of a master-level Houtian combatant.
		However, its body is extremely tough.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, what are
		those red spots on its body?” Ning wondered.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black metal puppet
		had over ten red dots on its body. The red dots were located between
		its forehead, on its throat, on its chest, on its arms, hands, back,
		and some other areas.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Try stabbing at the
		red dot on its forehead.” Yichuan said. “You have to be fast.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning stabbed
		out fiercely with his right hand.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tip of the sword
		pierced forward, but it struck the head, roughly an inch away from
		the red dot.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…” Ning was
		slightly startled. He clearly had aimed at the red dot. He couldn’t
		help but try stabbing three more times, but the results were always
		the same, slightly off.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have you discovered
		it?” Yichuan said calmly. “Although you want to stab it in the
		middle of the forehead, when you actually try to do so, you aren’t
		able to do so accurately. How can you stab accurately? First, you
		have to have to control your body perfectly. Second, you have to
		train countless times.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Every single sword
		technique can be described as being composed of thirteen specific
		movements; chop, pierce, scrape, sweep, break, tap, cleave, support,
		intercept, twist, lift, draw, and sheath.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chop, pierce,
		scrape, sweep, tap, cleave; these are used to attack.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Support, break,
		intercept, twist, lift, draw, and sheath; these are used to defend.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan pointed at the
		metal puppet. “This puppet isn’t moving at all, and it has nine
		red dots on its body. Execute the ‘chop, pierce, scrape, sweep,
		cleave, and tap’ movements against it. I will teach you the secrets
		to every single movement and how to move in harmony with your
		attacks. Every single basic movement must be practiced at least ten
		million times!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the future, the
		puppet will begin to move and chop at you with its own saber
		techniques. You will then use the ‘support, intercept, twist, lift,
		draw, break, and sheath’ movements, the seven basic defense
		movements, to defend yourself. You will train all of these movements
		ten million times as well.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Defend!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After you have
		become familiar with these two, the puppet will engage in battle
		against you, and you will use the combined thirteen stances to fight
		against it.” Yichuan looked at his son. “When the day comes when
		your thirteen basic stances have become engrained into your mind and
		your bones, and when you are perfectly accurate, that is when you
		will have absorbed the essence of the sword into your mind. Only then
		will your mind be ready to train in the sword.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning listened with his
		breath held.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prepare your body.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prepare your mind.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Afterwards, you will
		be able to truly start training in sword techniques.” Yichuan
		looked at his son. “Sword techniques are very complicated, but they
		are still formed from these thirteen basic movements. If you aren’t
		even able to memorize and absorb these thirteen basic movements…how
		can you possibly have any achievements in training with the sword?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After you have truly
		become familiar with the sword techniques I will pass down to you,
		then you can be considered to have reached the first, ‘basic’
		level of wielding a sword.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The sword has three
		levels as well.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The basic level, the
		advanced level, and the ‘one with the world’ level!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ‘advanced
		level’ for footwork requires precise control over the body. But the
		‘advanced level’ for the sword requires one to have precise
		control over both the body and the sword, and then merge them into
		one! It is ten times harder!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Becoming ‘one with
		the world’? That’s even farther off.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan looked at his
		son. “Ji Ning, do you now understand the path you must walk?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded
		heavily.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Crimsonbright
		Diagram of the Nine Heavens] training technique would give him a
		Fiendgod’s body and inconceivable strength.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the training in
		footwork and swordplay would decide…how much of that strength he
		would be able to use!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, how long
		would I need to train before I can reach the level of ‘one with the
		sword’?” Ning couldn’t help but ask.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hard to say.”
		Yichuan shook his head. “In the past, I had spent six years
		mastering the basics, then six more before becoming ‘one with the
		sword’. You can say that it took me twelve years!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Twelve years?”
		Ning held his breath.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His father, despite
		being young, had become the number one expert of the Ji clan of the
		West Prefecture. Someone as peerless of a talent had him had needed
		twelve years. Many ordinary people…would spend their lives training
		without being able to reach the ‘one with the sword’ level.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t bite off
		more than you can chew. Take things one stable step at a time.”
		Yichuan looked at his son. “Let’s begin. Let me first teach you
		the ‘pierce’ movement of the thirteen basic movements!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Under his father’s
		guidance, Ning’s posture was very correct as he pierced repeatedly!
		Chopped repeatedly! Scraped repeatedly! Tapped repeatedly!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was very boring.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And very tiring.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, Ning had
		astonishing regenerating capabilities. And given his experience in
		being tormented by illness in his past life…he was a person who
		would not easily give up.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After training
		attacking movements for two hours, he began to train defending
		movements for another two hours.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The metal puppet
		wouldn’t get tired, delivering endless hacking blows with the saber
		for Ning to defend against.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yichuan.” Snow
		stood from afar, watching her son train hard.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan walked to his
		wife’s side as well, and both of them watched that distant metal
		puppet battle against their son. “Snow. I didn’t expect this. I
		really didn’t expect…that our son would have such strong
		willpower. I had even prepared for him to complain about being tired,
		and prepared to force him to continue training. I didn’t expect
		that I don’t need to force him at all!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When he was training
		his footwork in the morning…” Snow felt sorry for her child.
		“Even though he said he was tired, all he did was talk. He didn’t
		stop a single time. Six hours in the morning, six hours in the
		afternoon…twelve hours of the day spent training. Ning is still
		very young…”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I still remember
		when I was young.” Yichuan said softly. “At that time, I was
		forced by my father to train. I felt too tired and that I was at the
		point of collapse, but whenever I gave up, my father would use his
		whip to beat me. I cried each time I drew my sword or used it to
		pierce…that continued until I turned ten, and my father was killed
		by a Diremonster from Eastlake Mountain. The status of my mother and
		I dropped by a thousand fathoms. Seeing how cold everyone had become
		towards us and then my mother die of illness…I finally woke up. I
		no longer said I was tired, or that I was hurting. Every day, I
		focused on my training.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Someone who had never
		trained before would never know how exhausting training was.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tiring to the body.
		Tiring to the mind.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Someone who wasn’t
		sufficiently mentally resolved or who had insufficient desire
		wouldn’t be able to persevere.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I had my doubts
		about our son’s future accomplishments.” Yichuan said softly.
		“Although his aptitude for the Fiendgod Body Refining is very high,
		if he doesn’t work hard, he still wouldn’t accomplish much…but
		now, I believe that my son will definitely become one of the true
		experts of this world. He definitely will!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hearing her husband’s
		words, Snow stared at her son who was still training in the distance.
		She gently nodded. “I believe it too!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Watching himself grow
		stronger, even stronger than those ‘supermen’ in the movies, was
		an absolutely wonderful feeling!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A year later.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blindfish, standing far
		away, threw four stones up into the air. The slightly taller Ning
		nocked his bow while grabbing four arrows, holding them tightly
		between his five fingers.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Four arrows flashed out
		simultaneously, leaving behind four trails of air in the sky, hitting
		all four of the rocks that had been thrown up. The four rocks all
		shattered into tiny pieces which fell to the ground.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Blindfish
		walked over, laughing loudly like the thunder.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master Blindfish.”
		Ning put away the bow.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve already
		mastered the mental segment. You’ve even quickly mastered my pride
		and my joy, the ‘Quadshot’ skill.” Blindfish praised as he
		nodded. “I have nothing left to teach you when it comes to archery.
		Next, you will have to just continuously train and build up
		experience. As your strength grows, you will be able to fire more
		powerful arrows. This training courtyard is now too small for you.
		You need to go to a larger, more expansive place and shoot arrows
		from a distance of one, two, or even three or four kilometers! The
		farther away you are shooting from, the more you will have to factor
		in the wind and the environment.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
		nodded.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Archery required one to
		be extremely precise.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One needed to consider
		the strength of the pull, the trajectory of the arrow, and also the
		downward pull of gravity. At the same time, one had to factor in the
		wind speed!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although it was
		complicated, as long as one could sense the direction and strength of
		the wind, one would be able to shoot without even needing to aim.
		This was because the question of from what angle to fire from and how
		to fire would have already been built into one’s bones from
		countless repetitive training exercises. At least, to the current
		Ning…within a range of five hundred meters, not even a fly could
		escape his arrows!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But this was far from
		being enough!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As his strength grew,
		his arrows would be more powerful as well. Some Xiantian lifeform’s
		arrows would fly several kilometers and still have tremendous force!
		The greater the distance, the more difficult it would be to shoot
		accurately as well…it required even more training and experience.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Starting tomorrow, I
		won’t come here anymore. Young master, you are the most talented
		student I have ever taught.” Blindfish looked at Ning. “Don’t
		waste your talent. In the future, you will definitely become the most
		terrifying godly archer in the Swallow Mountain area.”

	<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_12___Six_Years"></A>
		Chapter 12 - Six Years
	</H1>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the training
		courtyard, a youth clad in beast fur was wielding a black blunt
		sword. He stood there, and around him there were nine tall and
		powerful warriors. These valiant warriors all wore armor and wielding
		long spears, swords, and sabers, and other weapons in their hands.
		But none of the weapons had been edged or sharpened.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six years. Ning, who
		had trained for six years, was now ten years old. But because in this
		life, he had been training in accordance with the [Crimsonbright
		Diagram of the Nine Heavens], he had already reached a height of 1.6
		meters tall, just ten centimeters shorter than he had been in his
		previous life. His appearance was almost identical to how he had
		looked in his previous life. Perhaps this was what the saying, ‘a
		person’s appearance is birthed by their mind’. If one had to find
		a difference…then the difference was, in his previous life, his
		face was always sickly pale, while in this life, it was filled with
		boundless life and energy.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Same rule as
		always.” Ning stared at the people around him, his gaze even more
		terrifying than that of monsters. “As long as any of you can strike
		me, each person will be awarded a beasthead of gold!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grr!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful, young
		master!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, a beasthead of
		gold. Brothers, let’s let the young master see how powerful we
		are.” These brave warriors began to roar. They were the mightiest
		warriors within the armies of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture; the
		Ninefang Warriors! For someone to be awarded the title of Ninefang
		Warrior required their internal energy to have reached the limits of
		the Houtian level, and also be warriors with significant battle
		experience.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A beasthead of gold
		meant ten pounds of gold. Gold coins were used as a form of currency
		in the countless tribes, and ten pounds of gold, to these powerful
		warriors, was an extremely attractive offer.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But they didn’t dare
		to be incautious, because Ning’s power had spread across the army
		long ago. He had often sparred in the army with some of the elite
		soldiers…and thus, Ning’s ability had risen rapidly, as these
		warriors all knew. Even if nine of the most powerful warriors joined
		forces against him…defeating Ning would still be a hard task.
		However, it was still possible.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blunt black sword
		in hand, Ning stared quietly at the surrounding people.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, ever since he
		had learned the reputedly most complicated of sword techniques [108
		Swords of the Gods and Demons] and mastered it to the point where his
		father nodded in satisfaction, sparring with the metal puppet had
		become meaningless. Thus, he was permitted to begin sparring with the
		large number of soldiers and warriors in their army. While sparring,
		they always used blunt weapons.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time, his
		father had given him a strict order: “When sparring with others,
		you are only allowed to use a single sword! In addition, you are only
		permitted to use a tenth of your real strength! Only when sparring
		with your mother and I are you allowed to use the twin swords.
		Remember, the twin swords are your secret weapon. You are only
		permitted to use it when you really intend to kill your opponent.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus…
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning’s fame
		had become widespread across the army and he had been acknowledged as
		a rare talent, that was just the tip of the iceberg. But of course,
		when engaging in battle, Ning used all of his available skill in the
		‘single sword techniques’ and in the ‘footwork’ techniques.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine warriors
		surrounded Ning, walking in a circle around him while staring at him
		as though staring at their prey.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just stood there,
		as unmoving as a mountain.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shua!” One of the
		nine soldiers surrounding him suddenly charged forward. The bald
		soldier was wielding a longspear in his hands, and struck out with it
		like a viper, instantly arriving next to Ning.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Faced with this fierce
		spear, Ning’s body flickered and he drew near the bald warrior’s
		body, causing the spear to miss its mark.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Spears were weakest
		against close quarters combat!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chi!” The blunt
		sword in Ning’s hand sliced out. As the sword flashed towards him,
		the bald warrior hurriedly used his feet to kick against his
		longspear, sending it sweeping towards Ning as he himself rolled back
		into the array of soldiers surrounding Ning.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wow, that was
		dangerous. I almost got ended in one exchange. Brothers, be careful.”
		The bald warrior quickly called out as he returned to the others.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had already
		stepped on top of that longspear, staring at the people around him.
		“It is better if you come all at once. Otherwise, you’ll have no
		chance.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s do it.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine warriors,
		sensing the disparity in power, didn’t launch any more probing
		attacks. They immediately charged forward at full strength.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wind howled. Sabers
		flashed. The shadow of sword agilely danced about. Spears hissed
		through the air like dragons. Sticks smashed down like ferocious
		tigers. Attacks came from every direction towards Ning, while Ning
		just stood there, just occasionally taking a step back or turning.
		These seemingly minute movements resulted in many of the warriors’
		attacks missing.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The clanging sounds of
		weapons bashing against each other could be heard like thunderclaps.
		Clearly, these blows carried great force.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Occasionally, the sound
		was just a whisper-soft snick.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninefang Warriors
		really live up to their name. These nine have really good teamwork.
		If it was just five or six of them…I would be able to beat them in
		an instant. But the nine working together have put me at a complete
		disadvantage.” Ning found it very difficult to deal with the storm
		of attacks from these nine warriors. After all, he only had one
		sword. Under this sort of pressure, he was forced to use his sword
		techniques and his footwork techniques to their utmost.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hu!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hu!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword howled.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly felt
		intoxicated. Right at this moment, his body and his sword seemed to
		be in perfect harmony, and he seemed to even somehow feel the ‘body’
		of the sword itself, and even the wind which blew past the sword at
		high speed.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chi!” The blunt
		black sword gently chopped against a cavalry saber. It trembled, but
		then with a twist, it pushed the enemy’s blade to the side and out
		of the enemy’s control. And then, the tip of the sword went
		forward, stabbing into the warrior’s chest. The warrior felt the
		pressure against his chest, and he immediately retreated two steps,
		then sat down.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hu.” The blunt
		black sword slashed through a curved pattern in the air, easily
		avoiding the opponent’s blocking longspear, then slapping with the
		flat against the bald warrior’s face. With a bang, one of the man’s
		tooth went flying and was knocked away.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time seemed to past as
		slowly as a leaf falling down in the autumn wind.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword had
		suddenly become extremely nimble, and the movements of his sword were
		careful and minute, able to change in a flash. In a life and death
		battle…a momentary advantage was enough to change the outcome of a
		battle into a victory. Thus, although Ning had previously found it
		very hard to resist those nine warriors, he now, in the blink of an
		eye, was able to knock them all down.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
		young master.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
		young master, on your swordplay reaching the ‘advanced’ stage,
		‘one with the sword’.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The warriors were both
		shocked and excited. All of them congratulated him.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A youth who was merely
		ten years old was able to reach the ‘advanced’ stage of
		swordplay, and become ‘one with the sword’. This was more
		incredible than even the accomplishments of his father, the ‘Raindrop
		Sword’, Ji Yichuan.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” Ning
		was extremely excited as well. Six years. Six years of constantly
		training with the sword. Every day, aside from the time he spent
		training his archery skills outside the city at dawn, he spent
		virtually all of his time training with the sword. Sometimes he would
		train with his father, while sometimes he would train with his
		father’s disciples. Sometimes, he would spar against the army
		soldiers.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword had long ago
		imprinted itself into his bones.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After training with the
		sword for ten million times, his accuracy with the sword had reached
		a terrifying level a long time ago.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And, with his ability
		to split his mind, his sword techniques became all the more elusive
		and unpredictable.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had the body of a
		Fiendgod, and in terms of Ki Refining, he had already reached the
		peak of the Houtian stage in internal energy. This caused his sword
		attacks to be unstoppable.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And finally, today!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of these
		accumulated experiences had formed a cohesive whole, and he entered
		the ‘advanced’ stage of swordplay, ‘one with the sword’!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, today you
		have helped me to make a breakthrough. Although I don’t have much,
		I am giving each of you a beasthead of gold. Don’t try to refuse.”
		Ning laughed loudly.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine warriors
		exchanged glances, then said in unison, “Thank you, young master!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If they had simply
		lost, they wouldn’t have accepted it. After all, these Ninefang
		Warriors had their own pride and dignity. But for young master Ning
		to reach the ‘one with the sword’ level was a major, joyous
		occasion. Such a joyous occasion…it was only fair and proper that
		they, too, receive some gifts.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nine of them.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Spring
		Grass and Autumn Leaf, his two maids, hurriedly ran over with stone
		platters. Atop the stone platters were nine beastheads of gold. They
		were all the highest quality gold! The nine warriors laughed as they
		accepted it, while at the same time, feeling moved…young master
		Ning truly was powerful. But they had all seen with their own eyes
		how hard Ning had worked over these years.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
		young master. Felicitations, young master.” After the nine warriors
		left, Spring Grass and Autumn Leaf allowed their faces to be covered
		with joy and celebration.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six years had passed,
		and the two maids were now twenty years old. This was the most
		bewitching age for a woman. Maids such as these would usually be
		their master’s women, which is why they had long ago in their
		hearts decided to consider Ning as their world, as their god. To see
		their young master become so powerful, they naturally were extremely
		happy.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” Ning
		laughed as well.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anyone would be
		excited. After all, he had trained bitterly since he was young. How
		could he not be excited upon succeeding?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only after training
		with the sword for two years had his father decided that his ‘body’
		and his ‘mind’ were prepared to learn sword techniques. Only then
		had he been taught the [108 Swords of the Gods and Demons] technique.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After another year,
		when he mastered the first level, his father permitted him to spar
		with others.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After three more years,
		culminating in this day today, he had finally reached the second
		level, the ‘advanced’ level, becoming ‘one with the sword’.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spring Grass, Autumn
		Leaf, come with me.” Ning called out. What he wanted to do the most
		right now was to go see his parents.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep in the mountain
		ranges, there was a series of furious howls.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a large
		number of black armored riders, and these armored riders all had
		extremely thick armor, all covered with spikes as well. Their mounts
		were tall and powerful furry beasts with a single horn. These furry
		beasts had two curved, fierce looking fangs which flashed with cold
		light. Their four hooves were thick and sturdy. When they ran, the
		earth itself shook.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hundred black
		armored riders all gave off the aura of powerful experts.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?” The black
		armored riders all turned to stare at a place nearby. They saw a
		distant mountain quickly begin to turn red, and then begin to
		transform into scorching hot lava. A large amount of lava began to
		pour out from somewhere in the mountain, and faintly, a human figure
		could be seen walking on top of the lava, his entire body covered
		with flames. He walked straight towards them.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hu.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a single step, he
		leaped to the ground. He was bringing with him a ferocious scaled
		beast that was blackish-brown in color. Behind him, there was also a
		four-hooved beast that was walking as well. Quickly, the human figure
		flew out from the middle of the lava, revealing his face…it was a
		face belonging to an old man, with fiery red hair and a small scarlet
		snake hanging from his ear. The four-hooved beast also walked to the
		viper elder’s side, seeming extremely obedient.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The
		hundred black armored riders called out respectfully.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The viper elder laughed
		loudly. “We came hunting, but I didn’t expect that we would run
		into an Armored Wyrm. My luck isn’t bad. This Armored Wyrm is very
		close to becoming a Xiantian lifeform. When I get home, I need to
		spend some time raising it.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, master!” A
		voice suddenly rang out from the skies.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Lee raised his head.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In mid-air, an enormous
		flying beast with blue feathered wings could be seen, with a man
		wearing an exquisite beast pelt seated atop it. After the flying
		beast landed at high speed, the rider immediately jumped off and
		landed on the ground, then came to one knee. “Master, there’s
		news from the Prefecture.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Speak.” Lee
		frowned.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yichuan’s son,
		Ning, has entered the ‘one with the sword’ stage today.” The
		man said respectfully.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lee stared at him, the
		fire surrounding his body blazing hotter. He was so angry that his
		entire body began to shake. Suddenly, he smashed that Armored Wyrm he
		had captured into the distant mountain cliff. The heavy monstrous
		beast, at least ten thousand pounds in weight, turned into a blur.
		With a bang, it smashed against the distant mountain cliff, and on it
		appeared an enormous crevice which was now surrounded by
		hundred-meter long cracks. The Armored Wyrm lay there in the crevice,
		blood pouring from its head, and its scales shattered. It had been
		smashed to death.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Return to the West
		Prefecture City!” Lee ground his teeth for a long time before
		finally shouting out this order.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The hundred
		black armored riders said in unison. Although they felt that throwing
		away the corpse of the Armored Wyrm was a huge waste, their master,
		Ji Lee, was currently in a royal rage. Naturally, no one dared to
		contradict him.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble rumble.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lee, riding his
		four-hooved monstrous beast, was followed by his hundred black
		armored riders. They left the deep, mysterious mountain forest and
		quickly disappeared, only leaving behind that Armored Wyrm in that
		crevice in the mountainside, its blood still dripping down the cliff.
	</P>

		Chapter 13 - Five Major Sword Techniques
	</H1>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a sinister look on
		his face, Lee returned to his estate. Behind him was the four-hooved
		beast. The two entered his estate, and those servants and house
		guards all knelt down or lowered their heads when seeing him. None of
		them dared to even breathe too loudly. They could all tell that their
		master, Lee, was in an extremely foul mood. Someone who upset him
		might be slapped to death.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father.” A sound
		from afar, and a middle-aged man clad in beast fur with dozens of
		braids in his hair came out.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lee glanced at him. The
		person was his most competent son, and also one who had become a
		Xiantian lifeform; Ji Jadewich. Frowning, he said, “Jadewich, is
		this true? I just went out hunting, and shortly afterwards, I
		received news that Yichuan’s little animal has reached the
		‘advanced’ stage of swordplay, ‘one with the sword’?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is, father.”
		Jadewich shook his head and sighed. “Today, Ji Ning and nine
		Ninefang Warriors were sparring. He made a breakthrough in swordplay
		while sparring. There’s no doubt about this at all.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Argh!” Lee let out
		an angry sound. “The Heavens have set themselves against me, Ji
		Lee. My elder brother, Ji Young, was inferior to me, but due to my
		arrogance, I allowed him to seize the position of Prefecture Lord. He
		produced an outstanding descendant, Ji Yichuan, making his lineage
		even more stable. But now, an even more outstanding Ji Ning has been
		produced, who in six years managed to reach the ‘one with the
		sword’ level!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Reaching the ‘one
		with the sword’ level in just six years. Those three geniuses we
		selected from those countless tribes are far inferior to him by
		comparison.” Jadewich shook his head as well.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the sake of
		blocking Ning’s progression, they had specially selected three
		outstandingly talented children near Ning’s age, and began to teach
		them from a young age. But they were still inferior to Ning.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just a bit off. If
		Grizzly was just three years younger…” Jadewich sighed.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grizzly?” Lee was
		startled.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Grizzly was his foster
		son.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, when he
		had led the army to punish one of the larger tribes for a
		transgression, he had encountered a Diremonster, a ‘Golden Grizzly
		Bear’. After a vicious, terrifying battle, the Golden Grizzly Bear
		had finally fled in defeat. Lee then raided the Golden Grizzly Bear’s
		lair, and found inside the lair an infant child. The infant wasn’t
		a year old, but was born with tremendous strength…and was very much
		to Lee’s liking. He had said, “Kid, you were snatched by a Golden
		Grizzly Bear but weren’t killed. Instead, it raised you?
		Hahaha…from today onwards, you will be the adopted son of myself,
		Ji Lee. I’ll name you…Grizzly!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was common for
		someone to raise an adopted son who possessed extraordinary
		abilities.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Grizzly was
		brought back home, it was determined that he was one year old. He was
		now thirteen years old. Lee treated and raised Grizzly as a
		terrifying monstrous beast, having him engage beasts in battle since
		he was an infant, and sometimes even with monstrous beasts.
		Naturally, he also taught Grizzly the most suitable training methods…
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the middle of all
		that combat, last year, Grizzly had reached the stage of ‘one with
		the saber’.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ceremony of the
		Golden Sword is held every four years. There will be one this year.”
		Jadewich narrowed his eyes. “Four years from now, there will be
		another one. In another four years…Grizzly will be seventeen. Only
		those sixteen and younger can participate in the Ceremony of the
		Golden Sword. Four years from now, Grizzly won’t even be able to
		participate, much less stop Ning!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The only hope we
		have right now is that the three little brats I took in will be able
		to become a Xiantian lifeform within these next four years.” Lee
		muttered.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Jadewich
		nodded. “I personally selected the three of them out of all of the
		tribes as the most suited for Ki Refining. They’ve reached the peak
		of the Houtian level long ago. If a single one of them can advance to
		the Xiantian level, then our victory is assured.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lee nodded as well. “A
		Xiantian Ki Refiner is capable of using magical treasures and would
		definitely win. Only, it is simply too hard to become a Xiantian
		lifeform…”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All we can do is
		wait and see what Fate has to offer.” Jadewich said softly.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lee nodded lightly.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they were
		struggling over the Prefecture Lord position, Ji Lee and Ji Jadewich
		never even thought about killing Ji Ning. In this vast world, for a
		clan to be able to survive…they had to be unified, and fratricide
		was definitely forbidden! In addition, Ning had already been selected
		as a potential heir. If someone dared to try and use a wicked method
		to kill Ji Ning, most likely everyone in the Five Prefectures of the
		Ji Clan would join forces to punish the murderer!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thick, large candle
		lit up the hall. Yichuan was seated in the primary seat, while Snow
		and Ning sat close to him.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three of them were
		eating the meal in front of them on the table.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yichuan.” Snow
		looked at her son, his hands and mouth greasy from the meat he was
		eating. Her eyes were filled with pride. “Our son Ning mastered the
		basics in three years, and in three more years became ‘one with the
		sword’! It seems it will be easy for him to gain the position of
		Prefecture Lord.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Holding a ramshorn
		goblet, Yichuan nodded lightly. “When Ning sparred with the others,
		he only used his internal force. He didn’t use any of the power of
		the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], the number one
		Fiendgod Body Refining method. And in addition, when sparring with
		outsiders, Ning has only used a single sword.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Others didn’t know
		how powerful Ning was, but Yichuan and his wife knew exactly how
		capable their son was.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seizing the golden
		sword?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As easy as picking
		something out of his pocket!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, at his current
		level of power, is already easily capable of seizing the golden
		sword. In four more years, even Xiantian lifeforms won’t be able to
		stop him.” Yichuan poured himself another cup of wine.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
		simply sit there, eating and drinking prodigious amounts of food.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because he trained in
		the number one Fiendgod Body Refining, the [Crimsonbright Diagram of
		the Nine Heavens], he possessed the appetite of a Fiendgod as well.
		He could easily eat dozens of pounds of the meat of monstrous beasts
		in every meal. He had reached the third level of the [Crimsonbright
		Diagram of the Nine Heavens] two years ago. He was at a bottleneck
		now, but with one more step, he would reach the fourth level!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fourth level would
		let him become a Xiantian lifeform, and one which belonged to the
		number one Fiendgod Body Refining technique. His battle ability would
		far outstrip that of normal Xiantian lifeforms by a hundred times or
		a thousand times.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gurgle, gurgle,
		gurgle.” Ning drank large mouthfuls of hot water, pouring it all
		down his mouth, then rubbed his stomach as he put it down. “That
		feels good.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning.” Snow looked
		at her son with a laugh.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother.” Ning was
		very obedient. He could sense that his father cherished him but also
		valued the clan, while his mother had placed virtually all of her
		hopes and concerns in him. In her mother’s eyes, perhaps even the
		rise and fall of the entire Ji clan wasn’t nearly as important as
		her son.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow looked at her son.
		“When your father taught you the [108 Swords of the Gods and
		Demons], it was the most complicated level of sword techniques you
		could learn, and it was the most suitable set of sword techniques for
		you to reach the ‘one with the sword’ level. However, now that
		you have already reached that level, the [108 Swords of the Gods and
		Demons] technique is no longer of much use to you.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Yichuan
		looked at his son. “Now, Ning! When I had you prepare your ‘body’
		and your ‘mind’, I needed you to make all of your attacks as fast
		as lightning and incomparably accurate. I needed you to imprint those
		things in your bones. Only then did I teach you the [108 Swords of
		the Gods and Demons], and the purpose of that was…to let you go
		from something simple to complicated!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The path of sword
		training first goes from simple to complicated, and then from
		complicated back to simple. Only then can one be considered to have
		mastered the sword.” Yichuan looked at his son. “You have become
		‘one with the sword’, and you can wield it as easily as your own
		hands. You can be considered to have gone from complicated back to
		simple.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He understood this
		logic. If he was so stupid as to just constantly use those thirteen
		basic stances, he could still be considered an expert swordsman, but
		without having truly experienced ‘going from simple to complicated,
		then from complicated to simple’, it would be very hard for one to
		reach the ‘one with the sword’ level.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Next, you will need
		to reach the level of being ‘one with the world’.” Yichuan
		sighed. “This step is an extremely hard step.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One with the world…”
		Ning was filled with anticipation.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The previous sword
		techniques you’ve learned are now useless to you.” Yichuan looked
		at his son. “Your current level is enough to qualify you to learn
		the highest level swordplay of the Ji clan.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes lit up.
		The highest level swordplay of the Ji clan?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Ji clan is
		famous because of our swordplay.” Yichuan sighed with emotion. “In
		turn, the city of the Ji clan of the Main Prefecture, the ‘City of
		Ten Thousand Swords’, was named because the ancestors of the Ji
		clan rose to fame due to the [Melody of Ten Thousand Swords], which
		they used to establish themselves here.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After thousands of
		years, the Ji clan now has five highest level sword arts. They are
		the [Melody of Ten Thousand Swords], [Thunderflame Sword], [Illusion
		Sutra], [Raindrop Sutra], and the [Polaris Secret Manual]. Every
		single technique is extremely profound and is beyond what the ‘one
		with the sword’ level is capable of. If you can make
		accomplishments in any of them, you will find that their power is
		boundless.” Yichuan looked at his son. “I trained in the
		[Raindrop Sutra]. Most people, even after reaching the ‘one with
		the sword’ level, is at most able to select a single one of the
		arts to train in. This is because dividing the mind is simply too
		difficult. But Ning, since you are able to divide your mind in two,
		you would be able to choose two arts to train in.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hu!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In Yichuan’s hand,
		five books suddenly appeared. He casually tossed them out, and they
		flew straight over, landing in a neat stack on a nearby table, not
		touching any of the cups or plates.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The highest level
		swordplay?” Ning looked at the five books. He understood that these
		were just abridged versions. Only after he made his choice would he
		receive the ‘full versions’.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Make your choice.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan looked at his
		son and said solemnly, “Once you have chosen, your choice will be
		recorded for the Ji clan of the Five Prefectures to review! If it
		isn’t recorded down, you will be considered to have learned in
		secret. Anyone who does that will be exterminated by the combined
		forces of the Five Prefectures.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah!” Ji Ning
		understood this, but he still couldn’t help but feel surprised.
		“Then why is it that there was no such restriction on the
		[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] technique that I
		learned?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although the
		[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] technique is the number
		one Fiendgod Body Refining, it is extremely widespread. Virtually all
		of the tribes on the level of the Ji clan possesses a copy.
		Therefore, it doesn’t matter if our copy is leaked.” Yichuan
		looked at his son. “Most Ki Refining methods and Fiendgod Body
		Refining methods aren’t very valuable. Only the ultimate techniques
		of each clan are tightly restricted, like these five sword techniques
		here. In the area around Swallow Mountain, four of these techniques
		are possessed only by our Ji clan. Only the [Polaris Secret Manual]
		is also in the possession of another entity, the Blackflame Sect.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew that in the
		area around Swallow Mountain, aside from the armies of the Grand Xia
		Dynasty that were stationed here, there were in total, five other
		hegemonic powers. The Ji clan was also one of them.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These six hegemons
		engaged in constant battle, but none of them dared to offend the
		armies of the Grand Xia Dynasty!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
		immediately lowered his head and began to read, flipping through
		these five top-class sword techniques. If a person was at the ‘one
		with the sword’ level and then also possessed this sort of
		top-class sword technique, his power would definitely multiply.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Raindrop Sutra…”
		This was the first one Ning looked at. This was the top-class
		technique which had made his father famous.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His father’s
		nickname, after all, was the ‘Raindrop Sword’!

		Chapter 14 - The Cage
	</H1>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Raindrop Sutra]. The
		principle behind it was that of the saying, ‘dripping water can
		eventually tunnel through a rock’.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Its attacks were soft
		yet inexhaustible, seemingly as endless as the raindrops falling from
		the skies during a rainstorm, making the enemy find it difficult to
		even dodge. In turn, its defenses were utterly airtight…and at the
		same time, when tens of millions of raindrops converged on one point,
		it could form a terrifyingly explosive force. Even ordinary drops of
		water could eventually tunnel through a rock; the sword that had been
		transformed into ‘raindrops’ would naturally contain an
		unshakable, unyielding power.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Raindrop Sutra]
		truly is profound and wondrous.” Ning nodded as he read it, then
		picked up the second book, [Polaris Secret Manual].
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Polaris Secret
		Manual] was part of the legendary [Polaris Sword Manual]. It was
		divided into seven different sword stances, known as Dubhe, Merak,
		Phecda, Megrez, Alioth, Mizar, and Alkaid. These seven major sword
		stances all contained the power of the stars. They could be as
		ferocious and savage as the Voracious Alkaid Wolf Sword, or the
		extremely soft and extremely sinister Melodious Megrez Sword…
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword technique was
		unfathomably mysterious, and was very hard to defend against.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a good sword
		technique.” Ning sighed in amazement as he read, before picking up
		the other three books.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Thunderflame Sword].
		This was something which the ancestors of the Ji clan, when roving
		and training themselves elsewhere in the world, had been lucky enough
		to find. They had found a half-burned remnant of a book, and the
		words in it were not very clear. Only two words on the title could be
		seen: Thunderflame! In addition, they were only able to reclaim three
		complete sword stances from the book.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the stances were
		used to attack. When the stances were used, it was as though it
		contained the power of heavenly thunder and hellish flames. There was
		no question that in terms of attack power, it was the undisputed
		champion amongst the sword techniques of the Ji clan! For just three
		stances to allow it to be ranked amongst the Five Major Sword
		Techniques of the Ji clan, one could imagine how that unnamed
		complete sword technique…definitely outstripped the other four
		sword techniques vastly.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, although its
		strengths were apparent, its weaknesses were also apparent. This was
		because these vicious stances…were only three in number. Thus, they
		didn’t perfectly link to each other. In addition, all three stances
		were purely offensive, without any defensive stances. How could
		experts, when engaged in battle, have no defensive stances? Thus,
		very few people would choose to train in this sword technique.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really want to see
		what the complete Thunderflame Sword looks like.” Ning couldn’t
		help but sigh.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we had a complete
		copy,” the nearby Yichuan said, “Then it would be, without
		question, the number one Immortal technique in Swallow Mountain.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, then
		picked up the fourth book.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Illusion Sutra].
		Strictly speaking, this wasn’t a sword technique, because once one
		truly understood the meaning of the word ‘Illusion’, one could
		execute an ‘Illusion Saber’ technique, or an ‘Illusion Spear’
		technique, or an ‘Illusion Staff’ technique…this was an
		insidious and powerful attacking technique that allowed one to hide
		one’s true abilities and actions. Opponents often would die before
		even knowing what happened.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This technique was
		sinister to the extreme.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This isn’t suited
		to my temperament.” The first technique Ning discarded was the
		[Illusion Sutra]. Picking something suited to a person was very
		important. A technique that was opposite of one’s natural
		instincts, no matter how profound…would be incredibly difficult to
		train. Naturally, Ning immediately discarded it.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrm, the last one
		was originally the greatest strength of the Ji clan.” Ning began to
		flip through the [Melody of Ten Thousand Swords].
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Melody of Ten
		Thousand Swords] was praised as the most complicated of the five
		sword techniques, far more complicated than the [108 Swords of the
		Gods and Demons] which Ning had previously learned. But although it
		was complicated, once one truly mastered it, the [Melody of Ten
		Thousand Swords] could be simplified into three major stances. The
		‘One Sword, Ten Thousand Shadows’ stance, the ‘Ten Thousand
		Swords Become One’, and the ‘Melody of Ten Thousand Swords’.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning closed his eyes,
		pondering.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of being the
		most awe-inspiring and most complicated, or perhaps even the
		simplest, it would be the [Melody of Ten Thousand Swords].
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of being the
		most insidious and difficult to guard against, it would be the
		[Illusion Sutra].
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of being the
		most orthodox, it would be the [Polaris Secret Manual].
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of having the
		greatest defense, it would be the [Raindrop Sutra].
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of the most
		powerful attack and the deepest, most profound principles, it would
		be the [Thunderflame Sword].
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First of all, the
		[Illusion Sutra] can be excluded. It doesn’t suit my temperament!”
		Ning pondered. “The [Polaris Secret Manual] is part of the [Polaris
		Sword Manual]. In terms of attack, it isn’t very strong. In
		defense, it isn’t either. It isn’t very exquisite either…it’s
		comparatively average, but it isn’t weak in any aspect either. When
		fighting against experts, one must have some sort of advantage! The
		[Polaris Secret Manual] can be excluded as well.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only three left. The
		[Melody of Ten Thousand Swords], [Raindrop Sutra], and [Thunderflame
		Sword].”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Raindrop Sutra]
		is a must!” Ning thought to himself.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Raindrop Sutra was
		like a curtain of endless raindrops. It was the most defensive
		technique amongst the five major sword techniques.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In a battle, defensive
		abilities were even more important than attacking abilities!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his past life, Ning
		had seen many martial arts competitions. All of the champions were
		experts at dodging and defense. Even in soccer and basketball, there
		was the saying that ‘defense is king’. Although attacks were
		pretty to look at…it was defense which truly gave the best chances
		at victory.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The venue was
		different, but the logic was the same!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In life and death
		battles, defense was also important. When encountering an expert more
		powerful than one’s self, one might reach the point of only being
		able to defend and not attack. If one’s defense was strong, then
		perhaps one might still live. But once those attack-focused people
		encountered those who were even stronger than them, once their
		attacks were not able to harm the opponent, they were finished.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Defense is the same
		thing as preserving my life. First, I have to preserve my life; only
		then can I take the lives of others. In addition, this is the
		technique which my father used to become famous. With him personally
		instructing me, I will improve quickly. The [Raindrop Sutra] is a
		must.” Ning carefully continued to consider. “As for the
		[Thunderflame Sword] and the [Melody of Ten Thousand Swords]…”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright,
		[Thunderflame Sword] it is!” Ning quickly made his decision.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he was like an
		ordinary person who could only use a single sword technique, Ning
		probably would’ve made a choice between the [Raindrop Sutra] and
		the [Melody of Ten Thousand Swords].
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, since he used
		twin swords, he already had the [Raindrop Sutra] for defense. Thus,
		for the second one, he chose the most offensively powerful
		[Thunderflame Sword]. The [Thunderflame Sword] had, as its flaw, no
		defensive techniques, but as a twin-sword wielder, that wasn’t a
		flaw at all. He had already chosen the [Raindrop Sutra] for his
		defense, and thus what he now truly needed was a powerful killing
		technique.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Raindrop Sutra]
		and the [Thunderflame Sword].” Ning made up his mind. “The
		[Raindrop Sutra] is excellent at defense, while the [Thunderflame
		Sword], despite only having three strokes, has three incomparably
		powerful killer moves.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition, once my
		[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] reaches the Xiantian
		level, my Divine Sun Tattoo and Divine Moon Tattoo will allow me to
		control fire and water. Water is very suited to the [Raindrop Sutra]
		while fire is very suited to the [Thunderflame Sword]. I trust they
		will be of great help to my swordplay.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In defending, my
		defense must be so tight that not even a drop of water can get
		through!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In attacking, my
		attacks must be as explosively powerful as a fiery volcano!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have twin swords.
		One for defense, one for offense. Or perhaps I can use both for
		defense. Or both for attack. I’ll do as I please!” Ning rapidly
		began to evaluate his future possibilities in battle, and he saw the
		path with crystal clarity. He knew…only once one had a full
		understanding as to how one would develop and progress would one be
		able to avoid taking a wrong path. This would help one develop
		faster!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In warfare, strategies
		were of greater importance than tactics.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In a person’s growth,
		there was a saying that planning counted for more than effort.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one knew the right
		way one needed to advance towards, even if one didn’t make huge
		advances every day, after ten or twenty years, one would still reach
		a high level. But if one didn’t have a clear objective, and just
		blindly worked hard, a person might just be running in-place without
		improving, or perhaps even going backwards!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His careful examination
		of the books had taken two hours. That huge candle was already half
		used up. Yichuan and Snow just waited there quietly, occasionally
		exchanging a few words.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, Mother.”
		Ning suddenly spoke.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrm?” Yichuan and
		Snow both turned to look at him. Yichuan spoke. “You’ve chosen?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son, what have
		you chosen? One or two?” Snow asked.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve chosen two.”
		Ning held out the two books. “One is the [Raindrop Sutra]. The
		other is the [Thunderflame Sword].”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Raindrop Sutra]?
		[Thunderflame Sword]?” Yichuan nodded slightly. As the number one
		expert of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture, despite not having
		gained any merits in battle after his son was being born, his
		reputation had only grown. This was because no one knew how powerful
		Yichuan had become…but no one could dispute that in even ten years,
		Yichuan had already become the number one expert of the West
		Prefecture.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His judgment was
		therefore exceptional.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Yichuan
		nodded.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’d like to hear
		your advice, Father.” Ning hurriedly said.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No rush.” Yichuan
		shook his head. “I have some thoughts on the [Raindrop Sutra], but
		you’ve never trained it in before. Thus, even if I explained my
		thoughts to you, you wouldn’t be able to comprehend them. You have
		to first train hard, and even engage in life-and-death battles,
		before I can successfully guide you.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tomorrow at dawn, I
		will give you the full copies of the [Raindrop Sutra] and the
		[Thunderflame Sword]. At that time, you will perform them in front of
		me once. As long as you can get the postures and movements right,
		that will be enough.” Yichuan nodded. “Three days later, you will
		begin to engage in real battles. Those sparring matches you usually
		do are too simple and soft. You need to fight in real life-and-death
		battles.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was puzzled.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, haven’t I
		already engaged in life-and-death battles?” Ning couldn’t help
		but ask. “In the past, when you acknowledged that my skill had
		reached the first level in sword training, the basic level, didn’t
		you have me fight against and kill some prisoners who had been
		sentenced to death?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He still remembered the
		first time he had killed someone. At that time, his entire body had
		been trembling, uncontrollably so. Although he rationally knew that
		he shouldn’t be afraid, he still couldn’t help but shake.
		According to what his father had said…aside from a very few people
		who lived for slaughter, this was the normal reaction of most people
		the first time they killed someone.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having killed
		dozens of people sentenced to death row, he had grown calmer.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That wasn’t a
		battle. That was just training your courage.” Yichuan shook his
		head. “Fighting against convicts? All of them were weaker than you.
		How can that be called a life-and-death battle? Three days from now…I
		will arrange for you to engage in a true battle with monstrous
		beasts, powerful ones that have already reached mastery in the
		Houtian level.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Monsters?” Ning’s
		face changed.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those captured
		monsters will turn insane and ferocious for food and for the chance
		to live. In addition, they won’t show you any mercy at all.”
		Yichuan looked at his son. “In front of a massive cage, you will
		fight against the monstrous beasts, one on one. This is the battle
		which all important descendants of the Ji clan must go through; the
		‘Cage Battle’. Over half of these important descendants will die
		in that cage.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Half?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was briefly
		shocked, but then grew calm again. This was because he knew that the
		women and the slaves in the various tribes were highly fertile, but
		the total population here had never changed. Why? Because the savage
		environment had caused the tribes to need to struggle against the
		heavens, against the earth, against the Diremonsters hidden within
		the mountains and valleys, and even against other tribes. Only a few
		would be able to survive! Even though he was born into the Ji clan,
		he still needed to face tough, relentless training. Only the elite
		would survive.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was precisely
		because all the clan members of the Ji clan were so strong that the
		Ji clan was famous and had become a local hegemon!

	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three days later, at

	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dragon Castle was three
		hundred meters wide, a thousand meters long, and was divided into two
		parts; the Cage, and the tunnels for the monstrous beasts. The Cage
		was where the life-and-death battles would be carried out, while the
		beast tunnels were where the monstrous beasts were imprisoned.
		Because Dragon Castle held many monstrous beasts inside, it was
		extremely dangerous, which is why it had been built outside of the

	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dragon Castle. Within

	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning entered the Cage
		and looked around. This was an empty area that was two or three

		formed a metal web, preventing anyone from fleeing.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This place is
		completely sealed.” Yichuan, who faintly emanated a cold aura,
		said, “The walls are formed with blackwater iron. Although
		blackwater iron isn’t a particularly precious material, most early
		stage Xiantian will find it very difficult to damage such a thick
		blackwater iron wall. As for the thick chains above, those are also
		made from blackwater iron. Given your strength…if you are to use
		the power within the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] and
		use your full strength, you should be able to break apart the chains.
		But a web like this formed from many chains…you will probably need

		escape.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look.” Yichuan

	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your mother and I,

	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Roar!” The snow
		white dog also looked at Ning, his eyes filled with encouragement and
		anticipation. This snow white dog was his father Yichuan’s lifelong
		friend, and was also his own Uncle White. In total, his father had
		tamed two Diremonsters; one was that massive black python, the

		White.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Beasts, upon gaining a

		transform into monstrous beasts!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Monstrous beasts, after
		managing the difficult art of transformation, would enter the
		Xiantian level and become Xiantian lifeforms. Only then would they be
		considered Diremonsters. Generally speaking, Diremonsters were
		capable of transforming into humans, such as Uncle Black. But amongst
		monstrous beasts, there was a very unique type of creature: the
		Godbeasts.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godbeasts were magical
		beasts that contained some of the bloodline of those ancient
		Fiendgods of the past. They were born intelligence, and possessed
		powerful natural gifts. Their strength was far greater than that of
		ordinary monstrous beasts. They also found it extremely hard to
		transform into human forms, and for different Godbeasts, the level of
		difficulty was different as well.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some needed to reach
		the ‘Zifu’ level before they could take human form. Some needed
		to reach the ‘Wanxiang’ level. Some, even higher…
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Uncle White was a

		tongue.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning and the
		Whitewater Hound were extremely close to each other, because after
		having been taught archery by his teacher, Blindfish, Ning would
		spend every morning with the Whitewater Hound at the forests outside

		to rest easy with his son going out by himself, which is why he asked
		the Xiantian lifeform, the ‘Whitewater Hound’, to help protect
		him.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of a Xiantian

	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just watch.”

	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Growl.” The
		Whitewater Hound let out a growl as well, then followed Yichuan and
		Snow to the narrow walkway. Soon, they arrived at the viewing
		platform.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a soft
		breath, calming himself down as he looked around him.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why do I feel like
		I’m in the Coliseum?” Ning secretly murmured. “There’s a
		place for battle, and there’s a viewing platform.” He knew that
		generally speaking, only the important disciples of the clan would be
		permitted to engage in battle against monstrous beasts here, which is
		why the elders and family members of the clan would often come watch.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hua….” “Hua…”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hua…”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sound of chains
		clanking against each other could be heard from a distant tunnel.
		Ning couldn’t help but turn to look, and within that pitch black
		tunnel…he could faintly make out a low, angry growling sound, a
		sound which actually shook the entire cage. Even the massive chain
		net above the cage was quivering with the noise.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A massive, silver
		furred head slowly appeared from within the distant tunnel.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is that?”
		Ning looked carefully.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning.” Yichuan
		said coldly from the viewing platform above the cage, “You train in
		the number one Fiendgod Body Refining, so I specially selected an
		extremely powerful monstrous beast for you, one with the lineage of
		the Fiendgods: A Howling Moonwolf.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes widened
		as he stared above at his father, a look of shock on his face.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A beast that possessed
		the lineage of the Fiendgods?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Then that would be a
		Godbeast, right? But it made sense; Godbeasts were a type of
		monstrous beast. In the vast world, there were still a good number of
		Houtian level Godbeasts that roamed about, such as the Armored Wurm,
		the Earthquake Rhino, the Howling Moonwolf, the Redclawed
		Goldenraven, the Thundersea Owl, or the Whitewater Hound. Generally
		speaking, out of every thousand Houtian level Godbeast, only one
		would be able to break through to the Xiantian lifeform level.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hua…” The metal
		clanking sound continued.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t lose his
		focus. He stared at the giant tunnel in the wall. He knew that they
		were probably removing the chains on the other side. Once the chains
		were removed, the Howling Moonwolf would be released.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pengcheng!” The
		sound of metal chains hitting the floor.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hoooooowl!”
		Instantly, a carefree wolf’s howl rang out. In the air above,
		Yichuan, his wife, and the Whitewater Hound stared carefully down
		below.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning held his breath.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From the distant
		tunnel, a massive creature slowly made its way out. Its entire body
		was covered with beautiful silver fur. It was over two meters tall,
		and its steps were graceful. It stared at the tiny little pipsqueak
		standing in the distance; a human male. As one of the special types
		of monstrous beasts, a Godbeast, the creature’s intelligence wasn’t
		lower than that of humans.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It knew that there were
		only two possible outcomes after entering this cage. The first was to
		kill this human and continue to live. The other was to be killed by
		this human youth.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He picked a Godbeast
		for me the first time here.” Ning stretched out his right hand, and
		a sword appeared in it out of nowhere, gleaming with cold light.
		“Then let’s kill it.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Howling Moonwolf’s
		massive body weighed nearly ten thousand pounds, but its four legs
		moved with great agility as it closed the distance. Its long, narrow
		eyes inspected this human youth.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning walked forward,
		one step at a time, with longsword in hand.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distance between
		the two quickly drew near.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shua!” The Howling
		Moonwolf’s movements suddenly changed from being graceful to being
		savage, and it suddenly transformed into a blur as it pounced at
		Ning, and its previously soft paws suddenly had sharp claws emerge
		from it as well.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the critical moment,
		Ning suddenly moved, as graceful as the wind as he dodged the Howling
		Moonwolf’s pounce, and then stabbed out with the sharp sword in his
		hand! The stab was extremely forceful and straight, and it was also
		fast as lightning. If it managed to land on the Howling Moonwolf’s
		body, it would be able to borrow the charging force of the Moonwolf
		and tear its body open!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?” As he
		stabbed, Ning’s face suddenly changed. The sword tip had met with a
		powerful blocking force. The Howling Moonwolf’s fur had blocked the
		tip of the sword, preventing it from penetrating through.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time, the
		Howling Moonwolf suddenly sent its tail whisking towards Ning. Unable
		to dodge in time, Ning quickly used his sword to block.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Moonwolf’s tail
		landed against the blade like a heavy iron whip, and the powerful
		force knocked Ning flying away, his body slamming against the distant
		blackwater iron wall with a boom. Bang! The thick wall trembled
		violently.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Roar!” The Howling
		Moonwolf immediately followed up with another pounce as it slashed at
		Ning with its claws.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quickly dodged
		with a flying leap.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chi! Chi! Chi! Several
		deep claw marks appeared on the blackwater iron wall. The Moonwolf
		landed on the ground, then stared at the distant human youth. Its
		tail attack was its killing weapon. Its tail had sent the human youth
		slamming into the wall, but the human youth had actually been able to
		quickly dodge far away. It understood that this human youth truly was
		very powerful, powerful enough to give him a good fight.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An ordinary Ninefang
		Warrior, upon meeting with that tail, would probably have their
		organs split open.” Ning frowned as he stared at the Howling
		Moonwolf. “It seems I’ll have to rely on the power of the
		Fiendgod Body Refining.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These years, he had
		also engaged in Ki Refining and had reached mastery of the Houtian
		level.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But his attacks with
		Houtian level Ki Refining techniques couldn’t even break through
		the fur. How could he use it to fight?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrmph!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a deep
		growl, and from his nostrils came forth two streams of energy that
		were visible to the naked eye. The streams of energy were causing the
		air itself to shake. At that moment, the hidden, terrifying potential
		strength that was lying dormant in his body suddenly exploded forth,
		and the hidden Solar Strength and Lunar Strength exploded as well,
		and his entire body began to turn faintly red.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a slight movement
		of the sword in his hands, Ning shattered the air before him and
		carved a huge ditch into the thick earth.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Howling
		Moonwolf let out a low growl, staring fixedly at this youth.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The child has
		finally begun to use the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine
		Heavens].” Snow laughed. “Before this, he was still trying to
		avoid doing so.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan nodded. “The
		Howling Moonwolves have the lineage of the Fiendgods. Their fur is
		incomparably tough, and ordinary Houtian experts aren’t able to
		break through it. I chose this creature on purpose…to force Ning to
		use all of his strength, and see how much of it he can use in a real,
		life-and-death battle.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you think
		about the look on Ning’s face?” Yuchi Snow asked.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Average.” Ji
		Yichuan stared down. “He’s fairly calm.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Spinning the sword in
		his hand, Ning slowly walked towards the Howling Moonwolf, circling
		around it.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Moonwolf stared at
		Ning as well, choosing not to rashly attack. This was because once it
		attacked…it would expose its own flaws as well. That would the
		moment which determined life or death.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrmph.” Not
		hesitating at all, Ning suddenly charged forward after the Moonwolf,
		his body becoming a blur.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a howl, the
		Howling Moonwolf immediately pounced over as well, opening its
		massive maw and revealing its sharp fangs. Its sharp claws tore at
		Ning as well.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shua!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A flash of the sword!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The shadow of a sword
		slashed through the air, striking in a short range while changing
		trajectories nine times. Its speed was terrifyingly fast, so fast
		that it was as though even the void was being chopped apart with it.
		Chi chi chi chi chi. The flashing sword chopped at the Moonwolf’s
		chest, carving out a massive wound, and fresh blood instantly spurted
		out.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Block.” Just after
		Ning chopped out with one sword, he immediately turned his sword back
		and blocked the Howling Moonwolf’s claw, while simultaneously
		borrowing the clashing force to fly backwards and retreat.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Howling Moonwolf
		stared furiously at Ning. The massive wound on its chest was
		shrinking, and the flow of blood began to slow, but it still
		continued to drip blood. Clearly, that wound had simply been too
		massive.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Howling Moonwolf
		was now truly sensing the impending arrival of death!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Thunderflame
		Sword]’s technique, ‘Thunderflash Flint’, really is
		extraordinary. Ning sighed softly.
	</P>
	<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

		Chapter 16 - Causing Devastation
	</H1>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having received
		two consummate sword techniques, Ning had been training hard, of
		course. He was now capable of utilizing the techniques of the
		[Raindrop Sutra] and the [Thunderflame Sword], and his power had
		increased. However, he had only learned a tiny bit, and he wasn’t
		even at the level of expertise, much less mastery. After all, even
		his father, Yichuan, was still pondering on the secrets of the
		[Raindrop Sutra].
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thunderflash Flint was
		one of the three killer moves of the [Thunderflame Sword]. It relied
		on a single word; fast!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As fast as lightning!
		As swift as flame!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning’s swordplay
		and his footwork are both exquisite.” Snow said in praise from the
		viewing platform. “Although the Howling Moonwolf is as fast as a
		shadow, even faster than Ning, Ning has relied on the [Shadewind
		Steps] to constantly change directions. He’s in complete control of
		this battle. His swordplay has reached the ‘advanced’ level, and
		he can quickly make multiple changes in his movements. In dealing
		with that monstrous wolf…it can be said that his defense is
		airtight.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan nodded. “With
		the Fiendgod Body Refining, Ning’s great strength is his forte,
		while his speed is a bit weaker…but this is a Godbeast, after all.
		It has an extremely strong life force. A wound like this is just a
		skin wound to it. When it starts fighting all out, and with Ning
		never having experienced such a vicious life and death battle before,
		the results will be hard to predict.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Below, Ning had the
		feeling that everything was under control, and he continued to wield
		the sword in his hand as he drew near the Moonwolf.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Awoooooo!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sensing the threat of
		death from this human youth, the Moonwolf gave a savage howl. All the
		fur on its body stood up straight as needles, and its eyes turned
		hard, its pupils flashing. Those who were familiar with Moonwolves
		could tell…that this one had already entered a wild, bestial state.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A terrifying aura
		spread forth from it, causing Ning to pause.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A killing aura?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Growl!” The
		Howling Moonwolf charged towards him, the earth shaking beneath it.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning dodged as agilely
		as the wind, changing directions with a simple step. At the same
		time, his sword flashed. Chi! Fresh blood sprayed out once more, and
		yet another enormous wound appeared on the Moonwolf’s chest, but
		this time, the Moonwolf didn’t care at all as it sent its two pairs
		of ferocious paws towards Ning, its knife-like claws slashing through
		the air.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning calmly retreated
		while at the same time, using his sword to block.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ka!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Moonwolf’s left
		paw slammed against the sharp sword, its paw seeming to have
		transformed into a hook which suddenly latched onto the sword. But
		how could Ning’s sword, infused with his Fiendgod Body Refining
		power, be so easily caught? If the two clashed and then immediately
		flew apart, it wouldn’t have been so bad, but the Moonwolf wanted
		to fight that power head on with his claws, and so it smashed it hard
		against the sword.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ka!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Moonwolf’s left
		paw clearly turned red with blood, and the faint sound of bones
		breaking could be heard.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other paw came at
		Ning’s chest. The distance was simply too close, and there was no
		chance to block. Ning’s only option was to take a deep breath, and
		his chest suddenly retracted in by three centimeters. Chi! Chi! Chi!
		The tough animal fur over Ning’s chest was ripped to tatters. Blood
		spouted everywhere, and Ning was knocked flying as well, striking
		against the ground and making the earth itself crack from the impact.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Ning hurriedly
		pulled away.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Injured.” Ning
		looked at the Moonwolf, his eyes narrowing.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just then, the Moonwolf
		had actually chosen to use its paw to take his sword head on. The
		Howling Moonwolf didn’t care about what injuries upon itself were
		being inflected, as it was going all out. Its left paw was now half
		useless, and its speed had dropped dramatically as well. But the paw
		blow it had landed on Ning had torn through Ning’s beast skin
		clothes. The beast skin clothes were part of the fur from a Xiantian
		lifeform. Without any monstrous power infused into it, the defense
		would be a bit weaker, but generally speaking the fur from a Xiantian
		lifeform would be able to block the attacks of a Houtian monster.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the Howling
		Moonwolf was a Godbeast. Its full strength attack was able to rip the
		fur apart.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In order to further
		train himself…although Ning had the protection of the Goldstar
		Shirt and could use it to guard his entire body, Ning had shrank its
		defensive radius to only protect his most vulnerable areas.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A life-and-death
		battle is different from a spar. I can’t just use the experience I
		gained while sparring.” Ning quickly changed his calculations.
		“When sparring, nobody will engage in self-destructive behavior,
		but in a life-and-death battle…the goal is to kill the opponent.
		For the sake of this goal, any price is worth paying.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I need to be more
		careful and more cautious.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was like a sponge,
		quickly absorbing the learned experience. The fierce scar over his
		chest was visibly shrinking. The blood from it began to stop, and
		soon, it totally closed over, leaving behind a red line which then
		turned into white, clear skin. No lasting damage at all!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the powerful
		regenerative power provided by Fiendgod Body Refining.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ordinary Fiendgod Body
		Refining techniques only required a person to reach the Xiantian
		level before being able to regrow severed limbs. But Ning trained in
		the number one Fiendgod Body Refining, and his healing abilities were
		nearly on par with that sort of regeneration already.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent!” Ning
		cracked his lips into a smile. “It actually took my sword away.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Roaaaar.” The
		sword was stuck right beneath the Howling Moonwolf’s paw. It stared
		at Ning, its eyes filled with boundless bloodlust. The terrifying
		recuperative abilities of the human youth in front of it…it
		understood that this was a Fiendgod in human skin, with even greater
		healing abilities than Godbeasts.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his right
		hand, and yet another sharp sword appeared within it.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come again.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning transformed into a
		shadow as he pounced towards the Moonwolf.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Roaaar!” The
		Howling Moonwolf charged forward as well.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two engaged each
		other time and time again, each time exchanging blows that nearly
		took the other’s life. Ning possessed powerful healing abilities
		and terrifying power, and a fierce sword attack style! But the
		Howling Moonwolf had its fangs, sharp claws, and tail, all of which
		it could use as weapons. In addition, its massive body was so large
		that most weapon wounds were of minimal threat to it.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So he’s only using
		the Goldstar Shirt to protect his vital points.” A rare smile
		appeared on Yichuan’s face.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning really is
		trying very hard.” Snow was growing nervous as she watched.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her son’s body was
		covered in bloodstains. As his mother, how could she not worry?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry. Ning
		has still covered his body’s vital points with the Goldstar Shirt.
		Even if he is wounded, it won’t be life-threatening.” Yichuan
		said. “At most, he might lose an arm or a leg…but given his
		regenerative abilities, with a little bit of time, he’ll grow
		another one.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lose an arm or a
		leg?” Snow couldn’t help but grow frantic, but she knew how
		difficult the road to becoming an expert had to be.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hu!” “Hu!”
		“Hu!” Although Ning had the body of a Fiendgod, right now, he
		couldn’t help but pant for breath. The fur clothes on his body was
		already ripped apart in many areas, and the wound on his body was
		rapidly closing.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Roaaaar.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Moonwolf let out a
		despairing growl. It was forcing itself to stand erect, but its two
		paws were both quivering, as though it could collapse at any time.
		Its body was covered with dozens of giant wounds, and a particularly
		vicious pierce-wound was in its head.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of its legs had
		been shattered. It was already quite an impressive feat for it to be
		able to remain standing.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You lose.” Ning
		wiped the blood from the corner of his eyes, then said in a quiet
		voice, “My power is actually greater than yours, but my victory was
		quite a difficult one…the reason is because when faced with your
		bloodlust and your wildness, I was unable to be calm and bring out my
		full power. You are the first monster that I have ever killed, and
		thus, I will let you die under my greatest attack!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua! A second sword
		appeared out of nowhere in Ning’s left hand. Holding the twin
		swords, he stared at the Moonwolf.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly
		transformed into a blur as he threw himself at the Moonwolf. The
		Howling Moonwolf let out a final howl as it threw itself at Ning as
		well.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two massive flashes of
		light suddenly appeared, destroying one of the Moonwolf’s remaining
		good legs, and then, with another flash, a massive criss-cross wound
		appeared on the Howling Moonwolf’s head, sending blood and brain
		matter flying everywhere.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning landed on the
		ground.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Howling Moonwolf
		collapsed on the ground, brain matter tumbling out of the massive
		wound on its head. Its fur was stained with the color of the earth,
		and its formerly beautiful silver fur had became a stained
		combination of mud and blood, unsightly to the extreme. A descendant

	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How do you feel?”
		Yichuan looked down at his son.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I feel great.”
		Ning looked up at his father, his eyes filled with ardor. “Let’s
		do this once a day.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan’s eyelids
		twitched. He muttered, “Do you think capturing a peak Houtian level
		Godbeast is easy? Once every three days. And, most will be ordinary
		monstrous beasts. If you want to Godbeast, it’ll be a matter of
		luck. I’ll arrange for the most powerful monstrous beasts here in
		Dragon Castle to be reserved for your training.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “If I
		meet some weaker monstrous beasts, I’ll just rely on my internal
		force only.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given the power of a
		Fiendgod’s body, your ordinary peak Houtian monstrous beasts would
		be brutalized by brute force alone. This was why only Godbeasts with
		Fiendgod heritage in their blood could fight against Ning.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed by.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning fought with one
		monstrous beast after another, and his sword technique and footwork
		grew more exquisite. At the same time, he learned how to better
		maintain his calm in life-and-death battles. If his heart was not
		calm…then his power wouldn’t be able to be displayed to
		perfection.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn had come.
		Swallow Mountain had become incomparably cold, and some weak tribes
		had their lives become even more difficult. Especially when they were
		met with the savage attacks of some monsters from deep in the
		mountains…some smaller tribes might be exterminated!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Honghonghong….
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The earth was shaking.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop this barren,

		their long-furred beasts. They seemed like a black flood which was
		charging across these plains.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Halt.” A cold
		command. Three hundred powerful black armored riders instantly came
		to a halt.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Commander, this
		place is the location where that serpent monster appeared last. This
		is the territory of the Sharphorn Tribe. Three days ago, the monster
		suddenly charged at the Sharphorn Tribe and devoured eighteen people,
		then killed over a hundred. The Sharphorn Tribe was totally
		destroyed.” A black armored rider said respectfully. “This
		creature has been an impending disaster for months. It has killed
		over a thousand people and devastated over ten tribes. However, all
		of those tribes were small ones. Logically speaking, it should be a
		peak-stage Houtian level monster with the lineage of the Fiendgods,
		or perhaps a Diremonster who has newly reached the Xiantian level.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrm.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bearded man who was

		“This serpent monster has been causing wanton devastation within

	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The three

	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two days later.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a forest with
		thick foliage, a large number of black armored riders were
		surrounding a serpent monster.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Roar…” This was
		a massive, blood-red serpent which glowed with silver light around
		its torso. Around its torso, it had two pairs of sinuous claws with
		four toes, and a pair of terrifying red serpentine eyes. However,
		right now, the giant snake had been totally covered by a giant net.
		No matter how much it struggled, it couldn’t break loose.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha.” The
		bearded man in red armor laughed loudly. “Stupid snake. You were
		caught alive by us so easily. You, go tie it up.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, several
		dozen black armored knights cast one black chain after another,
		sending them flying towards the giant snake, quickly binding it up.
		The red serpent was tied up to securely that no matter how it
		contorted itself, it wasn’t able to do anything. Soon, it had been
		completely wrapped up by metal chains and bound so securely it
		couldn’t even open its mouth.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Commander, where
		does this giant snake come from? Why does it have two claws?” A
		nearby black armored rider was curious. No matter how long he had
		been pondering, he couldn’t discern what type of Godbeast this was.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bearded man
		laughed. “Serpent-type creatures are often intermingled in blood. I
		myself have seen over a hundred serpents with Fiendgod blood. Only,
		some bloodlines are very pure and therefore become famous and are
		named. A sort of mongrel mutant Godbeast like this has no name at

	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The young master
		needs some powerful Houtian level monstrous beasts to practice his
		sword on. This serpent monster would be a good choice.” The bearded
		man weighed the snake with his gaze, then nodded in satisfaction.
		“Take it back.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black armored
		riders acknowledged respectfully.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The commander of this
		regiment was a Xiantian-level lifeform belonging to the Ji clan of
		the Western Prefecture - the number one expert archer, Blindfish!
		Blindfish was still one of young master Ning’s instructors, and
		without question in the Ji clan, he stood on the side of Ji Young and
		Ji Yichuan. In addition, Blindfish was quite proud of having taught
		Ning.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The story of how young
		master Ning would use monstrous beasts to train his swordplay had
		spread quite some time ago.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all, for him to
		kill one every three days resulted in a large number of monstrous
		beasts being killed. These beasts were almost all brought back by the
		black armored riders, and so the news had quickly spread amongst the
		army.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master Ning
		reached the peak of the Houtian stage long ago, and his swordplay is
		at the advanced level of ‘one with the sword’. In addition, he is
		training in the most powerful sword technique of our Ji clan. Killing
		a peak Houtian monster should be a simple thing.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Supposedly, he’s
		even killed a Houtian level Godbeast.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Think about who
		young master Ning is. He definitely has an extremely sharp,
		unblockable precious weapon. With a weapon like this, relying on his
		‘advanced’ level sword techniques…killing a peak Houtian level
		Godbeast isn’t too hard.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The legends that were
		circulating amongst the soldiers of the West Prefecture were quite
		vivid and fanciful.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the other powerful
		member of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture, Ji Lee, believed that
		the little fellow Ning was only able to kill a Godbeast because he
		had some sort of precious weapon.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dragon Castle. The
		cage.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A powerfully built
		monstrous beast with black spots was lying on the ground. The thick
		fur on his body had been split open in many places, and blood from
		those massive wounds stained the ground.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was still standing
		there, frowning as he was thinking. The sharp sword in his hand
		disappeared into thin air. When fighting with most peak Houtian
		monsters, he only used his internal energy, and the weapons he used
		were only fairly decent weapons which couldn’t be described as
		‘precious’. After all, he was already so physically strong that
		using a precious weapon on top of that would make the training
		pointless.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning!” A voice
		from above.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
		but look up at his father, Yichuan, who was on the viewing platform.
		This made Ning quite surprised. “Father, why have you come?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because he fought every
		three days here in the Dragon Castle, aside from that first fight
		with the Howling Moonwolf, the subsequent dozens of battles, his
		father had not attended…
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wanted to see how
		your swordplay was progressing.” Yichuan said. “Have you reached
		‘initiation’ yet?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not yet.” Ning
		shook his head. “I haven’t gained expertise in any of the many
		attacks contained within the [Raindrop Sutra] or the [Thunderflame
		Sword].”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Raindrop Sutra]
		had a total of nine attack techniques.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Thunderflame
		Sword] had a total of three attack techniques.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These attack techniques
		were all very special…if one could train in them to a high level,
		one would feel as though one had become ‘one with the world’ and
		be able to use the power of the world itself. This was what was known
		as ‘initiation’. But this didn’t actually symbolize that a
		person had reached the third level of swordplay, ‘one with the
		world’, because the true ‘one with the world’ level of
		swordplay was when one could use any sword attack, be it as something
		as simple as a stab, a chop, or a scrape, and utilize the power of
		the world itself with the attack. Only then would one be at the ‘one
		with the world’ level!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Initiation only meant
		that one could temporarily reach the ‘one with the world’ effect
		when using certain techniques.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to what his
		father had said…
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon reaching
		‘initiation’, one would have reached a certain level of expertise
		in a technique.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When one reached the
		‘one with the world’ level, that means one had mastered a
		technique.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to legends…
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was an even
		higher, more profound level above the ‘one with the world’ level.
		The [Raindrop Sutra] and the [Thunderflame Sword] techniques were
		developed by people who were beyond the ‘one with the world’
		level.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There is no need for
		you to be so continuously hard working while training in the sword.”
		Yichuan said. “Today, take Spring Grass and Autumn Leaf and go for
		a stroll.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “Yes,
		father.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned his head
		and left through that narrow tunnel. As for the corpse of the dead
		monstrous beast, someone would come collect it later.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">West Prefecture City
		had hundreds of thousands of citizens. It was a large city.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, it’s
		been so long since we’ve gone for a stroll.” Spring Grass and
		Autumn Leaf, his two female servants, were clearly very happy as they
		followed by his side.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled as he
		walked on the streets. This was one of the most bustling streets in
		the entire West Prefecture City. Generally speaking, all the
		merchants would pass by this street. The street was normally ten
		meters wide, but there were so many merchant stalls on each side that
		nearly half the space was taken up, causing there to only be seven
		meters of walking space left.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look at this woman.
		Look at her ample chest, her large buttocks. She can definitely birth
		many babies. Ten lambskins for her!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These men are all
		fine warriors. They can all lift over a thousand pounds. Just five
		ingots of gold. If you buy one, we’ll throw in a kid as well.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A bald man dressed in
		beast furs was shouting at the top of his lungs. He had several dozen
		fur-clad warriors standing guard around him, while he also had many
		slaves dressed in dirty, tattered fur pelts. All of them stared
		pitifully around them, hoping that they would meet a kind master who
		would buy them. There were signs on their heads.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These signs signified
		that they were for sale.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They strolled and
		looked around.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were slave
		traders, beast fur traders, weapon traders, beast traders, monstrous
		beast traders…all sorts of people were here. There were even some
		precious books, precious weapons, poisons and herbs, secret technique
		manuals, and other things for sale.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Over a hundred
		warriors in our tribe died for us to acquire this precious weapon,
		and then we had to make our way back through the wilderness and
		encounter countless difficulties before we arrived at the West
		Prefecture City. We weren’t even willing to sell it for thirty
		beastheads of gold, but you want to try and buy it for ten? That’s
		too little. At least a hundred beastheads of gold!” A rough-voiced
		man was shouting from nearby.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced over in
		curiosity.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He saw around dozens of
		people in a circle surrounding three strong men wearing pitch-black
		furs, one of whom had a black snake coiled around his arm. The man
		continued: “A hundred beastheads of gold, whoever pays a hundred
		beastheads can take it away!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How greedy.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually dares to
		demand a hundred beastheads of gold.” Spring Grass and Autumn Leaf
		both murmured.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was surprised as
		well. A beasthead of gold was around ten pounds. A hundred beastheads
		meant a thousand pounds of gold. Although to the young master of the
		Ji clan, it was nothing, to an ordinary tribesman, it was a vast
		fortune.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter how sharp
		it is, it’s just a weapon.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It isn’t as though
		it is some perfect magic treasure. It’s just a damaged magic
		treasure that can be used as a weapon.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Twenty beastheads.
		I’ll pay twenty beastheads at most. You want to sell, and I want to
		buy!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Someone made an offer.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A hundred
		beastheads.” The man didn’t budge at all. The two men by his side
		watched the crowd carefully, afraid that someone might try to seize
		their treasure. For the sake of this treasure, many people in their
		tribe had died, and as they made their way from the tribe to the city
		through the desolate wilderness, dozens more warriors had died. They
		had to sell this treasure for a high price.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After selling it, they
		would be able to buy some slaves and some good weapons, so as to
		allow the tribe to increase its power.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me take a look.”
		Ning saw the precious weapon which the man was clutching and
		immediately stepped forward.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The people nearby all
		turned to look at him.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the young
		master of the Ji clan? The son of the Raindrop Sword?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many people stepped
		back modestly. Anyone capable of paying such a high price was an
		extraordinary person. In addition, in the past few years, Ning had
		gone every day with the Whitewater Hound outside the city to train in
		archery. Each time they left the city, many people saw and recognized
		him as the exalted young master of the Ji clan. The other people who
		didn’t recognize him, upon hearing others discuss him, were made
		aware as well.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the man with the
		black snake saw everyone else step back, then heard the words ‘young
		master of the Ji clan’ and ‘son of the Raindrop Sword’, he was
		instantly so frightened that his heart began to shake. As people who
		lived on the territory of the Ji clan, they all knew the legendary
		Raindrop Sword. This was the number one expert in the entire area
		around the Ji clan’s West Prefecture, a godlike presence.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And the person in front
		of him was the only child of the Raindrop Sword?
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me take a look.”
		Ning said.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Honored young
		master, please look.” The man respectfully offered the sword in
		both hands. The two men behind him both felt extremely nervous. They
		were afraid that this young master who had an extremely high and
		exalted status would simply take their treasure by force. In the
		tribes, for a powerful person or person with high status to seize
		treasures by force was quite common. Although it was forbidden in the
		West Prefecture City and nobody dared to challenge the laws of the Ji
		clan, the young man in front of them was a young master of the Ji
		clan, the only son of the Raindrop Sword!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning accepted the
		sword, and his hands sank down slightly from the weight. This was a
		pitch-black sword. The thick black sheath seemed very plain and
		unadorned, but if one looked at it closely, one would find that this
		scabbard actually had three swords sheathed within it.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One scabbard, three
		swords?” Surprised, Ning pulled out the swords.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While pulling out the
		three swords, a cold light flashed on the surface of the swords, and
		ancient, shattered runes glowed dimly.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a pity.” Ning
		shook his head and sighed. He had seen many treasures in the
		prefecture. Seeing those mysterious runes and the power they
		emanated, he knew that this was previously a magic treasure. It
		should have been three flying swords which were controlled by a
		Immortal practitioner. But these runes were all but destroyed.
		Clearly, this magic treasure was badly damaged. It could only be used
		as a weapon now.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chi.” Ning tested
		his finger against the blade of the sword.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful. It is very
		sharp.” The man with the serpent called out in alarm. This precious
		weapon could cut through stones like tofu.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt the skin of
		his fingertips shake slightly. He couldn’t help but feel surprise.
		“I have the Goldstar Shirt protecting my body, which is currently
		spread to every inch of my skin. Just then, when I casually sliced my
		finger…it actually impacted the Goldstar Shirt. If I were to swing
		the sword down hard, it probably would have broken through the
		Goldstar Shirt’s defense. I walk through the city streets every day
		on my way to archery training and have seen countless weapons, but
		I’ve never seen such a sharp, precious weapon.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Others only sensed that
		this weapon was very sharp, but they didn’t know exactly how sharp
		it was. But Ning had the feeling…that even his Goldstar Shirt would
		find it hard to block this precious weapon.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want this weapon.”
		Ning looked at the man with the snake.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The man was both
		excited and nervous. He hurriedly said, “Young master, for the sake
		of this weapon, our tribe…” In front of this young man of exalted
		status, he was nervous and didn’t dare to demand a certain price.

	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” With a flip

		He tossed it directly towards the man with the black serpent. “Take

	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just this little

		now!” Instantly, the nearby people began to make offers. All of
		them were people of some status in the West Prefecture City, or came
		from the clans with Xiantian lifeforms in them, or perhaps belonged
		to the powerful tribes that were located close to the West
		Prefecture. How excellent their judgment must therefore be!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The man with the black
		snake hurriedly clutched the piece of thundergold. He clearly felt
		that the weight of this item was far beyond that of normal yellow
		gold. He exchanged glances with his two friends, both shocked and
		overjoyed.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, young
		master.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, mighty
		young master.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three men instantly
		thanked him, filled with gratitude.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now you thank him?
		The Raindrop Sword is a major figure whose fame is known everywhere.
		Think about what sort of status his son has. How could he possibly
		take your weapon by force? Just the tiniest portion of his fortune
		that he could casually toss out would astonish you.” A fat,
		fur-clad old man next to them said in a loud voice. Clearly, these
		words were intentionally said for the not too distant Ning to hear.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning chuckled, and then
		casually made the sheath with the three swords disappear into his
		kalestone. Because the space inside the kalestone was limited, thus
		Ning only carried a few beastheads of gold with him. Everything else
		he had was all precious treasures.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the hall.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Yichuan was seated
		at the master’s seat, while Yuchi Snow sat on his left. The two
		were slowly eating the food on the table in front of them.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A human figure rushed
		in. It was Ning, who had finished his stroll.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, mother.”
		Ning said hurriedly.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan frowned. “Why
		didn’t you pay attention to the time when you were taking a stroll
		outside?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning obediently didn’t
		dare to make a sound, hurriedly running to his usual spot, sitting on
		his knees and beginning to eat. Their lunch was rather sumptuous,
		with all sorts of meats, bread, and wine on the table. Ning’s
		current appetite was simply voracious, and virtually all of the food
		and beverages on the table were devoured by Ning in a short period of
		time.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow laughed as she
		watched her son tear through the food like a tornado.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, mother.”
		Ning suddenly thought of the sheath and three swords he had purchased
		today. He hurriedly said, “Today, while taking the walk, I ran into
		three tribal warriors. They should have come from a distant,
		impoverished place to the Western Prefecture City. They came for the
		purpose of selling a precious weapon. And I…decided to buy it.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Precious weapon?”
		The seated Yichuan frowned. “In the treasure warehouse of our Ji
		clan here in the West Prefecture, we have plenty of precious weapons.
		In the past, didn’t you already select two precious weapons? How
		can those lowly peddlers in the city possibly have anything good.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because Ning had yet to
		read the Xiantian level in Ki Refining, he naturally couldn’t
		control any magic treasures yet, which is why he went to the treasure
		warehouse to pick out two precious swords. But of course, when
		training in the cage, he only used ordinary weapons.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, the two
		precious weapons I selected in the warehouse are far inferior to this
		one I just bought.” Ning said seriously.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Yichuan
		looked at his son.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Actually, the
		precious weapon I bought is a damaged sword-type magic treasure.”
		Ning explained. “There are occult runes carved onto it, but they
		are totally damaged. Therefore, it can only be used as a fairly sharp
		precious weapon. However, it really is sharp, far more so than the
		previous precious weapons in my residence. If I use some force, I can
		pierce through the Goldstar Shirt.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pierce through the
		Goldstar Shirt?” Yichuan revealed a hint of surprise. “Let me
		take a look.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stretched his hand
		out, and that simple, unadorned sheath and three swords appeared
		within it. Standing up, he walked it over to his father.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan accepted it and
		took a close look at the sheath, then pulled out the three swords.
		“The magic runes on the swords are totally destroyed, but it feels
		as though…this is indeed a flying sword magic treasure!
		Unfortunately, it’s a damaged magic treasure. Most damaged magic
		treasures aren’t worth much. At most, they might be sold to be
		broken down into some other materials.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had read many books,
		and knew that damaged magic treasures were not worth much, because
		the material components of magic treasures had already undergone
		various fusing techniques, making it so that even if one broke down
		the magic treasure, one wouldn’t be able to get many of the
		original components back.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chi!” Yichuan
		stroked the tip of the sword with his finger, and a hint of blood
		appeared on his fingertip. A look of shock appeared on his face.
		“What a sharp sword. Without any energy infused into it, the sword
		is still so incredibly sharp. I’ve never seen such a thing. Snow,
		come take a look. Can you tell where it comes from?”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuchi Snow accepted it
		and carefully looked it over, then slowly shook her head after a long
		time. “I can’t tell.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother, if this
		magic flying sword treasure wasn’t damaged, would it be a ‘ranked’
		treasure?” Ning hurriedly asked.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course it would
		be a ‘ranked’ treasure.” Snow nodded. “Even though it is
		damaged, the sharpness of this sword is still on par with some
		‘unranked’ magic treasures. When it was undamaged…of course it
		was a ‘ranked’ treasure. Only, exactly what rank it was at, I
		can’t tell at all. Perhaps no one in the entire area around Swallow
		Mountain can tell.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. He
		understood this.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking, the
		magic treasures owned by a Xiantian level Ki Refiner was ‘unranked’.
		Only Zifu Disciples and above would have ‘ranked’ magic
		treasures. Forging magic treasures…that was even harder. There was
		nobody in the entire Swallow Mountain area who was known to be able
		to forge magic treasures. Perhaps only in those distant, incomparably
		powerful tribes would there be an expert capable of forging magic
		treasures.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Grand Xia
		Dynasty has persisted from the Fiendgod Era until now.” Yichuan
		returned the sheath and the three swords to his son. “It rules over
		countless territories, with a history of trillions of years. Who
		knows how many tribes have risen, fallen, or been exterminated, and
		how many treasures they have left behind. It isn’t rare to see some
		magic treasures left over from wars, and our Ji clan has hundreds of
		damaged magic treasures as well, most of which are of unknown origin.
		But for this damaged magic treasure to still be so incredibly sharp
		is quite rare. It is very suited for your use.”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow then added, “Ning,
		in the future, when you reach the Xiantian level as a Ki Refiner and
		infuse your life energy into an ‘unranked’ magic treasure…its
		power still might be inferior to these swords!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Magic treasures could
		be unfathomably profound.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
		when Ki Refiners used magic treasures, they were capable of thousands
		of bizarre powers. But for Fiendgod Body Refiners…they still
		specialized in close combat. They had a virtually indestructible
		body, great strength, speed, and regenerative abilities, which is why
		even when using magic treasures, Fiendgod Body Refiners would
		generally use weapons such as swords, daggers, spears, and what not.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This sheath and its
		three sword will still be useful to me, even after I become a
		Xiantian lifeform.” Ning felt delighted. He pondered, “Since it
		will most likely be with me for a long time, I need to give it a
		name…Hrm. I’ll call it the ‘Darknorth sword!’”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a reason why
		Ning had suddenly thought of ‘Darknorth’.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, when his
		father, Ji Yichuan, had left Swallow Mountain and roamed in the
		boundless wide world, he had even gone to the north, to the unending
		ocean. That massive sea was named as the ‘Dark North Sea’. Within
		the Dark North Sea, there were many islands. Ji Yichuan had floated
		from one island to another, and that’s where he had met Yuchi Snow.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They became travel
		companions, and then after experiencing life and death battles, fell
		in love with each other, then Snow became pregnant.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because of the
		pregnancy…they finally left the dangerous Dark North Sea and
		returned to Swallow Mountain. Mid-journey, however, they had run into
		a dangerous situation and Yuchi Snow had suffered a serious wound.
		This is why they had said that ‘Ning suffered an injury in the
		womb’. At that critical time, the Godbeast, ‘Whitewater Hound’,
		had carried Snow on his back and fled.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was why Yichuan
		often said that Uncle White had once saved Ning.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His parents had met,
		fell in love, then conceived him in the Dark North Sea.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The phrase,
		‘Darknorth’, thus had a special meaning to Ning.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father. Mother.”
		Ning said seriously. “I have given a name to this sheath and its
		three swords. Its name will be the Darknorth swords!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time Ning
		acquired the Darknorth swords. In an area within Swallow Mountain
		known as Serpentwing Lake….
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing Lake was a
		massive lake, nearly a hundred kilometers long, so large that one
		wouldn’t be able to see the end of it.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the saying goes,
		deep mountains and massive lakes always have monsters within.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These words were not
		false! This massive, mysterious lake, without question, has
		Diremonsters within it, and countless numbers of lesser monsters. The
		name of the Diremonster within this lake was Serpentwing. It was an
		ancient monster, over a thousand years old, and possessed
		outlandishly strong power. It was born capable of flight, and it
		could control both water and poison. It was a very ferocious,
		awe-inspiring Diremonster.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep in the center of
		the lake, there was a small island. This was the lair of Serpentwing.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Boom…” A giant
		black coiled serpent, hundreds of meters long. Its two massive scaled
		wings were spread so wide, it seemed to encompass the skies. Its
		scarlet eyes were focused on a group of quivering monstrous beasts. A
		cold aura surrounded the place, and a layer of frost was on the
		ground.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The densely clustered
		lesser monsters were all on their knees or on their faces, all of
		them quivering.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Over a hundred
		monstrous beasts lay fallen on the ground, their bodies covered with
		frost. They had been frozen solid.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Boom…” The
		furious Serpentwing let out an enraged roar.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those lesser monsters
		consisted of all sorts of serpent, crab, and fish-type monsters. They
		all growled softly in reply. Clearly, they were all incomparably
		terrified.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“ROAR!” Serpentwing
		snarled coldly.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Huahuahua….
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the monsters
		retreated at high speed, as though relieved of a heavy burden. Many
		of the monsters left the island and entered the depths of the lake,
		while a portion of them took up defensive positions in various places
		around the island.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shua.” The giant
		black snake suddenly transformed into mist, and then it reformed into
		a black-clothed man.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, Serpentwing, had
		ninety two sons!” The black-clothed man ground his teeth. “While
		they grew up, the majority died, and only sixteen survived! And only
		one of them has the lineage of the Fiendgods…my most beloved son,
		Redtip!”
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snakes were lascivious
		by nature.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he himself did
		not have the lineage of the Fiendgods, he had copulated with many
		Houtian monsters, some of whom included Houtian stage Godbeasts. To
		an ancient monster who had trained for over a thousand years…it was
		fairly easy for him to meet and engage with some Houtian level
		Godbeasts. But Godbeasts rarely got pregnant, and thus only a single
		one of his children had the lineage of the Fiendgods. That one was
		Redtip.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His most beloved child.
		He was certain that so long as Redtip could become a Xiantian
		lifeform, he would definitely possess enormous power and limitless
		prospects.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Redtip, I told you
		long ago not to go out before reaching the Xiantian level. Although
		humans are delicious, if you eat too many of them, the Ji clan would
		come and deal with you.” The black-robed man growled, filled with
		misery.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His pride and his joy,
		his son Redtip, had snuck out and discovered that the taste of human
		flesh was far better than that of other monstrous beasts. Human flesh
		truly was delicious.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And thus, Redtip had
		gone behind his father’s back and snuck out time and time again to
		engage in slaughter.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My child. I have to
		bring you back.” The black-clothed man instantly transformed back
		into the enormous winged serpent form. His massive body floated into
		the air, and then he transformed into a black shadow, streaking
		across the sky and disappearing into the clouds.
