had never been kind to Ji Ning. Wracked by illnesses and infirm his
entire life on Earth, Ning knew early on that he would die as a
teenager. What he didn’t know was that there really was such a
thing as life after death, and that the multiverse was a far larger
place than he thought. A lucky twist of fate (one of the few in
Ning’s life) meant that Ning was reborn into a world of Immortals
and monsters, of Ki Refiners and powerful Fiendgods, a world where
Dynasties lasted for millions of years. A world which is both
greater…and yet also smaller…than he ever could imagine. He would
have the opportunity to join them, and in this life, Ning swore to
himself, he would never let himself be weak again! The Era he was
born into was a Desolate one, but Ning would make it his era.

Chapter 1: Hawkfang</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Five Truncheon Chapters, Chapter 1 – Hawkfang</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Exalt,
who in the world is this white-robed Daolord? Why must we sacrifice
everything for the sake of killing him?” One of the many Hegemons
below the Exalt, a Sithe descendant, couldn’t help but ask this
question. To this very day, the Sithe descendants had no idea what ‘a
Daolord who has mastered an Eternal Omega Dao’ truly represented
for the Sithe. In truth, the Sithe didn’t dare to tell their
descendants too much either!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the end, their descendants were native to this Chaosverse and had
grown up here. Strictly speaking, it was destined for them to be
unable to walk the same path together, and so they were purposefully
kept in the dark regarding many things. As a result, they now felt
that this was completely incomprehensible and not worth them losing
their lives over!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right,
Exalt! We had thought that killing him would be very easy, but
Purgatory was defeated even after we gave it a pair of
Apocalypse-class treasures. This Daolord is too powerful! Aside from
the three Elder Halls, we don’t have any treasures that are
superior to the ones we already sent down, but the three Elder Halls
are immobile. If we want to proactively attack him, we’ll be at a
huge disadvantage. Many of us will probably die.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
can simply keep him exiled in Purgatory and wait for his truesoul to
collapse. He’ll still die, right? Why is it necessary for us to pay
such an enormous price?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
do we have to fight with him to the death?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Is
such an enormous price truly worth it?” The Sithe descendants
voiced their arguments, one by one. The true Sithe were silent. They
knew the details behind this, but they didn’t dare to expose them!
They had been ordered long ago to restrict the amount of contact
between them and their descendants, for fear of their descendants
learning the ‘truth’ and losing faith.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Worth
it?” The blue-haired youth, ‘Exalt Bowenya’, let out a soft
sigh from atop his throne. “Yes… I, too, feel that it isn’t
worth it.” Exalt Bowenya stared downwards. “But I’ve already
told you everything I can. The things I have left unsaid, I have done
so because I am not permitted to! If I told you the truth, I would be
violating Sithe laws and my truesoul would be annihilated.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
you need to know is this! Our dimension may seem large, but we are
nothing more than a small part of the Sithe race and empire. This is
nothing more than a small part of Sithe territory.” Exalt Bowenya
waved a finger, causing an image to appear in midair of the
white-robed Daolord. “As for him… he is of grave importance to
the entire Sithe civilization. We have to destroy him and then
capture his truesoul. This will be an enormous accomplishment for our
race! Sacrificing our entire hidden dimension will be worth it, yes.
Even if the sacrifice was greater, it would still be worth it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Everyone
below fell silent. The Sithe descendants also knew that they were
nothing more than a small part of the massive Sithe empire as a
whole.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
we go against our orders, our entire dimension will be punished and
annihilated. All of us, including myself, will be put to death.”
Exalt Bowenya’s voice was glacially cold, and the Hegemons below
him all felt an invisible sense of oppression. If they tried to find
a way out, the only result would be death.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
no way out. We have to kill him. If we kill him, we’ll all be
rewarded heavily. If we do not… we will all die! If you must blame
someone, blame that Daolord for having come to our home,” Exalt
Bowenya said. “Now… obey my orders.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">None
of the Hegemons voiced any further complaints. The true Sithe knew
that there was no way to avoid this, while the Sithe progeny all knew
that shirking back meant death.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Jonnbech,”
Exalt Bowenya called out. An extremely muscular four-armed man with
curly hair who was three meters tall had been standing close to the
front of the throng of Hegemons. He stepped forward and said
respectfully, “Exalt.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Jonnbech,
it is now time for war. We are throwing everything we have into this
battle against that Daolord. You have past experience with
controlling an Elder Hall, and so from this day forth you shall be
the controller of the ‘Iceland’ Elder Hall.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”
Jonnbech was a true Sithe and was second only to the Exalt in power.
He had a perfect Dao-heart and was highly venerated amongst the
Sithe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hawkfang.”
Exalt Bowenya’s gaze turned towards another man. Instantly, the
entire hall began to stir. Some of the true Sithe began to frown,
while others remained quite calm. Most of the Sithe progeny, however,
grew excited. Hawkfang was a leader amongst the Sithe descendants and
extremely powerful.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Exalt.”
Hawkfang bowed respectfully. His face was calm, and he was dressed in
long black robes. His eyes seemed to contain an endless universe of
space and time within them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Exalt
Bowenya couldn’t help but secretly sigh to himself when he saw
this. Hawkfang was a descendant he held in high regard, and was the
son of a friend. The man was extremely talented and had reached
Hegemony in a very short period of time. He stood a very good chance
of becoming an Autarch in the future! Even the supreme leader of the
Sithe paid a great deal of attention to Hawkfang.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Alas,
during the Dawn War, Hawkfang’s father (another Exalt) died in
battle. Ever since then, Hawkfang seemed to have become filled with
many thoughts and worries, resulting in him being unable to progress
any further in his path of cultivation. The entire Sithe race sighed
at the loss.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
must be remembered that if Sithe descendants became what the locals
called ‘Autarchs’, then as natives to this Chaosverse they would
gain full control over the power of the local Dao. An extra ‘Autarch’
on the side of the Sithe would be of enormous assistance to them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
the supreme leader of the Sithe once said: “Hawkfang simply hasn’t
experienced enough. The only place he has ever lived is that single
small dimension. The death of his father caused his heart to be
filled with turmoil. He is unable to perfect his Dao-heart and he no
longer has any chance of reaching Autarchy! If he had been able to
spend more time wandering the universe, his father’s death wouldn’t
have dealt such a deadly bow to his psyche. Now that a shadow has
been cast over his heart, it will be very difficult for him to
perfect his Dao-heart!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had been such a promising figure, but now he was destined to be
mediocre! Still… in this dimension, Hawkfang remained the most
talented member of the Sithe descendants, and he had reached Hegemony
in a total of six Daos!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Starting
now, Hawkfang, you shall be in control of the same Elder Hall your
father controlled – the ‘Flameland’ Elder Hall,” Exalt
Bowenya said. “Your father died a glorious death in battle for the
sake of the Sithe. I hope you will prove to be as fearless as your
father was and destroy this Daolord for the Sithe.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”
Hawkfang remained completely expressionless as he bowed respectfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Jonnbech,
Hawkfang, the two of you should immediately go to your respective
Elder Halls and take control over them. Once you do so, the three of
us shall decide on a strategy for dealing with this Daolord,” Exalt
Bowenya instructed. “As for the other Hegemons, await your
deployment orders.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”
The throng of Hegemons and Emperors all acknowledged the order.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three Elder Halls were all glowing with white light. One of them was
shining brighter than the other two, which were slightly dimmer. They
had lain untouched for many years, after all; they were simply
functioning on auto-mode.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The black-robed Hawkfang suddenly flew through the air, moving
towards the towering, twelve-storied tower which emanated a scorching
aura. When he arrived before it, he raised his head and stared
upwards, a lost look in his eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Father,”
Hawkfang murmured softly. He still clearly remembered his father
bringing him here when he was young. This was his father’s Daoguard
Tower, and they had played together here. Life back then had been
truly carefree, and he had been so incredibly talented that he had
succeeded in everything he tried. His father had arranged him to
experience a few setbacks to temper him, but they barely slowed him
down at all. He had reached the Daomerge with incredible speed, then
completed it and reached Hegemony.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
been so long, but I’ve come again.” Hawkfang reached out to touch
the tower. He could still remember that battle clearly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">During
the Dawn War, his avatar had accompanied his father in their grand
campaign. Towards the end of the war, they had fallen into dire
straits. His father had personally destroyed his avatar, not wishing
for his avatar to fall into the hands of their cultivator enemies. If
the Autarchs managed to capture his avatar, they were completely
capable of using karma to slay his true body as well! In contrast,
when his father killed his avatar it would have no impact at all.
Avatars didn’t matter too much to Hegemons, as they could simply
remake them after they were destroyed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the end, his father had died during that battle. He had died at the
hands of a cultivator known as ‘Autarch Bolin’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
cultivators…” Hawkfang mused to himself, “Am I a Sithe, or am I
a cultivator?” Hawkfang shook his head. “Let us fight, then. If
you can’t even stop someone like me, then you deserve to die. Even
if I really am a cultivator, killing some of them in Father’s
memory isn’t that big a deal.” He stepped into the tower.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Young
master.” A black golem instantly appeared on the first floor of the
great tower, and it bowed respectfully: “I’ve already received
orders to hand the entire Daoguard Tower over to you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mm.”
Hawkfang nodded. He immediately took control over the entire Elder
Hall and began to make plans to deal with the white-robed Daolord
based on the various tricks and traps the hall contained.”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_42_Chapter_002__The"></A>
Chapter 2: Illusion Sword Dao</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Five Truncheon Chapters, Chapter 2 – Illusion Sword Dao</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hawkfang
and Jonnbech quickly familiarized themselves with their respective
Elder Halls. After doing so, they went to meet with Exalt Bowenya
again. The three met within a quiet side hall and began to discuss
their battle plans.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Exalt,
these are all the tools which my ‘Iceland’ Elder Hall possesses.”
Jonnbech waved his hand, causing a scroll to appear. This scroll was
covered with dense scribbling which recorded the various offensive
techniques the Iceland Hall possessed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“These
are all the attacks which the ‘Flameland’ Elder Hall can use.”
Hawkfang also produced a scroll which was covered with a complete
record of what his hall could do.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Exalt
Bowenya carefully inspected both the scrolls. “Huh. My old friends
certainly put a great deal of countermeasures inside their Daoguard
Towers.” Exalt Bowenya chuckled. “My plans for dealing with this
Daolord are simple. Let’s fight him openly and use the overwhelming
power over our three Daoguard Towers to fight and kill him head-on.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fight
and kill him head-on? How?” Jonnbech asked, while Hawkfang simply
listened without saying a word.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Simple.
Our three Daoguard Towers shall use all the long-distance attacks
available to us, as well as treasures that are strong enough to pose
a threat to him! Everyone else will swarm him as we do so, and we’ll
wipe him out at the base of the Sacred Mountains,” Exalt Bowenya
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Both
Jonnbech and Hawkfang were startled. This was an extremely vicious
ploy! They had been planning on setting down layers of traps to
slowly whittle away at the Daolord’s longevity until he finally
died, but Exalt Bowenya had a far crueler plan in mind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
were going to send all the Hegemons and Emperors to attack while the
Daoguard Towers launched virtually all of their attacks from afar!
They would literally focus all of their firepower in one massive
bombardment, using all of their tricks and traps and offensive powers
at the same time. This was indeed likely to result in the Daolord’s
death, but the maddened Daolord would probably butcher many of the
Hegemons and Emperors swarming him. However, Jonnbech and Hawkfang
didn’t voice any dissent. The Exalt was the final decision-maker,
after all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
if he doesn’t die at the base of the Sacred Mountains?” Hawkfang
asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
could he possibly survive that many attacks?” Jonnbech frowned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“And
what if he does?” Hawkfang repeated.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Bowenya
smiled coldly. “Then the only things left to us shall be our
respective Daoguard Towers. Even if it costs us our very lives, we
have to kill him… because if we can’t kill him, we will still
die.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
plan is to have 70% of the Hegemons and Emperors take part in the
battle at the base of the Sacred Mountains. The remaining 30% of them
will be split amongst the three of us. If it really does come down to
a series of final battles involving our Daoguard Towers, we’ll need
their help.” Bowenya chuckled. “He’s nothing more than a
Daolord whose truesoul is crumbling away. Our three towers should be
enough to kill him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Exalt
Bowenya gave the order, and the entire Sacred Realm sprinted into
motion. An awesome number of Samsara Daolords were teleported away
from it, while some of the most supremely talented Daolords were
actually given a chance to take part in the fight as well! They were
given Sithe weapons and would be sent out as fodder to exhaust that
terrifying Daolord in battle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
the levitating Realmgate suddenly activated, once more glowing with
the same dazzling light that it had emanated for countless years. The
Realmgate was a hundred thousand kilometers tall, and it radiated
eye-catching splendor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning was seated in the lotus position on the ground. He raised his
head to glance at the distant Realmgate. “The Realmgate has been
activated. However… I’m in no rush to go there just yet.” Ning
then shut his eyes again, once more focusing on the Dao of Illusions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ever
since he had learned of those nine special techniques, he had scoured
the memories of all the Hegemons and Emperors he had captured.
However, there had been two Hegemons who had extremely powerful
Dao-hearts. Ning had been unable to successfully review their
memories! Ning was planning to capture more Hegemons during this trip
into the Sacred Realm. He had to improve his mastery over the art of
illusions, improving it to Hegemony!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ever
since he had mastered the Eternal Omega Sword Dao, he had been able
to quickly master other Daos as well. For example, he had long ago
reached Hegemony in the Dao of Space and the Dao of Time. Training to
Hegemony was quite simple, but fusing them into his Eternal Omega
Sword Dao was fairly difficult.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for the Dao of Illusions? Ning had yet to upgrade it to Hegemony,
much less infuse it into his sword-arts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
continued to pass on. He was able to reach Hegemony in the Dao of
Illusions after merely eighty thousand years. It could be said that
Ning was now at a level where he could easily reach Hegemony in any
Dao he desired, even complicated Daos such as the Dao of Numerancy or
the Dao of Karma. They might take a bit more time, but he could still
do it. To Ning, however, there wasn’t much of a point to doing so.
These Daos were only useful when he infused them into his Eternal
Omega Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
continued to flow on. A hundred million years. A billion years. Ten
billion years…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sacred Realm had finished making its preparations long ago. The Sithe
were waiting for Ning… and they began to grow a bit anxious.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
hasn’t that Daolord come yet?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
has been nearly half a chaos cycle. How much longer does he plan to
train for?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
this continues, is it possible that he’ll just naturally expire and
his truesoul will crumble?” The Sithe were all rather worried.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry. He won’t. The fact that he is still cultivating is proof
that he very much wants to stay alive. He wouldn’t be willing to
just train until his death.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
keep waiting. That’s the only choice we have! He’s the only
living person in all of Purgatory right now. There’s no way for us
to set up any formations there, and the power of the three Elder
Halls would be dramatically weakened if used in Purgatory. We used
two Apocalypse-class treasures which were a perfect counter against
him, but both failed. There’s no point in sending anyone else with
any other treasures to Purgatory. Our only choice is to wait.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was simply too powerful. In the end, even the ‘perfect counters’
against him had failed. Their only chance was to rely on their
Daoguard Towers and wait for Ning to come to them. The Daoguard
Towers, however, were in the Sacred Realm! Thus, the Sithe had to
remain in the Sacred Realm. They wouldn’t dare go to Purgatory!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">One
chaos cycle. Two chaos cycles. Ten chaos cycles. A hundred chaos
cycles…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
Primaltwin in the outside world was training as well, paying no heed
to the Sithe who were being driven mad with impatience.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Finally,
the day came when a small smile appeared in Ning’s face. He had
been completely absorbed in cultivating for many years now, and today
he finally felt the joy of finding the Dao he sought! He slowly
opened his eyes, and his gaze seemed to be filled with illusions of
the birth and destruction of all things in spacetime.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
A strange surge of power flowed through the Sword Dao Domain around
him, causing countless illusions to appear. Countless living beings
were born, lived, and fought against each other. Some of them even
possessed rudimentary levels of sentience. It could be said that they
already had some of the qualities of actual living beings.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
never would’ve imagined that when the Dao of Illusions came
together with my Eternal Omega Sword Dao, its power would skyrocket
by such a great amount. My illusions are beginning to become
reality.” Ning could sense that the illusory life forms he had
created were all ‘real’. They had their own sentience and even
some rudimentary emotions; the only thing they lacked was a sense of
self-awareness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
now felt rather reluctant to bring this illusion to an end. Once he
did, it would represent the annihilation of all the living beings
within this illusory realm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
the guesses of countless cultivators who came before me were correct.
If one can reach an incredibly high level in the Dao of Illusions,
one truly can turn illusions into reality,” Ning mused. “If I can
make another breakthrough and upgrade my Omega Dao to Autarchy, I’ll
probably be able to make everything within my heartworld projection
real.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">With
another thought, Ning gradually cast the illusory world around him
into darkness. The countless beings within that world all fell
asleep… and then, the illusion came to an end.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
he was rather unwilling to part with them, he couldn’t just spend
all his time and energy maintaining that illusory realm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Illusions…
reality… I imagine there are many cultivators who would rather live
in an illusory realm.” Ning’s Illusion Sword Dao had reached such
a level where many cultivators would willingly allow themselves to be
captured by it, because it truly did feel extremely real. Only a tiny
little bit of difference remained between it and true reality.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
truesoul was affected by the power of his Illusion Sword Dao as well.
Reality and illusion intersected repeatedly, resulting in his
truesoul feeling more comfortable than ever before. Even the
truesoul’s crumbling speed was somewhat lessened! Ning’s mastery
of the Wind Sword Dao and Lightning Sword Dao had been of negligible
benefit to his truesoul, but the Illusion Sword Dao was clearly quite
helpful.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“For
the sake of this Illusion Sword Dao, I spent a total of 185 chaos
cycles in training! However, the Illusion Sword Dao has caused my
truesoul to slow down its rate of crumbling. As a result, I still
have six hundred chaos cycles left.” Ning couldn’t help but let
out an involuntary chuckle. “I guess you really do win some and
lose some.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
that I have mastered the Illusion Sword Dao, it is time to review the
memories of those two Hegemons.” Ning once more summoned the two
Hegemons he had captured.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
soon as the two Hegemons looked at Ning, they instantly fell into a
dazed stupor. Ning’s mastery of the Illusion Sword Dao meant only
Autarch Stonerule, the master of the Illusion Daobirth Essence, was
superior to him in the art of illusions… and only somewhat superior
at that. The other Autarchs were all slightly inferior to Ning in
this regard! And so, Ning was able to review the memories of the
various Hegemons with ease.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_42_Chapter_003__The"></A>
Chapter 3: Wandering the Sacred Realm Alone</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Five Truncheon Chapters, Chapter 3 – Wandering the Sacred Realm
Alone</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was another testament to how formidable the path of the Omega Dao
was. Mastering the Eternal Omega Sword Dao put Ji Ning on par with
the Autarchs, and as Ning infused more and more Daos into his Sword
Dao, he began to improve in many other areas as well. Given enough
time, he would undergo a final transformation and reach a higher
level, the level which the entire cultivator civilization yearned
for!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
pity. Once again, no luck with those nine techniques.” Ning slowly
shook his head. “They are all bound by lifeblood oaths. There’s
no way to review those techniques at all. Can it really be possible
that every single Hegemon and Emperor was bound by a lifeblood oath?
Is there really no way at all?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No.
The probability may be low, but there always is a chance. Mm. Well.
Time to go to the Sacred Realm.” Ning lifted his head to stare at
the towering Realmgate. It had been glowing with dazzling light for
many years now.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
took a single step forwards and moved towards the Realmgate. After
stepping inside, he entered yet another tunnel that was formed from
many different folds of dimensional space. This was the dimensional
passageway which led to the Sacred Realm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
time, he didn’t suffer any attacks within the dimensional
passageway. Sneak attacks had clearly proven to be useless against
him, after all, and letting him die alone in exile wasn’t worth it.
They had been waiting for him for many years now… waiting for him
to come to the Sacred Realm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sacred Realm.” Ning stood at the exit to the tunnel, staring at the
Sacred Realm around him. “Odd. I thought that this place would be
quite dangerous, that there would be many different traps and
formations awaiting my arrival. Who would’ve thought that there’d
be nothing here?” Ning was rather surprised. There was no way any
ambush could escape his detection. Ning had been planning to rely on
his Storm Sword Dao to flee at high speeds if he discovered any
traps, but now it seemed as it was all unnecessary.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
Ning flew away from the Realmgate and into the skies. He stared down
at the vast world around him, quickly seeing the palaces and estates
which were located off in the distance. Clearly, there had once been
many people who had lived here. Now, the entire Sacred Realm was
deathly silent. All the Daolords had been evacuated, leaving their
empty estates behind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
took a deep breath, and as he did so a surge of energy flowed into
his body, making him feel quite comfortable. An awesome aura of power
pervaded this entire place. The energy here was so dense than an
entire army of Hegemons could draw upon it and use it to cultivate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
a truly wonderful ‘Sacred Realm’,” Ning said with an approving
chuckle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord.”
An icy void suddenly echoed in the skies above the Sacred Realm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Is
that the Sithe Exalt?” Ning stood there in midair, a smile on his
face. “I thought you’d attack me as soon as I exited the
Realmgate. I didn’t expect you to behave so courteously.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I,
Bowenya, have been waiting for you for many years now, Daolord,”
the icy void said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I,
Darknorth, was teleported into this place by you Sithe. Heh.” Ning
chuckled. “Honestly, I would really rather not fight you. If you
just let me go, that would be the best outcome for both of us!
Otherwise, our only option is to fight each other.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Many
of the Sithe descendants were moved by these words. They knew just
how powerful Daolord Darknorth was, and they weren’t willing to
fight him. If it truly was possible for them to avoid this battle,
how wonderful it would be! However, they all knew that this was a
fantasy. No one dared to disobey the orders from the supreme Sithe
leader! There was no way out of this deadly battle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth?” The icy voice spoke out once more: “A fine name.
There is no need for us to waste time on words. If you wish to leave
this place, you must do so through overpowering us. Given how strong
you are, I imagine you can tell where the exit path lies.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
exit path should lie within the Daoguard Tower in the very rear, I
imagine,” Ning said. Ning was able to sense and scan the entire
Sacred Realm through the power of his Wind Sword Dao, and he knew of
the presence of those three Daoguard Towers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
three Daoguard Towers had a total of twelve stories. Based on what
Ning knew regarding the Sithe, this meant that these were Daoguard
Towers which belonged to Sithe Exalts! There was no way they would be
as easy to deal with as the Daoguard Tower he had dealt with some
time ago. Ning’s acute attunement to space also allowed him to
ascertain and verify that the center of the Sacred Realm, the place
where all the dimensional controls were located, was within the
Daoguard Tower at the very rear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">What
he didn’t know was that during the Dawn War, all three Daoguard
Towers shared part of the dimensional controls! After two of the
Sithe Exalts died, the Daoguard Towers had been modified so that the
only one which could be used to control this hidden dimension was the
one which Exalt Bowenya controlled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Impressive,
Daolord Darknorth.” The icy voice continued, “Then come and fight
me, if you dare.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.”
Ning let out an amused snort. “Be there shortly. Relax.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
began to leisurely fly through the Sacred Realm, blinking through the
various regions within it and inspecting it carefully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Huh.”
Ning stood before a mountain wall which was filled with many carvings
as well as some cultivation techniques. “Now that’s interesting.”
Ning was like a tourist, wandering through the various parts of the
Sacred Realm and visiting many of the sects it held.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Hegemons and Emperors had been waiting for battle for many years now,
and they all felt rather speechless at Ning’s behavior. Still…
they had already managed to wait for over a hundred chaos cycles. A
bit more time would make no difference at all. They could be patient.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
spent a total of fifteen days touring the Sacred Realm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
pity. I didn’t find any trace of the nine techniques I’m
interested in.” Ning couldn’t help but sigh to himself. The
Sacred Realm had been used to train Samsara Daolords for countless
aeons. Many techniques had been recorded here, and not all of them
had been destroyed during the evacuation. Ning was able to broaden
his horizons by inspecting the remaining ones, but he didn’t find
the ones he really needed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning began to fly closer towards the Sacred Mountains. There were a
total of three towering Daoguard Towers at the peaks of three of the
mountains, and they were all glowing with dazzling light that caused
spacetime to ripple around them. The effect of the light extended to
a distance of a trillion kilometers, and the effect was continuous.
Not even Autarch Mogg, who specialized in the Dao of Space, would be
able to teleport through this region, to say nothing of Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was one of the things which made an Exalt’s Daoguard Tower so
incredibly dangerous! Spacetime was completely suppressed here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
truly is a beautiful world. A pity that it is about to be torn apart
by war,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Even
if it is destroyed, we can remake it in the future,” that icy voice
replied.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
said nothing further. He drew a Northbow sword from the sheath on his
back, then continued to fly forwards as he carefully inspected the
area around him. “I can sense danger within every inch of the
Sacred Mountains. It doesn’t matter which direction I enter from;
I’ll still be facing incredible danger. I have no choice but to
just charge in.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning continued to fly forwards. Suddenly, the hills below him began
to tremble and shake, followed by rippling ley-lines to appear. A
massive formation that was a hundred billion kilometers in size began
to activate, and it completely separated the surrounding dimension
away from the normal spacetime continuum.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Dimensional Separator again?” Ning shook his head and laughed. An
area of a hundred billion kilometers around him had been completely
separated from the outside world. Ning had suffered a similar attack
while rescuing the Paragon of Pills. Ning couldn’t help but sigh at
how the Sithe seemed to be able to play with space, cutting through
it as though it was a cake.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
simply stood there in the air, sword at the ready as he calmly
glanced at the stand-alone dimension which had been formed around
him. He was waiting for them to come to him. If he didn’t fight,
how was he supposed to capture more Emperors and search for those
nine techniques?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Whoosh. Whoosh. Vile auras began to appear at the margins of this
sealed spacetime continuum, and the vile auras began to come together
and form vilefiends. These vilefiends were all extremely powerful,
the most powerful vilefiends Ning had seen thus far. They were
probably all at the Otherverse Lord level of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Exalt-level
Daoguard Towers are able to make use of even more of the power of the
Sithe energy generator. As a result, they can give birth to
vilefiends of tremendous power. Still, for them to produce a total of
105 vilefiends of such power at once… they’ve probably brought
out everything they built up over the course of aeons.” Ning
remained quite calm. This was all as he had inspected. These
vilefiends would at most be able to slow him down a bit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“GWAAAAR!”
“KILL!” “DIE!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Cracks
began to appear in the ground at the margins of this sealed
continuum, and various creatures began to fly out of those cracks.
Their eyes were all dead, and they were at varying levels of power.
Some had auras comparable to Otherverse Lords, while others were
noticeably more powerful. Still, they were all somewhat inferior to
the likes of the Blazesun Ruler.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
that strong, but there are certainly quite a lot of them. If they all
attack at once, it’ll be a bit troublesome.” Ning frowned
slightly. It would consume quite a bit of his energy to kill all
those vilefiends as well as those poor mind-controlled living golems.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Moments
later, a total of nine figures appeared around Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning frowned again. “Daolords?” The nine figures were all Samsara
Daolords, but all of them were unspeakably powerful.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth, we’ll be more than enough to deal with you. You aren’t
worthy of the Hegemons and Emperors dirtying their hands!” The nine
Daolords all had crazed looks in their eyes. Daolords were generally
fearless to begin with, and the Sithe Exalt had offered them enormous
rewards for this mission. He had also given them control over many
vilefiends and living golems. They naturally were going to do their
absolute utmost in this battle.</P>

Five Truncheon Chapters, Chapter 4 – Successfully Surrounded</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
this sealed continuum, Ji Ning’s Sword Dao Domain was only able to
extend up to a distance of one billion kilometers. The invisible
suppressive power of the Sacred Realm was simply too strong.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!
Once Daolord Darknorth’s domain sweeps over us, we’ll be dead,”a
black-winged Daolord sent mentally. Given Ning’s power, even
Hegemons and Emperors would fall to his domain unless they were
protected by incredibly powerful treasures, to say nothing of mere
Daolords. He would be able to toy with them as he pleased.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
actually want to attack me with such a miniscule amount of power?”
Ning made his move, transforming into a streak of light that flew
towards the Daolord closest to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
nine Daolords were all separated at the margins of this sealed
continuum, each in a different direction. That way, if Ning wanted to
deal with them he would have to fly to them one-by-one.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill
this Daolord!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill
him!” The vilefiends and the living golems let out crazed roars as
they fearlessly swarmed towards Ning, seeking to surround him. As for
the nine Daolords, they immediately set up various treasures which
were controlled by the power of a Daoguard Tower.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
answer to this mass attack was to continue flying forwards at high
speed while manifesting countless streaks of sword-light within his
Sword Dao Domain. They sent the vilefiends and the living golems
stumbling backwards, falling to the ground, or even go flying into
the air. Only a tiny number of them were able to get close to Ning,
with the majority unable to approach him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was why a powerful domain was so useful in battle. Ning was able to
use it toy with anyone at or below the Otherverse Lord level of
power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clack!
Clack! Clack! Strange edifices began to appear in front of the nine
Daolords. They looked like miniature castles, with each being 9,900
meters tall and completely golden. Semi-translucent towers could be
seen at the very top of the castles. These nine Sithe treasures were
controlled by the Daoguard Tower, and they were powerful treasures
which could be used to attack from afar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
main mission for these nine Daoguards was to get in and then put
these nine treasures in position. If they managed to do that, they
would have succeeded in their task!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“These
Daolords truly are fools.” Ning flew so incredibly fast that he was
already within a billion kilometers of the first Daolord. His Sword
Dao Domain instantly captured the Daolord, preventing him from moving
at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Get
in here.” Ning didn’t attack, instead choosing to draw both the
Daolord and the treasure into his estate-world, separating it from
the power of the Daoguard Tower.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiiiiip!
Beams of dazzling, destructive energy spat out from the other eight
castle towers, moving with incomprehensible speed and striking with
nigh-Autarch levels of power! The attacks were incredibly powerful,
but in the end they were generated by treasures. There was no way
these attacks could compare with attacks from actual Autarchs in
terms of profundity; they relied strictly upon overwhelming speed and
power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
Ning used his Storm Sword Dao to evade. Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! He
evaded all eight destructive rays of light. By the time those eight
rays of light had flown tens of billions of kilometers and reached
Ning, Ning was able to brush past them and let them splatter against
the distant dimensional membrane, causing it to tremble.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for the vilefiends and living golems? The ones touched by the rays of
light were instantly and easily chopped apart! However, the
vilefiends and the living golems were able to quickly recover.
Killing them wouldn’t be that easy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
suddenly, yet another rift appeared at the margins of this sealed
continuum. A total of fifty-plus Hegemons and Emperors flew out from
within this rift! Ning raised an eyebrow, then immediately
transformed into a streak of light as he flew towards those
fifty-plus Hegemons. However, as he did so another rift appeared in
the distance. Another squad of fifty-plus Hegemons and Emperors
appeared from this second rift as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eight
of the nine treasures remain intact. Good enough.” The Hegemons
began to advance. When they saw that eight of the castle towers were
once more glowing with destructive light, they couldn’t help but
secretly feel a sense of joy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
‘Daolord Darknorth’ is nothing more than a Daolord whose truesoul
is crumbling away. We have over a hundred Hegemons on our side and
are supported by treasures from the Daoguard Tower. I refuse to
believe we cannot kill him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ll
smash him apart with one coordinated strike. We’ll be rewarded for
our victory and this calamity shall be at an end.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!”
The Hegemons and Emperors were brimming with malevolence. Whether it
was because they had to obey orders, wanted to protect their home, or
desired the great rewards promised, they had to kill Ning!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Whoosh! Whoosh! A miniature star began to appear in front of each of
the hundred-plus Hegemons and Emperors. The hundred-plus miniature
stars manifested runes which began to accumulate different but
equally terrifying types of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flameland
Astral Chains!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Iceland
Astral Chains!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Hegemons began to launch their various weapons as well. The nine
castle-like treasures were fixed in location and didn’t need to be
controlled, but the various ‘astral chains’ were more complicated
and needed to be controlled. Thus, the Sithe had sent over a hundred
Hegemons and Emperors to man them. Each of the miniature stars was
drawing power from the Daoguard Towers, then controlled by a Hegemon
or Emperor to launch attacks via a formation that made it hard for
Ning to dodge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
The fifty-plus Hegemons and Emperors to the left released streams of
icy energy from their miniature stars. The icy energy shot straight
towards Ning like rays of frozen light, completely freezing even
spacetime. The combined power of the freezing energy was absolutely
at the Autarch level of power; even Autarchs would be temporarily
suppressed by such an assault.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">To
the right, streams of fiery golden light appeared as well, joining
together and shooting towards Ning at terrifying speeds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">To
one side, freezing cold. To the other, blazing heat. These were two
diametrically different types of energy, and each was capable of
threatening even an Autarch. When used in concert, they became even
more terrifyingly powerful, especially now that they came together in
accordance with an incredibly profound formation. They flew towards
Ning in an intricate manner, making it almost impossible for him to
dodge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swish!
Swish! Swish! Swish! The eight streams of apocalyptic light continued
to attack as well, slowing down Ning’s movements.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.”
Ning moved like the storm, transforming into a blurry shadow of
lightning and wind. However, the ‘Flameland Astral Chains’ and
the ‘Iceland Astral Chains’ being used by the Hegemons and
Emperors had completely locked onto Ning, and they arced in the air
as they continued their pursuit of him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can’t dodge them?!” A look of shock and anger appeared on Ning’s
face, while looks of excitement appeared on the faces of the
hundred-plus Hegemons and the eight Daolords.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Ning hurriedly retreated backwards, wishing to draw those two
terrifying types of energy together and cause them to collide.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
fool.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Did
he think that our treasures would interfere with each other?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“When
the two astral chains link up, merging fire and ice together, the
power shall only increase!” The Hegemons all smirked as they
watched the freezing energy swirl together with the golden flames as
both continued to shoot towards Ning. Finally, the energies began to
clash together. Tink! Each collision was extremely soft, and the only
result was a series of strange dimensional ripples being generated as
the attacks became even more powerful.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
watched as Daolord Darknorth continued to retreat, his face ashen as
he frantically used the Northbow sword in his hand to execute the
Water Sword Dao. A stream of watery light circled around him,
striving to block the attacks, but some of the destructive power
managed to pierce through the water. Of course, this was with Daolord
Darknorth doing his best to conserve his energy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Daolord
Darknorth had clearly been caught off-guard by the hundred-plus
streams of energy assaulting him. He executed repeated sword-arts,
striving to block as his truesoul began to crumble more quickly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hahaha…
the Exalt’s prediction was spot-on!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
might be fast, but the astral chains are a perfect counter for him.
When the astral chains from the Flameland Elder Hall and the Iceland
Elder Hall merge together, they are his absolute nemesis. It’ll be
hard for us to kill him outright, but we’ll be able to exhaust a
large amount of his energy and hasten the collapse of his truesoul.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Hegemons grew increasingly excited. To kill this terrifying Daolord
was unrealistic; all they could do was exhaust as much of his power
as was possible! Each time the Daolord defended, his lifespan would
be shortened. Eventually, he would die without them needing to do a
thing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill!
Kill! Kill!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Again!”
The Hegemons and Emperors were all in a wonderful mood.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had gotten the worst of his first clash against them. This time, he
transformed into a streak of light and shot straight towards them.
Clearly, he wanted to try and capture or kill as many Hegemons as he
could. If he succeeded, the astral chains would become ownerless and
he could take them away with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth, our Exalt has already predicted your every move!” The
Hegemons scattered every which way, but as they flew the miniature
stars flew with them, allowing them to maintain the astral chain
formations.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Yet another rift appeared at the borders, resulting in thirty-five
more Hegemons appearing. After they appeared, they immediately
produced their own treasures and joined together into a formation.
Soon, a thick black miasma began to sweep out and cover the entire
sealed continuum, causing an ominous feeling to arise in Ning’s
heart.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_42_Chapter_005__The"></A>
Chapter 5: Exhaust Him!</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Five Truncheon Chapters, Chapter 5 – Exhaust Him!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning remained quite calm, because this entire time he had the feeling
that this sealed continuum had not finished revealing all of the
dangers hidden within it. Although none of these dangers were truly
lethal, if he didn’t handle them correctly he would pay a heavy
price for it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Inside
the brightest of the three Elder Halls in this hidden dimension.
Exalt Bowenya was looking nervously at the images in the air before
him. The images were displaying the chaotic battle going on within
the sealed spacetime continuum. Explosions were occurring everywhere
as energy blasted about willy-nilly. Even though he was in control of
the Sacred Realm, he wasn’t able to clearly see what was going on
in the battle. Clearly, a chaotic and terrifying war was going on,
with all three Exalt-class Daoguard Towers focusing their
long-distance firepower against Daolord Darknorth, with all the
Hegemons working to assist the towers!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
the situation?” Exalt Bowenya barked coldly. He was able to get a
vague sense of what was going on from watching the images, and it
seemed as though his side held the advantage. They had surrounded
Daolord Darknorth and were blasting him with attacks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Exalt.”
More than twenty avatars belonging to the battling Hegemons and
Emperors were gathered next to him. True Sithe did not have avatars,
as they were constantly being rejected and suppressed by this
Chaosverse. It was impossible for them to use their godsense to keep
and maintain an avatar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
contrast, the Sithe descendants were native to this Chaosverse. They
all had avatars. Clearly, then, the avatars located next to Exalt
Bowenya all belonged to the Sithe progeny. These avatars belonged to
the various squads who had been assigned to take part in this battle.
Through them, the Exalt was able to quickly issue new orders as well
as be updated on how the battle was progressing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Exalt,
don’t worry. We have an absolute advantage in this battle. We’re
definitely going to win,” a horned man said excitedly. “The
astral chains have completely countered Daolord Darknorth’s
advantages. Each time, he is forced to use his sword-arts to defend
against us. He’s constantly using up energy, and his truesoul is
crumbling at an increasing pace while we are sending more and more
people into the sealed continuum to assault him. He’ll only be able
to capture or kill one of two of us within a short period of time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
sealed continuum was a hundred billion kilometers in size. Ning moved
much more slowly due to all of the attacks raining down on him, and
he was using up a lot of energy. As a result, he had to slowly move
from Emperor to Emperor as he captured them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“With
our grand formation having been established, he won’t have any
chance at all of capturing anyone from our team of thirty-five
Hegemons and Emperors,” a black-robed elder said confidently.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
already used his sword-arts at least ten times by now, and this is
just the beginning! We have many tools remaining that we haven’t
even used yet.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Exalt,
let us use all the tools we have at our disposal.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Exalt,
let us take part in the battle as well!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Exalt Bowenya revealed a look of delight. “Hah! I knew it. He’s
not going to pull anything unexpected out of his sleeves.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Exalt was no fool. Each plan he had used against Ning had a very high
chance of success. In Purgatory, the Apocalypse-class castle would’ve
stood a good chance of exhausting Ning to death, if it hadn’t been
for Ning’s Storm Sword Dao allowing Ning to move much faster than
anyone had anticipated.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for the spacetime formation, the only reason why Ning had survived it
was because the Apocalypse-class castle had bought him an extra hour
of time to gain insight into a few of the formation’s mysteries. As
a result, he had launched eighteen strikes and broke through that
formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
these past two failures, the Sithe Exalt was actually beginning to
lose confidence in himself. This time, however, everything was
progressing smoothly in accordance with their plan. This caused him
to feel quite delighted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
attack is much more powerful than the two previous attacks in
Purgatory combined.” An expectant look was in Exalt Bowenya’s
eyes. “We have three Daoguard Towers working together to rain
attacks on him, after all, and we also have a large group of Hegemons
and Emperors going all-out against him. Even if we can’t kill him
head-on, we can exhaust him to death.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Send
in the Bloodfiend Maze Formation as well,” Exalt Bowenya ordered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood!”
Two of the Sithe descendants next to him immediately acknowledged the
order respectively, then sent their squad of fifty-two Hegemons into
battle as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Have
all eighteen of the Death Attendants enter as well!” Exalt Bowenya
commanded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Just
a short while later… “Exalt, Daolord Darknorth is completely
helpless against the Death Attendants. All he can do is rely on his
speed to dodge. The more he dodges, the more awkward his movements
become. We’re landing more and more attacks from the astral chain
formations and the other formations, and he’s forced to use more
and more sword-arts to defend.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“His
truesoul is beginning to crumble faster and faster.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Exalt,
we’re definitely going to win!” All of the avatars of the Sithe
taking part in the battle were extremely confident.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hahaha,
I knew…!” Exalt Bowenya let out a laugh as he prepared to issue
his final orders, but then he suddenly hesitated. He asked, “How
many of our Hegemons and Emperors have been captured or killed?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Around
sixty-five of them were taken or slain,” a black-robed elder said.
Their formation was in control of the entire battlefield, allowing
them to know the casualties they had suffered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Quite
heavy.” Exalt Bowenya couldn’t help but smile, even as he said
these words. Even if all the Hegemons died, it would be worth it if
they killed Daolord Darknorth. Right now, just twenty percent or so
had perished!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
our casualties are indeed quite heavy, but Daolord Darknorth is
extremely important to the entire Sithe race. If we can kill him, it
will all be worth it.” The Hegemons and Emperors were brimming with
the desire to do battle. They had known long ago that this would be a
calamitous battle, but at least the situation was better than they
had expected, even though more and more Hegemons and Emperors were
being slain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
that’s the case, then send in the final two formation squads as
well. All remaining Hegemons and Emperors, use your respective
treasures to assist. Don’t let Daolord Darknorth focus his
attention on any one area in particular,” Exalt Bowenya said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.”
Instantly, a large number of Hegemons and Emperors charged forth.
This final wave included an enormous number of Emperors; there had to
be over two thousand of them!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, there was a limit to how many Hegemons could be used by the
three Daoguard Towers. At most, eight hundred Hegemons was enough!
More than two thousand of the other Hegemons were simply there to
obscure Ning’s vision and to distract him. After all, Ning would
continuously counter-attack and either kill or capture these
Hegemons! If he managed to kill someone who was in control of a
Daoguard Tower treasure, the impact would be significant, but if he
only managed to kill one of the screeners, it would have no impact on
the Sithe combat power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Of
course, even though these Emperors were merely a screening force,
they were also provided with formations and Sithe treasures to slow
Ning down.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
seems I’ll be able to deal with Daolord Darknorth just by
sacrificing a few Hegemons and Emperors.” Exalt Bowenya smiled
broadly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
continued to tick past, second after second.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ve
already lost more than ninety Hegemons and Emperors.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth has used his sword-arts over forty times by now.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
managed to capture another thirty Hegemons and Emperors, but most of
them were useless pawns. It won’t affect our combat power much. By
now, he’s used his sword-arts over fifty times!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
battle grew increasingly ferocious.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
already captured over two hundred Hegemons and should have used his
sword-arts at least eighty times by now. His truesoul is crumbling
quite rapidly.” The avatars continued to make detailed combat
reports to the Exalt.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Over
twenty Hegemons belonging to the Iceland Astral Chains have been
captured. The formation has been destroyed!” Suddenly, this new
report came out. The astral chain formations could still be
maintained after suffering light casualties, but at a certain point
it would still break apart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Keep
fighting! Daolord Darknorth won’t be able to last much longer,”
Exalt Bowenya said calmly. “He’s used his sword-arts many times…
even if he didn’t go full-force for most of them, it should still
have exhausted him tremendously.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
time continued to flow on, three more of the major formations were
breached as well. By now, Ning had either killed or captured over
five hundred Hegemons and Emperors, and had used his sword-arts over
180 times.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Almost.
Almost!” Exalt Bowenya was waiting eagerly. “We’re going to
win.” Each strike would consume a significant amount of Daolord
Darknorth’s vitality, even if the strikes were not full-force.
Based on his calculations, the Daolord would die after a total of
around two hundred strikes.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ve
lost over six hundred Hegemons and Emperors, while he’s already
used his sword-arts more than two hundred times. We still have over
two thousand people left, but we only have three formations
remaining. Daolord Darknorth is quite clever; he’s been focusing
his efforts on the Hegemons who are in control of the formations.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hold
nothing back!” Exalt Bowenya ordered coldly. “He’ll be dying
any moment now, while we have over two thousand Hegemons and Emperors
left. We’ll be able to exhaust him to death!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But…
for some reason, the closer they came to success, the more uneasy
Exalt Bowenya suddenly began to feel. He shook his head, forcing down
that uneasy feeling and reassuring himself that it had appeared
because he wanted to win too badly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Over
seven hundred Hegemons and Emperors have been captured, while we only
have two main formations remaining; the other formations aren’t
important and are just meant to screen the real ones. Daolord
Darknorth hasn’t died yet!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Over
eight hundred have been captured. He’s used his sword-arts over 250
times, but he still hasn’t died! We only have one main formation
left.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
hasn’t he died yet?!” Exalt Bowenya was growing increasingly
nervous and impatient.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
good!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Exalt!”
Suddenly, half of the remaining avatars turned completely ashen. One
of them said frantically, “Exalt, we’ve been counter-trapped!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Counter-trapped?!”
The Exalt was completely dumbfounded.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Five Truncheon Chapters, Chapter 6 – Putting On a Show</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Exalt
Bowenya’s face tightened. He murmured softly to himself, “Is he
actually exhausted, or was he just pretending?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
was beginning to feel some suspicions. The battle had progressed far
too smoothly, causing him to feel a hint of unease deep inside. Each
time, however, he had reassured himself that he was simply
overthinking things! Upon hearing the remaining Hegemons cry that
they had been counter-trapped? Exalt Bowenya’s intuition, tempered
by countless years of adventuring and battle, screamed that something
was seriously wrong with this battle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Are
all of you trapped?” Exalt Bowenya asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’re
all trapped. This entire place is filled with black fog. I can’t
see the other Hegemons and Emperors.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ve
been trapped as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’re
trapped.” The various avatars of the Hegemons and Emperors all
spoke out frantically, causing Exalt Bowenya to feel increasingly
uneasy about this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the sealed spacetime continuum of a hundred billion kilometers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
stood there in midair, relaxed and at his ease. Hundreds of millions
of kilometers away, some magic treasures and formations continued to
rain down attacks upon a second white-robed Daolord Darknorth. This
second Daolord Darknorth was doing his best to dodge and evade while
using his Water Sword Dao, Storm Sword Dao, and other techniques,
with his truesoul at the brink of collapse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
is real is false. What is false is real.” Ning murmured softly,
“None of these Hegemons are able to see through my Illusion Sword
Dao. I’m able to toy with them with ease.” Ever since he had been
trapped within this sealed continuum, his ‘frenzied fighting’ and
his ‘crumbling truesoul’ had all been falsified by his Illusion
Sword Dao!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
Sword Dao Domain was able to spread out to a distance of one billion
kilometers! With but a thought, he caused this entire region to be
transformed into an illusory realm. At Ning’s current level of
insight, the illusory beings within his domain had gained a basic
level of sentience, emotions, and intelligence! This was an
absolutely terrifying concept. In comparison, simply faking a battle
scene within this domain was incredibly simple. The Hegemons and
Emperors only saw what Ning wished for them to see!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
Ning was able to use his Omega Sword Dao to become an Autarch, his
illusory domain would reach the level of being able to manifest
reality itself. By then, his ‘illusions’ would be real on both
the surface and inside. He could create an ‘illusion’ of a
Universe treasure, and it would become a genuine Universe treasure.
If he created the illusion of an expert, they would become real
experts! But of course, this would require him to constantly consume
a large amount of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Even
now, the beings created by his illusions possessed intelligence,
emotions, and sentience. Ning’s ‘Illusion Sword Dao’ had become
one of his killer techniques. In a battle against an Autarch, it
would be somewhat effective but wouldn’t necessarily be the
determining factor… but against mere Hegemons and Emperors? The
Illusion Sword Dao could toy with them with ease! However, it took
Ning time to capture those Hegemons and break their formations, which
is why he had continued to put on a show and buy more time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.
We’ve already taken control of this formation,” Azurefiend’s
avatar reported.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Good.”
Ning revealed a delighted look, then waved his hand. A formation-base
which was ten million kilometers long suddenly appeared next to him.
Azurefiend’s avatar, the Paragon of Pills, Lord Annihilation,
Hegemon Tia, and Hegemon Flameleft were jointly controlling this
grand formation, which was one of the many formations which Ning had
taken away. He had let his team choose from the available formations
and find one which they could use.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Assemble
the formation and use it to cover everything within a hundred billion
kilometers,” Ning immediately ordered. “Trap them all. Let none
escape!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Leave
it to us.” Azurefiend, Lord Annihilation, and the others were all
quite excited. Capture two thousand Hegemons in one blow? They had
never done or even seen anything like this before! All of them felt
both eagerness and nervousness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Whoosh. Whoosh. A large amount of black fog spread out from within
the formation. It almost instantly covered the entire sealed
continuum, spreading out to a distance of a hundred billion
kilometers. This formation had been meant to deal with Ning. It only
had a minor effect on him, but it was perfect for dealing with these
Hegemons and Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can’t see anything!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
a terrifying aura of darkness. I’ve been suppressed!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can’t see anything either.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can’t resist it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ve
been completely trapped.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ve
been trapped as well!” The two thousand remaining Hegemons and
Emperors were all beginning to panic, because Ning had already dealt
with the most powerful formations earlier. The remaining Hegemons had
just a single powerful formation left, but it was an attack-type
formation that couldn’t affect this grand darkness formation at
all!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Once
the darkness spread out, almost 99% of the Hegemons and Emperors were
completely paralyzed. The rest were able to fight back a bit thanks
to the treasures they possessed, but there were only around ten or so
in total. They wouldn’t be able to make much of a difference.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Time
to bring it to an end.” Ning immediately began to fly towards those
remaining Hegemons. His Sword Dao Domain quickly spread out to cover
them, completely suppressing them and making it impossible for them
to move. With but a thought, Ning drew all the Hegemons into his
estate-world and imprisoned them in separate parts of it!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Whoosh. Whoosh. Soon, all of the Hegemons and Emperors within the
sealed continuum had been drawn away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Impressive,
Darknorth. I never would’ve dared to imagine a result like this.”
The Paragon of Pills was incomparably excited, while the nearby
Azurefiend, Lord Annihilation, Tia, and Flameleft were stunned as
well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
that I’ve taken part in such a great undertaking, I can die with no
regrets. I imagine my old friends wouldn’t even believe me when I
tell them about this,” Hegemon Flameleft sighed with shock.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“More
than two thousand Hegemons and Emperors!” Azurefiend sighed as
well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. “More than two thousand eight hundred, to be precise.
However, it was all thanks to you helping out. Otherwise, I wouldn’t
have been able to activate that formation on my own.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
we did was use that formation in a very simple manner, nothing else.”
Lord Annihilation said hurriedly, “In the end, it was all thanks to
your unearthly power, Daolord Darknorth. You dealt with the biggest
problems, allowing us to sweep up the scattered remnants.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Stop
flattering me,” Ning said with a laugh. “Go ahead and enter my
estate-world. This was merely our first battle in the Sacred Realm.
It is far too early to be celebrating.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“With
you by our side, Daolord, we’ll definitely make it out alive.”
Lord Annihilation continued his flattery.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Be
careful, Darknorth.” The Paragon of Pills looked at him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
sealed spacetime continuum was now completely empty. The only person
left within this region of a hundred billion kilometers was Ji Ning!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
that was a fine show we put on.” Ning couldn’t help but grin when
he thought about what had happened just now. In order to make the
performance seem as realistic as possible, he even used up a few of
his Sithe treasures, allowing them to take blows meant for him and
then explode in dramatic fashion. He actually made use of them as
well, as the fragments would clearly be real even after flying out of
the range of his Sword Dao Domain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Illusions…
reality… Ning was now an absolute grandmaster in blending the two
together, and so all of the Hegemons and Emperors fell into his
grasp.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
scan their memories first.” He had captured most of them alive,
sparing even the many true Sithe he had captured, all for the sake of
finding those nine special techniques. This was something which would
have an impact on his own chances of survival!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
waved his hand, causing a true Sithe Hegemon to appear before him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth?” The Sithe Hegemon stared at Ning, shocked. He then
gritted his teeth and said, “W-what do you want?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
continued to maintain his Illusion Sword Dao Domain. To the Sithe, it
looked as though Ning’s truesoul was crumbling away rapidly. It
looked as though Ning was at the very verge of death.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Do
you want to live, or do you want to die?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Live?
Die?” The Sithe Hegemon was stunned. Who would choose death if life
was an option? But as he hesitated, Ning secretly lured his mind into
the illusory realm, causing a dazed look to appear in his eyes. Ning
then began to flip through the memories of this Sithe Hegemon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
also swore a lifeblood oath not to reveal anything?” Ning’s face
tightened. “The Sithe truly are cautious. Even the true Sithe were
forced to swear lifeblood oaths.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
wasn’t able to find the nine techniques, and so he turned his
attention to the Hegemon’s other memories, carefully viewing them
in the hopes of finding something useful.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the brightest Elder Hall. Exalt Bowenya stood silently on his feet,
with the avatars of his servants by his side. All of their true
bodies had been captured alive! Clearly, they had already lost the
first battle. All the Hegemons and Emperors had been captured, with a
tiny fraction having been killed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Exalt.”
Two figures appeared next to him. It was the incarnations of Hawkfang
and Jonnbech.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was fairly easy for such high-level cultivators to use divine power
to manifest incarnations. So long as the incarnations remained fairly
close to their true bodies, the incarnations could be maintained with
ease! Hawkfang and Jonnbech’s true bodies were both located in the
other two Elder Halls, which were quite close. As a result, it was
easy for them to maintain incarnations here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
incarnations formed via divine power were all extremely weak,
negligibly weak when compared to their true bodies! In contrast,
avatars were different. Avatars could come close to true bodies in
power, with some able to reach 70% or even 80%.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
should we do next?” Jonnbech’s incarnation asked.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_42_Chapter_007__The"></A>
Chapter 7: Pity</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Five Truncheon Chapters, Chapter 7 – Pity</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Exalt
Bowenya instructed, “Go ahead and cancel the formations.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood,”
Hawkfang said. The formation which sealed the spacetime continuum
around Ji Ning was under the control of his Flameland Elder Hall. The
sealed continuum quickly dissipated, allowing the region at the base
of the distant Sacred Mountains to go back to normal and reveal
Daolord Darknorth at its center.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ahahaha!
Sithe Exalt, do you have any other tricks up your sleeve?” Ning
called out loudly from the base of the Sacred Mountains.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">From
afar, it looked as though his truesoul was crumbling quite quickly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“His
truesoul has crumbled to the point where he is on the verge of death.
I’m amazed at how calm he is.” Jonnbech stared downwards from his
Elder Hall to the base of the Sacred Mountains, then let out a sigh:
“Truly impressive.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
I was in his position, I’d probably have gone completely berserk by
now,” Hawkfang’s incarnation agreed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Exalt
Bowenya stared from afar, his forehead creased in a frown. “Do you
think Daolord Darknorth’s truesoul is truly crumbling that fast? Or
is it perhaps a deception?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
deception?” The avatars of the Hegemons, Hawkfang, and Jonnbech all
stared at him in surprise. They had all reached incredibly high
levels of insight. To deceive them would be nearly impossible! They
had never encountered something like this after becoming Hegemons and
Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
haven’t experienced enough. The things you see, the things you
sense… it can all be a lie. Even your own intuition can be
deceived.” Exalt Bowenya looked at the distant Ning. “We’ve
lost the first battle, just like that. I can’t help but feel that
something is wrong. If Daolord Darknorth was extremely skilled in the
Dao of Illusions, he would be able to put on a show which none of you
could see through.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
show?” Hawkfang and Jonnbech spoke out at the same time. Both were
shocked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
just one possibility. It’s also possible that he really is at the
verge of death.” Exalt Bowenya narrowed his eyes. Unlike these
Hegemons and Emperors, when he lived in his own Chaosverse he was an
actual Autarch, and his opponents were also Autarchs! In fact, he had
even met someone who was even more powerful than the Autarchs. He was
much more experienced and knew just how terrifying the Dao of
Illusions could be.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Exalt
Bowenya said calmly, “I’m just saying that this is a possibility.
You have to be wary of it during our upcoming battles.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
should we do next?” Hawkfang and Jonnbech looked at Exalt Bowenya.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
can we do? Use our Daoguard Towers to fight back against him as best
we can,” Exalt Bowenya said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Their
Daoguard Towers had already used up virtually all of their many
long-distance offensive treasures in the first battle. Exalt
Bowenya’s goal had been to focus-fire everything on Ning and
destroy him in their first engagement. However, they had already lost
that critical battle. As a result, they now had far fewer resources
available to them. The only things left were the Daoguard Towers
themselves!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Ning suddenly soared into the skies, then landed down upon the peak
of a distant mountain. He then sat down in the lotus position,
establishing a Sword Dao Domain that completely separated him from
the world beyond. A region of one billion kilometers transformed into
a blurry field of light, preventing Exalt Bowenya and the others from
seeing anything else.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
started to train again?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
about to die. He’s still training?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Everyone,
even Exalt Bowenya, felt their hearts clench. When Ning had first
entered Purgatory, he had done the same thing. He sat down in the
lotus position and meditated until he mastered his Wind Sword Dao.
After defeating the first castle, he had then entered another lengthy
training session which had concluded with his mastery of the Storm
Sword Dao! And after breaking through the spacetime formation, he had
trained for over a hundred chaos cycles before mastering the Illusion
Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Each
time Ning concluded a battle, he would begin a training session…
and each time, the training session would be quite long. Now that
Ning had finished his first big battle in the Sacred Realm, he
actually started to train once again. Exalt Bowenya and the others
had no idea as to how they should respond!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
sat there in the lotus position at a peak below the Sacred Mountains,
his Sword Dao Domain severing this peak from the world around him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Time
to continue.” Ning summoned another Sithe Hegemon and began to flip
through his memories. Time continued to flow on. Each Hegemon
consumed quite a bit of time, ranging from four hours to as long as
five days!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning willed a Sithe descendant to appear before him. This one was
fairly handsome but quite skinny. When he saw Ning, a shocked look
appeared on his face. “Daolord Darknorth!” Next, a maddened and
hateful look appeared in his eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
good.” Ning sensed a bit of danger. He hurriedly retreated while
taking out a large astral treasure and placing it before him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
The skinny Emperor suddenly exploded, causing a terrifying surge of
power to blast outwards. This explosion was on par with the might of
the Blazesun Ruler, and it smashed directly onto the astral treasure
in front of Ning. The treasure was smashed backwards and sent flying
more than ten million kilometers before Ning managed to regain
control over it and bring it back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
actually detonated a treasure he was carrying on him to launch one
final attack. He knew that his chances of killing me were slim, but
he was still willing to sacrifice his life?” Ning shook his head,
murmuring softly to himself. He had clearly seen the maddened,
hateful look in that Sithe man’s eyes; the man had truly viewed him
as a hated foe! Ning, however, didn’t feel any enmity towards them.
Strictly speaking, the ‘Sithe descendants’ were actually natives
to this Chaosverse who had been born and bred here, just like Ning
himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Another
half-month went by. Ning continued to summon Sithe descendants and
flip through their memories. On this day, he summoned a female
Emperor. She was similarly startled when she saw Ning appear before
her, then moved to self-detonate without hesitate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Freeze.”
This time, Ning moved much more decisively. Previously, he would chat
a bit with his prisoners to shake their willpower. This time, he
instantly sent a tendril of the sword-intent from his Illusion Sword
Dao into her body.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
maddened look quickly disappeared from the crazed female Emperor eyes
and was replaced by a lost look. Ning shook his head, his mood poor.
He began to scan the female Emperor’s memories.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
woman was known as Empress Gracevoid. Her path of cultivation had
been one filled with setbacks. She had originally been a mortal
physician, but a stroke of karmic luck had set her upon the path of
cultivation. Her heart was filled with kindness and benevolence, and
she chose the Daoist title ‘Gracevoid’ because her clan’s
apothecary shop had been named the ‘Gracevoid Hall’. The title
‘Fairy Gracevoid’ or ‘Daoist Gracevoid’ had accompanied her
as she had progressed up the path of cultivation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">She
bore love for all life, including even the grass and the plants. Her
heart was filled with love for everyone, but most of all she loved
the homeland where she had been born and bred.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However…
this battle against Ning was a battle which could not be avoided. One
side had to die! The Sithe viewed the cultivators as their mortal
enemies, and Exalt Bowenya himself had stated that if they lost, this
dimension would still end up being annihilated by that cultivator
Daolord! Her homeland would be completely destroyed. Empress
Gracevoid couldn’t accept this, and so she swore she would kill
this demon known as ‘Daolord Darknorth’! She would be willing to
pay any price needed to accomplish this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
greater the love, the deeper the hate.” Ning let out a sigh. “Hand
over all of your treasures,” Ning said, and the illusion-trapped
Empress obediently handed over all of her treasures.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
didn’t really care about the treasures themselves, of course. His
worry was that this Empress would once more attempt to commit
suicide! “Now wake up,” Ning said softly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Empress trembled slightly, regaining her clarity of mind. When she
saw Ning, she once more prepared to launch a desperate assault… but
then, she realized she had no treasures on her at all. If she simply
tried to self-detonate herself, the resulting blast wouldn’t be
enough to threaten even a mere Hegemon, to say nothing of this
terrifying Daolord.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
must you act like this upon seeing me?” Ning shook his head.
“Another Emperor tried to do the same earlier. I was a bit slower
and wasn’t able to save him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
no need to shed crocodile tears,” the Empress said angrily. “You
cultivators are our mortal enemies. Once we lose the war, our home
will be finished!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I,
Daolord Darknorth, swear on my very life itself that even if I do
gain victory in the Sacred Realm, I’ll leave without harming any of
the six mortal realms here,” Ning swore.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Empress was stunned. There was no way to falsify a lifeblood oath.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
never wanted to destroy your world,” Ning said. “And you aren’t
even true Sithe. Technically speaking, you belong to the same ‘race’
as me. The Sithe are the outsiders, not us.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Huh?!”
The Empress couldn’t believe it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“N-no…
I’m a Sithe descendant. There’s no question about that!” the
Empress argued.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Even
so, you are fundamentally different from them on an intrinsic level.
Haven’t you noticed yet? They treat you as nothing more than a
pawn.” Ning felt pity for these Sithe progeny. He held both Empress
Gracevoid and the man who had self-detonated in high regard, even
though they all wanted him dead.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_42_Chapter_008__The"></A>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Five Truncheon Chapters, Chapter 8 – Battle to the Death</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Different?”
The Empress fell silent. As an Eternal Empress, she was no fool; she
had realized long ago that there were some differences between the
Sithe descendants and the true Sithe! Over the course of many years,
the Hegemons and Emperors within this hidden dimension had slowly
diverged into two main camps. The first was led by the true Sithe,
while the second was led by the Sithe descendants. There were indeed
some true Sithe who held their descendants in contempt. Exalt Bowenya
ensured that they didn’t go too far and that conflict didn’t
erupt, but everyone could sense the tension.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Still
other Sithe managed to hide their contempt, but the more powerful
descendants could still sense it. This infuriated them all the more,
which was why they ended up following Hawkfang and setting up their
own camp.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
train in divine power and Immortal energy, but they train in a
completely different type of energy,” the Empress said softly. “We
might both be ‘Hegemons’, but our side completely surpasses them
in power. When we strike, the mighty power of the Dao flows through
us… but they are dramatically weakened and don’t have the power
of the Dao behind them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
descendants know all these things, and we have many suspicions, but…
but without a doubt, they are our ancestors.” An anxious look
appeared in the Empress’ eyes. “Hawkfang, for example. His father
was one of the Exalts. We might have some quarrels with them, but we
are definitely their children and grandchildren. There’s no
question about this at all… and so without a doubt, we are Sithe.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Wrong.”
Ning shook his head. “The power of the Dao comes from the power of
the primordial chaos, which is omnipresent. They have been rejected
by it, which is why they are unable to summon the power of the Dao…
and only the true Sithe will be rejected!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You,
however, are part of our Chaosverse. You are completely different
types of lifeforms from them. In this battle… ugh. I have to admit,
you Sithe progeny are placed in a rather awkward situation.” Ning
shook his head. “You’ll only be truly free once this war comes to
an end.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
female Empress had the vague feeling that Daolord Darknorth was not
lying to her. “I understand.” This was her only response. She
said nothing further.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go
then.” Ning waved his hand, sending her back into his estate-world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
continued to rifle through the memories of the Hegemons and Emperors.
None of the true Sithe attempted to self-detonate, because they all
knew the truth! This was an invasion, while they were the invaders
and had lost. They did, however, feel some degree of resentment
towards Ning. They were unhappy that Ning had come here and disturbed
their tranquil lives, embroiling them into a deadly war once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for the Sithe progeny? Nearly 10% of them attempted to self-detonate
or launch some other type of attack! They were willing to sacrifice
anything for their homes. As a result, Ning immediately captured them
with his illusions when he summoned them, then rifled through their
memories to know what they were intending. That way, they didn’t
have a chance to attack Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Poor
bastards. They’ll be in a rather awkward position until the day
that this war ends.” Even if they wanted to join the cultivators…
could the cultivators trust them? Of course not! The mighty
cultivator civilizations didn’t need a few extra Hegemons or
Emperors. They would probably first put them in internment camps
somewhere else, not letting them take part in the war to come!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Once
our Chaosverse gains a controller, there will be no more invaders.
Only then would our Chaosverse be strong and confident enough to
welcome the Sithe descendants without needing to worry about them.”
Although Ning felt mixed emotions about them, his decisions would not
be impacted by those emotions. He knew that this was just one of many
sad stories that came as a result of this clash of civilizations.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
they lost this war, all cultivator civilizations in this Chaosverse
would be brought to an end. That would be a true apocalypse! Thus,
Ning wouldn’t show any mercy at all to the true Sithe. He killed
almost all of them after flipping through their memories, sparing
only those few who Ning felt were quite benevolent in nature and had
been forced to take part in this war against their will.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ten
years later. On this day, Ning finally finished reviewing the
memories of the 2800+ Hegemons and Emperors he had captured.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nothing!”
Ning frowned. He had expected this result, but he still felt quite
disappointed. Everyone who had ever learned the nine special
techniques had been forced to swear lifeblood oaths not to transmit
them to any others. There was no way to review the techniques at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Exalt
Bowenya, perhaps?” Ning rose to his feet, staring at the three
glowing Daoguard Towers off in the distance. “Judging from the
memories I reviewed, he should be the one in control of this entire
hidden dimension! He seems to have some sort of connection to the
Sithe heartlands, as the orders to the Sithe are sent via him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
the heart of the Sithelands have been sealed off long ago. How is it
that they are still connected to the outside world?” Ning frowned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">During
the Dawn War, the Autarchs had commanded countless cultivators to
assault and defeat the Sithe. They had occupied the outer perimeter
of the Sithelands, then completely sealed away the heartland regions!
But this hidden dimension… not only had the Autarchs been unable to
discover it, it was even in contact with the Sithe heartlands.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
wonder if the experts within the Sithe heartlands have a way to
escape or not.” Ning was beginning to feel a bit of worry. Being in
contact was one thing, but if the Sithe army was somehow able to slip
out without anyone noticing… that would be a serious problem!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Time
to go to war.” Ning rose to his feet, then turned and stared at the
three distant Daoguard Towers. He took a single step forwards,
quickly soaring into the skies towards the Daoguard Towers. His Sword
Dao Domain continuously expanded, while he maintained the illusion of
his truesoul crumbling at incredible speeds. He looked just like a
Daolord who was on the verge of death.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
coming.” Exalt Bowenya and the incarnations of Hawkfang and
Jonnbech were gathered together. The other Hegemons and Emperors had
retreated; it was now up to the three of them to carry out this
battle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Bowenya!”
Ning’s voice echoed throughout the heavens as he flew towards the
Daoguard Tower located at the very rear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
actually headed straight for my Daoguard tower?” Exalt Bowenya
frowned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Exalt,
what should we do?” Hawkfang and Jonnbech were both rather anxious.
Previously, they had been hoping that Ning would attack their Elder
Halls first. The Elder Halls were all Exalt-class Daoguard Towers,
and each was filled with countless dangers. They had clung onto the
hope that Ning would actually charge inside their Daoguard Towers…
but Ning had completely ignored them!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was because Ning could vaguely sense that the central control
mechanisms for this entire hidden dimension were located within the
rear Elder Hall.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
he’s heading straight for me,” Exalt Bowenya said coldly, “Then
just go ahead and give him a proper greeting. Hawkfang, you go first.
If you fail, Jonnbech will follow you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood,”
Hawkfang said respectfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry. Although I suspect Daolord Darknorth might be feigning
weakness, as a Daolord he probably hasn’t been training long enough
to reach such a ridiculously high level in the Dao of Illusions! If
his injuries are real, then he should be at the verge of death. It’ll
be easy for you to kill him,” Exalt Bowenya said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">By
now, Ning was already very close to the Daoguard Tower in the back.
Suddenly, a rumbling sound could be heard. The three towering
Daoguard Towers were located on the peaks of three separate
mountains. The sound of explosions suddenly emanated from one of
them, causing the earth to shake as it began to separate from the
mountains beneath it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!”
Ning turned to glance at the distant Daoguard Tower, watching in
shock as it slowly separated from the mountain beneath it. “Daoguard
Towers are incredibly hard to establish. They were actually willing
to discard the foundation for that tower?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Daoguard
Towers were extremely stable after being constructed. Daoguard Towers
were extremely powerful, partially because of the treasures they
held, but also because of the extremely complicated formations
governing their foundations. These formations allowed them to draw
large amounts of energy through the earth, ensuring that the Daoguard
Tower could function indefinitely!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
complex formations also allowed them to maintain control over an
extremely wide region, making that region part of their territory.
The technique they had used to trap Ning within that sealed spacetime
continuum during the previous battle was just one example of that
control. Now, however, the three Daoguard Towers had already
exhausted all of their long-range attacks. Their only option was to
use the towers themselves to fight.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
the situation was truly dire, or when a tower’s owner was
determined to battle to the death, some truly berserk actions could
be taken. For example, when Ning had rescued the Paragon of Pills,
the controller of that tower had actually allowed the tower itself to
crumble in order to release the terrifying being trapped beneath it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Every
single Daoguard Tower was the home base for a powerful Sithe expert.
If they were truly driven to the brink, they could separate the
Daoguard Tower from the foundation, choosing to either flee or battle
with the foe to the end.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_42_Chapter_009__The"></A>
Chapter 9: Dueling Hawkfang</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Five Truncheon Chapters, Chapter 9 – Dueling Hawkfang</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Once
the Daoguard Tower breaks free from its foundation, many of its
formations will become unusable, and it’ll no longer be able to
draw any more energy into itself. It’ll only be able to use
whatever energy it already accumulated prior to breaking free,” Ji
Ning mused to himself. “Without the foundation supporting its many
formations, the Daoguard Tower will be dramatically weakened and
won’t last long in battle.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“And…
I don’t even need to go inside that Daoguard Tower.” Ning was
brimming with confidence. “I’ll definitely win this battle!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
frenzied war outside the Sacred Realm had been dangerous to him
because there had been 2,800 Hegemons and Emperors attacking him,
reinforced by multiple formations and treasures from the Daoguard
Towers! If Ning had chosen to fight them squarely, he probably
would’ve died in that battle. Thankfully, he was able to rely on
his Illusion Sword Dao to put on a fine show without actually using
up much energy. Now, things would be much simpler.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
only thing worrying him was the Daoguard Tower controlled by Exalt
Bowenya! The other Daoguard Towers would be comparatively easier to
deal with.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
need to conserve as much energy as I can.” Ning watched as the
distant Daoguard Tower flew through the skies in his direction.
“Based on the memories I searched, this Daoguard Tower should be
the ‘Flameland Elder Hall’ which Hawkfang controls. I hear that
he’s an incredibly talented genius who has a chance of becoming an
Autarch!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
breaking free from its foundation, the Flameland Elder Hall began to
fly by itself through the air. This was going to be a battle to the
death, a war without quarter. Roughly four hundred Hegemons and
Emperors were within the Flameland Elder Hall. The entire Sacred
Realm only had a total of around 1,200 Hegemons and Emperors left,
and they were divided into three squads controlled by Hawkfang,
Jonnbech, and Exalt Bowenya.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Hegemons and Emperors who followed Hawkfang were all Sithe
descendants!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hawkfang,
Daolord Darknorth is already at the verge of death. There’s no need
for you to fight personally. Let us go instead! We’ll exhaust him
to death,” a muscular, fiery-armored man said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right!
Hawkfang, you have to stay alive. So long as you are alive, the
future generations of Hegemons and Emperors here will have someone to
protect them and make their lives easier. Let us be the vanguard in
this battle. Once we kill that demon, this tribulation will be at an
end and we’ll all be able to relax.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hawkfang
was silent. His heart was filled with many mixed emotions. He didn’t
feel much hatred towards Daolord Darknorth, because he had seen too
much and knew too much. He had long ago learned the truth when his
avatar had accompanied his father in that final battle during the
Dawn War.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Is
there no way out at all? Hawkfang glanced at his comrades. All of
them were native to this dimension. They were powerful experts who
had arduously arisen from amongst the countless mortal cultivators
born within this realm. He had known them for countless aeons, and
they were all linked together by deep bonds of love and affection.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There’s
no way out. We’ve all sworn oaths long ago to be loyal to Exalt
Bowenya and obey his commands. If we flee, we’ll all die. For the
sake of my friends and brothers… Daolord Darknorth, I suppose
you’ll have to die in their stead. Cold light flashed through
Hawkfang’s eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hear
my orders!” Hawkfang called out loudly. All of the Hegemons and
Emperors turned solemn and let out acknowledging shouts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Assemble
a total of three Ragnorak Formations! We’ll need a total of 192
Emperors to control them.” Hawkfang swept the area with his gaze,
then waved his hand and sent his Immortal energy flying out towards
192 of the figures present. “You shall control these three
formations. Hurry up and take control!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Everyone
else, focus on offensive formations. We’ll split the remaining
Hegemons into six squads which will control these formations.”
Hawkfang divided up the remaining Hegemons into multiple squads. He
had more Hegemons and Emperors than he needed to fully staff the
Daoguard Tower’s formations, and so he assigned them to control
other formations instead.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hawkfang,
what about our avatars?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Our
avatars will be able to fight as well!” the Sithe descendants said
hurriedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hawkfang
replied coldly, “Deploy your avatars as you see fit. Prepare all
your treasures and get ready for our final battle.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go!” The Hegemons and Emperors quickly began to take control over
the respective formations.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
Sword Dao Domain was continuously maintaining an illusory field
within its reach. To the Sithe, it looked as though Ning was soaring
through the skies towards them… but in reality, Ning was more than
six hundred million kilometers away from his illusory location!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Daoguard Tower. If I refuse to go inside, what can it possibly do to
me?” Ning stared as that twelve-storied tower flew towards him from
afar. This Daoguard Tower radiated a weighty aura of might, and it
did give Ning a vague sense of danger. It continued to move closer to
Ning’s real location, causing him to frown. He immediately began to
retreat, wanting to pull away from it as much as possible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!”
This cold shout came from the lips of a black-robed man whose eyes
were terrifyingly calm. He stood at the entrance to the Daoguard
Tower, staring at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was able to see the opening, but he certainly wasn’t going to
charge into it and enter the Daoguard Tower!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hawkfang?”
Ning immediately recognized this person. He had already ‘met’
Hawkfang numerous times while rifling through the memories of the
captured Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
series of formation-lines suddenly lit up on the ninth floor of the
Daoguard Tower, with a large amount of power circulating through it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
dimensional wave filled with destructive power swept out towards
Ning, moving so fast and covering such a great area that it almost
instantly appeared before him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn!
They’ve actually completely boxed me in.” Ning frowned when he
saw this. His illusions were still active, but his opponents had
launched such a large-scale attack that everything within his Sword
Dao Domain was being assaulted, including both the illusory Ning and
the real Ning!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
was really nothing Ning could do against such a large-scale area
attack. He immediately drew a Northbow sword and lightly sliced the
air, causing a dimensional ripple to spread out and surround him. He
was going to use his Space Sword Dao to counter these dimensional
ripples.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was securely ensconced in a dimensional ‘bubble’ which resisted
the all-encompassing attack. Ning could sense exactly how much power
was pushing against him, and he made sure that his bubble held just a
tiny bit more power. He also continued to maintain the illusions with
his Sword Dao Domain, having the illusory Ning also ‘block’ with
the Space Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!”
Yet another order rang out. This time, the sixth floor of the
Daoguard Tower unleashed a terrifyingly large streak of saber-light
that shot out in a fan-shape. This fan of saber-light was composed of
countless tiny streaks of saber-light that were densely clustered
together. Their power was overwhelming, and they also constitute a
vast area attack that completely covered the entire Sword Dao Domain,
viciously smashing through everything within it!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
was nothing Ning could do except use his sword-arts to defend once
again. Fortunately, it didn’t require too much energy as these
untargeted area attacks were much less dangerous to Ning, in that the
force exerted against each individual within the area was much lower
than in the case of a targeted attack. It was just barely at the
Blazesun Ruler level of power, and so Ning was able to block without
too much difficulty.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!”
This time, the attack came from the third floor of the Daoguard
Tower. It burst forth with the most powerful attack yet, unleashing a
stream of golden flames which covered the skies and blazed away at
everything within the Sword Dao Domain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Have
they already guessed that I’m using illusions? Otherwise, why would
they exclusively use such large-scale attacks?” Ning frowned. These
large-scale attacks weren’t that dangerous, but they still took up
some of his energy. Ning couldn’t help but feel worried. “Time to
change strategies.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Exalt
Bowenya and Jonnbech were carefully watching this battle from afar.
It was impossible for Hawkfang to fully control the tower while using
his godsense to maintain a connection with an incarnation, and so he
had dispelled it for now. The only people remaining here were Bowenya
and Jonnbech’s incarnation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Watch
carefully, Jonnbech.” Exalt Bowenya stared at the distant Ning
intently. “I hope Hawkfang can win this battle, but if he loses,
you are next! You are one of the most impressive Sithe Hegemons to
have come here. I don’t care too much if the others die, but I hope
you will survive.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry, Exalt,” Jonnbech said. Jonnbech was the only Hegemon within
this entire hidden dimension who had a truly perfect Dao-heart. He
was close to becoming an Exalt himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">True
Sithe were only able to become Exalts in this dimension, but their
children could become Autarchs! This was why the Sithe had paid so
much attention to Hawkfang. In his heart, though, Exalt Bowenya still
felt closer to Jonnbech. He couldn’t help it; the two were both
true Sithe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
doesn’t matter if Daolord Darknorth really is skilled in putting on
a show. We’ll find out the truth soon enough.” Jonnbech stared
from afar. “If he can endure even this sort of all-out assault from
Hawkfang’s Flameland Elder Hall, we can be all but certain that his
‘injuries’ were a false front.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.
If he truly is at the brink of death, it’s highly unlikely that he
will be able to defeat Hawkfang’s Flameland Elder Hall,” Exalt
Bowenya agreed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hawkfang’s
quite intelligent as well.” Jonnbech continued to watch, then let
out a cold smile: “He’s using up all the remaining power of his
Daoguard Tower to launch repeated wide-scale attacks. That was the
fifteenth wave of attacks!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Exalt
Bowenya just continued to watch silently. So what if Hawkfang died?
So what if even Jonnbech died? He cared, but not that much. So long
as he himself survived and managed to successfully kill Ning, he
would be a happy man.</P>

attacks against him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Flameland Elder Hall launched attack after attack, using those
massive streams of golden fire, the enormous fans of saber-light, and
those giant dimensional waves. On top of these wide-ranging area
attacks, they also launched quite a number of single-target attacks
against Ning! These single-target attacks were more focused, and as a
result they were more powerful!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ve
already launched a total of fifteen wide-range attacks, and also

grow anxious.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“His

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’ll
die any moment now.” Under Hawkfang’s direction, the Hegemons and
Emperors in the Flameland Elder Hall launched yet another furious
wave attacks, while Ning continued to retreat while blocking as best
he could.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
continued to tick away. Hawkfang watched as the rate at which Ning’s
truesoul crumbled away continued to increase. He was clearly in
increasingly bad shape. Any ordinary Daolord would’ve died long
ago! Ning, however, was able to somehow keep fighting.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">More
time passed. Ning continued to run around the area, blocking and
defending. He looked as though he was in his death throes… but he
simply wouldn’t die! By now, the Fireland Elder Hall had used up
the majority of its energy stores.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
all an illusion!” Hawkfang suddenly said coldly, a frozen look on
his face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“An
illusion?” The avatars of the Emperors next to him were all
stunned. As the battle had raged on for longer than they had
expected, they too had started to grow increasingly uneasy, but they
could tell that the white-robed Daolord’s truesoul really was
crumbling away faster and faster. It looked as though they were very
close to succeeding in their task of slaying this ‘Daolord
Darknorth’. They really didn’t want to believe it was all an
illusion.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hawkfang
gritted his teeth. “He was already at death’s door before we even
started! By now, the Flameland Elder Hall has used up more than half
of our energy stores, yet he is somehow still able to keep up the
fight? He’s just a Daolord! How strong could his truesoul possibly
be?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
w-we…” the Hegemons and Emperors all started to panic.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
it really is an illusion.” Exalt Bowenya watched from afar. “He
is the first Daolord to master an Eternal Omega Dao in this
Chaosverse. He truly cannot be underestimated! Still… while I knew
his sword-arts were powerful, I never would’ve imagined that his
illusions would be so incredible as well. Even I cannot see any flaws
in his illusions.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Exalt
Bowenya remained quite calm. He had been alive for a very long time,
and the Sithe Chaosverse was a far more advanced place than this one.
Back in his homeland, there had been quite a few who had become
Eternal Emperors via an Omega Dao! Thus, Exalt Bowenya was able to
accurately judge Ning’s power and abilities. However, he felt that
since Ning was a Daolord who had failed the Daomerge, by all rights
he should’ve been lacking in areas aside from his primary Dao, as
he simply hadn’t been alive long enough. Now, it seemed, Daolord
Darknorth had reached incredible heights in the art of illusions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
what should I do, Exalt?” Jonnbech frowned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Follow
our original plan,” Exalt Bowenya said. “I’ll give you every
treasure I can spare! There’s no way Hawkfang can win this fight.
His Flameland Elder Hall will run out of energy soon, and once it
does it won’t even be able to continue flying! This battle will be
up to you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”
Jonnbech nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
a pity.” Exalt Bowenya stared off into the distance. “We have had
innumerable progeny, but Hawkfang was quite arguably the most
talented one to have ever arisen within this Chaosverse. He had a
good chance of becoming an Autarch! If he succeeded, his status
would’ve skyrocketed to a level that was much higher than my own.
Unfortunately, his Dao-heart was flawed and he has never been able to
perfect it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">To
become an Autarch, one needed a perfect Dao-heart. The same was
needed to master an Eternal Omega Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’ll
probably die here.” Exalt Bowenya let out a sigh. Once the power of
the Flameland Elder Hall was used up, it would no longer pose a
threat to Daolord Darknorth at all, who would be able to capture
Hawkfang with ease. Not even Exalt Bowenya would dare to battle Ning
head-on without the backing of his Daoguard Tower.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the Sword Dao Domain. A glowing castle that was merely thirty meters
long was stationed here, with Ning and Azurefiend’s avatar located
within it. Azurefiend’s avatar was pouring Immortal energy into the
castle, keeping it active. As for Ning, he was seated off to one side
in front of a table that had a flask of wine and a wine cup on it.
Every so often, he would lift up the wine cup and take a sip.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
only needed to spare a bit of attention to maintaining the illusions
within the Sword Dao Doman, making the illusory Ning’s performance
more convincing! The single-target attacks were powerful and
concentrated, with the ones shooting out from this Exalt-class
Daoguard Tower being close to Autarch-level attacks in might.
However, they all hit the illusory Ning without harming the real one
in the slightest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for the large-scale attacks, they dispersed their might across an
extremely wide area, making it fairly easy to defend against them.
However, Ning wasn’t willing to do so and instead took out a Sithe
treasure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
must be remembered that Ning had captured over 2,800 Hegemons and
Emperors during the previous battle! They had carried many types of
treasures on them, and it could be said that they collectively held
roughly over 80% of the total Sithe treasures within this hidden
dimension. Now, those treasures were all Ning’s! There were
actually over ten items that were on the level of the Blacksun. Ning
had pulled out one of them and allowed Azurefiend’s avatar to bind
it, then used it to defend against the attacks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had selected this castle for its sturdiness and defensive strength.
It was able to defend against the large-scale attacks that struck it
with ease. This castle was on the same level as the Blacksun, and it
was specialized in defense. Attacks like this, merely on par with the
Blazesun Ruler, were completely unable to breach its thick walls. The
only thing they did was to consume Azurefiend’s power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Withdraw.”
Ning watched the battle proceed while causing his Sword Dao Domain to
rapidly retreat and disperse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
why are you having us retreat?” Azurefiend’s avatar asked. “These
Sithe have extremely powerful attacks, but the wide-scale ones are
all being blocked by the castle. Why should we withdraw?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
where you are wrong.” Ning laughed. “Warfare isn’t as simple as
attacking and defending. You need to see beyond the clashes to the
nature of the battle itself. There’s no need for us to do too much
in this battle against the Flameland Elder Hall. Given enough time,
they will run out of energy and we will have won.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
gaze went through the walls of the castle, allowing him to see the
Flameland Elder Hall which continued to pursue and assault them.
“Once they broke free from their foundations, they no longer had
any chance to retreat. Their only option was to unleash all the power
available to them in a final, desperate assault,” Ning explained.
“So… why should we actually fight them? I’ll just keep running,
while they will keep chasing. It actually takes this Daoguard Tower
energy to fly through the air as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
was another unspoken reason why Ning had them continuously retreat.
This was because he wanted to stay as far away from the other two
Elder Halls as possible! That way, once he captured all the Hegemons
and Emperors in the Flameland Elder Hall, he would be able to review
their memories without being disturbed. If he was too close to the
other two Elder Halls, they’d probably launch attacks at him and
disrupt him. If he stayed farther away, it would be harder for them
to bother him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Explosions
of ruinous power continued to ring out unabated, with Ning continuing
to fight while fleeing. Every so often, a streak of Autarch-level
golden light would shoot out, tearing through the earth and gouging
unfathomably deep tunnels in the ground. As for the wide-scale
attacks that covered as much as ten billion kilometers, they would
terrify even most Hegemons.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Any
other cultivator would’ve perished long ago from a battle like
this. Only the Autarchs and Ning were equipped to handle it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Flameland Elder Hall has nearly been utterly exhausted of all its
power. It only has enough to keep flying.” Hawkfang gritted his
teeth after saying these words. His voice echoed throughout the
entire Elder Hall, with every single Emperor and Hegemon inside
hearing them. “We have lost this battle. The only thing we have
left is a final charge.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hawkfang
felt pain and sorrow in his heart, because he knew that this final
charge would result in his comrades throwing their lives away. The
cultivators… the Sithe… Hawkfang wasn’t sure who he truly
belonged to, but he knew that the people he cared the most about were
his comrades, the other Sithe descendants. And yet, his care alone
wouldn’t be of any use. He couldn’t disobey Exalt Bowenya’s
orders. Every single Hegemon and Emperor had long ago sworn oaths to
obey Exalt Bowenya.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
final charge.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!
Even as we die, let’s use up more of Daolord Darknorth’s power.
Exhaust him!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill
him, and we’ll bring hope to our homeland. Once we die, it’ll all
be for nothing.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hawkfang,
you stay back. So long as you are alive, the others will still have a
leader!” The Hegemons and Emperors began to charge out of the
Flameland Elder Hall, moving like streaks of light towards Ning as
they tried to dissuade Hawkfang from joining the battle.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_42_Chapter_011__The"></A>
Chapter 11: A Wonderful Surprise</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Five Truncheon Chapters, Chapter 11 – A Wonderful Surprise</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Streaks
of light flew out from the Flameland Elder Hall. The Sithe
descendants were absolutely fearless, and they charged out with a
mixture of both frenzy and despair.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hawkfang
silently watched from afar. He suddenly had the feeling that those
streaks of light were utterly beautiful… yet at the same time, they
stabbed against his heart like daggers. In truth, the torment he had
felt in his heart over the course of many aeons had been utterly
excruciating. This was why he had never been able to perfect his
Dao-heart!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Death
is a form of release. My friends… if all of you die, what would be
the point of me surviving by myself? To continue being a disposable
pawn to the Sithe?” A calm look appeared in Hawkfang’s eyes, and
he began to release the two monsters trapped within the Flameland
Elder Hall. Clack clack clack clack… the prison cells located
within the deepest depths of the Elder Hall began to swing open,
awakening two mighty creatures that had existed since antiquity.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom.
Boom. Boom. The entire Flameland Elder Hall began to shake. After
awakening, the two strange creatures instantly entered a berserk
state. It was extremely hard to control these creatures, but somewhat
easier to drive them so berserk that they would attack all foes
before them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sithe generally treated these creatures as their final trump cards.
The creatures were sent out to fight only when the Sithe were on
their last legs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They’ve
all gone.” Hawkfang watched those hundreds of streaks of light shot
from the Flameland Elder Hall towards the distant region covered by
the Sword Dao Domain… but those who entered it disappeared without
a trace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
go as well.” Hawkfang could sense those two creatures beginning to
awaken and cause destruction. The power within his Daoguard Tower had
finally been used up. Without any energy to power its artifacts and
formations, the Daoguard Tower was completely incapable of
restraining these two mighty beasts any further. The two were
beginning to tear it apart… and in truth, Hawkfang didn’t care.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had already committed himself irrevocably to this path once he had
split the Elder Hall away from its foundation. Even if the depleted
tower wasn’t destroyed, it would be of little use; at most, he
could detach a few weapons and use them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!”
Hawkfang shot out like a streak of light, charging with determination
towards the distant Ning. He was the last of the Hegemons and
Emperors in his group to attack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Exalt
Bowenya and Jonnbech all watched as those hundreds of streaks of
light shot out towards Daolord Darknorth, followed by the final
streak of light which represented Hawkfang. Both of them were silent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for Ning, he was absolutely delighted. He had long ago put away his
castle and was actively manipulating his Sword Dao Domain instead. He
flew through the air, moving towards those attacking Emperors as his
domain moved with him as well. As soon as the Emperors entered his
reach, they were trapped by illusions and captured with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! The Hegemons and Emperors continued to launch frenzied
attacks, but none of them landed on Ning at all. At most, Ning would
have to exert a tiny bit of power to use evasion-arts to dodge. And
so… all of the Hegemons and Emperors, Hawkfang included, were
captured in one fell swoop. He drew all of them into his
estate-world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
that is that?” Just as Ning was feeling quite satisfied with
himself and preparing to review the memories of these Hegemons, he
suddenly turned to stare at the crumbling Flameland Elder Hall with a
slightly tense look on his face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
A giant hole appeared in the side of the Flameland Elder Hall,
followed by a creature that looked like a giant fish flying out of
the opening. The giant fish quickly expanded in size when it flew
out, expanding to become thirty thousand kilometers long. It had long
whiskers around its mouth, and those whiskers were all ten thousand
kilometers as well. It also had a total of eighteen sets of claws
located alongside its flank. As for its tail, the tip of its tail was
connected to a series of slender threads which chopped through space
with terrifying power as they swished back and forth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
an incredible beast.” Ning felt a sense of threat. “I have the
feeling that it is even tougher to deal with than the last beast I
encountered.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Squish.
Squish. Squish. Right at this moment, another strange creature that
looked something like an earthworm began to slowly ooze its way out
of the main gates of the Flameland Elder Hall. The creature emanated
a halo of golden light, and when Ning saw it he immediately had the
feeling that its body was incredibly tough. Even if Ning chopped it
into ten pieces, it probably still wouldn’t die. Killing it would
be no easy task.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
need to find their essence cores before I can kill them,” Ning
mused. “But both are extremely hard to deal with. It’ll probably
take me ten or twenty strikes to kill them… but why should I have
to?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
exert his will as he landed upon the ground beneath him. He had
already flown out of the Sacred Mountains and into an empty plains,
and when he landed on the plains he exerted the power of his Illusion
Sword Dao, vanishing without a trace. He was using his illusions to
blend into his surroundings, completely masking his aura and
revealing no traces of his presence at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill…
kill… kill…” These two creatures came from outside the
Chaosverse, and they were born with incredibly powerful bodies. Their
eyes were filled with savagery as they scanned the area, searching
for living beings to kill. And yet… after doing so, they ended up
turning and charging towards the two remaining Elder Halls instead!
Both of those Elder Halls were easily locatable, and they could sense
that both held living beings within them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn!
It really was all an illusion. Daolord Darknorth’s illusions are
truly…” Exalt Bowenya turned pale when he saw this. These were
clearly HIS beasts, but upon being unable to find Ning they chose to
charge towards him instead!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
had captured these beasts and driven them berserk. For these beasts
to now attack them was a form of karma.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Squish! The two creatures parted ways, separating as they moved
towards the two Elder Halls. They began to launch a frenzied barrage
of attacks upon their respective Elder Halls. Their mighty bodies
contained an even more massive amount of energy than Flamewing! It
gave them all the power they needed to furiously assault the towers
to give vent to their hate. They even opened their giant mouths to
bite down at the towers… but the two Elder Halls would not be so
easily shaken by the likes of them!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! The two Elder Halls began to counter-attack with
near-Autarch levels of might. The attacks left gaping wounds on the
bodies of the two creatures. The earthworm creature was able to
endure nearly a hundred blows before finally being blasted apart, at
which point its essence core was destroyed and it perished. As for
the giant fish, when it was on the verge of dying it actually came
back to its senses and bored into the earth to flee.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
regained its mind?” Exalt Bowenya was quite shocked. “We had
driven it completely insane, but it somehow managed to come back to
its senses. Near-death experiences truly can give birth to miracles.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
didn’t worry about that giant fish-creature too much, because the
Sacred Realm was so stable that there was no way the creature would
be able to break free and escape from it. After he dealt with the
biggest problem, ‘Daolord Darknorth’, he would have plenty of
time to handle the fish and recapture it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth.” Exalt Bowenya stared off into the distance, his gaze
focused upon the plains where Ning had vanished. Daolord Darknorth
was a thousand times more dangerous than that giant fish!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had hidden himself via his power over illusions. And upon doing so he
had immediately summoned Hawkfang.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hawkfang
had been someone whom the Sithe had held great hopes for. He had a
chance of becoming an Autarch, and was the son of a Sithe Exalt. Ning
had searched the memories of over 2,800 Sithe Emperors to no avail.
By now, he felt certain that his chances of finding those nine
techniques in the memories of ordinary Emperors were extremely slim.
Hawkfang, however, was special. Perhaps he might have something.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The black-robed Hawkfang appeared before Ning. His gaze was calm, and
he even smiled slightly when he saw Ning appear before him. “Daolord
Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
didn’t say anything, immediately drawing Hawkfang into an illusion.
He was afraid that Hawkfang would try to commit suicide in the hopes
of killing him. If that happened, Ning wouldn’t have a chance to
search his memories. They would have plenty of time to chat later.
The nine techniques, however, were absolutely critical to him and his
hopes of proceeding further along the path of cultivation. He
wouldn’t take any risks with that.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is certainly a great deal of memories.” Ning began to review
Hawkfang’s memories. Hawkfang’s Dao-heart was flawed, and so he
wasn’t able to resist Ning’s illusions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
couldn’t help but sigh as he flipped through Hawkfang’s memories.
Hawkfang was a rather tragic figure. If he had been born amongst the
cultivators, he probably would’ve already become an Autarch.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!
He also swore a lifeblood oath not to transmit the nine techniques to
anyone?” Ning felt rather speechless when he saw the
thought-bubbles surrounding those nine techniques. He had expected
this, but he had still been hoping that Hawkfang would be different.
In truth, however… every single Sithe given access to these
techniques had been forced to swear lifeblood oaths. Hawkfang was no
exception.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ugh.”
Ning felt rather disappointed after being unable to access the nine
techniques, but he continued to flip through Hawkfang’s other
memories.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
slowly flowed on. Two hours. Four hours…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
this?” Ning’s eyes slowly began to light up as he began to flip
through the memories faster and faster. The more he saw, the more
excited he became… and towards the end, he was so excited that his
entire body was quivering.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
this is an unexpected surprise!” Due to his repeated failures, Ji
Ning was already at the verge of abandoning all hope of finding the
nine special techniques. He was simply rifling through the rest of
Hawkfang’s memories out of a sense of caution. Who would’ve
thought that such an unexpected surprise would pop out!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hawkfang
was the creator of the [Five Truncheon Chapters]. He truly was a
genius!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
Hawkfang’s father had accompanied the Sithe army in their first
invasion of the Chaosverse, he began to live here within this hidden
dimension. Later on, the supreme Sithe leaders sent orders for the
Sithe to begin to propagate within this land. As for Hawkfang’s
father, he was an Exalt, but the one and only child he had upon
reaching this level was Hawkfang. He began to put all of his efforts
into rearing his son.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hawkfang
was incredibly talented in every respect, and he skyrocketed in power
with no pause at all! However… he was still just a Sithe
descendant. The true Sithe couldn’t help but feel a sense of
caution towards these descendants, and so they weren’t willing to
pass down any information or guidance regarding Omega Daos! If one of
their children managed to reach Autarchy via an Omega Dao, it would
be their children who would become the rulers of this Chaosverse…
which meant that it would still be suited for the current
cultivators, not the Sithe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sithe descendants were much like the local cultivators, after all.
They were born and bred under the current conditions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
addition, if someone reached Autarchy via an Omega Dao, not even a
lifeblood oath would be able to restrain or affect him. The Sithe
were afraid that they would no longer be able to control such a
person, and so they didn’t pass down any Omega daos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hawkfang
was incredibly talented. Guided by the Sithe away from the Omega
Daos, he succeeded in the Daomerge and became a mere Hegemon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, this was perhaps a lucky thing for Hawkfang. Ning didn’t
have any guidance as he walked the path of the Omega Sword Dao, but
the difficulty of the Daomerge resulted in him failing at it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Becoming
a Hegemon… it was hard to say if it was a ‘good’ thing or a
‘bad’ thing for Hawkfang. After becoming a Hegemon, he had
quickly reached Hegemony in five other Daos. His speed of advancement
was so shockingly fast that it had amazed the entire Sithe race! Even
the highest ranking members of the Sithe paid close attention to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Later
on, the Dawn War began! Hawkfang’s father, as an Exalt, was
required to lead the Sithe forces into battle! Hawkfang insisted on
accompanying his father into battle. As one of the most favored Sithe
descendants, he had a somewhat special status, and so the highest
level Sithe reluctantly agreed to his request. However, they only
agreed to let him send his avatar, as they knew the war would be so
fierce that Hawkfang could very well die in it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
entire Sithe race was eagerly awaiting an Autarch arising from within
the ranks of their children!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">During
the war, Hawkfang’s avatar accompanied his father in battling
against the cultivators. He saw many things… and slowly, he began
to realize the truth!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
imbeciles! Can’t you feel it? Can’t you sense the difference
between you and the Sithe? It was this vast Chaosverse which gave
birth to you, nurtured you, supported you! The primordial chaos of
this universe accepts you but rejects the Sithe, because the Sithe
are foreign invaders and enemies. You are helping your own enemies!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
are cultivators! Why do you willingly serve the Sithe?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Bolin had charged towards them, roaring with accusation and fury.
Hawkfang had long ago suspected the truth… and on that day, he
became certain of it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fang,
my son.” His father had sought him out that day. “We’re quite
unlucky to have run into one of the cultivator Autarchs so soon.
We’re going to die today. I’ll destroy your avatar to ensure that
this Autarch won’t be able to kill you. Every single one of his
strikes is filled with the binding power of karma. If he kills you,
he’ll use karma to destroy your true body as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Father…
I am a cultivator, not a Sithe. Right?” Hawkfang asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was looking through Hawkfang’s memories and could see through
Hawkfang’s eyes. He saw the look on the face of Hawkfang’s
father… and that look shook even Ning’s own heart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hawkfang’s
father had fallen silent for a moment. He then looked at his son, his
eyes filled with mixed emotions. Heartache, love, worry, hope…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">These
were the pure emotions a dying father would feel when gazing at his
son.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hawkfang’s
father had then said softly, “I might as well tell you. I was bound
by oaths not to reveal this to you, but now you already know the
truth. I… I didn’t have a choice. I had to take part in this war
and just hope for the best. You don’t have a choice either. The two
of us, father and son… we certainly share a sorry fate.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
Hawkfang’s father had said these words, his eyes had become filled
with resentment. He had then let out a sigh: “If you can become an
Autarch, the Sithe wouldn’t dare to mistreat you. You’d be
considered one of their important thugs… but if you fail to make
that breakthrough and remain a mere Hegemon, you wouldn’t even be
considered a thug, just a disposable pawn. I was able to protect you,
but I’m going to die soon. I won’t be able to protect you any
longer. If you ever have the chance… flee. Escape and go to the
cultivator civilizations.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hawkfang
had been stunned. He never would have imagined that his father would
tell him to go flee to the cultivators.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.
We’re out of time.” Hawkfang’s father had then reached out and
pressed his hand against Hawkfang’s chest, destroying Hawkfang’s
avatar with one blow... and that was the last memory Hawkfang had of
his father.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
end result of that battle… was Autarch Bolin exterminating the
entire squad led by Hawkfang’s father.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Eventually,
the Dawn War came to an end. Hawkfang continued to live within the
Sacred Realm inside the hidden dimension. At first, the Sithe
continued to pay close attention to him… but the shadow that had
been cast over his heart made it so that he would be unable to
cleanse his Dao-heart of all flaws.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
was a cultivator, but he was also a descendant of the Sithe. If the
Sithe had treated him with sincerity, he wouldn’t feel so torn…
but in reality, he now knew that they were nothing more than cannon
fodder and pawns. Even if he worked extremely hard and became an
Autarch, he’d be viewed as nothing more than a useful thug.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">What
was the point of cultivating?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">And…
he was forever unable to forget his father’s final words: “I
didn’t have a choice. I had to take part in this war and just hope
for the best. You don’t have a choice either. The two of us, father
and son… we certainly share a sorry fate.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">These
words tore at his heart. Ever since his mother had died due to her
lifespan coming to an end, his father had become the person who he
cared about above all others. His father, in turn, had cherished him
and loved him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Only
when he heard those words did he realize how miserably unhappy his
father had been. His father had the exalted title of ‘Exalt’, but
he had been given no choices either. He had only come to take part in
this war because he had to, and his fate had been left up to luck.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Sithe...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“SITHE!!!!”
Hawkfang began to feel hatred towards the Sithe race, which treated
both himself and his father as disposable pawns. This hatred cast a
shadow over his heart, preventing him from perfecting his Dao-heart.
He knew that he had to become more powerful and become an Autarch, as
it would give him a better chance of escaping and taking revenge upon
the Sithe… but he could no longer perfect his Dao-heart. In fact,
he couldn’t improve at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
no longer being able to progress on the path of cultivation, Hawkfang
eventually began to give up on his hopes of Autarchy. However, he
then came up with another idea for taking revenge upon the Sithe!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
knew that the Sithe had long ago transmitted nine special techniques
to their descendants, wanting to make cultivation easier for them.
These techniques allowed divine power and Immortal energy to be
merged together, theoretically ensuring that even Daolords would no
longer face mortal danger as they took their various steps. Even if
you failed in the Daomerge, you would be able to quickly recover and
then attempt it again! This was the reason why the Sithe were able to
produce so many Hegemons, Emperors, and Exalts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sithe continuously improved as they created these nine techniques,
with the ninth being much better than the first. But in the end? Even
the ninth and ultimate technique remained flawed. It only allowed for
one to become a Daolord of the First Step, at which point the body
would crumble and the truesoul would vanish.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can sense that these techniques are somewhat rejected by the natural
‘Dao’ of this Chaosverse. If I can retrofit them, I should be
able to produce something better.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">True
Sithe were unable to sense or make use of the Dao of this Chaosverse…
but Hawkfang could!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was absolutely incredible that the Sithe Lord of Chaos was able to
create a technique which would allow a local cultivator to safely
become a Daolord, even though the Lord of Chaos himself was unable to
sense the Dao here. Hawkfang had personally viewed all nine of the
techniques in the past, and he had watched as the almighty Sithe Lord
of Chaos had slowly improved and perfected them. Hawkfang had gained
many new insights as he had watched… and so, he had chosen to make
use of those insights into creating his own techniques.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had felt certain that all nine Sithe techniques contained
fundamental, foundational errors. The only reason why those errors
weren’t apparent early on was because when one was weak, there was
a great deal of margin for error.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">For
example, consider mortal cultivators. ‘Foundation level’, ‘Golden
Core level’, ‘Nascent Soul level’… ‘Mortal-ranked’,
‘Earth-ranked’, ‘Heaven-ranked’… ‘Wanxiang Adept’,
‘Primal Daoist’, ‘Void level’… all sorts of techniques and
styles could be used, because the weaker you were the less of an
impact the Chaosverse’s Dao would have upon you. But the closer to
the peak you were, the more demanding the Dao would become.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hawkfang
himself was able to sense the Dao of this Chaosverse. He borrowed
some of the technical tricks and ideas used by the nine special
techniques, then began to recreate them in his own image, devising
the [Mortal Chapter], [Fiendgod Chapter], [World Chapter], [Daolord
Chapter], and [Deathless Chapter].</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
became the technique which he named the [Five Truncheon Chapters].
The reason why he called it the [Five Truncheon Chapters] was because
his father’s favorite magic treasure had been a wooden truncheon.
As a child, Hawkfang had loved to play around with that truncheon,
and so his father had given it to him. Hawkfang had always carried it
by his side, and it became a symbol of the love he bore for his
father.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_42_Chapter_013__The"></A>
Chapter 13: Deathless</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Five Truncheon Chapters, Chapter 13 – Deathless</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hawkfang
had created this technique in order to take revenge upon the Sithe.
He wanted to take revenge for both his father’s sake and his own
sake, and for the sake of the countless deceived Sithe descendants!
They were viewed as disposable cannon fodder by the true Sithe, while
even his father had been forced to take part in the war.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
two of us, father and son… we certainly share a sorry fate.”
These words continued to stab against Hawkfang’s heart like knives.
He would never be able to forget that look on his father’s face.
This was why he needed revenge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
wanted to create this technique, then find a way to deliver it to the
cultivators! He felt certain that the cultivators would be able to
use it to dramatically increase in power, producing many new Hegemons
and even new Autarchs. That way, the Sithe would be defeated.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
of course, if the Sithe found out that he was creating this
technique, he would be doomed! Thus, he had carried out all of his
experiments upon the beings who resided within his own
estate-treasure. As a Hegemon, he had many estate-treasures which
were filled with countless living beings. He had these beings test
out his cultivation techniques, and many ended up dying due to errors
in the technique. He had tested them time and time again, then remade
them repeatedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
talent was put to full effect here. He quickly mastered the [Mortal
Chapter] and the [Fiendgod Chapter]. The first was comparable to
pre-Celestial Tribulation levels of the Three Realms, while the
second included everything post-tribulation to the Elder
God/Ancestral Immortal level.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
it was different from the way in which the nine techniques operated,
it was successful and had a similar effect to Ning’s own
azureflower seal technique.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
[World Chapter] covered World Gods and Chaos Immortals. It was
clearly far more difficult, and it took him a great deal of time…
but in the end, he succeeded once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
[Daolord Chapter], however, was even more difficult. It must be
remembered that even the finest of the nine special techniques only
allowed for cultivators to safely train to the World level. Once one
became a Daolord of the First Step, the body would crumble apart and
the truesoul would be destroyed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hawkfang
spent untold aeons working on the [Daolord Chapter], and to this very
day he was still working on it. Alas, he had only been able to
successfully complete the parts for Daolords of the First Step and
Daolords of the Second Step. He hadn’t been able to succeed for the
third or fourth steps!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Due
to being stymied by the [Daolord Chapter], he had turned his
attention to the [Deathless Chapter] instead. The [Deathless Chapter]
was meant to allow Daolords who had failed in the Daomerge to halt
and reverse the crumbling of the truesoul, allowing them to then
attempt the Daomerge once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
nine of the Sithe techniques were also focused on recovering from a
failed Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mortal
cultivators who reach a certain level can be reborn from a single
drop of blood. Upon reaching the ‘Fiendgod’ level, they will not
die so long as their truesoul remains unharmed. However… if there
was a way which would allow a shattered truesoul, the very core of a
person’s being, to be repaired after already breaking apart? That
would represent true deathlessness. The only thing which could end
one’s life would be when the invisible laws that govern everyone’s
maximum lifespan in a Chaosverse took effect.” And so, Hawkfang had
focused his efforts on the [Deathless Chapter].</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
allowed the Daolords residing in his estate-treasures who had failed
the Daomerge to test out this technique. He had gone so far as to
recruit many disciples in the Sacred Realm. After those Daolord
disciples failed the Daomerge, he would have them go into his
estate-treasure and test out the [Deathless Chapter]… but of
course, he would have them swear oaths not to divulge this to anyone
else.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had refined the [Deathless Chapter] over and over again, but to this
very day, it remained a failure! Clearly, it was almost completely
impossible to allow a Daolord who had failed the Daomerge to repair
his crumbling truesoul.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thus,
only the first three chapters of the [Five Truncheon Chapters] were
complete. The [Daolord Chapter] and the [Deathless Chapter] were both
flawed and imperfect… but in truth, both were significantly
superior to the nine unique techniques the Sithe had developed. It
wasn’t that Hawkfang was more talented than the Sithe Lord of
Chaos; rather, it was that he was able to use those nine techniques
as a reference, and was also able to sense the Dao of this
Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
the Sithe Lord of Chaos was also able to sense the Dao of this
Chaosverse, he probably would’ve been able to easily create a
perfect technique which would allow someone to train all the way to
the Autarch level.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was extremely excited, especially after reviewing the [Deathless
Chapter]. As Ning reviewed the technique, he couldn’t help but get
the feeling that there were certain similarities to the mysteries of
the Nine Chaos Seals which Autarch Awakener had created.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was like a brand new door had appeared in front of Ning, one which
allowed limitless possibilities in a brand new world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sithe Lord of Chaos was at such an extremely high level of insight
that he was able to create these nine techniques just based on
guesswork and prediction. He had overhauled them and repeatedly
perfected them, but they remained flawed. This, however, was because
his understanding of the nature of this Chaosverse’s Dao was
limited. If the Dao had operated in the manner he had believed it to
operate, the nine techniques would’ve been perfect. Alas, the Dao
was different and so the nine techniques were unusable. Hawkfang,
however, had managed to use them to create his own [Deathless
Chapter].</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can see hope. There are many ways we can continue to improve the
[Deathless Chapter].” Ning was different form Hawkfang. He was the
master of the Eternal Omega Sword Dao, on par with Autarchs in terms
of insight. He had reached an incredibly high level of understanding
into the Dao, which was why he was able to reach Hegemony in so many
Daos with such ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
the path to perfecting it will be a long one. If I let Hawkfang do
it, he probably wouldn’t succeed even if he was given ten times as
much time as he already had.” Autarch Awakener had attempted to
complete this path, but he had approached it from a different angle.
He had been able to reach an extremely deep level of mastery in his
approach, which was why Ning was certain that the [Deathless Chapter]
held many flaws.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However…
it was a different approach that would provide many new inspirations.
In addition, he was able to see a complete ‘structure’ to the
[Deathless Chapter].</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
experiences of Autarch Awakener, combined with the mysteries of the
[Deathless Chapter]… if I fused them together and then worked hard
on improving them, I might be able to create a perfect technique in
my remaining years which would allow my crumbling truesoul to
recover.” Ning instantly grew excited. If he could heal his
truesoul… then if he attempted the Daomerge again, he would
instantly become an Eternal Emperor because he was already the master
of the Eternal Omega Sword Dao!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
of course… he would first have to create a new technique which
would allow the truesoul to become deathless and everlasting.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can definitely succeed. I will definitely succeed!” Ning was filled
with anticipation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Prior
to acquiring the [Deathless Chapter], Ning had felt that his chances
of creating such a ‘Truesoul Everlasting’ technique to be
virtually negligible. Now, however? Hope blazed in front of him like
a radiant sun. It was still a distant goal, but it was bright enough
to illuminate the path in front of it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Titanos and the others had felt that there was no hope because they
didn’t even know what path to begin embarking on! The [Deathless
Chapter], however, was based off the nine special techniques and so
it provided an overall framework and ‘path’, even though this
path was filled with many pitfalls and dead ends. This was why the
Sithe had forced anyone who ever learned the nine techniques to swear
lifeblood oaths not to divulge it to anyone else.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
were afraid that the nine techniques would be disseminated to the
cultivators, accelerating their research efforts into this same
field.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hawkfang,
I truly have to thank you.” Ning stared at Hawkfang, who was still
in a dazed and illusion-bound state in front of him, then smiled.
After completely reviewing Hawkfang’s memories, Ning felt that this
trip to this hidden dimension had been completely worth it!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Awaken,”
Ning murmured softly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hawkfang
trembled slightly. Moments later, his eyes regained their usual
clarity. He looked at Ning, blinked, and then smiled slightly.
“Daolord Darknorth, was I in an illusion just now?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.”
Ning nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You’ve
already reviewed my memories?” Hawkfang asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hawkfang
continued, “I’ve always felt quite torn between the Sithe and the
cultivators. The blood in my veins belongs to the Sithe and comes
from my father! And yet, I am indeed a local cultivator myself. Life
has been quite agonizing… but one thing is certain. I hate the
Sithe! I hate them for forcing my father into war, and hate them for
sending all of us, their children, to our deaths. Now you have my
[Five Truncheon Chapters], a technique I poured my heart and soul
into. In the end, I still wasn’t able to truly complete them.
However… after you cultivators acquire them, I’m certain that
you’ll be able to create a perfect technique.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you,” Ning said. “The entire cultivator civilization owes you
thanks, and I owe you more than anyone else.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You?”
Hawkfang blinked, then laughed. “Do you thank me because you have
failed the Daomerge? But creating a ‘Truesoul Everlasting’
technique will be extremely difficult. This is the hardest part of
the entire set, Daolord Darknorth! You are incredibly talented, but
you don’t have much time left, while perfecting the technique will
be extremely difficult. The Autarchs weren’t able to accomplish it,
while I was only able to do what I did thanks to having studied those
nine unique techniques. Even though you’ll be able to learn from
what I created… I’m afraid that it’ll still take you a million
or even tens of millions of chaos cycles before you are able to
succeed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“At
least I can give it a shot before I die.” Ning smiled. “If I
succeed, I’ll be able to keep living.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hawkfang
smiled as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Is
there anything you want from me?” Ning asked. “I’ll do anything
which is within my power.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
don’t need much. If you do win, take away all of the descendants
from my homeland and give them a safe, remote location which will be
far away from the terrifying clash of civilizations. I’ll find a
quiet place for myself and live out a peaceful life.” Hawkfang
smiled. “But of course, that’s only if you win. If you lose, all
of this talk will have been for nothing.”</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Five Truncheon Chapters, Chapter 14 – Before the Battle</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
Ji Ning had already acquired the technique he was searching for, the
[Five Truncheon Chapters], he still continued flipping through the
memories of all the other Hegemons and Emperors he had captured. He
wanted to try and find more Sithe secrets that might be of help to
the cultivators.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
a full year concluded, Ning once more flew towards the Sacred
Mountains…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
coming.” Exalt Bowenya stared from afar, his gaze ice-cold.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth has already appeared. We cannot shirk back from this fight.
Our only options are to win glory for ourselves by killing Daolord
Darknorth… or dying in battle.” Jonnbach was standing outside the
Iceland Elder Hall, radiating the desire to do battle. Behind him
were nearly four hundred Hegemons and Emperors, the vast majority of
whom were all true Sithe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Do
you want to die?” Jonnbech’s voice was placid, but it echoed
throughout the hall. The true Sithe and the Sithe descendants were
all silent, but their eyes were filled with berserk looks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Good.
Let’s begin.” Accompanying Jonnbech’s orders, the towering
Iceland Elder Hall began to shake and rumble as it broke free from
its own foundation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-robed Ning was soaring through the skies towards them. Now, the
vast Iceland Elder Hall was soaring into the air as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“At
most, they’ll force me to waste a bit of extra time.” Thanks to
his Illusion Sword Dao, Ning would be able to win this fight quite
easily. None of them could see through his illusions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
Sword Dao Domain was able cover an area of over a billion kilometers,
and this entire area would be transformed into an illusory realm!
Wide-range attacks could hit him, but they would be weak enough that
Ning could just hide inside his treasures and defend against them
with ease. Focused attacks were powerful, but there was no way they
would be able to locate the true Ning within this region of a billion
kilometers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
I had already mastered the Illusion Sword Dao while I was fighting in
Purgatory, I wouldn’t have needed to use my Storm Sword Dao to
evade those attacks when fighting that first castle. The Illusion
Sword Dao would’ve been enough to make it impossible for my
opponents to locate me, much less stop me. Same with that spacetime
formation; I still would’ve been trapped, but the Illusion Sword
Dao would’ve made it impossible for them to injure me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
couldn’t help but sigh. During the battle in the spacetime
formation, he had sacrificed many precious treasures and had to
strike eighteen times before he was able to escape. What a waste! If
he had already mastered the Illusion Sword Dao, he could’ve relaxed
within the confines of that formation. His opponents wouldn’t have
been able to touch him!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Alas,
Ning had no idea back then that the Illusion Sword Dao would prove to
be so effective. It was of very little use against other
Autarch-level experts, after all… but against hordes of weaker
Emperors and Hegemons? It was absolutely crushing! They wouldn’t
even be able to locate him, much less strike him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is nearly time.” Ning sipped from a glass of wine as he stared
outside of the star-treasure he was in towards the approaching
Iceland Elder Hall.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
it seems as though we stand a good chance at escaping,”
Azurefiend’s avatar said excitedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Flameland Elder Hall and the Iceland Elder Hall both voluntarily
abandoned their foundations in order to attack me. That’s why they
aren’t that dangerous. But the remaining Daoguard Tower which is
owned by Exalt Bowenya… now that is a different story.” Ning
shook his head. “The central control mechanisms for this entire
hidden dimension are located within that Daoguard Tower, which means
I have to actually go inside it. The danger level inside a Daoguard
Tower is completely different.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
have to be careful, Master,” Azurefiend’s avatar said. The more
time he spent with Ning, the more admiration he felt, especially when
he saw how almost nothing could shake Ning’s Dao-heart and how calm
Ning was in the face of even the greatest of dangers. Azurefiend
himself was not capable of this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!
Kill Daolord Darknorth! Kill him and we’ll be rewarded heavily.
Even if we die, we’ll be revived through spacetime inversion and
then be graced with many gifts! If we can’t kill him, at least we
can tire him out a bit. Next, Exalt Bowenya will personally deal with
him! So long as the Exalt succeeds, we’ll still be brought back.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“ATTACK!”
Jonnbech howled. His only hope was to render enough merits to the
Sithe that he would be revived via spacetime inversion… because he
knew that they were definitely going to die during this battle
against this terrifying Daolord.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!”
All the Hegemons and Emperors charged forwards madly, including both
the true Sithe and the Sithe descendants. If they charged and
attacked, at least they would have a tiny chance at surviving this.
Anyone who dared to try and flee would be put to death in accordance
to Sithe laws, never to be revived again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
clearly know that they have no chance against me. They are like
mantises waving their arms in front of a cart and seeking to stop it,
but they still show no signs of fear at all.” Ning couldn’t help
but feel a slight sense of trepidation when he gazed upon the
hundreds of berserk Hegemons and Emperors. “Hawkfang’s memories
indicate that even Sithe Exalts like his father were all forced to
take part in this war. Life amongst the Sithe certainly is brutal.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning used the power of his Illusion Sword Dao against the rampaging
Hegemons who were charging towards him as the battle began.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the final Elder Hall, the brightest one of the three. The blue-robed,
blue-haired Bowenya was standing there, calmly watching the battle
from afar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
didn’t care about the deaths of the Hegemons and the Emperors. He
only cared about one thing… success!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
they die, they die. So long as we can kill Daolord Darknorth and
swallow up his truesoul, I’ll have rendered the greatest merit
anyone has accomplished since our invasion into this Chaosverse! I’ll
be given true freedom, and many other gifts as well.” Exalt Bowenya
stared intently at the distant white-robed youth. “This is in
accordance with the rules which our leader personally wrote down.
There’s no way he would go back on his word.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
have to kill him.” Bowenya’s eyes were filled with savagery as
well. Hawkfang? Jonnbech? Even if they died… even if this entire
hidden dimension was destroyed… he wouldn’t care one bit! The
only thing which mattered was killing Ning and then swallowing up his
truesoul.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">According
to what their leader had said, the higher your status and the more
karmic luck you had, the more the Quintessence of the Chaosverse
would dote upon you! The person before Bowenya was the first master
of an Eternal Omega Sword Dao this Chaosverse had ever seen. Even
though he had failed his Daomerge, he would remain beloved by this
Chaosverse and would be blessed with tremendous karmic luck and
tremendous power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Similarly,
during the era of the Three Realms, its most talented experts such as
Nuwa and Ning would all be blessed and reinforced by the power of the
Three Realms. The same was true for the Chaosverse as a whole. The
most talented denizens of the Chaosverse would be blessed with
tremendous karmic luck. This was true for both the Autarchs and Ning!
If any of them were slain and their truesouls devoured, it would be a
tremendous blow to this Chaosverse as a whole!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
Ning had died under ordinary circumstances, such as his truesoul
naturally dissipating, then his truesoul fragments would make their
way back into the prime essences of the Chaosverse. But if he was
killed by the Sithe, then had his truesoul fragments devoured in
accordance with those secret Sithe truesoul-swallowing techniques,
there would be no way for his truesoul fragments to go back to this
Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was why Bowenya had to kill Ning, rather than just trap him and let
him slowly die a normal death. And… killing Ning would be an even
greater accomplishment than killing an ordinary Autarch!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was because the Sithe leadership knew that while ordinary Autarchs
were unable to improve any further, those who were in control of an
Eternal Omega Dao could very well take that final step and become an
Omega Autarch, resulting in a new Lord of Chaos being born. The Sithe
would stop at nothing to kill Ning! Even though he had failed his
Daomerge, they would still be worried that someone as brilliant as
him might be able to come up with a way to devise a ‘Truesoul
Everlasting’ technique.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
sooner they killed him, the better.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
capturing Jonnbech and the others, Ning inspected all of their
memories. However, the only unexpected surprises came from Jonnbech
himself. Jonnbech actually had a perfect Dao-heart, and so the
illusions formed from the Sword Dao Domain were not enough to control
his mind. Ning was forced to use some of his own power and use a
secret art in order to draw Jonnbech into an illusion, then rifle
through his memories.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was quite delighted by what he found. Jonnbech, as someone who had a
perfect Dao-heart, was a very high-ranking Sithe. He was far more
important than the vast majority of Hegemons, and was given the best
resources in the hope that he would become an Exalt! As a result, he
had viewed many different techniques which were meant to aid Hegemons
in breaking through to Autarchy. Some required lifeblood oaths to be
sworn not to divulge them to outsiders, while others Jonnbech had
found on his own. The latter didn’t require any oaths, and so Ning
managed to uncover quite a few techniques which not even Autarch
Titanos or Autarch Awakener had been able to acquire.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is an unexpected surprise. And… it seems that Jonnbech’s home
truly had many powerful experts within it.” Ning found quite a few
memories pertaining to the Sithe Chaosverse as well. There, the
‘Exalts’ were truly Autarchs in power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
of course, there were differences in power amongst the Autarchs as
well. Some reached Autarchy as Heartforce Cultivators, while others
reached Autarchy through the Dao of the Sword, the Dao of Spacetime,
the Dao of Space, and more. Some reached Autarchy through the Dao of
Metal, while other reached Autarchy through the Dao of the Five
Elements.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Different
Daos would result in different levels of power. Those who reached
Autarchy via the Dao of Space, for example, would be a bit weaker
than those who reached Autarchy via the Dao of Spacetime. In turn,
those who reached Autarchy via the Dao of the Five Elements would be
even more powerful.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Alas,
all memories pertaining to the secrets of the Omega Daos were sealed
by lifeblood oaths. Even so, Ning’s horizons were considerably
expanded. He actually gained new insights into his own path of
cultivation as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
don’t have enough time as a cultivator of the Dao of the Sword.
Reaching Autarchy via my Omega Sword Dao before my truesoul crumbles
is nothing more than a vain dream. I don’t have nearly enough time;
in fact, I probably won’t even be able to finish my Karma Sword
Dao! I need to focus all of my efforts on creating the ‘Truesoul
Everlasting’ technique.”</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Five Truncheon Chapters, Chapter 15 – Deadlock</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Crunch.
Crunch. Clack!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
a gorge inside the Sacred Realm. Ji Ning was standing next to the
Iceland Elder Hall, using his Sword Dao Domain to break it apart and
deconstruct it. The Iceland Elder Hall was devoid of all power, and
so he was able to break it apart quite quickly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth, why are you wasting time breaking apart a useless Daoguard
Tower? Is it perhaps because of how pathetically impoverished all you
cultivators are? During the last war we fought against you
cultivators, your kind did the same thing in frantically scavenging
for any scraps you could find.” The heavens echoed with a cold,
mocking laugh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
in no rush,” Ning murmured calmly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.
Then go ahead and keep on breaking it apart,” the icy voice replied
coldly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">That
was exactly what Ning did. He continued to break the Daoguard Tower
apart piece-by-piece, and he carefully scrutinized every inch of it.
This was the first time he had a chance to inspect an Exalt-class
Daoguard Tower up close! His next action was to enter Exalt Bowenya’s
Elder Hall. Given that all Daoguard Towers shared certain
commonalities in construction, deconstructing and inspecting this one
was a form of preparation for him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
the saying goes, if you knew yourself and knew your enemies, you
would be blessed with victory in all of your battles. The
deconstruction of the Iceland Elder Hall was part of Ning efforts to
know his enemies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
pity that the Flameland Elder Hall was virtually annihilated,” Ning
mused to himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Twenty-six
days went past in the blink of an eye before Ning had finally
finished carefully tearing apart the entire Iceland Elder Hall.
During this process, he had also discovered a strange beast which had
been slumbering deep within a prison inside the tower. Ning had used
his Sword Dao Domain to pick up the sleeping beast, toss it far away,
and then use illusions to mask his own location.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for what happened once the beast woke up? Ning really didn’t give a
damn.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had considered drawing it away into his own estate-world, but the
creature was too overwhelmingly powerful. Ordinary estate-worlds
wouldn’t be able to contain its might! It would probably be able to
tear through Ning’s estate-worlds with ease. Yes, some of the Sithe
treasures Ning had might be able to contain it, but Ning didn’t
want to go through the trouble of doing so. An insane beast was of
little value to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hm.”
Ning stood within that empty gorge, the Iceland Elder Hall having
been completely deconstructed and then put away within an
estate-world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Exalt-class
Daoguard Towers truly are marvelously built up. They require an
utterly inconceivable amount of expertise with regards to
manipulating space and time. I wager that the blueprints for
Exalt-class Daoguard Towers were created by the Sithe Lord of Chaos.”
Ning was secretly shocked by what he had found. The Iceland Elder
Hall had been devoid of all power, and so many of its powerful
functions had become inert and hidden… and yet, Ning was still able
to see how incredibly powerful and complex it was based on how it had
been created.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
what should I do? Given my current level of power, if I actually
tried to barge my way inside one of these things, my chances would be
quite low.” Ning was quite worried. He had never entered a Daoguard
Tower before! Now, however, if he wanted to leave this place he would
have to pass through the center of this hidden dimension… and that
center was located within that Daoguard Tower! He had to enter it…
but if he did, he would be in incredible danger.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
transformed into a streak of light as he quickly flew towards that
final remaining Elder Hall.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Exalt
Bowenya stood within that Elder Hall, staring intently at the streak
of light flying towards him. He murmured softly, “He’s coming.
Good. My only fear was that you wouldn’t come.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
hint of a cold smile appeared on Bowenya’s face. “Get ready,
everyone. Once Daolord Darknorth enters the tower, you’ll be
responsible for manning your stations and killing him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”
The hundreds of Hegemons and Emperors were all ready for this. Some
were berserk, some were filled with hate, and some were filled with
desire for glory. They had already sacrificed far too much to kill
this terrifying Daolord.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The distant Ning suddenly landed on the peak of a mountain less than
a billion kilometers away from the tower. A wine-laden table appeared
in front of him as he sat down in the lotus position.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Bowenya was flabbergasted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
isn’t he coming?” The Hegemons and Emperors behind him all grew
worried.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Bowenya.”
Between mouthfuls of food and wine, Ning chuckled: “Did you really
take me for a fool? This is an Exalt-class Daoguard Tower which has
you, an Exalt, in command. You also have hundreds of Hegemons serving
as your deathsworn! I’m not so bored with life as to go barging
into your Daoguard Tower.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
what are you saying?” Bowenya’s voice rang out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
much. I’m simply not planning to go inside, that’s all,” Ning
said. “Even if I do end up dying, you can forget about swallowing
away my truesoul fragments.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
knew that if he died at the hands of the Sithe, his truesoul would be
devoured instead of returning to the prime essences of the
Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Bowenya
blinked, while the Hegemons and Emperors behind him grew anxious.
“Exalt, what should we do?” “If he doesn’t come in, what can
we do? He’s too powerful. He managed to deal with both of the
previous Elder Halls when they moved to attack him!” “Right,
w-what should we do?” They were all panicked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Exalt
Bowenya barked, “Shut up!” Instantly, the Elder Hall fell silent.
He then frowned and stared at the distant Ning, then said in a cold
voice: “Daolord Darknorth! I admire you for your strength. If I
fought you in solo combat, I would probably be defeated by you with
ease. I have no chance of defeating you if I exit this tower.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
failed my Daomerge. My truesoul has been crumbling this entire time.”
Ning sat at the peak of that distant mountain, sipping his wine and
smiling. “You are still a Sithe Exalt, after all. It won’t be
easy for me to kill you, and my lifespan will be dramatically
lessened by battling you. Perhaps my truesoul will crumble to the
point of collapsing during our battle, in which case you would have
won. If you fight, you stand a chance at winning.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
I come out and fight you, I have a greater-than 90% chance of dying,”
Bowenya said. “and you, Daolord Darknorth, must know that although
killing me won’t be easy due to how tough my body is, capturing me
would be much simpler. Hmph. I’ve encountered Omega Emperors before
in my own homeland.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
raised an eyebrow. It was true. Killing Bowenya would be fairly
difficult, as his body and truesoul were both on the Autarch level!
It was only because he was a foreign invader that this Chaosverse
rejected him and suppressed his power to the level of the Blazesun
Ruler. To kill him would take many blows… but simply capturing him
would be easier. Ning had already mastered the Space Sword Dao; he
could use a blow to wrap Exalt Bowenya within layers of space and
then imprison him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had many different Sword Daos. The Space Sword Dao would be the
easiest one for capturing Bowenya.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
why I won’t go out and fight you,” Bowneya continued. “Either
you come inside, or I’ll just watch you die from afar.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Watch
me die? Then you won’t have the chance to be rewarded for this.”
Ning smirked. “You prepared so many plots to kill me, all for the
sake of exhausting me and slaying me so you can swallow up my
truesoul. If I just die naturally, you won’t get my truesoul.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
life is more valuable than any reward. The rewards for killing you
are great enough that I would be willing to risk my life if I felt my
chances were good… but given how slim my chances would be, I won’t
be so foolish as to go out and fight you. You are indeed very
powerful; my only chance lies in battling within the Daoguard Tower,”
Bowenya said. “You were able to use your illusions to defeat the
many other traps and treasures I threw your way. Now, only my
Daoguard Tower remains. If you come inside, I’ll battle you to the
death. If you do not, you can just die outside.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Bowenya
remained quite calm and focused. He cared intensely about staying
alive. He could calmly, emotionlessly watch as over 2,800 Hegemons
and Emperors perished, including Hawkfang and Jonnbech, but himself?
He wasn’t going to throw his life away. He would rather abandon his
chance at glory than to risk himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning transformed into a streak of light and flew towards the Daoguard
Tower.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
coming.” Bowenya and the others began to grow excited. The gates to
this Elder Hall were wide open. Ning was on par with the Autarchs in
power; to him, whether or not the gates were open was really
meaningless. He could simply teleport inside even a completely
sealed-off castle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
quickly flew next to the Elder Hall. He stared upwards at the
towering, twelve-story tower, then reached out with his right hand
and gently pressed it against against the surface of the Daoguard
Tower. The surface felt rather cool to the touch. Thanks to his
mastery over the Metal Sword Dao and the Earth Sword Dao, Ning could
sense some of the internal underpinnings of the tower without even
having to enter it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“As
I expected, the most dangerous part of an Exalt-class Daoguard Tower
lies in the Dao of Spacetime.” Ning secretly frowned. When he had
torn apart the Iceland Elder Hall, he had come to this conclusion. He
was hoping that perhaps Exalt Bowenya’s Daoguard Tower was
different… but in truth, the situation was essentially the same.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Daoguard Tower looked like a single entity, but it was actually
composed of many different spacetime continuums that were fitted
together in extremely marvelous ways. This required an extreme level
of mastery of the Dao of Spacetime. If Ning entered, he would need to
traverse a veritable maze of spacetime continuums and would probably
die midway through.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
I also managed to master the Time Sword Dao and then merged it
together with my Space Sword Dao into the Spacetime Sword Dao, I
would be completely confident in my chances,” Ning mused.
“Unfortunately, it took me thousands of chaos cycles just to master
the Space Sword Dao. The Time Sword Dao is even more difficult. It
will probably take me over ten thousand chaos cycles.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had spend the majority of his three thousand chaos cycles of
wandering on the Space Sword Dao, which was why he had been able to
master it after entering the Sithelands.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Space Sword Dao was more difficult than all five of the Five Elements
Sword Daos combined. The Time Sword Dao was even more difficult than
that!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
don’t have enough time, but if I go inside while simply relying on
the Space Sword Dao, I’m not sure I’ll make it out again.” Ning
hesitated.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_42_Chapter_016__The"></A>
Chapter 16: Charging Into the Elder Hall</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the end, Ji Ning elected to begin silently training in the Spacetime
Sword Dao atop that mountain peak within the Sacred Mountains.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
training AGAIN?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
Daolord Darknorth is…!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Bowenya
and the others were so angry, their teeth hurt. Unfortunately, they
wouldn’t dare to actually charge out and attack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had long ago mastered his Space Sword Dao and had reached Hegemony in
both the Dao of Space and the Dao of Time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Spacetime Sword Dao…” Ning silently visualized how it could be
manifested. Twenty-six chaos cycles went past without him even
realizing it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Finally,
Ning opened his eyes and shook his head slightly. He had made
significant improvements at first, but now he had reached a major
bottleneck and was stuck. He was far from being able to succeed in
this Dao, which would most likely take tens of thousands of chaos
cycles. He couldn’t waste all of his time here. The ‘Truesoul
Everlasting’ technique was even more important.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
true body only has six hundred chaos cycles of life left. I have no
chance of mastering the Spacetime Sword Dao.” Ning rose to his
feet, his eyes flashing sharply. “Then I suppose I’ll just have
to take the risk and try to find a chance for myself.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
turned to stare at the distant, towering Elder Hall. “Twenty-six
chaos cycles have gone past, but Exalt Bowenya refuses to come out.
He’s quite steadfast.” If the Exalt came out, he would almost
certainly be defeated. Bowenya cared immensely about his own life;
why would he come out?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
coming! He’s coming!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
headed our way.” Bowenya and the others had been forced to watch as
Ning had trained for multiple chaos cycles. Now, Ning was coming for
them once more, but this time they didn’t feel too worried.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
see what this Daolord is planning to do,” Bowenya said calmly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh.
Ning reached the Elder Hall, then rested his hand against its outer
surface. Moments later, he silently blinked past its outer shell and
entered it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
came inside!!!” Exalt Bowenya’s eyes bulged out in shock. Moments
later, they became filled with wild joy as he ordered, “All
Hegemons and Emperors, prepare to follow my previous instructions!
Stand guard over your stations and attack Daolord Darknorth. Worsen
his injuries and make sure he dies within my Daoguard Tower!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
Exalt!” The response came from throughout the Daoguard Tower.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ahahaha…
Daolord Darknorth, you actually dared to come inside, eh? Even your
Autarchs would probably be trapped for an extremely long period of
time if they dared to enter my Daoguard Tower. You? A Daolord who
failed the Daomerge? Haha… you’ll definitely die!” Bowenya was
filled with confidence. He immediately turned and strode into the
air, then vanished without a trace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the very center of the Daoguard Tower was a dark and secluded region.
This region was filled with an enormous millstone-like formation-base
which was slowly swiveling at all times. It emanated ripples of
spacetime, and Bowenya was standing atop it. This was the center of
the Daoguard Tower, and the main control mechanism for this entire
hidden dimension.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
time… I, Bowenya, shall have accomplished something incredible for
the Sithe! I’ll be able to truly transcend my service and gain
freedom. Daolord Darknorth, you are going to die!” Bowenya stared
towards countless globe-shaped illusions that were in front of him.
One of the many globes was displaying a white-robed youth who bore a
black sheath on his back – Ji Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
many globe-shaped illusions represented the true shape of this
Daoguard Tower. It was a spacetime maze!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
blinking into the Daoguard Tower, Ning saw a brand new world appear
before him. He was within a dark-red cave that was merely a million
kilometers in size. This region was covered with countless flowing
runes that brimmed with fiery energy. There was nothing within this
region save for Ning himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Up,
down, left, right, forwards, backwards…” Ning stood there in
midair, scanning his surroundings. He could vaguely sense that this
region was connected to six other spacetime continuums.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
doesn’t seem to matter which direction I choose.” At Ning’s
level, his premonitions were extremely accurate. In truth, these
‘senses’ were a reflection of the whispers of the Chaosverse
itself. Ning truly was blessed and doted upon by the prime essences
of the Chaosverse, and so his senses were extremely keen. Even here
in a spacetime maze, his senses would help tell him which was the
best path to take.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
suddenly, all of the mystic runes within this region of one million
kilometers began to flare up, producing dark-red flames that swarmed
the region as they flew towards Ning. Ning was surrounded by his
Sword Dao Domain, but the flames were omnipresent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
powerful flames.” Ning drew a Northbow sword. Sword-light spun out
as he poured his divine power into his sword, using the Earth Sword
Dao. It formed a triple layer of rippling yellow energy which
surrounded him and protected him. The flames blazed away against him,
but the earthen yellow energy simple rippled slightly while managing
to endure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Of
Ning’s many Daos, the Earth Sword Dao was the best suited for
dealing with these corrosive dark-red flames. However, its power
would quickly be used up at an alarming rate. Most likely, it would
be consumed within ten seconds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“These
flames are incredibly powerful. I imagine even the Blazesun Ruler
would be roasted to death by them.” Ning quickly began to inspect
this spacetime continuum in detail. However, it took him three
strikes with his sword to defend against the flames before he was
able to locate the critical points to this spacetime continuum.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Ning began to furiously attack using his Space Sword Dao. His
first sword scissored through space like paper, doing the groundwork
necessary to allow his second sword to tear through this spacetime
continuum.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
A giant gaping hole in spacetime appeared. Ning immediately darted
into it, then stared at the void before him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
raised his head to glance at the ‘skies’. These spacetime
continuums all seemed to be globe-shaped, and the spacetime globes
were all linked together. There were dimensional seams between them
as well, and Ning was within one of those seams. As he flew through
the seams, he carefully inspected the area around him, but in the end
was only able to discover a total of four spacetime continuums.
Everything else was completely blocked off by these four.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
if I wish to advance, I have to enter one of these four?” Ning
hesitated. Suddenly… crack! A bolt of lightning shot out from one
of the nearby spacetime continuums, striking towards Ning and forcing
him to use his Lightning Sword Dao to defend.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth, even if you don’t enter my maze you’ll still die,” a
cold voice rang out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
quickly understood that Hegemons were using treasures within the
Daoguard Tower to assault him! If he entered one of the continuums,
he would have to face the dangers inherent to each continuum. If he
remained outside, he would be ambushed and assaulted by the Hegemons
and Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
glanced at the spacetime around him. “What a formidable formation.”
Swoosh! Ning drilled into one of the spacetime continuums, flying
inside. The spacetime membrane didn’t block his path, allowing him
to enter with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
particular continuum was one filled with a boundless howling wind
which felt as sharp as daggers. The wind cut everything within the
continuum to ribbons, and Ning was forced to use his Water Sword Dao
to defend.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Danger
was everywhere. Death was omnipresent. Ning’s only choice was to
defend while searching for ways to defeat the mechanisms inherent to
each continuum! It must be remembered that within this spacetime
maze, every single spacetime continuum contained a powerful offensive
formation. As a result, they weren’t exceptionally stable. These
Daoguard Towers weren’t built to trap foes; if trapping the foe was
the goal, the Sacred Realm and Purgatory was more than enough. They
existed to actively kill enemies!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Alas,
they were invaders into this Chaosverse. As a result, Sithe Daoguard
Towers were only able to draw upon the energy provided by the local
generator they had set up. There was a limit to how much power they
could draw. Back in their own homeland, they could draw upon the
power of the entire Chaosverse. Only then would they be at peak
power! Every single spacetime continuum would become dramatically
more powerful. Even Autarchs would be attritioned to death.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for now? It would be hard for this Daoguard Tower to slay an Autarch,
but it could certainly trap one for an extended period of time. As
for killing a Daolord whose lifespan was limited… Bowenya felt
certain that it would be quite easy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
one here.” Ning broke out of another spacetime continuum, following
his premonitions and advancing without hesitation towards a brand-new
continuum.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
senses wouldn’t deceive him. This was definitely the path which led
him closest to where he needed to go. If he followed this path, he
would definitely be able to reach the core of this Daoguard Tower!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hahaha!
Daolord Darknorth, if my count is correct, you’ve already attacked
more than fifty times.” Exalt Bowenya’s voice echoed within this
mist-filled continuum. “As expected of the first master of an
Eternal Omega Dao in this Chaosverse. You truly are impressive, and
your senses truly are sharp! Even in a spacetime maze, you are able
to find the best path available.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
completely ignored him, choosing to instead focus on analyzing the
new region he was in. He wanted to find the center of this tower,
then assault it with all his power. His strikes against it would be
far more effective than his strikes anywhere else; two or three
strikes would be enough to grant him escape.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
even if you can find the best path, it’ll be of no use. You’ll
die of exhaustion before you ever reach it.” Exalt Bowenya roared
with laughter. “Let me tell you a little secret. You are still at
the outer edges of the spacetime maze. You aren’t even close to me
yet!”</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Five Truncheon Chapters, Chapter 17 – The Epiphany Within the
Spacetime Maze</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning did in fact feel anxious. He could sense that although he had
indeed chosen the quickest path, the journey before him would be a
long one and he would need to traverse over a thousand different
spacetime continuums.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had to strike at least four or five times within each spacetime
continuum to break free. Some cost him seven or eight strikes! He had
only been fighting for a short while but had already struck over
fifty times. This was rapidly depleting his lifespan! Although Ning
had expected that this would be dangerous, there was nothing he could
do upon being trapped within the spacetime maze.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
didn’t have to use full power on each strike, but I really don’t
have many strikes left in me. My truesoul is crumbling faster and
faster now. I can’t predict when the final collapse will come.”
Ning was worried. More and more cracks had appeared upon his
truesoul, hastening the day when it all came crashing down. These
cracks were accumulating at an alarming rate!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
lifespan was rapidly decreasing, but he didn’t slow down in the
slightest. He wouldn’t give up until the last moment came.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Drip.
Drip. Drip. Ning was within a world of rain. His sword-light cut a
hole into the world, allowing him to flee this spacetime continuum.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had always been charging forwards fearlessly, but suddenly he came to
a halt and turned backwards to look into the rain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">For
some strange reason… perhaps because he knew he was about to die…
when Ning saw the rain, he couldn’t help but think back to his
father and mother. His father had personally taught him the [Raindrop
Sutra] sword-arts. Later on, Ning had then understood the True
Meaning of the Raindrop and embarked upon the path of the Dao…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The giant gaping hole behind him began to rapidly close as spacetime
reached out to merge together and seal the breach. The hole began to
shrink in size, and he was able to see less and less of the rain
behind him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly,
Ning’s entire body froze. When he saw how spacetime reached out to
‘heal’ that wound, he suddenly had the feeling that spacetime had
a type of life and vitality of its own, as though it was a living
being that was struggling to grow, develop, and heal.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Spacetime.”
Ning stood there, an epiphany going off in his mind that illuminated
his thoughts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Exalt
Bowenya frowned from his position at the very center of the Daoguard
Tower as he stared at the small, illusory figure who stood within one
of many illusory globes before him. “Why did Daolord Darknorth
suddenly come to a halt in the dimensional seams? Hmph. Does he
really think he’ll last longer if he doesn’t go into the next
spacetime continuum?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fuze,
attack Daolord Darknorth,” Exalt Bowenya instructed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”
Upon hearing the order, a Sithe Emperor who was lying in wait within
the dimensional seams of the spacetime maze immediately prepared to
launch an attack with the treasures within the Daoguard tower that
had been assigned to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was in the middle of a prajna-state of epiphany. When you were weak,
you might be unable to control yourself upon entering such a state.
In fact, you might even forget the entire world around you, including
any danger you were in.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning,
however, had reached an Autarch’s level of insight. Even though he
was in a prajna-state, he was able to remain somewhat aware of his
surroundings.. He first accelerated time by 100x around him, then
carefully continued his meditations.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Not
just him; even the black-robed Primaltwin in the outside world had
also entered a prajna-state.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swish!
A streak of black wind howled straight towards Ning. The meditating
Ning was able to divert a bit of his attention to dealing with it,
using the Water Sword Dao to form a curtain of water which protected
and surrounded him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
still not leaving?” Exalt Bowenya was able to watch everything from
afar. When he saw that Ning remained within the dimensional seams, he
immediately ordered: “Continue. Do not stop! Since he has chosen to
remain within the seams, bombard him with attacks until he dies.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
black wind attacked again and again, but Ning continued to stand
there without moving. If he entered a new spacetime continuum, he
would have to deal with incessant attacks which would come from every
direction. This black wind, however, was only able to attack roughly
once every five seconds. Each time Ning used his sword-arts, he would
be able to defend for roughly twenty seconds! During this period of
time, Ning kept himself at an 100x temporal rate while continuing to
maintain his prajna-state.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
continued to flow on. After Ning executed the eighteenth stance from
his sword-arts, his eyes suddenly lit up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Spacetime
is alive and sentient in its own way. So this is the Spacetime Sword
Dao!” Ning’s heart was filled with joy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
he had been forced to just sit in the outside world and quietly
ponder the mysteries of spacetime, it truly would have taken him over
ten thousand chaos cycles to understand all of this! But he was in a
life-and-death state in a region where spacetime had been manipulated
to an unbelievable degree. Thanks to his mastery of the Space Sword
Dao and the many insights it had brought, Ning had also come to
understand some of the mysteries behind this spacetime maze, which
had been developed by the Sithe Lord of Chaos and was incredibly
profound and abstruse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
of this had resulted in Ning entering a prajna-state, and in doing so
he had shattered through all the obstacles in his path, allowing him
to break through to the next level. Oftentimes, aeons of normal
cultivation wouldn’t be as effective as a single moment of
epiphany.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
had been a long, long time since Ning had entered a prajna-state.
Generally speaking, the higher a level of insight you reached, the
harder it would be for you to truly enter such a state. Back when he
was young and living in the Three Realms, he had entered this state
on multiple occasions. However, ever since he had become the
incredible Daolord Darknorth, master of the Eternal Omega Sword Dao,
he had never entered this type of state again. Although he gained the
occasional insight, those were not true epiphanies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
this time… Ning had a true epiphany!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
seems that I, Darknorth, am not destined to die in this place. Nor
are Mistress and the others.” Ning revealed a smile, unable to
disguise his excitement. If the Paragon of Pills had truly died here,
he would forever feel ashamed of himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
suddenly flew into one of the nearby spacetime continuums.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
thought he’d just stay there for quite some time.” Exalt Bowenya
smiled coldly. “This is my Daoguard Tower and my spacetime maze. He
can do nothing save passively endure attacks from within my spacetime
continuums, and in the end he shall die.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the new spacetime continuum. Everything was blurry and indistinct in
this region, but the air was filled with many flowing runes that
brimmed with electric power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
raised his head to glance at the runes. Given his mastery over the
Spacetime Sword Dao, a single glance was all it took for him to
discover the secrets behind how the lightning formation was connected
to this spacetime continuum.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
Ning’s Sword Dao Domain spread out, quickly covering every inch of
this spacetime continuum. It even reached out to penetrate spacetime
itself, disrupting the lightning runes and bringing the power flowing
through them to a sluggish halt. Both the lightning formation and the
spacetime continuum were disrupted, making it extremely difficult for
them to draw upon the power of the Daoguard Tower and then release
it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Previously,
Ning’s only choice was to passively endure the hits while searching
for the critical points in each continuum, then breaking through
them. This time, he had twisted spacetime itself to disrupt the local
formations. This was a testament to how much control over spacetime
the Spacetime Sword Dao granted him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
spacetime continuum…” Ning inspected it carefully. He was able to
instantly see that there were a total of 360 nodes here, but it would
take him time and careful analysis to figure out a way to break
through them without using any of his own power at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth… what have you done? What have you done?!” Exalt
Bowenya’s enraged and panicked voice rang out from far away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">How
could he not be angry? He was in control of the entire Daoguard
Tower, and as a result he could instantly sense that the spacetime
continuum Ning was in was now unable to draw upon the power of his
Daoguard Tower and no longer attacked Ning!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">How
had this happened? Why did the attacks come to halt? He didn’t
understand!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Could
it be that he is incredibly talented in the Dao of Formations and was
able to deconstruct the lightning formation?” Exalt Bowenya was
puzzled. “But these are all top-tier formations. Even Autarchs
would find it extremely hard to breach them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
of course, he had no idea that Ning hadn’t actually deconstructed
the formation itself; rather, he had severed the connection between
the formation and the local spacetime continuum. Now that the
formation was severed from its power source, it was naturally unable
to launch any attacks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth!” Exalt Bowenya shouted repeatedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
completely ignored the Exalt’s rants as he continued to carefully
analyze the local spacetime continuum. There were now fewer and fewer
runes before him, awaiting his analysis. He was already able to
merely use his Sword Dao Domain to deconstruct this spacetime
continuum, but he continued his studies because he wanted to learn
how to best deconstruct the other continuums as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
of these spacetime continuums had to share certain commonalities. The
more he researched one of them, the easier it would be for him to
understand the others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Finally,
however, Exalt Bowenya was no longer able to hold back. “Destroy!”
Whoosh. The spacetime continuum Ning was in finally began to break
apart. Exalt Bowenya was in complete control over this entire
spacetime maze, and as a result was able to create and destroy new
spacetime continuums as he saw fit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning blinked, then chuckled. “Exalt Bowenya… since you are so
impatient, I’ll hurry it up a little. I’ll be seeing you soon.”
As he spoke he began to fly forwards, expanding his Sword Dao Domain
as he flew. His domain quickly expanded to the point where it pushed
against the surrounding spacetime continuums, which Ning glanced at
with a relaxed smile on his face. “Every continuum within this
spacetime maze is pretty much constructed in the same manner.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Just
two seconds later, Ning had completely taken over and destroyed the
five spacetime continuums around him, while his Sword Dao Domain
expanded to an even greater size.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_42_Chapter_018__The"></A>
Chapter 18: Iyerre</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
Exalt Bowenya saw this, he felt as though a bucket of cold ice had
just been dumped over his head. He was completely stunned, shaken,
and stupefied.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
a Sithe Exalt, he instantly knew what the scene in front of him
represented! Daolord Darknorth had been surrounded by five spacetime
continuums, but he had been able to simultaneously destroy all five
of them in two seconds. Clearly, the spacetime maze was no longer any
danger to him at all, as he was able to easily see through the
mysteries of spacetime they employed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
finished.” Exalt Bowenya’s face turned ugly. “Thankfully, I
still have a bit of time left. The closest path to me will still
require him to pass nearly a thousand spacetime continuums. It’ll
take him a while to get here.” Bowenya began to frantically
consider what options were available to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Obey
my orders!” Exalt Bowenya immediately began to issue new orders:
“All Hegemons and Emperors, attack Daolord Darknorth’s position
with everything you have. I’ll give you his exact location.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”
The various Hegemons and Emperors all acknowledged his orders. As for
Exalt Bowenya, he took control over some of the Daoguard Tower’s
treasures and used them to assault Ning, who was still surrounded by
countless spacetime continuums.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Now
that the spacetime maze was no longer of any threat to Ning,
Bowenya’s only choice was to use his Emperors and the Daoguard
Tower’s own treasures to attack him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Whoosh! Slash! All sorts of attacks rained down upon Ning from every
direction, passing through various spacetime continuums. Exalt
Bowenya remained in full control of spacetime here, and thus he was
able to make it so that the various continuums allowed attacks to
pass through them without impediment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
stood there without moving, his Sword Dao Domain active around him.
He was able to use it to sense how spacetime was operating around
him, and in doing so he was able to quickly dissolve the various
continuums his domain touched. This time, he was actually a bit
faster than previously. Every single continuum was deconstructed with
ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">What
he needed to do was to get a clear picture of how each of the
continuums operated. Upon doing so, he would be able to deconstruct
them!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning suddenly felt a premonition that dangerous attacks were raining
down towards him from every direction. “What’s with all these
attacks?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Hegemons and Emperors were all scattered throughout the Daoguard
Tower, which was why prior to this Ning had only had to deal with a
single attack each time. Now that Exalt Bowenya had abandoned using
the spacetime maze to trap Ning, all of the Emperors were attacking
at the same time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Some
were so very far away that their attacks had to fly through spacetime
for an extremely long period of time before reaching Ning, who was
able to use his Illusion Sword Dao to dodge the vast majority of
them. The only ones which were dangerous were the ones coming from
nearby Hegemons and Emperors who were attacking from close range. The
ones who were just ten or twenty million kilometers away were
especially dangerous.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning was forced to use his Water Sword Dao to defend. His Sword Dao
Domain was currently only able to expand to a maximum of eight
million kilometers, and so these attacks were able to easily saturate
this entire region with attacks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Pop!
Pop! More surrounding spacetime continuums were destroyed, with Ning
continuing to deconstruct them faster and faster.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth!” A voice rang out from afar. “I know that we are going
to lose this battle. My only request is that you spare the countless
mortals who live within our homeland. Give them a chance to survive!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Boundless,
how dare you betray me! Attack! Attack and kill Daolord Darknorth!”
Exalt Bowenya screamed frantically.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Boundless…
why even bother with him?” Angry, desperate, and grief-filled
voices rang out. These came from the other Hegemons and Emperors
within the Daoguard Tower, and the rain of attacks pouring down upon
Ning began to slow down.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Pop!
Pop! Pop! Just four seconds later, Ning was able to destroy four more
continuums towards his left. He instantly saw the Hegemon known as
‘boundless’ who was controlling treasures from the dimensional
seam beyond those continuums. He was looking at Ning, a pleading look
in his eyes… and his aura was rapidly weakening.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
truesoul was breaking apart. Even his body began to break apart and
decompose.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
must be remembered that these Hegemons and Emperors had all sworn
lifeblood oaths to obey Exalt Bowenya’s orders! Exalt Bowenya had
ordered all of them them to attack Ning. If they were perhaps a bit
slow while they attacked or took it easy on Ning, that would be one
thing… but if they suddenly and completely halted all of their
attacks, that would constitute a violation of orders and therefore a
violation of their oaths. They would be punished for it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
had all sworn oaths with extremely heavy consequences. As a result,
every strand of truesoul within Boundless’ body was breaking apart,
as his body itself began to crumble and break apart as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Boundless.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Boundless.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Many
voices rang out. Quite a few of the Hegemons and Emperors present
were Sithe descendants, and they all felt grief. Clearly, Hegemon
Boundless had many friends amongst their ranks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
gazed at Hegemon Boundless, who continued to stare at Ning with a
pleading expression even as his body broke apart. Ning couldn’t
help but let out a sigh. Why?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sithe descendants… they felt much more love and attachment towards
this hidden dimension than the true Sithe did, as this was the place
they were born and bred. They had lived here for countless aeons, and
they were willing to die for the sake of their homes. Now that they
had no further hopes of defeating Ning in battle, their only choice
was to beg him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“When
I captured the other Hegemons and Emperors, I promised long ago that
I would not destroy your homeland. There’s no need for you to
worry.” Ning’s voice echoed throughout the Daoguard Tower as he
continue to destroy the spacetime continuums surrounding him. By now,
it took him less than a second for each ‘cycle’ of destruction.
Ning could as easily deconstruct nine or ten continuums
simultaneously as he could two or three. There was no real
difference. Anything he could ‘see’ through his Sword Dao Domain,
he could deconstruct.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Farewell,
Brother Boundless.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Boundless.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Some
of the Emperors and Hegemons began to dramatically slow down their
attack rates. They were bound by their oaths to continue attacking,
but now they were just doing the bare minimum necessary.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
Sword Dao Domain continued to expand, reaching ten million
kilometers, twenty million kilometers, and more. It gradually began
to encompass some of the nearby Hegemons and Emperors, who Ning
captured and transferred into his estate-world. Almost none of the
descendants fought back; in fact, most were quite calm. The true
Sithe, however, resisted fiercely, unwilling to give up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
could sense the deep feelings the Sithe descendants had towards their
home. This caused him to feel a sense of admiration towards them, but
it also increased his distaste of Bowenya. Bowenya truly didn’t
treat these people as living beings at all!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
the Sword Dao Domain continued to rapidly expand in every direction,
destroying more and more spacetime continuums as Ning moved closer to
the heart of the Daoguard Tower.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the dark room inside the heart of the Daoguard Tower. The giant
formation-base millstone continued to slowly swivel, and next to it
were three other formation-base millstones of varying sizes which
were swiveling slightly faster and the big one.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Bowenya
flew over to the smallest millstone. This one was merely three meters
long and it was semi-translucent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Focus.”
Bowenya took control over that millstone, pouring the power of his
Daoguard Tower inside it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
a pillar of blurry light instantly appeared above the
semi-translucent millstone. The pillar of light slowly began to
resonate with another distant location. Finally, a blurry humanoid
figure began to appear in the middle of the light. The figure slowly
began to solidify further, resolving into a barefoot, gray-robed man
who had a benevolent smile on his face, one which seemed to whisper
of the pity he felt for the plight of mortals. He was dressed in
loose robes and was balding, but his body was extremely muscular. His
eyes contained a strange, irresistible magnetism, as though anyone
who stared into his eyes would be forever trapped within them. Not
even Exalt Bowenya would dare to stare this man in the eye.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Almighty
Iyerre!” Exalt Bowenya bowed reverently.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
respect he showed came from every fiber of his being. He was like a
servant in the presence of the master.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Bowenya,
why have you contacted me directly?” The tall, balding, barefoot
Iyerre cast his gaze across spacetime to stare at Bowenya. Bowenya
felt both embarrassed and terrified, and as a result his voice became
even more respectful: “Almighty Iyerre, I have discovered that this
Chaosverse has given birth to a Daolord who controls an Eternal Omega
Dao.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“An
Eternal Omega Dao? Yes, I’ve heard of this as well. His name is
‘Daolord Darknorth’, I believe. His name has been spread
throughout this entire Chaosverse. My servants have notified me of
this long ago,” Iyerre said calmly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
is currently within the dimension I control. In fact, he’s right
here inside my Daoguard Tower!” Bowenya said hurriedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre’s
eyes suddenly shone with dazzling light. He wanted very much to kill
Daolord Darknorth, but he knew that the man would be able to summon
Autarchs to assist him. Killing him anywhere in this Chaosverse would
be extremely difficult. Iyerre was the supreme commander of the Sithe
forces here, and his goal was to take over this entire Chaosverse. It
was important that the local cultivators not even know of his
existence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thus,
all high-ranking Sithe had been forced to swear oaths not to divulge
his presence! As a result, neither Ning nor the Autarchs even knew of
Iyerre’s existence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Have
you killed him?” Iyerre asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
have not. He’s already solved my spacetime maze and will reach the
heart of my Daoguard Tower soon,” Bowenya said hurriedly. “I’m
no match for him at all.”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_42_Chapter_019__The"></A>
Chapter 19: Descent</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
solved the spacetime maze?” Iyerre hesitated slightly, then said in
a calm voice, “I’ll send an Apocalypse-class servitor over.
Remember, you must not reveal any traces of my existence.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
hidden weapon was only effective when it remained hidden. Once his
presence was revealed, the cultivators would be on their guard
against him, which would drastically weaken the impact he might have.
During the previous Dawn War, Iyerre could tell that the situation
was unfavorable for them. Even if he led his forces in a final
attack, they would at most be able to cause the cultivators to suffer
heavy losses. Victory would still elude them… and so he instead
chose to hide, waiting for a better opportunity.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
was a very patient man! There was no way he would be willing to risk
exposing himself merely to kill Daolord Darknorth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
understand,” Bowenya said respectfully. Sharp light flickered in
his eyes. He had sacrificed too much in his efforts to kill this
damnable Daolord Darknorth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“An
Apocalypse-class servitor… hmph. Those are some of the most
powerful servants under almighty Iyerre’s control.” Bowenya was
filled with eagerness. “This time, we’ll definitely be able to
kill you, even if we have to simply attrition you to death.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had previously used an ‘Apocalypse-class’ castle and formation
against Ning. In truth, Apocalypse-class simply represented an
overall level of power. Apocalypse-class servitors, however, were
actual living beings. Every single attack they launched was
comparable to the power of an Apocalypse-class treasure, making them
far more deadly than the treasures themselves.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Deep
within the spacetime maze. Ning stood there at the center of the
maze, his Sword Dao Domain continuing to furiously expand as he
‘popped’ the various spacetime continuums and destroyed them.
Each continuum was only able to last a single second in the face of
Ning’s might, and just a short while later his Sword Dao Domain had
already stretched out to encompass a hundred million kilometers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ve
lost.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
really can’t accept this.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Who
would’ve thought that after surviving the last great war in this
Chaosverse, we’d end up dying here?” The true Sithe Hegemons were
filled with despair as the Sword Dao Domain reached out to encompass
them. They were captured without being able to fight back at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
continued to furiously expand his Sword Dao Domain as he moved closer
and closer towards the center of the Daoguard Tower. Suddenly…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth, I’m truly impressed. You were actually able to solve my
spacetime maze. Not even my Daoguard Tower can suppress you! Heh.
Still… since I know that I’ve lost this battle, I’m not going
to stay here any longer. Before leaving, I’m going to give you one
final gift.” Bowenya’s voice rang out from afar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Exalt,
take us with you!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Exalt,
save us!” Instantly, some Hegemons and Emperors began to beg for
rescue. This hidden dimension was able to capture enemies from afar;
naturally, it was also able to allow Exalt Bowenya free passage in
escaping.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“As
far as Bowenya is concerned, his life is the only life that matters.
He won’t care about whether the rest of you survive or not, much
less whether this dimension will survive,” Ning said coldly as he
continued to furiously break apart the various spacetime continuums.
However, it would still take him hundreds of seconds to reach the
core of this tower. He simply didn’t have enough time to stop Exalt
Bowenya from leaving.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
final gift to you is the most terrifying of the many creatures which
have been kept suppressed within this hidden dimension. If you can
survive it, you’ll be able to leave this place. I, however, won’t
be staying to watch,” Bowenya called out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
a deep thrumming sound pervaded the entire Daoguard Tower as
dimensional ripples spread out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
left?” Ning was quickly able to ascertain that Exalt Bowenya had
indeed fled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damnit.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Bowenya!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Bowenya,
why couldn’t you take us with you?” Many Hegemons and Emperors
were cursing at him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the core of the Daoguard Tower. An enormous hand tore through space,
ripping open a dark dimensional tunnel that led straight to the core.
A giant tree suddenly came flying out from that dimensional tunnel!
This giant tree was covered with countless branches and leaves, and
the main trunk had a single giant eye on it. When it flew out of the
black passageway, it gave Bowenya a cold glance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Bowenya
said, “I’ll leave the rest up to you.” He quickly fled into the
dimensional tunnel.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
this Exalt-class Daoguard Tower did indeed hold other creatures
within it, those were all insane prisoners. How could he possibly
have an Apocalypse-class servitor with him? These powerful beings
always followed by Iyerre’s side.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mm.”
The giant tree grunted, watching as Bowenya disappeared within the
darkness of the tunnel. The tree was now in charge of protecting the
core of this entire Daoguard Tower, and it quickly took control of it
as the tunnel behind it vanished.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoooosh.
Its countless branches all stretched out, extending out of the
central room and towards the outside world as its countless branches
grew longer and thicker. It must be understood that this creature had
lived in the Infinite Void prior to being captured and tamed by
Iyerre. Its true form was as vast as any celestial object! Its
current form was just a miniaturized version of itself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
spacetime maze was quite enormous. Ning had only dealt with a small
portion of it. The branches quickly extended outside the Daoguard
Tower, then began to twist themselves around it. As soon as they
exited the Daoguard Tower, the branches began to rapidly expand in
size, with each branch coiling around the tower like a titanic
python. The entire Daoguard Tower was almost instantly surrounded by
a cocoon of countless leafy branches. The branches covered every
single inch of the Daoguard Tower in a tight embrace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Next,
the branches began to extend in every other direction, including both
the Sacred Mountains, the skies, and the depths of the earth. They
continued to furiously expand in size, snaking out longer and longer.
After just ten seconds, the branches had filled every inch of the
entire Sacred Realm, completely covering every inch of it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the Doaguard Tower. As soon as the giant tree completely covered the
Daoguard Hall, it began to attack Ning as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning turned pale. He could subconsciously sense that something
incredibly dangerous was happening. Moments later, a series of
enormous black branches shot through the air and entered the range of
his Sword Dao Domain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Illusion
Sword Dao!” Ning kept his illusory realm active, hiding the
location of his true body.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth, mm? Do you think you can hide from me?” A sonorous voice
boomed out as a large number of twisting veins appeared on the
surface of every single branch. The countless branches began to sweep
through every inch of the Sword Dao Domain. There were simply too
many of them, while Ning’s domain was merely a hundred million
kilometers in size. There was nowhere for him to hide.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break!”
The Northbow sword in Ning’s hand suddenly flashed with light.
Crack! Twelve branches were instantly severed by this blow. It seemed
as though this creature was actually more fragile than the other
creatures Ning had encountered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Still,
Ning’s face remained quite somber. There were simply too many of
these branching tendrils, and the ones he severed began to quickly
regrow.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Whoosh. The branches quickly managed to locate where Ning was, then
began to lash out at him with abandon. Each strike was just as
powerful as the strikes from the first beast Ning had encountered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">What
he didn’t know was that while this Apocalypse-class creature’s
attacks weren’t all that strong, it was extremely difficult to
actually get rid of and defeat. Iyerre had sent this servant because
it was a perfect counter for Ning, whose truesoul was already
crumbling away. The goal was to kill him through attrition.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
are too many branches. I can’t get rid of them.” Ning was forced
to strike eight times in a row, seeking to carve an escape path for
himself, but each time new branches would spring up to cover the ones
he had destroyed. Worse, Ning had the vague feeling that there were
even more branches waiting for their turn!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
could this Daoguard Tower have such an irritating creature within
it?” Ning’s face was grim. If he was an Autarch, he could
continue to attack with abandon, unleashing thousands of
full-strength blows in an extremely short period of time. But he
didn’t have much time or energy left. At most, he only had a few
dozen strikes left in him. There was no way he could escape at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! The branches continued to furiously rain blows upon Ning, who
was forced to use the Spacetime Sword Dao to create a tiny miniature
spacetime continuum which served as a form of armor which covered
him. This was his most powerful defensive technique thus far.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Focusing
on defense allowed him to conserve more energy. Attacking consumed it
far too quickly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Die!
DIE!” The countless branches lashed at him like a thousand whips,
furiously slamming against the spacetime armor covering Ning. They
attacked at such high speed that they were like countless leafy
blurs, and each strike was slightly stronger than a blow from the
Blazesun Ruler! Ning continued to fly about and dodge while letting
his armor absorb the blows, but just one second later he was forced
to once more use his sword-arts to recreate the armor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
divine power and Immortal energy was depleting at a fast pace, and
the cracks in his truesoul were growing larger and larger as the
crumbling process accelerated.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch
Mogg, hurry up and deconstruct this hidden dimension!” Ning felt
extremely anxious. “I’m not going to be able to hang on for much
longer.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had been just one step away from success. If he died here, that meant
the Paragon of Pills would die here as well! Ning truly couldn’t
accept this outcome.</P>

Chapter 20: The Autarchs Arrive</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
outside world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
were three figures located in the dark void outside this hidden
dimension. They were the black-robed Ji Ning, the bald, red-robed
avatar of Autarch Titanos, and the skinny, black-robed avatar of
Autarch Mogg.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
As Bowenya departed from this dimension and the tree-creature
arrived, a dimensional ripple suddenly spread outwards.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
spatial ripple!” Autarch Titanos revealed a look of delight, as did
the black-robed Ning. Both of them turned to look at Autarch Mogg.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
black-robed Ning said, “Bowenya probably fled out of the hidden
dimension.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Mogg’s azure eyes narrowed intently as he stared at the dimensional
ripples before him. He said softly, “Yes, I can sense a dimensional
tunnel… but it was opened in an extremely careful and intricate
way. The ripples are very minute.” The dimensional tunnel had not
actually opened up from within the hidden dimension itself. If it
had, the ripples would be far greater. This was a passageway created
from afar by Iyerre, and the ripples were very subdued as a result.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
being attacked by some sort of strange lifeform. It is incredibly
powerful, and I won’t be able to hold on for much longer,” Ning
blurted out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
moving as fast as I can,” Autarch Mogg said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Fifteen
seconds went by. “Found it!” Autarch Mogg’s eyes lit up. Those
ripples were minute, but he was still able to use them to lock onto
the location of that hidden dimension. Autarch Mogg was the Autarch
of the Space Daobirth Essence, after all, and he was in his own
Chaosverse. He had every factor on his side, and as a result he was
naturally able to locate that dimension.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hurry
up and open a path into it!” Autarch Titanos urged.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Autarch Mogg drew an extremely slender saber with his right hand,
then gave it a wave. Slash! The space before him was torn open as
easily as paper, producing a neat ‘wound’ in space. This slash
tore through multiple layers of different dimensional continuums,
reaching all the way towards the hidden dimension which Autarch Mogg
and located.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiiip!
The slash clashed against the tenacious exterior membrane protecting
the hidden continuum.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
it is.” Autarch Mogg blinked in surprise. “The membrane is quite
tough. BREAK!” Autarch Mogg instantly manifested a total of six
arms. Each of them was grasping an extremely long and slender blade,
and he leapt forwards to soar towards the membrane. Thousands of
beautiful flowers seemed to bloom before him, with each snowy-white
flower being formed from a slash of dimensional saber-light. Autarch
Mogg was definitely the paramount expert in chopping apart
dimensional membranes, and it took him just a single second to tear
through it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Impressive.”
Ning couldn’t help but sigh in amazement. He might have his Space
Sword Dao, but its power was still fundamentally that of the Dao of
the Sword; the Dao of Space was just a supporting Dao. There was no
way it could compare to Autarch Mogg’s ‘Space Daobirth Essence’.
Without question, Autarch Mogg’s mastery over space was superior to
all others within this Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
Autarch Titanos had to assault the dimensional membrane, he would’ve
been forced to tear through it by hammering it repeatedly through
brute-force attacks. Autarch Mogg was able to accomplish it much more
easily.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go inside!” Autarch Mogg led Ning into the hidden dimension. As
soon as the two avatars and the black-robed Ning entered it, they saw
the countless leafy tendrils which completely filled this entire
world. There were many places which were completely surrounded by
those countless branches! This sight caused even Autarch Mogg and
Autarch Titanos to reveal looks of surprise.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“DIE!”
When the great tree saw that outsiders had arrived, it instantly sent
countless tendrils sweeping towards them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
true body is right in the center of the Daoguard Tower,” Ning said
hurriedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Titanos,
you take care of Darknorth’s Primaltwin. I’ll go to the Daoguard
Tower,” Mogg said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Better
that we go together. Darknorth’s true body isn’t going to be able
to hold on much longer. Darknorth, go inside my estate-world for a
short while.” Autarch Titanos waved his hand, sending the
black-robed Ning into his estate-world. Ning didn’t try to resist
it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!”
The avatars of Autarch Mogg and Autarch Titanos drew their weapons
and began to fight. Thanks to their mastery over space and karma,
they were able to accurately sense the location of the Daoguard
Tower, and the two worked together to charge closer and closer
towards it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Whoosh! Whoosh! Autarch Mogg’s six slender sabers chopped through
everything within their path. His weapons were like dimensional
blades that could chop through all matter, and his strikes actually
extended out on a multidimensional level to continue cutting through
space itself. His attack speed was absolutely incredible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Die.”
Autarch Titanos was wearing a set of inky black gloves on all six of
his hands, and each glove unleashed boundless mystical power as he
struck out towards the opponent. Although his movements seemed much
more relaxed, each strike caused countless branches to decay and rot
away. In terms of raw damage, he vastly surpassed Autarch Mogg.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
creature has incredible vitality. Most of these creatures are unable
to take more than three palms from me.” Autarch Titanos frowned as
he realized how strong this creature’s vital force was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
two continued to advance at high speed, with black gloves
annihilating countless branches on one side and slender sabers
chopping through everything on the other. The tree was suffering more
and more injuries. It didn’t really care too much about Autarch
Mogg’s chops, because it could regrow the parts that had been
severed; Autarch Mogg’s attacks weren’t causing too much real
damage. Autarch Titanos’ karmic strikes, however, were assaulting
its very essence and causing it much more damage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
have to kill him.” The tree was under orders, and it began to fight
in an even more frenzied manner. It didn’t have much time left; it
had to kill Ning as soon as possible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the Daoguard Tower.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Countless
tough tendrils and branches were continuing to furiously rain blows
upon Ning, whose truesoul was crumbling at an extremely fast pace. In
order to conserve as much energy as possible, he didn’t launch any
counter-attacks and instead focused completely on defense.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
body was covered by a miniature spacetime cocoon which accompanied
him as he fled, dodged, and was occasionally knocked flying. Each
time he was struck, he didn’t try to resist the momentum, instead
borrowing from it to conserve as much of his own power as possible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
continued to flow on. Ning repeatedly used his sword-arts to defend,
but each time it resulted in his truesoul crumbling faster and
faster.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hurry
up… hurry up! I can’t hold on much longer.” Ning grew
increasingly desperate. “I have nothing left!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
An enormous explosion rang out. The countless branches within the
Daoguard Tower began to tremble as two figures charged inside the
tower.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No.
No! I have to kill this Daolord!” The great tree was already
heavily wounded, but it still had a considerable amount of power
left. It continued to rain attacks down against Ning while sending
many tendrils out to block the two intruders.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Boom! Saber-light flashed while black gloves struck out as Autarch
Mogg and Autarch Titanos unleashed the power of their Daos. In the
face of their attacks, these branches seemed unspeakably weak and
were destroyed on a large scale.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
snowy-white streak of saber-light suddenly flashed out, severing all
the branches and leaves within its path. Some of the branches which
were furiously assaulting Ning were severed as well, and Ning could
sense that the attacks against him had suddenly lessened. The
saber-light was followed by two consecutive strikes from the black
gloves, causing the surrounding branches to wither away and rot into
nothingness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
finally allowed himself to relax. He landed atop one of the undamaged
spacetime bubbles, then sat down and took a deep breath. “Whew.”
Ning smiled as he looked at Autarch Mogg and Autarch Titanos. “You
finally made it.” Ning laughed, and his laughter was very joyful.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
had finally succeeded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Titanos’ terrifying black gloves finally demolished the great
tree’s remaining life force. The Daoguard Tower was now completely
empty, with just a few remnants of the spacetime maze left behind as
well as some terrified Sithe. The great tree had not gone out of its
way to slay these Hegemons and Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
Autarch Titanos and Autarch Mogg both looked at Ning. They quickly
turned pale.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
truesoul was crumbling at an incredibly fast rate. It was now so
badly cracked that the truesoul itself was shuddering violently, as
though it was going to break apart at any moment. If Ning absolutely
had to, he might be able to unleash four or five strikes at most…
but even if he didn’t, the truesoul was still going to completely
crumble apart soon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“As
soon as my true body became trapped in here, I knew that my chances
of surviving would be slim. I’m happy that I was able to survive as
long as I did… and to tell the truth, I benefited greatly from my
experiences here,” Ning said with a smile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You…”
Autarch Titanos could sense that Ning’s truesoul suddenly began to
crumble many times faster than before. Clearly, it was about to
completely break apart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh.
Don’t be in a rush to kill these Hegemons and Emperors. Many of
them are Sithe descendants. They are quite pitiable,” Ning said
hurriedly.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_42_Chapter_021__The"></A>
Chapter 21: Glad You Are Safe</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
doesn’t really matter if we kill them or not. They’re nothing
more than foot soldiers,” Autarch Titanos said. “But if we don’t
kill them, I recommend that we at least imprison them. We shouldn’t
let them escape and reinforce the other Sithe.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
understand.” Ning smiled. “There’s something else I’ll need
to trouble you two with.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hm?”
Autarch Titanos and Autarch Mogg both looked at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Please
don’t tell the Paragon of Pills and the others about my true body
dying here,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Mogg and Autarch Titanos blinked. Autarch Titanos said with surprise,
“Don’t tell them? You came to the Sithelands for the sake of the
Paragon, I believe. They’ll probably be able to guess the truth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
hide it as best we can. Otherwise, they’ll feel guilty about this,”
Ning said with a smile. Suddenly, Ning’s gaze grew distant. He
murmured softly, “What an odd feeling. So this is what it feels
like for my truesoul to crumble…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
His truesoul completely fell apart. Ning could feel his mind and his
thoughts turn sluggish. The entire framework of his truesoul was
completely collapsing, like a cracked dike which was falling apart.
Countless truesoul fragments spread out in every direction at a pace
which was thousands of times faster than before.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">So
much of his truesoul was breaking apart that it was actually visible
to the naked eye. Countless specks of light flew out from Ning as his
divine power and Immortal energy both vanished as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Everything…
feels… slow. Going… back… to… Chaosverse?” Ning’s
sluggish mind could sense that an enormous, warm location was calling
towards him. This had to be the Quintessence of the Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly,
Ning’s seated figure lit up like a ball of fire, instantly
transforming into countless specks of light that blasted out in every
direction, leaving nothing behind. Ning’s body was completely gone.
The only things left were his clothes and magic treasures.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Titanos and Autarch Mogg simply watched silently.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
an estate-world. The black-robed Ning was silently standing on his
feet. The death of his true body had no impact on his Primaltwin at
all, as the two were completely different ‘lives’. His Primaltwin
would only perish if a powerful foe was able to use a karmic attack
to slay the true body and then follow the karmic connection between
the two to slay the Primaltwin as well! A normal dissipation,
however, wouldn’t result in any connected consequences. Ning’s
Primaltwin continued to slowly disintegrate, but it had yet to engage
in any combat since his Daomerge attempt and so the process was still
quite slow for it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
this is what it feels like for one’s truesoul to dissipate?” the
black-robed Ning murmured softly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
true body had died. If his Primaltwin was unable to devise the
‘Truesoul Everlasting’ technique, it would face the same fate. “I
have to seize this opportunity.” The black-robed Ning’s eyes were
shining with hope.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch
Titanos, let me out,” the black-robed Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the Daoguard Tower. Ning’s true body had dissipated, while the
black-robed Ning had appeared next to Autarch Titanos and Autarch
Mogg.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come.”
The black-robed Ning waved his hand, summoning his Northbow swords
and his other treasures to him. Moments later, his clothes
immediately changed as well, going from black to white as he sheathed
the Northbow swords on his back once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“From
this day forth… there is no ‘true body’ or ‘Primaltwin’;
just me,” Ning murmured softly. This was the only life he had.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break.”
Ning released his awesome Sword Dao Domain, instantly beginning to
destroy the few remaining spacetime bubbles of the maze that had
trapped him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
nearby Autarch Mogg chuckled. “Let me give you a hand.” As he
spoke, he unleashed an awesome wave of power that swept across the
entire region, instantly annihilating the continuum bubbles and
destroying them in just two seconds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Skyfeeder and Autarch Mogg were most likely superior to all others in
this Chaosverse when it came to solving spacetime mazes. One was the
master of the Time Daobirth Essence, while the other was the master
of the Space Daobirth Essence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">With
the various continuum bubbles destroyed, the Hegemons and Emperors
who had been scattered throughout the various seams were all
revealed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Some
of the Sithe descendants managed to remain quite calm, but the true
Sithe were driven to both rage and despair because they knew that
Ning would never spare them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth… you didn’t die?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is all your fault. Why did you have to come here?! We grew tired of
the war long ago and were enjoying a peaceful life in this dimension.
You had to come and ruin everything!” Some of the true Sithe were
howling angrily at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
fault?” Ning shook his head. “You know the secrets behind this
hidden dimension. Do you really think I would’ve been able to enter
on my own? Clearly, it was the controller of this hidden dimension,
Bowenya, who forcibly teleported me here.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
formerly-howling Sithe suddenly fell silent. Right. It had to have
been Bowenya who teleported Ning here… but he did so because he
wanted to render great merits to the Sithe and be rewarded for it.
This was on the standing instructions of the supreme Sithe leader.
Who could blame him?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
wanted to kill me, so I had to fight back,” Ning said. He then
expanded his Sword Dao Domain to cover all of the Hegemons and
Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Get
in here.” He instantly teleported them into his estate-world. Now,
the only figures left in the Daoguard Tower were the two Autarchs and
Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Next,
Ning willed the Paragon of Pills, Hegemon Tia, Hegemon Flameleft, and
Lord Annihilation to appear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
The Paragon and the others turned to look at the two Autarchs, both
of whom radiated auras of ineffable power, then at Ning. Ning’s
truesoul was clearly disintegrating at a very, very slow pace. They
all revealed looks of delight.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Respectful
greetings, Autarch!” All four of them bowed respectfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Titanos and Autarch Mogg both nodded slightly, but their gazes
flickered a little when they glanced at the Paragon of Pills, who
Ning clearly cared about deeply. It was for this woman’s sake that
Ning had lost his life.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
continued to maintain the illusory effect around his Sword Dao
Domain, ensuring so that his truesoul appeared to be crumbling faster
than it actually was. He didn’t wish for the Paragon of Pills and
the others to be able to see any flaws in his pretense.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
Primaltwin had never engaged in battle after the Daomerge, and so its
truesoul was crumbling at a pace which was slower than his true
body’s prior to his true body entering the Sithelands. This was an
obvious problem, and so Ning quickly masked it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
didn’t wish for the Paragon of Pills to feel too much guilt. He had
already accomplished his goal and saved her; there was no point in
making her feel guilty about it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
glad you are safe.” The Paragon of Pills was all smiles.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
knew that Daolord Darknorth would be able to defeat those Sithe with
ease!” Lord Annihilation said flatteringly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
was just lucky. I also have to thank these two Autarchs for managing
to get here in the nick of time. Otherwise, I would’ve been in
serious trouble,” Ning said. “Mistress, since you have realmships
you can head off on your own. I have a few things to discuss with the
Autarchs.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well.” The Paragon and the others all nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch
Mogg, please help send them outside the Sithelands,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
easy. Let’s leave this dimension first.” Autarch Mogg sent out a
powerful wave of dimensional might which captured all of them. Swish!
They instantly reappeared in the black void of space outside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
surprised look appeared on Ning’s face. “We left? As easy as
that?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“When
we broke into this place, I went ahead and bound the core of this
Daoguard Tower to myself. I can now control it with ease,” Autarch
Mogg said. “That’s why we were able to leave so easily.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
rest of you can be off now.” Autarch Mogg waved his hand, cutting
through space with ease. Riiiip! An iridescent dimensional tunnel
appeared before him, leading out of the Sithelands.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sithelands was quite a dangerous place, after all. Who knew what
would happen if they had to fly out? Given how strong the Paragon
was, once they made it outside the Sithelands they would definitely
be safe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
I really have to thank you for everything.” The Paragon looked at
Ning. She felt extremely grateful towards him. Not only had Ning
ensured that her three ‘brothers’ were brought back to life, he
had also helped her survive this place, allowing her to reunite with
them in person. She had no idea how she was supposed to repay him.
Thankfully, Ning didn’t suffer any serious injuries during their
time in this dangerous dimension. Otherwise, she truly would’ve
been wracked by guilt.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Off
with you. Shoo.” Ning smiled at her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Paragon of Pills and the others quickly entered the dimensional
tunnel and disappeared. Autarch Mogg and Autarch Titanos glanced at
each other, then sighed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clearly,
the Paragon of Pills had no idea that Ning’s true body had already
died within this hidden dimension. She would probably never know the
truth.</P>
