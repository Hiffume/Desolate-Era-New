had never been kind to Ji Ning. Wracked by illnesses and infirm his
entire life on Earth, Ning knew early on that he would die as a
teenager. What he didn’t know was that there really was such a
thing as life after death, and that the multiverse was a far larger
place than he thought. A lucky twist of fate (one of the few in
Ning’s life) meant that Ning was reborn into a world of Immortals
and monsters, of Ki Refiners and powerful Fiendgods, a world where
Dynasties lasted for millions of years. A world which is both
greater…and yet also smaller…than he ever could imagine. He would
have the opportunity to join them, and in this life, Ning swore to
himself, he would never let himself be weak again! The Era he was
born into was a Desolate one, but Ning would make it his era.

Chapter 1: Revival</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Vastheaven
Palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
a hidden estate-world, there were beautiful valleys filled with
fragrant flowers and birdsong. A golden-robed Ji Ning was seated in
the lotus position atop the grass, and in front of the grass before
him was a black-white piece of jade. This jade talisman was the
‘Lifeblood’ Dao-seal which Emperor Maniseal had once bestowed
upon Ning in order to curry favor with the Paragon of Pills. However,
it wasn’t one of his most valuable ones, as it was only able to
revive Samsara Daolords. Next to the piece of black-white jade was a
giant, mountain-sized pile of countless chaos jewels.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the exact instant when the distant Archon Silksnow slew Ji Ning…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
the black-white jade talisman instantly lit up with dazzling light.
The strand of truesoul which Ning had left behind in the talisman
slowly began to rebuild itself from the talisman’s energy, almost
like an infant gestating within his mother’s belly or like life
taking shape within an egg. Ning’s strand of truesoul slowly began
to recover and reform within that white-black jade talisman, and as
more of it recovered he slowly began to gain mental clarity as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Just
now, I was killed… and I could sense my consciousness descend into
infinite darkness. Now that I’ve come back… I feel as though I
have been brought back into endless light.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
experience of dying and coming back to life had truly and completely
stunned Ning. Ning instantly gained a fresh perspective on what the
nature of the Dao truly was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thruuuuum!
Ning’s consciousness instantly began to absorb energy from the
outside world. The many chaos jewels which his avatar had prepared
long ago were instantly activated and their energy was drawn into
Ning nonstop.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoooosh.
As Ning began to actively drawn in energy, his body quickly began to
reform around him as the black-white jade talisman disintegrated
soundlessly. The figure of a white-robed youth began to coalesce in
the empty air within the gorge, his body glowing with light and
looking rather ethereal. However, as more time passed his body
gradually began to grow increasingly solid. By the time he had
absorbed more than half of the mountain of chaos jewels, his aura was
completely restored and reserved once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-robed Ning descended from the skies, exchanging a glance with
the golden-robed Ning. Both had joyless looks on their faces; the
only expression they had was that of worry.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
true body was reformed thanks to the Dao-seal, but brother Ninedust…”
Ning was worried. “Archon Silksnow saw the Hegemon appear, but he
still chose to kill me no matter the cost. He probably went after the
treasures I left behind. Ninedust was hiding inside my estate-world.
I hope he doesn’t end up in Archon Silksnow’s hands.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
With but a thought, Ning exited from this estate-world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Outside
the estate-world was Ji Ning’s residence within Vastheaven Palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.”
The fiery-robed woman seated by herself atop a distant boulder
revealed a smile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Youji.”
Ning smiled back at her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
why has your true form returned?” Su Youji was quite surprised. She
had spent almost all of the past few years in Vastheaven Palace, but
she generally only saw the golden-robed avatar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
chuckled. “I got beaten back.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Who
was able to beat you, Master?” Su Youji didn’t believe it. Her
master was virtually invincible amongst Daolords, right?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
I’d rather not discuss such an embarrassing event in detail.
Where’s Pillsaint? Still making his pills?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
Pillsaint’s gone absolutely pill-crazy,” Su Youji said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly,
a spacetime ripple swept across the entire Vastheaven Palace. Su
Youji didn’t notice, but Ning revealed a nervous look on his face.
He was worried about Ninedust’s safety, and so he immediately bowed
respectfully in the direction of the ripple. “Greetings, Hegemon.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
pitch-black tear in spacetime appeared in front of Ning, followed by
a snow-robed, white-bearded old man with six horns on his head
emerging from it. When he saw Ning, he revealed a surprised look:
“Darknorth, you are actually still alive?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
Ning saw the Hegemon, he let out a sigh of relief. This was because
he could sense that his weapons and treasures were all on the
Hegemon; clearly, the Hegemon had picked them up for him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Long
ago, Hegemon, you arranged for me to enter that alternate universe. I
was fortunate enough to acquire a ‘Lifeblood’ Dao-seal forged by
Emperor Maniseal,” Ning said. “It was all thanks to that Dao-seal
that I was able to survive.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
Lifeblood Dao-seal from Maniseal?” Hegemon Brightshore nodded
slowly. “No wonder you survived. Maniseal is an extremely arrogant
and solitary figure; if you were able to attract his interest, you
must have had quite the experience.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
secretly muttered to himself. It had nothing to with him attracting
Maniseal’s interest; in fact, he had never even met Emperor
Maniseal! It was all because the man wanted to gain favor with the
Paragon of Pills. That was why he had bestowed the Dao-seal upon
Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh,
right. Here are your treasures.” Hegemon Brightseal waved his hand,
causing the six Northbow swords, the Hegemon armor, the estate-world,
and the many other treasures to fly towards Ning. The six Northbow
swords in particular began to shiver; clearly, they were extremely
excited upon seeing their master again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
waved his hand, accepting all of the treasures. Some he stored away
and some he wore. As fo the six Northbow swords, they re-entered the
sheath on his back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
finally relaxed after acquiring these treasures. He had only acquired
them after many dangerous adventures; if he lost them all, he really
would be heartbroken. Ning could also sense that the Ninedust
Sectlord was still safely within his estate-world. This caused Ning
to reveal a smile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you, Hegemon. These are the fruits from Crimsonwave Temple I
promised.” Ning immediately offered a jade green gourd which was
filled with all of the remaining fruits from Crimsonwave Temple.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
cannot accept this.” Hegemon Brightshore smiled and shook his head.
“You asked me to save your life, and if I had done so I would’ve
accepted these fruits. But… I was just a bit too slow, and Archon
Silksnow didn’t show any mercy even though I was there. I wasn’t
able to save you; you saved yourself thanks to that Dao-seal, coming
back to life. How can I accept?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“These
fruits are nothing more than a portion of the treasures I own,”
Ning said hurriedly. “Hegemon, you sent all of my treasures over to
me. They are very important, especially my lifeblood weapons!
Darknorth is filled with tremendous gratitude towards you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
failure is a failure.” Hegemon Brightshore shook his head. “I’m
not going to be greedy over the treasures of a young fellow like
yourself.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was rather speechless. Still, high-level figures generally had
exceptional levels of pride. Everyone had bottom lines they would not
cross without a very good reason! But of course, a sufficiently
tempting treasure might be a good enough reason for them to cross
their bottom line. A completely undamaged realmship, for example,
would be enough to drive any Hegemon crazy. Ning, however, was just a
Daolord; Hegemon Brightshore really didn’t have much interest in
his items. Even if he knew that Ning had an omnigeddon bloodfruit
tree, he still wouldn’t care. The verdant azuresoul might interest
him slightly, but he still wouldn’t go crazy over it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was because one would have to first find a Chaos Primordial before
one could use the verdant azuresoul to take control over it. One had
to remember that even for Autarchs finding a Chaos Primordial was an
incredibly difficult task, much less for someone like Hegemon
Brightshore who had always resided within the Flamedragon Realmverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
other words… even if he knew all of the treasures Ning possessed,
he still wouldn’t be so shameless as to pilfer from Ning. And of
course, he had no idea that Ning had treasures like the verdant
azuresoul.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“T-then…”
Ning’s eyes suddenly lit up. He immediately said, “Darknorth has
something to ask of you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh?”
Hegemon Brightshore looked at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
need some precious materials.” Ning waved his hand, causing a large
number of characters to immediately appear in the air next to him.
The text narrated the many materials Ning needed to reach the third
level of the [Sword Dao Body] technique. His previous body had been
destroyed, after all. Although he had rebuilt his true body, his
restored body was just his ‘ordinary’ body.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
protective divine ability? His nine novessence arts? They were all
gone. He didn’t care about the nine novessence arts, as they were
already getting to be a bit too weak… but the protective divine
ability was still of use.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Previously,
when Ning had battled against Archon Silksnow, the reason why he
hadn’t died when he was getting blasted back prior to his
[Heartsword] breakthrough was precisely because his protective divine
ability was quite powerful! But of course, if he wanted to train to
the fourth level, where his body would be comparable to a top-grade
Eternal treasure, the amount of treasures he would have to expend
would cause even a Hegemon some pain. Ning suspected that not even
his omnigeddon bloodfruit tree would be enough.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
remember you buying these things last time?” Hegemon Brightshore
chuckled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
have to re-train this divine ability,” Ning said helplessly. “If
I use my remaining fruits to trade for them, it should be enough,
yes?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is enough.” Hegemon Brightshore smiled. He was starting to like the
kid more and more. He really did want to acquire those fruits, but he
absolutely was not going to take advantage of Ning, a mere Daolord.
The materials which Ning had requested were in fact of equal value to
these fruits! However, if Ning wished to trade his fruits, he
would’ve been able to trade with either the Dao Alliance or the
Ancient cultivators for them… and he probably would’ve gotten a
better deal. These fruits were rarer and more important to Eternal
Emperors, after all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
accept these fruits and will immediately assemble the materials. I’ll
arrange for them to be sent to Vastheaven Palace within one month.”
Hegemon Brightshore accepted the jade green gourd. “Also… you
should keep the fact that you at Vastheaven Palace a tight secret. Do
not let Archon Silksnow find out.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood,”
Ning said immediately. He still was not a match for Archon Silksnow
just yet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
he really does attack, you can immediately ask me for assistance.
I’ll tear straight through spacetime and immediately arrive at
Vastheaven Palace,” Hegemon Brightshore said. “Last time, I was a
bit slow because I didn’t know where you were, exactly; I had to
rely on your servant’s clone guiding the way for me. I’ll be much
faster next time, because I can descend directly upon Vastheaven
Palace. However, I’ll only intervene on your behalf once. Any other
dangers you encounter, you’ll have to resolve yourself.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”
Ning nodded. To Hegemons and Archons, Daolords really didn’t matter
that much. Even though some Daolords were incredibly talented, once
their lifespans ended they would almost all perish.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Brightshore, for example, still viewed Archon Silksnow as a peer
despite being far more powerful than him! But when he viewed
Daolords, he viewed them as being kids. No matter how much of a fuss
they kicked up, they would still just be kids. There had never been a
Daolord who was qualified to treat with Hegemons and Archons as
equals.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Hegemon Brightshore tore a hole in spacetime, then stepped into it
and departed.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_36_Chapter_002__Daol"></A>
Chapter 2: Farewells</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“W-was
that Hegemon Brightshore?” Only now did Su Youji dare to speak.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.”
Ji Ning nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
just now, you said Archon Silksnow…” Su Youji had overheard quite
a bit and now knew much of the story.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
immediately instructed, “You cannot make this information public,
nor can you reveal the fact that I came back to life thanks to a
Dao-seal! Once Archon Silksnow finds out… given his temperament,
there’s no way he’ll let this matter rest. Although Hegemon
Brightshore promised to help out, for him to assist me once is
already giving me great face. In the end, I’ll have to rely on my
own skills to deal with Archon Silksnow.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
we’re talking about Archon Silksnow! T-this…” Su Youji was
extremely worried. No matter how powerful her master was, he was
still just a Daolord. How was he supposed to fight against one of the
eight awesome lords of the Sacred Cities, Archon Silksnow?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
not for you to worry about,” Ning instructed. He then waved his
hand, causing a silver-robed man to appear next to him. It was the
Ninedust Sectlord.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
When Ninedust saw Ning, he immediately revealed a look of delight.
“You are unharmed? Thank goodness. I was worried about something
happening to you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
you were worried about something happening to me and you being unable
to escape, right?” Ning teased.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
jackass, I really was worried about you,” Ninedust said, feigning
anger.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
chuckled, then let out a sigh: “Your worries weren’t unfounded. I
really did end up being killed by Archon Silksnow.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?
You died?!” Ninedust was shocked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
once acquired a special treasure which can allow a Daolord to be
brought back to life.” Ning didn’t hide what actually happened as
he pointed to the surrounding area. “Look, we’re already in
Vastheaven Palace! As for you? It was technically Hegemon Brightshore
who intervened and rescued you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ninedust
started to understand. Moments later, he let out a chuckle. “Hegemon
Brightshore? He’s always been filled with enmity towards us Ancient
cultivators; there’s no way he would’ve gone out of his way to
save me. I imagine he intervened because of you. When it comes down
to it, the person I owe a debt to is still you.” Clearly, the
long-running feud between the Brightshore Kingdom and the Ancient
cultivators made it so that Ninedust didn’t feel any goodwill
towards Hegemon Brightshore.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh,
right. There’s something I want to make clear to you,” Ninedust
said, his face suddenly turning solemn.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
is it?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ninedust
glanced at the nearby Su Youji. Suddenly, he used his Immortal energy
to form a barrier that completely blocked them off from the outside
world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ninedust
had mixed emotions on his face when he said, “Darknorth, we’ve
experience life and death on numerous occasions together. At the
beginning, we were on par in terms of power… and even later on, you
were only slightly more powerful than me. Slowly, though, you’ve
become more and more powerful. When we were in the Autarch’s
estate-world within the Aeonian Kingdom, I could do nothing but watch
when you fought against the flame beasts and the sea dragons. Later
on, I could only watch when you battled against Archon Silksnow. More
and more, I can sense how great the gap between us has become.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was stunned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Slowly,
without me even realizing it, you have completely surpassed me in
power. Even if we were to keep adventuring together, it really
wouldn’t work out. A good test for me would be far too easy for
you, while an adventure suitable for you would be absolutely lethal
to me.” Ninedust sighed. “If this continues… it won’t be good
for either of us.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded slowly. He understood what Ninedust was saying, but… were
the two of them, lifelong brothers, about to separate?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
have used a Voidsea Jadeseal and gained guidance from an Autarch’s
Dao, then studied over three hundred Hegemonic legacies. Thanks to
all of these fortuitous encounters, I can sense that my chances at
the Daomerge are getting better and better.” Ninedust’s eyes
blazed with eagerness. “That’s why I can’t let myself just come
to a halt. I have to keep adventuring and keep testing myself, so
that I can improve my Daomerge chances.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Either
I’ll succeed in the Daomerge, or I’ll die in my adventures.
Darknorth!” Ninedust looked towards Ning. “Let us part ways here.
You have your cultivation path to walk, and I have my Daomerge path
to embark on…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was silent for a long moment. Finally, he nodded. “Very well. My
avatar shall continue to reside here at Vastheaven Palace. If you
need anything, you can simply send word here.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’ll
be just as easy for you to reach me. You merely need to send word to
the Palace of Ancient Truth,” Ninedust said. “The Palace of
Ancient Truth has branches throughout all eight of the Sacred Cities
of the Dao Alliance. In truth, we Ancient cultivators are behind it.
Once you send a message to the Palace of Ancient Truth, it’ll
naturally send word to the Ancient cultivators and my avatar will
immediately be notified.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ninedust
had a very complex look on his face, but he forced a wide smile:
“Darknorth, where do you plan to go adventuring next? Deep into the
Terror Starsea, or…?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
in no rush for now. I’m going to quietly meditate for a period of
time. I was just slain by Archon Silksnow slew me and then brought
back to life by that Dao-seal, after all. This process of death and
rebirth… it caused me to gain many new insights which I wish to
meditate on,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”
Ninedust took a deep breath, then said solemnly: “Brother, I’m
going to leave now. Be careful, and be especially wary of that Archon
Silksnow fellow. He’s definitely not going to give up, if only for
the sake of acquiring that realmship part.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
looked at Ninedust. He knew that once they parted today, it was
possible that they would never see each other ever again. “You also
need to be careful on your adventures. Make sure you don’t die an
early death. I believe in you. You’ll definitely succeed in your
Daomerge!” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
right. I’ll definitely succeed in my Daomerge. In fact, both of us
will! Haha. I’m leaving now. No need to show me off!” Ninedust
immediately flew into the skies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
raised his head, watching as the barriers in the sky automatically
parted and let Ninedust leave. A streak of light shot through the
skies, followed by a dimensional ripple appearing off in the
distance. The streak of light flew into the ripple, then disappeared
without a trace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
continued to watch silently, head upraised. “Take care.” After a
long moment, Ning finally murmured these final words.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,”
Su Youji said. She hadn’t been able to hear any of that
conversation due to the barrier of Immortal energy which Ninedust had
set up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
fine.” Ning was feeling rather frustrated and disheartened. Indeed,
he had his own path of cultivation to walk, as did Ninedust. Ninedust
wanted to focus on the Daomerge, after all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for Ning himself, his chances at the Daomerge were still too slim.
Voidsea Jadeseals were of little to no use to him, while the
Hegemonic legacies were only useful as references. None of those
Hegemons had Daos that were as complex as Ning’s Omega Sword Dao,
after all! Even the Autarch’s Dao was merely of use as a guidepost,
as the Autarch had not embarked upon an Omega Dao as a Daolord.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“For
now, my goal should be to become a Daolord of the Fourth Step as soon
as possible. Once I reach that level, I’ll be qualified to fight
against my foes… and I’ll even have a chance to acquire enough
treasures to ask an Autarch to reverse spacetime and revive my wife.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ninedust’s
goal, however, is the Daomerge. I hope he succeeds in it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
first thing Ning did in the upcoming days was to visit Emperor
Solesky. Emperor Solesky had immediately noticed when Ning had
allowed Ninedust to leave, after all, and so Ning had to advise
Emperor Solesky that he absolutely cannot divulge the fact that
Ning’s true body was at Vastheaven Palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Soon,
after half a month, a Daolord of the Brightshore Kingdom came
delivering treasures.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">That
very day. Vastheaven Palace. Darknorth’s estate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
planning to go out wandering for a bit. Right now, the only ones who
know that I am at Vastheaven Palace are you, big brother Solesky, and
the two of you. You absolutely must not reveal this information;
otherwise, a calamity shall descend upon us.” Ning glanced at
Emperor Solesky, Su Youji, and Pillsaint.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry.” Emperor Solesky nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
I wish to go by your side,” Su Youji said immediately. Pillsaint
opened his mouth, wanting to agree.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
need,” Ning interrupted. “I’m just going to search for new
insights and meditate on the Dao. Travelling alone will be better.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Su
Youji and Pillsaint could only nod.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
leaving now. If there’s anything you wish to tell me, you can
simply inform my avatar.” After finishing his words, Ning took a
single step forwards and disappeared gracefully, passing through
Vastheaven Palace’s barriers and vanishing within the skies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Vastheaven
Palace was located within the Vastheaven Everworld, which as an
everworld was naturally an incredibly gigantic place. Countless
living beings were here, and there were some places where experts
were as common as the clouds. There were even a few Ancestral
Immortals and even Chaos Immortals who arose from this place! There
were other places that, due to special geography, only had mortals
and had no cultivators whatsoever.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning strode slowly through the everworld. Although there were quite a
few dangerous places within it, given how strong Ning was there
really was nothing within it which could pose a threat to him. In
fact, even the Emperor who had originally established this everworld
was significantly weaker than the current Ning!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
region is quite interesting.” Ning stared off into the distance at
a vast region which was hundreds of millions of kilometers in size.
This was a region that was completely surrounded by a titanic, barren
marsh. As a result, it was completely separated from the outside
world. This was a land of ordinary mortals, and even the most supreme
of cultivators were at most at the Celestial Immortal level. There
was simply no way for them to pass through the great marsh and reach
the outside world, and so it was a self-contained realm unto itself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
desolate marsh had probably been naturally formed when the everworld
was first created. Not even some of the weaker Daolords were capable
of traversing it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Seven
kingdoms fighting for supremacy.” Ning stared at the vast land,
then nodded slightly. “Countless living beings are dying at any
given moment in this place. Very well then… this shall be the
place! Here, I shall search for the secrets of mortality, the secrets
of life and death.”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_36_Chapter_003__Daol"></A>
Chapter 3: Boulder Transformation</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
this vast realm, seven nations were striving for dominance. The
cultivation system here was completely different from that of the
outside world. There were three major stages known as ‘warriors’,
‘masters’, and ‘grandmasters’. Reaching the ‘grandmaster’
level was akin to becoming a Void-level Earth Immortal in the outside
world. Ji Ning transformed himself and entered this realm, beginning
to truly experience it and live in it as he watched countless living
beings be born and die.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Waaaaaaa!”
An infant was born within a large manor, bawling his lungs out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-robed Ning appeared outside the manor. His body blurred, then
transformed into a middle-aged man bearing a flag. On the flag were
two simple characters which meant ‘fortune teller’. He walked in
front of the manor, then said to the two manor guards, “This young
master is connected to me via destiny.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
filthy fortune teller like you is connected to him?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Beat
it! Fuck off!” The two guards immediately shouted at this
fortune-teller, shooing him away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
didn’t let himself grow angry. When he was pushed away and sent
stumbling back, he called out loudly, “But we really are connected
by destiny?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
child who was born on this day within this manor was the
manor-master’s only child. His name was ‘Xuhu’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Three
years later. The white-robed Ning once more appeared outside this
estate. He stared at the ten-plus children playing in the mud from
afar, then smiled slightly. His body blurred as he transformed into a
four-year-old child as well dressed in red clothes, then ran barefoot
towards the others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Where
are you from? Why haven’t I ever met you before?” The child who
spoke was surnamed Wang, and he was the only son of the lord of the
manor. Wang Xuhu had a very high status, and he stared puzzledly at
the red-lipped, white-toothed child in front of him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“None
of your business.” The red-clothed child spoke in a very
overbearing manner. “Hey, that’s some nice mud art you made.
Lemme see!” As he spoke, he reached out to grab the horse-shaped
mud sculpture. Plop! The thing completely broke apart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Y-you…”
The child, Wang Xuhu, stared wide-eyed. Tears were beginning to
appear, and he was so angry he gritted his teeth. “Give it back!”
As he spoke, he ran forwards to punch the red-clothed child.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Beat
him up!” The other children all joined him in picking on this new,
strange child.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
want to hit me?” The red-clothed child moved like a blur, landing a
kick on Xuhu’s butt and sending him sprawling on the ground.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Waaaaaaaah!”
Xuhu was both ashamed and enraged. Still sobbing, he clambered to his
feet as he continued to charge towards the red-clothed child.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
going on? Why are you all fighting?” Some of the manor guests had
noticed what was going on over here. The red-clothed child
immediately began to run, soon charging into the distant forests and
disappearing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Xuhu
was the only son of the manor lord. That very night he was struck by
a severe fever which drove him delirious. This terrified the manor
lord into immediately sending for a physician, but three days later
Xuhu miraculously recovered on his own. He began to quickly grow in
strength, and his talent for cultivation became increasingly
astonishing as well. At just eighteen years of age, he stepped into
the ‘master’ stage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Warriors,
masters, grandmasters… the three principle stages of cultivation in
this realm. Warriors were ordinary mortals who trained physically,
making it slow for them to increase their power. At their peak, they
were at most comparable to the Xiantian lifeforms of the Three
Realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Masters
began to accumulate a core within their bodies… they were
comparable to the Zifu Disciples and Wanxiang Adepts of the Three
Realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Grandmasters
began to establish a world within their bodies… they were
comparable to the Primal Daoists and Void-level Earth Immortals of
the Three Realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Those
who surpassed the grandmaster level were comparable to Celestial
Immortals. This realm only occasionally gave birth to a new Celestial
Immortal, and thus their numbers were extremely low.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
continued to watch as Xuhu grew up. When Xuhu turned eighteen, he had
already become the number one hero in the surrounding area, with no
one his equal in a million kilometer area! He was extremely powerful
and ferocious. However, bandits and robbers began to pour into the
region. Xuhu led soldiers to attack them, but ended up being defeated
in battle. He fled to a mountain village, and there he met the love
of his life… ‘Rose’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Sir,
I’d like to buy two pounds of pork.” The girl led the sickly Xuhu
out to purchase some food.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Wait
a bit.” The butcher was a pudgy, white-robed grandpa who was
extremely muscular-looking. He picked up his saber, then began to
hack through the pig bones and carve apart the meat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
Xuhu saw this, his eyes began to lit up. “Rose, you can go home
first,” Xuhu instructed. The girl did just that with those two
pounds of meat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Sir,
please teach me your saber-arts.” Xuhu immediately fell down to his
knees.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ahaha!
I don’t know any ‘saber-arts’! All I know is how to kill pigs
and butcher them,” the elderly butcher said with a loud laugh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
I want to learn how to kill pigs and butcher meat,” Xuhu said
hurriedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
not gonna pay you a salary.” The old man looked at him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
don’t need one,” Xuhu replied.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">From
that day forth, the old butcher gained an apprentice. Half a year
later, the old butcher suddenly vanished. No matter how Xuhu searched
for him, he couldn’t find the old man. He had no choice but to
bring the girl back to his homeland.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ahahaha…
I’ve cultivated for many years, but I’ve never been a
pig-sticking butcher before. That really was a first.” The old
butcher had transformed back into the white-robed Ning and was
standing at the peak of a mountain, watching as Xuhu led his wife
away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
learning that set of saber-arts, Xuhu began to develop at an
unstoppable pace as his level of insight grew deeper and deeper. When
he went back home, he slew those bandits with ease. As his insight
increased even further, he actually stepped into the ‘grandmaster’
stage. When the emperor of his nation heard the news, the emperor
personally sent someone over to confer the title of ‘general’
upon him!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had established his reputation, bringing glory to clan and ancestors
alike. He became one of the pillars of the entire nation, commanding
over three hundred thousand soldiers to guard the borderlands. He
spent more than eight hundred years serving in this capacity.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had a total of three sons and one daughter, and a plethora of
grandchildren.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Finally,
the internal situation of the nation took a turn for the worse as
they lost battle after battle. Xuhu did his best to hold on, leading
his army in an orderly retreat, but the overall situation had already
been set in stone. There was simply no way for Xuhu to reverse it. He
was ambushed and surrounded by eight enemy grandmasters, causing him
to suffer severe injuries. In the end, he didn’t die on the
battlefield but was about to perish in bed due to the wounds suffered
during that assassination attempt.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Xuhu
lay there in bed, surrounded by the aura of death. Within the room
stood the emperor, the senior ministers, and Xuhu’s children and
grandchildren.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Your
Majesty, your old servant is about to depart.” Xuhu’s voice was
hoarse and his face was ashen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Old
general… my beloved old general… you can’t just go like this!”
The young emperor was completely terrified. The old general had been
his final source of support, and it was thanks to him that their
nation had been able to resist for over two hundred years despite the
situation being so grim. Once the old general died, everything really
would come to an end. Their enemy nations were quite vicious; they
had been willing to sacrifice eight grandmasters, sending them into
the capital to engage in an assassination attempt.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flowers
bloom, then shrivel; the grass grows verdant, then shrivels. This is
the cycle of life.” Xuhu turned to look at his sobbing, kneeling
children and grandchildren. He was quite relaxed, feeling as though
he was on the verge of release.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly,
a white-robed youth appeared in front of the emperor before the bed.
The white-robed youth looked at him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
are…” Xuhu looked at the white-robed youth. Suddenly, he turned
stiff – he couldn’t help but think of the red-clothed child who
had given him a kick so many years ago and caused him to enter a
three-day fever. That child had exactly the same eyes as the youth
before him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
then thought of his teacher, that old, grandfatherly butcher who had
taught him saber-arts. His teacher had the same eyes and the same
look on his face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Life
is a cycle, and your cycle has come to an end.” Ning smiled. “I
have been by your side for nearly a thousand years. It can be said
that the ties of destiny linked us together. I shall ensure that you
keep your memories and allow you to be reborn into the cycle of
reincarnation… but our karmic ties shall have to come to an end.
From this day forth, everything shall be up to you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master…
Master…” Xuhu called out, but his aura grew weaker and weaker.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go
on. Go.” Ning nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">That
day, Ning personally escorted Xuhu into the cycle of reincarnation,
ensuring that he was reborn into the belly of a woman who lived in a
village located within a secluded mountain paradise.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is time for me to go find the next person I am destined to meet.”
Ning smiled and took a step forwards, leaving the general’s estate.
He once more transformed into a middle-aged man who bore a flag with
the words ‘fortune teller’ on it, then began to amble through the
streets.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Buns
for sale! Steamed buns for sale!” The street he was on was filled
with meat bun stalls, and there was a child hunched over the ground
playing a game.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
flag-bearing Ning walked over to the child. “Hey kid!” Ning
called out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Huh?”
Puzzled, the kid lifted his head up to look at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
and I are linked by destiny,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
swindler, do you think to deceive my child?” A burly woman
immediately charged out from behind the meat bun stall with a
dough-roller in her hands. The flag-bearing Ning was frightened into
a hasty retreat, but as he fled he called out loudly, “No, we
really are linked by destiny!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Fortune
teller. Innhouse keeper. Coffin maker. Brothel owner. An old
deathsworn soldier who lived his life out on the battlefield…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
took on one form after another, watching from up close as countless
mortals struggled through life. Their lives… their deaths… their
rises… their falls.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
flowed on. The seven warring states ended up as a war between three
states, and in the end it was the Qian state which unified the world.
However, the Qian dynasty then broke apart in a civil war, with the
Southern Qian and the Northern Qian battling against each other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Eventually,
the Qian dynasty fell and another arose.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
lived through each and every dynasty, continuing to search for the
secrets of life and death. Given his wisdom and intelligence, he
slowly began to gain more and more of the insights he sought.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This…
this should be the secret for my Omega Sword Dao to make its next
breakthrough.” By now, he had lived in this realm for over 130
million years. On this day, Ning was standing at the peak of a
towering mountain, gazing down at the world with a feeling of joy in
his heart and a smile on his lips.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning transformed into a boulder that was many meters tall. The
boulder landed upon the mountain peak, looking quite unremarkable. He
just sat there, allowing the wind to blow against him and the sun to
bake him. There was even an occasional passerby who would write a few
words on him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
transforming into the boulder, Ning just sat there and quietly stared
at the vast world as well as the countless living beings who were
born and reborn within it. In his heart, his five major sword stances
began to merge. Blood Drop, Yin-Yang, Soleheart, Heavenbreaker,
Shadowless… they slowly began to become one.</P>

Chapter 4: Omega Sword Dao, Stage Four</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Millions
of years went by after Ji Ning transformed into that boulder atop the
mountain peak. One day, a thick mist suddenly arose around the great
mountain. The mist was so thick as to block out the skies and the
sun. It covered an area of tens of thousands of kilometers, including
every single part of the great mountain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
a massive fog.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
going on? Why am I walking in circles? I keep on ending up here.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Some
of the ordinary mortals who passed through this place quickly
discovered how bizarre the mist was. Word quickly spread and some
experts began to arrive and explore the mist. Alas, anyone who
entered the mist, no matter how powerful, would quickly end up
walking out of the mist just a short while later. At first, everyone
was quite startled, but after more time passed everyone grew
accustomed to it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the thick mist. Thousands of streams of sword-light were roving about
in the air above the boulder at the peak of the mountain, fluctuating
and vanishing in an unpredictable manner while being as dominating
and exalted as the heavens themselves. At other times, the
sword-light transformed into endlessly vast black holes which ground
through everything nearby.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
boulder suddenly transformed into human form. A white-robed youth
appeared at the peak of the mountain. He raised his head to look into
the skies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
Dao has been completed.” Ning said in a soft voice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
The towering Dao-tree within his body began to grow, rumbling and
trembling as its branches and trunk stretched outwards. The branches
coiled like the bodies of sinuous dragons, while the trunk grew even
thicker. The countless leaves on the tree were all trembling. This
towering Dao-tree was unfathomably stronger than the Dao-trees of
ordinary Daolords of the Fourth Step. Clearly, Ning’s foundation
was far, far more stable than theirs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Dao-tree continued to grow taller as well before finally topping out
at 540,000 meters. The Dao-tree had finally reached its true,
absolute limit in size! The next step would be the Daomerge, which
would result in the Dao-tree giving birth to a flower of eternity.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
the giant pile of chaos jewels continued to crumble apart and shatter
as a veritable ocean of energy surged into Ning. His divine body and
Immortal energy began to transform and evolve, while his heartworld
began its final expansion…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
reason why he completely separated this place off from the rest of
the world and elected to absorb energy from chaos jewels rather than
from the primordial chaos of the outside world was to prevent
anything unexpected from happening! The disturbance which would be
caused by Ning drawing upon chaos energy from the outside world in
making his breakthrough to the fourth step would definitely shock
everyone. News would quickly spread! Moreover, absorbing chaos energy
from the primordial chaos was extremely slow. Archon Silksnow or the
Aeonians might be able to make it here and attack Ning before he
finished his breakthrough!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Archon
Silksnow and the Aeonians had been searching for Ning this entire
time. At first, Archon Silksnow wasn’t sure if Ning was dead or
not, but he quickly received word that Ning was actually alive! In
truth, this was quite easy to discern; Ning’s heartlamp within the
Sword Palace of the Twelve Palaces of Brightshore remained lit. This
meant that Ning wasn’t dead yet! Given how strong Archon Silksnow
was, it was very easy for him to befriend a few Daolords of the
Brightshore Kingdom and have them help him examine Ning’s
heartlamp.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
the Daolords of the Brightshore Kingdom were forbidden from engaging
in fratricide, something as minor as inspecting a heartlamp was
nothing more than sending a bit of information forward. It didn’t
count.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Whew.”
Ning stood at the peak of a mountain, a smile on his face. It had
only been a short period of time, but the chaos jewels had allowed
his divine power and Immortal energy to complete their
transformations. He now truly was a Daolord of the Fourth Step in
every way, shape, and form! He was now simply accumulating energy
from the chaos jewels in order to generate more of the azureflower
mist energy and expand his heartworld.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
short while from now, I’ll have completely transformed. Archon
Silksnow and the Aeonians will no longer pose any threat to me.”
Ning could sense how his body had changed. With his Omega Sword Dao
having reached the fourth stage, his Dao had broken through to a
brand new level. Ning himself had been catapaulted into a higher
level of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
glanced downwards, his gaze piercing through the mist as he stared at
the vast land beneath him. The land was filled with countless
ordinary mortals, and Ning was able to see the tiny threads of fate
which connected those ordinary mortals together.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Karma?”
Ning nodded slowly. Although he had never trained specifically in the
Dao of Karma, anyone who reached a sufficiently high level of insight
in any Dao would be able to engage in karmic scrying. Given Ning’s
current level of enlightenment, there were now many ‘hidden’
places in the vast universe which could no longer hide from his gaze!
If he wished to slay a foe, he could use his sword to follow the
threads of karma to slay all of his his foe’s clones and
Primaltwin!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth Archon Silksnow was able to do this as well, but the problem
was that he wasn’t able to rely on his own power to kill Ning; he
had to rely on a powerful treasure he had acquired in the Terror
Starsea. The power of the treasure was tremendous… but since it
didn’t truly belong to him, he could at most control the direction
in which the power was released. There was no way he could control it
to follow Ning’s karmic threads and kill Ning’s other bodies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning’s body began to move. Whoooooosh. Countless Nings appeared
above the mountain peak. He was moving at such an incomprehensible
level of speed that ordinary matter wasn’t able to impede him in
the slightest; in fact, not even spacetime was able to impede him! In
terms of speed, Ning was definitely superior to the likes of Archon
Silksnow by now. He truly had reached an incomprehensible level.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Ning’s body suddenly blasted apart, dissolving into countless motes
of light. The light then reformed into a glowing humanoid figure. The
glowing humanoid figure then blasted apart, transforming into an
endless black fog which drifted away… then suddenly transformed
into a stream of water. A while later, the stream of water vanished
and a towering inferno replaced it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
am the world. The world is me.” In the end, the inferno transformed
into countless specks of flying sand which reformed into Ning’s
figure. Ning murmured softly to himself, “Shadowless and traceless,
I manifest and disappear as I please. So when the Omega Sword Dao –
Shadowless reaches the fourth stage, it can actually produce a
terrifying invulnerable form…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had always envied the other cultivators for their various
invulnerable forms. Upon gaining an invulnerable form, it would be
difficult for foes to slay you unless the gap in power between you
and them was ridiculously large.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">For
example, Archon Silksnow’s invulnerable form made it so that even
Hegemon Brightshore would find him difficult to kill. But of course,
‘difficult’ didn’t mean ‘impossible’; if Hegemon
Brightshore was willing to pay any price, he would still be able to
accomplish it. The price, however, would be huge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
invulnerable form should be even more perfect than Archon
Silksnow’s.” Ning laughed. His Omega Sword Dao was truly perfect
and without flaw. In the past, he didn’t have an invulnerable form
primarily because he hadn’t reached the proper stage of cultivation
yet. Not that he had, it was naturally unlocked for him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Archon
Silksnow’s Dao of the Saber was offense oriented, and so there was
no way he could use his Saber Dao to generate an invulnerable form
for himself. This was why he had spent so much time and energy
training in the Dao of Snow. The Dao of Snow, the Dao of Light, and
other similar Daos were Daos which could be used to generate
invulnerable forms with (relative) ease. Archon Silksnow had used
this method to cover up this particular flaw, lowering his overall
weaknesses.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Ning’s heartworld finally expanded to a completely new level as
well, causing his massive reserve of heartforce to become even more
powerful.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
smiled slightly. When his Omega Sword Dao had been at the third
stage, his insights into the Dao were already comparable to the
insights of ‘ordinary’ supreme Daolords. The difference was, he
was extremely well-rounded and flawless in every aspect, which was
why he ranked at the very top of the supreme Daolord ranking.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Now,
his Omega Sword Dao had broken through to the fourth stage. In terms
of insight, he was at the Archon level… and a highly ranked one at
that! This was especially true now that his [Heartsword] art had
reached the twelfth stance, which meant that Ning’s sword-arts were
now six times stronger when using the [Heartsword] art! During his
fight against Archon Silksnow, he had only mastered the eleventh
stance, but since the eleventh and twelfth stances belonged to the
same ‘stage’, it was very easy to break through from the former
to the latter. Ning had already spent 130 million years wandering
this mortal world; he naturally was able to break through to a new
level during this period of time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Given
my current Omega Sword Dao and my twelfth stance of the [Heartsword]
art… there might be Archons capable of defeating me, but they can
probably be counted on one hand.” Ning smiled. “Even the three
mighty Hegemons… they are worthy of my respect, but I no longer
need to live in terror of them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
protective abilities were far superior to Archon Silksnow’s. He had
already mastered his own invulnerable form, the Shadowless form. It
allowed him to become one with the world and for the world to become
one with him. Injuring him would be very, very difficult.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“With
this level of power… I now have a chance at acquiring treasures
which are valuable enough to persuade an Autarch to help me out.”
Ning was in high spirits. After countless years of cultivation, he
had finally reached this new height.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
becoming a Daolord of the Fourth Step, Ning continued to sit by
himself at the peak of the mountain, calmly and quietly training in
the secret art known as the [Grand Diffraction Sword]. This was a
secret art left behind by the Sword Hegemon, and was a Hegemon-level
secret art! Even the current Ning was merely able to master two of
the three stages of this art, as he was still at a somewhat lower
level of insight than that of a Hegemon. For now, he was unable to
master the third stage… and in truth, the third stage required so
many treasures that not even a Hegemon would necessarily be able to
scrounge up all the items necessary.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Welkin, for the sake of training in a Hegemonic secret art, had
wandered many realmverses and otherverses in search of the materials
he needed… but to this very day, he was still lacking a few items.
As a result, Hegemon Welkin had only mastered part of his Hegemonic
secret arts!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Truly
mastering Hegemonic secret arts was just too difficult. If Ning could
master just two of those three stages, he would have reached the same
level of power in secret arts as Hegemon Welkin had reached.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_36_Chapter_005__Daol"></A>
Chapter 5: Ji Ning Appears</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Whoosh. Whoosh. Arcs of sword-light flew around Ji Ning in an orderly
process while growing increasingly powerful.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Jindan chaos region inside of Ning’s body was currently making use
of various treasures to establish a ‘sea of diffracted light’.
This sea would in turn birth and hold the energy needed for the
[Grand Diffraction Sword]. Like the nine novessence arts, this was a
type of outside power! However, to train this technique was extremely
difficult, requiring an extremely high level of insight into the Dao.
Ning was finding it quite laborious and taxing to establish this
diffraction sea.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
deeper the sea became, the more powerful his [Grand Diffraction
Sword] would become! If he could truly master this Hegemonic secret
art, he would be able to beat Archons senseless with casual strikes
from it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Fortunately,
Ning’s mastery of the Dao of the Sword had no weaknesses. Although
this secret art had high requirements in many different aspects of
the Dao of the Sword, Ning was able to slowly master it. After
spending over a thousand years, Ning finally finished establishing
his diffraction sea. This sea of diffracted light was now more than
thirty thousand kilometers wide, signifying that he had mastered the
first two stages of the [Grand Diffraction Sword]. The very first
stage of this technique was already comparable to the nine novessence
arts. The second stage was much more powerful.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
rose to his feet, dispelling the mist which had surrounded the
mountain for so long, then stared at the world about him. “Now that
my secret arts are mastered, it is time to go back.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Focus.”
Ning pointed from afar. Instantly, part of his will containing his
sword-arts legacy shot out of his finger. Although this wasn’t the
Omega Sword Dao, it was still something which would allow someone to
establish the most stable foundation possible in the Dao of the
Sword. It would allow cultivators to walk the path most suitable for
them… and in this realm, where the highest skilled cultivators were
merely Celestial Immortals, it would allow practitioners to become
invincible with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I,
Darknorth, meditated on the Dao in this place and became a Daolord of
the Fourth Step here. It can be said that karma binds us together,
and so I have left a fragment of my will. The one who passes my
trials and acquires this fragment of my will shall gain my legacy and
become my personal disciple, the fourth disciple under my tutelage.”
Ning had already set up a number of trials within the mountain with
ease. Anyone who came would have to first follow Ning’s trials as
he set them up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
someone wished to breach the trials through raw force? Even supreme
Daolords could well die unless they had incredible life-preserving
abilities!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning took a single step forwards, disappearing from the mountain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
Ning had spent over a hundred million years in seclusion, in truth
all of those years had been spent within the Vastheaven Everworld.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
Vastheaven Palace. As soon as Ning returned to his own residence,
Emperor Solesky hurried over to meet him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.”
Just as Su Youji called out in delight, she saw Emperor Solesky fly
towards them. She hurriedly bowed: “Greetings, Emperor.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Step
back for now,” Emperor Solesky instructed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Although Su Youji was a bit puzzled, she immediately retreated.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
Su Youji left, Emperor Solesky said hurriedly, “Darknorth, why have
you come back? I told you to go into hiding and not reveal yourself!
Although no one in Vastheaven Palace would leak this information, we
still need to be careful. There might be Eternal Emperors scrying on
us from outside. If they see that your true body has returned, we’re
going to be in serious trouble.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
need to worry that much, big brother,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
situation is extremely grim,” Emperor Solesky explained. “I
already told you last time… Archon Silksnow has arranged for many
different organizations to track your whereabouts. Some of my
friends, however, have told me that someone else just as powerful as
Archon Silksnow is also trying to trace your whereabouts. For now, I
haven’t been able to find out just who it is, but judging from the
amount of manpower he’s been able to move, there’s no question
that he’s at least as strong as Archon Silksnow.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is the Aeonians,” Ning explained.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Aeonian race?!” Emperor Solesky was shocked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
aren’t just searching for me in the Dao Alliance, they are also
searching for me in the Brightshore Kingdom,” Ning explained.
“Hegemon Brightshore has warned me long ago.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Archon
Silksnow is famous for being a savage madman. It is ‘normal’ for
him to behave in such a frenzied manner… but why are the Aeonians
searching for you?” Emperor Solesky was puzzled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
smiled calmly. “Because of a treasure.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
aren’t worried at all?” Emperor Solesky was rather flabbergasted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Worried?
Why should I be worried? They should be the ones to worry.” Ning
smiled. He was at a different level of power now, and so he was also
in a different state of mind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had been weaker than them in the past, and he didn’t have an
invulnerable form, nor did he have any powerful protective treasures.
He was constantly at risk of dying! Even his Lifeblood Dao-seal had
been used up. Of course he had to be in hiding.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Now,
he was much stronger and more confident in himself. Why would he fear
Archon Silksnow or the Aeonians?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You…?”
Emperor Solesky was rather puzzled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Big
brother Solesky, I’m planning to pay a visit to the Brightshore
Kingdom. After that… I’m planning to attack the Sacred City of
Silksnow and kill Archon Silksnow.” A murderous look flashed
through Ning’s eyes. “It’s going to cause a bit of a stir, so I
wanted to give you advance notice. No need to worry.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
are going to attack the Sacred City of Silksnow and kill Archon
Silksnow?!” Emperor Solesky was stunned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Well.
I might not be able to kill him, but I’ll uproot him and everything
he’s ever established.” Ning’s eyes flickered icily. He was
going to ‘kill a chicken to frighten off the monkeys’, warning
any others that he was not to be messed with. Archon Silksnow was
nothing more than a chicken for him to use in this plan!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the coming days, there would be cases where he would occasionally
reveal his strength. This would definitely surprise and puzzle many.
Previously, for him to be able to rely on the [Heartsword] art and
other art to just barely reach the Archon level was already a
freakish display of strength in talent… but it was still within the
realm of believability! But when he now revealed an even more
terrifying level of power, it would truly stun everyone.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">How
could a Daolord reach such a level of power? This was completely
illogical. It made no sense at all! And yet, it had happened. How?
Perhaps the Hegemons and the other ancient cultivators would try to
capture Ning and force him to hand over his secrets.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">For
the sake of personal power, anything and everything was possible.
Ning didn’t want to go through all that trouble… and so he was
going to go out of his way to show everyone just how hard he could
hit! He was going to dominate Archon Silksnow in a display of
absolute power! That way, no one would dare to plot against him. Even
if they did want to learn some of Ning’s secrets, they wouldn’t
make an enemy out of him without a good reason. No one in the Endless
Territories, after all, would want to offend someone who could
dominate Archon Silksnow!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Archon
Silksnow… you’ve searched for me again and again, unwilling to
give up on your plans. Then… I’ll force you to give up, and I’ll
make an example out of you in the process!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
you… you plan to uproot his foundation?” Emperor Solesky could
hardly believe it. “He’s one of the eight lords of the Sacred
Cities! He’s so legendary for his savagery that he has numerous
bloodthirsty Emperors serving as his retainers. All of the Emperors
under his command are powerful, and it is said that he has other
ancient Archon-level figures who are supporting him from behind. If
you are going to act against him, that means you are going to have to
fight all of those Emperors!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
what makes it fun.” Ning smiled. Archon Silksnow was no threat to
him at all. He wanted to uproot Archon Silksnow’s entire
foundation; that was what would truly stun everyone around.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
you are still just a Daolord!” Emperor Solesky’s anxiety was
beginning to transform into rage. “Those Emperors have been around
for an unfathomably long period of time, and Archon Silksnow stands
at their very peak. He’s not going to be that easy for you to deal
with!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Big
brother.” Ning frowned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
know what type of temper you have, and I know that I can’t stop
you. Fine. I’ll go with you,” Emperor Solesky said. “I might
not be able to kill Archon Silksnow, but I’m skilled in staying
alive. I should stand a good chance at fleeing with you in tow.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
shook his head, then stretched his hand and waved a finger. Whoosh. A
streak of sword-light appeared in the air, arcing out and brushing
past Emperor Solesky. This caused Emperor Solesky’s face to turn
pale, and he couldn’t help but tremble.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“B-but…”
Emperor Solesky could hardly believe it. Wasn’t his brother just a
Daolord? How could he be this powerful?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Big
brother, just wait for the news.” Ning turned and left.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Brightshore Kingdom. The Palace of the Sword. A white-robed youth
appeared right in front of its main doors and walked towards it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Is
that…?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
Palace Lord Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Isn’t
that Palace Lord Darknorth?” The World-level cultivators and
black-armored Daolords in front of the Sword Palace all stared in
amazement at the white-robed youth who appeared before them. Ever
since Ning had shocked everyone with his performance in the Waveshift
Realm, he had become acknowledged as the Palace Lord of the Palace of
the Sword.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Greetings,
Palace Lord.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Palace
Lord.” They all bowed respectfully as he walked past, but the
black-armored Daolords began to secretly spread the word. Archon
Silksnow and the Aeonians were still searching for him, after all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Soon,
word was sent from the Brightshore Kingdom and began to spread out
throughout the Endless Territories. Daolord Darknorth had appeared
within the Palace of the Sword in the Brightshore Kingdom!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
finally come out. Hegemon Brightshore was willing to help you out
once, but I refuse to believe he’ll help you out a second, third,
or fourth time. How could an exalted Hegemon lower himself to helping
out a Daolord that many times?” Archon Silksnow immediately grew
excited upon hearing this information, and his oily green eyes were
filled with murderous malice. “This time… as soon as you leave
the Brightshore Kingdom, I’m going to claim your life.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You’ve
hidden yourself for quite some time, but now you’ve finally shown
yourself. The only thing that little thief is capable of is running
around and hiding. If we can find him, we’ll crush him with ease.”
Within the Aeonian Kingdom, Emperors Anchen, Islehide, and Duug were
filled with the desire to kill as well. They didn’t believe Ning
would pose any risk to them at all.</P>

Chapter 6: Refusal</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning walked into the Palace of the Sword. All of the cultivators he
passed would all address him respectfully as ‘Palace Lord’ or as
‘senior apprentice-brother’. Clearly, Ning’s status was supreme
amongst those inside the Palace of the Sword.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
Ning revealed his true power? The only person whose status was higher
than him in the Brightshore Kingdom would probably be Hegemon
Brightshore himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Armaments
Gorge.” Ning walked through the air to descend up on the building
located deep within a gorge. This was Armaments Gorge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Palace
Lord.” The two golems responsible for overseeing Armaments Gorge,
‘Swordfive’ and ‘Swordsix’, both called out respectfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Long
time no see.” Ning smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
mere billion years or so has passed since you first entered our
palace, Palace Lord. And yet, you have now become the preeminent
power of the Sword Palace,” Swordfive said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
couldn’t help but think back to those early years. When he had
first entered the Palace of the Sword, he had merely been a
World-level cultivator, awed and dazed by what he was seeing. He had
been filled with excitement and desire towards cultivation! In the
blink of an eye, a billion years had gone by. He now stood amongst
those who were at the very apex of power within the Endless
Territories. The only ones who were truly stronger than him were the
three Hegemons. Who would’ve ever thought he would rise to such
heights?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
casually walked into the Armaments Gorge, glancing at the many
treasures inside. To the current Ning, they were of very little
interest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Halfsword.” Ning’s gaze fell upon the broken sword lying on the
table. An awesome sword-intent emanated from the broken sword which
surrounded the area, making it impossible for any cultivator who
entered to miss it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
Universe treasure.” Ning smiled as he walked over. When he was
thirty meters away, an invisible field of energy sought to stop Ning
in his tracks. Ning paused momentarily, then easily brushed aside the
surge of energy and continued to walk over. He walked next to the
table, then looked down upon the broken sword resting upon it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
didn’t want to let you get close to me, but you actually forced you
way over.” A figure suddenly appeared directly above the broken
sword. It was a pink-robed, icy-faced woman.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Treasure-spirit,”
Ning said, “Aren’t you bored by life in Armaments Gorge? Why
don’t you accompany me in roving through the outside world. What do
you say?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
you are now the new Palace Lord of the Palace of the Sword.” The
icy-faced woman said coldly, “I remember you from back when you
were still just a kid, unable to withstand even my aura. You’ve
become fairly powerful, but you are still just a Daolord. Successive
generations of Palace Lords have sought me out, but I was not
interested in any of them. You can leave now. I will not follow any
Daolord.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was speechless. He had come to the Brightshore Kingdom on serious
business; he had only come to visit the Halfsword to try his luck. If
he really could acquire a Universe treasure, his power would be
increased by quite a significant amount.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Aren’t
you setting your requirements a bit too high?” Ning smirked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
not interested in ordinary Eternal Emperors either, only in sword
cultivators who have at least reached the Archon level. A Hegemon
would be even better,” the icy-faced woman said coldly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
the entire Flamedragon Realmverse doesn’t even have a single
sword-wielding Hegemon.” Ning teased, “And the number of Archons
who wield swords can also be counted on one hand. It seems it’ll be
quite hard for you to find a new master.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.
You are far too weak. Even if you did have a Universe treasure, you’d
just end up being easily beaten and losing it to a powerful Eternal
Emperor.” The icy-faced woman snickered, “Giving a Universe
treasure to a Daolord is a waste. I heard that someone named Winesage
did end up with a Universe treasure. I think that Universe treasure
must’ve been crazy for him to choose to follow a Daolord.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Two
streams of sword-light suddenly shot out of Ning’s eyes. Boom!
Boom! These two streams of sword-light carried an aura of terrifying
power which spread out in the area around the Halfsword, but it
didn’t contain any offensive power to it. All of the treasures
within Armaments Gorge were protected by barriers which Hegemon
Brightshore himself had set down. The other major powers who had come
afterwards had set down barriers as well. It was impossible to take
away any of the treasures here by force.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Your
Dao of the Sword…?” The icy-faced woman was stunned. “Y-y-you…
how could you have…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">She
was a Universe-level sword! Her senses were keenly attuned to the
auras of sword cultivators, and she could instantly tell how
exquisite Ning’s Dao of the Sword was. It had completely surpassed
the Daolord level; it was at a level which only some Archons could
match.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Follow
me and adventure by my side. You should be able to tell how strong I
am; there is no one in the entire Flamedragon Realmverse who can do
anything to me.” Ning looked at her. “Even if I truly do end up
dying one day, you’ll just regain your freedom once more. Come
adventuring with me. Life here is far too boring and meaningless.”
Ning was trying to ‘seduce’ her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
icy-faced woman hesitated slightly. She actually did want to go out
adventuring as well… but her innate pride forced her to let out a
cold snort. “Your Sword Dao is excellent, but you are still just a
Daolord. If you can succeed in your Daomerge, I’ll agree to follow
you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
couldn’t help but feel speechless. Succeed in his Daomerge? That
was incredibly difficult. If he really was able to succeed in the
Daomerge and make his Omega Sword Dao eternal… he couldn’t even
imagine what level he would be at by then. By then, even Universe
treasures would probably be of limited use to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Are
you sure you don’t want to come out with me?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
are just a Daolord.” Clearly, the icy-faced woman wasn’t willing
to lower her head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ah,
forget it then. It seems that we are not destined to be a match.”
Ning turned and left.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
icy-faced woman watched as Ning left, gritting her teeth. A Daolord
who had reached such a high level in the Dao of the Sword truly had
been quite enticing for her. “Bah. In the end, he is just a
Daolord. Once he fails his Daomerge, it will all be over. We’ll
talk again once he succeeds in his Daomerge.” The icy-faced woman
put Ning out of her mind, returning into the Halfsword.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
flew out of Armaments Gorge, feeling slightly regretful. “Winesage
is weaker than me, but he found a Universe treasure willing to follow
him… but even now, I’m still unable to take the Halfsword away.
Ah, forget it, forget it. Haha.” Ning was fairly relaxed about
this. His Northbow swords were lifeblood weapons which also helped
him out significantly, after all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">By
now, his six Northbow swords and the sword quintessence within them
had also evolved alongside Ning reaching the fourth stage with his
Omega Sword Dao, giving them an even deeper foundation than before.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
Northbow swords aren’t THAT much weaker than Universe treasures by
now.” Ning transformed into a streak of light, quickly arriving at
the peak of a mountain within the Sword Palace. Moments later, an
Immortal estate descended upon it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was where Ning had resided in the past. Now that he was back, he was
going to take up residence here for now. “Help me send word to
Hegemon Brightshore. Inform him that Darknorth has a trade he wishes
to make,” Ning instructed his servant.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
Master,” the servant replied.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the Immortal estate. Ning was within one of the towers, gazing down
at the beautiful Palace of the Sword while leaning against the
railings.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
A figure suddenly materialized next to him. It was a snow-robed,
white-bearded old man with six curved horns on his head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
turned and immediately bowed: “Darknorth greets you, Hegemon.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Brightshore looked at Ning. “You are quite bold. You know that
Archon Silksnow and the Aeonians are both searching for you, and yet
you dare to show your face here publicly?” Ning didn’t wish for
his enemies to know that he had made a breakthrough, and so he was
using the [Vitalis] art to modify his aura and ensure that it was
identical to before the breakthrough.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hegemon,
do you know why the Aeonians have been searching for me?” Ning
smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
asked you previously, but you weren’t willing to explain in
detail.” Hegemon Brightshore looked at Ning. “Ready to tell me?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded, then waved his hand and produced a fiery fruit within it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom.
Boom. Boom. The rumbling aura of the fruit was capable of pervading
the hearts and souls of cultivators. Even at his current level, Ning
felt his heartrate speed up slightly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Is
that…?” Hegemon Brightshore’s eyes lit up. “Is that an
aeonfruit?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Aeonfruit?”
Ning was startled. Wasn’t this the mutated omnigeddon bloodfruit
which had some of the Autarch’s blood within it?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
seems you don’t really understand… which makes sense. Aeonfruits
are far too rare and far too valuable,” Hegemon Brightshore said.
“Aeonfruits are only available to the Aeonian race! The Aeonians
view them to be as important as their very lives, and do not trade
them to outsiders unless they have an extremely pressing need. Based
on what I know, the Aeonians in a few other realmverses also have
access to aeonfruits.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded slightly. Prior to the great war starting, Autarch Bolin had
set up estate-worlds in quite a few realmverses. Most likely, after
the battle concluded he had left behind a drop of Autarch’s blood
within most of those estates for his Aeonians to acquire.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“However…
none of the Aeonians in any of those realmverses are willing to trade
them,” Hegemon Brightshore said. “I’ve heard of only three
instances in which they were willing to trade aeonfruits, and in each
case it involved something which the Aeonians were desperate to
acquire as soon as possible.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Is
this fruit truly that special?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
are fairly similar to omnigeddon bloodfruits, but they are more
effective when used to create spirit-pills and medicine. As you are
probably aware, a 30% increase in medicinal strength translates into
a tenfold increase in value,” Hegemon Brightshore said. “A single
aeonfruit is generally worth more than twenty omnigeddon bloodfruits.
Right… so this means that the Aeonians have been searching for you
because of this aeonfruit?”</P>

Chapter 7: Success</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
stole their aeonfruits?” Hegemon Brightshore asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning silently mused to himself, “I didn’t just steal their fruit,
I uprooted their tree.” Still, Ning didn’t feel much sympathy or
guilt towards the Aeonians. This was a race that delighted in
devouring cultivators! He really had no idea why Autarch Bolin had
created such a race of progeny.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
wish to trade aeonfruits to you,” Ning said, “But I need certain
materials.” As he spoke, he waved his hand. A vast list of
characters appeared in the air next to him. These were the materials
needed to master the first two stages of the [Lumisword Godwings].
Ning had viewed over three hundred Hegemonic legacies, and from them
he had chosen this secret art as being the best match for his [Grand
Diffraction Sword] art. He was planning to train in both secret arts
at the same time. That way, when he used the Omega Sword Dao –
Yin-Yang in the future, he would be able to use them together and
further increase the power of this technique.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
materials you need are all extremely valuable and rare.” Hegemon
Brightshore frowned upon seeing them. These were materials for a
Hegemonic secret art; of course they were rare!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
chortled: “That’s why I’m offering aeonfruits for them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
need half a year,” Hegemon Brightshore said. “I’ll also need
fifteen aeonfruits.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Ning accepted without haggling.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Brightshore glanced at Ning, surprised, then laughed: “Darknorth,
how many aeonfruits did you take from the Aeonians? They value every
single of them highly, but it seems you were able to snatch away
fifteen of them with ease. No wonder they are searching for you like
crazy.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
that many, actually,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
have to remind you to be careful. Neither Archon Silksnow nor the
Aeonians are easy enemies to face,” Hegemon Brightshore said. “I
promised you to help you out once! If you are willing to trade me
more aeonfruits, I’ll help you out a second time for ten more of
them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
blinked. Ruthless. Absolutely ruthless. Ten?! The Aeonians were only
able to harvest thirty-six aeonfruits every million chaos cycles.
They were only created thanks to an Autarch’s blood!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well.” Ning still smiled and nodded, but he murmured mentally to
himself, “Oh, Hegemon… I’m afraid you won’t have that chance
any longer. Neither Archon Silksnow nor the Aeonians are of any
threat to me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
vast Sacred City of Silksnow was perpetually covered by drifting
flakes of snow. At the very top of a towering palace within the city.
A skinny, white-robed, white-haired man was standing in front of the
railings, his long eyebrows fluttering in the wind. He stared off
into the void of space, three Eternal Emperors behind him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.”
Archon Silksnow was boiling with killing intent. “I’ve received
word that Daolord Darknorth is currently hiding within the
Brightshore Kingdom,” Archon Silksnow said coldly. “I don’t
know if it is a Primaltwin or if he managed to revive himself
somehow, but I’m absolutely not going to let him survive again.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
probably going to spend quite some time in the Brightshore Kingdom,”
the red-haired, red-robed woman said hesitantly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
no way he’ll hide there forever. Sooner or later, he’ll come out.
Daolords only live for 108,000 chaos cycles; he needs to go out
adventuring, and he needs to attempt the Daomerge. There’s no way
he’ll hide inside forever,” Archon Silksnow said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
where would he flee to?” The other Emperors were all hesitating.
They felt that trapping Ning was going to be extremely difficult.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Archon
Silksnow, however, felt quite confident: “Once he leaves the
Brightshore Kingdom, there are two possibilities. The first is that
he will go through one of the three spacetime tunnels as he leaves.
The tunnels which Hegemon Brightshore personally established can send
him a tremendous distance, and they lead to three different regions.
The second possibility is that he’ll leave on his own power.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Archon
Silksnow smiled coldly. “I’m going to ask the three of you to
stand guard in front of those three spacetime tunnel exits. I will
personally stand guard outside the Brightshore Kingdom! So long as he
dares to exit it, I’ll immediately kill him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Archon,
it’ll be easy if you merely wish for us to watch the spacetime
tunnel exits, but you’ll have to watch over the entire Brightshore
Kingdom.” The three Emperors all felt rather worried.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
have my own plans.” Archon Silksnow didn’t explain in detail. He
had that damaged realmship, but it was in good enough shape that it
even had a ship-spirit. The realmship was usable, it just wasn’t
able to cover long distances; in fact, it couldn’t even match up to
the distance Hegemon Brightshore could teleport through spacetime.
Despite that, Archon Silksnow still didn’t dare to divulge the fact
that he had it. He truly wanted to kill Ning and Ninedust so that he
could repair it a bit further.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
soon as he moved close to the Brightshore Kingdom, he would be able
to sense Ning’s location based on the resonance between the parts.
If Ning wanted to slowly fly away… impossible!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ll
keep watch over the three spacetime tunnels and the area outside the
Brightshore Kingdom. Daolord Darknorth… you have nowhere to run.”
Archon Silksnow narrowed his oily green eyes, cold light flashing
from them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning,
however, didn’t care at all. Nearly five months went by. Hegemon
Brightshore visited quite a few places, finally acquiring all the
materials which Ning needed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thankfully,
Ning had only requested the materials needed for the first two stages
of the [Lumisword Godwings]. If he wanted to fully master it, the
materials needed would cost tens of time as much. The entire
Flamedragon Realmverse probably didn’t have enough; he’d have to
go elsewhere to slowly search for it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Lumisword
Godwings.” Ning sat in the lotus position within a flat plains
within his estate-world. Above his head hovered an absolutely
dazzling pair of golden wings which radiated an aura of incomparable
sword-ki.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
wings were spread out revealing countless feathers. Each feather
radiated an absolutely staggering amount of power. The wings and the
feathers were all formed by sword-light which had taken material
form. Within Ning’s Jindan chaos region lay the actual golden
wings, which were akin to a type of magic treasure. All the precious
materials that had been consumed were used to forge this set of
wings.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
pair of wings hung there within the Jindan chaos region. As Ning
carefully molded and remolded it over and over again, a large number
of materials were continuously consumed and transformed into feathers
which flew into the wings.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
more time flowed on, the wings began to grow more and more
complicated as well as larger in size. Clearly, its power was
increasing as well. The Godwings above Ning’s head began to glow
with absolutely dazzling light. Most likely, ordinary supreme
Daolords who saw it would be so terrified their legs would turn to
jelly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
[Grand Diffraction Sword] and the [Lumisword Godwings] were somewhat
different in nature. The [Grand Diffraction Sword] was rather
unpredictable and ephemeral, almost like the waves of the sea in that
it came crashing down upon foes in an endless cycle. Its power was
spread out across countless streams of sword-ki. The [Lumisword
Godwings], however, focused all of its power into that pair of wings.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
first scattered its power, the second condensed it. This was why Ning
had determined that these were the two secret arts which would be
most appropriate for him to use in forming his Yin-Yang Chaosworld.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
truly is complicated. It really does require an extremely high level
of insight into the Dao of the Sword.” This was an extremely
complicated secret art. Ning had spent over thirty thousand years
training in it… and if one factored in his usage of a temporal
acceleration treasure, he had actually spent over three million years
before succeeding! The complexity of this secret art was
self-evident.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Whoosh! Up above the sea of diffracted light within Ning’s Jindan
chaos region, a simple yet beautiful golden pair of golden wings
could be seen flying about. Its power was now completely restrained
and reserved, unlike before when it was plainly visible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
finally mastered it. I’ve now mastered both of my secret arts; the
[Grand Diffraction Sword] and the [Lumisword Godwings].” Ning
revealed a look of delight.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Time
to test out their power.” Ning stood there on the plains, staring
into the empty skies. With but a thought from him, a large amount of
power began to flood out of his body and form a pair of golden wings
in the air. The wings were absolutely dazzling, a veritable work of
art, but they didn’t emanate any sword-ki at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
moment later, yet another flood of power surged out of his body. This
time, a large amount of arcing sword-light appeared. Soon, the
countless arcs of sword-light completely filled an area of tens of
thousands of kilometers around Ning. They swept through each other,
sometimes merging together and sometimes bouncing off each other as
they flew about. As for the golden wings, they flew within this storm
of sword-light with incredible speed. The golden wings flew more than
ten times faster than Ning himself could fly. This was a level of
speed which one could not achieve through ordinary movement alone.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swish.
Swish. Swish. The golden wings seemed to be present everywhere within
the region. They were absolutely beautiful, yet also simple and plain
without emanating the slightest hint of sword-ki at all. As they
flew, however, they cut through everything in their path. It was so
powerful that even Ning himself was a bit shocked by them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yin-Yang
Chaosworld.” Ning immediately controlled the two secret arts
together, mixing Yin and Yang to manifest a world of his Sword Dao!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
The golden wings were like an exalted emperor, flying through every
part of the region with abandon. Wherever they appeared, countless
streams of arced sword-light surrounded them, and the two seemed to
form a natural, perfect whole.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
I then combine my Yin-Yang Chaosworld with my heartworld projection…
any foes would probably be scared senseless even before I personally
attacked! With this technique at my disposal, I’m no longer
vulnerable to group attacks, no matter how many come at me!” Ning
was quite delighted. His nine novessence arts actually hadn’t been
a very good fit for his Omega Sword Dao – Yin-Yang, as they had
been primarily elemental in nature. Using secret arts based on the
Dao of the Sword was the most appropriate choice! As for the two
secret arts Ning chose, one just so happened to be Yin-attribute
while the other was Yang-attribute.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
that I’ve mastered my secret arts… it is time to attack.” That
very day, Ning put away his Immortal estate. Then, under the watchful
gazes of all the cultivators of the Sword Palace, he left by himself.</P>

Chapter 8: Emperor Nightwell</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Palace
Lord Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Palace
Lord.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
various cultivators of the Twelve Kingdoms who Ji Ning passed by all
called out to him with great respect. Soon, Ning reached the
spacetime tunnels. Ning chose one of the three tunnels, then entered
it and disappeared without a trace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth has already headed out. He’s heading towards the Flydust
Star.” Some of the black-armored Daolords as well as the other
cultivators began to spread the word. They didn’t know who was
actually seeking this information, but given that Archon Silksnow and
the Aeonians were both searching for Ning, they were naturally able
to use the many channels available for them to accurately and quickly
track Ning’s whereabouts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the void outside the Brightshore Kingdom. Archon Silksnow was
standing guard, his white eyebrows fluttering. Suddenly, a hint of
surprise appeared on his cold face. “The spacetime tunnel which
Daolord Darknorth chose is actually the one which exits the closest
to Silksnow City? Hmph… how clever. He intentionally chose the one
which no one else would’ve suspected. Unfortunately for him, I’ve
arranged for an Emperor to watch over all three of the exits!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Nightwell, Daolord Darknorth is about to appear at the Flydust Star.
All you need to do is to tie him down for a period of time. I’m
heading out immediately.” Archon Silksnow immediately began to
issue orders.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry, Archon!” Emperor Nightwell was filled with confidence in
himself. All of them belonged to the Sacred City of Silksnow, and
they all had avatars back home within the city. As a result, the
avatars were able to instantly communicate with each other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Flydust
Star had once been an ordinary, desolate star. Ever since Hegemon
Brightshore had set up his stable spacetime tunnels, it had become
one of the three tunnel exits. As a result, it naturally became quite
a special place. This area was now protected by ancient and powerful
barriers, and there were black-armored Daolords as well as more
powerful Daolords protecting it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth?” A pudgy old man was in the chaotic void outside Flydust
Star. He had strange white skin and was extremely fat, and he was
dressed in loose robes. He had a pair of soft horns growing out of
his forehead, and a pair of corrosive-looking eyes that gleamed
almost like the cold eyes of a viper. This pudgy, snowy-skinned old
man was Emperor Nightwell, famous for his savagery.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Archon
Silksnow could be described as ‘evil and brutal’ in an open and
visible manner. Emperor Nightwell, by contrast, was ‘insidious and
cruel’ in a shadowy manner. His reputation was absolutely terrible,
and everyone knew him to be a truly maleficent man. Even other
Emperors had once pursued him and attempted to kill him. Once Archon
Silksnow had risen to power, he immediately had Emperor Nightwell
join him as a subordinate. Many savage and cruel Emperors had done
the same, and they had joined together and then taken over one of the
Sacred Cities. They were so strong that their organization was quite
difficult to dislodge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
evil and brutal cultivators were often hated, there was no way to
truly wipe them all out. Now that they had Archon Silksnow as their
leader and other ancient monsters supporting them in secret, they
became an extremely formidable force.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
he comes.” Emperor Nightwell’s gaze was focused upon the tunnel
exit at Flydust Star. He watched as a white-robed youth with a black
sheath on his back suddenly emerged.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“According
to what the Archon said, Darknorth should’ve reached the Archon
level of power and is just slightly weaker than him. Not even the
Archon was able to kill him; he had to rely on a treasure.”
Although Emperor Nightwell held Daolords in disdain, he didn’t dare
to underestimate Daolord Darknorth too much. The man was probably
significantly more powerful than him, after all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
I need to do is to slow him down as much as I can and make sure he
doesn’t break free.” Emperor Nightwell felt quite confident in
his chances.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ji Ning appeared in the void above the Flydust Star, then quickly
flew out of it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning suddenly slowed down, frowning as he stared off into the
distance at the pudgy, bizarrely white-skinned old man who had
suddenly appeared before him. “Emperor Nightwell?” Ning
recognized the man.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
didn’t expect you to know of me, Daolord Darknorth. I’m flattered
and honored.” Emperor Nightwell’s eyes crinkled as he beamed
mirthfully. “I imagine you know why I am here, Daolord Darknorth.
I’ve been standing guard in this place because I wish to invite
you, Daolord Darknorth, to come pay a visit to the Sacred City of
Silksnow. Our Archon truly wishes to meet with you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Invite
me?” Ning smiled coldly. “Very well. Lead the way.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
I’m up ahead leading the way… what if you suddenly run off,
Daolord Darknorth? Wouldn’t that be troublesome? I think you should
enter my estate-world. That way, we can move more quickly and more
conveniently.” Emperor Nightwell continued to beam at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had already decided that he was going to uproot Archon Silksnow’s
entire organization! He had naturally done his research on the
Emperors belonging to the Sacred City of Silksnow. Aside from a few
reclusive old fellows who were hard to find information about, Ning
had essentially gotten full reports on almost all of them. As for
Emperor Nightwell… this pudgy, bizarrely white-skinned old man was
rotten to the core.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Of
the Emperors belonging to the Sacred City of Silksnow who Ning was
planning to kill, Emperor Nightwell definitely ranked in the top
three.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
I enter your estate-world, my life would be in your hands.” Ning
shook his head. “Pardon me for not obliging.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth… given the situation, do you really think you’ll be
able to escape?” Emperor Nightwell’s eyes flashed with cold
light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Escape
from who? You?” Ning chuckled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
might not be able to beat you, Daolord Darknorth, but you can forget
about escaping.” Emperor Nightwell smiled. The reason why Archon
Silksnow had chosen the three of them was because they were highly
skilled at tying down opponents.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
suddenly said in a soft voice, “I’ve heard, Emperor Nightwell,
that for the sake of training your self-created [Nightwell] secret
art, you slaughtered every single infant within a total of 381
territories.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
were nothing more than infants. More are being produced every day,”
Emperor Nightwell said softly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hegemon
Brightshore is a Chaos Godbeast. Hegemon Netherlily is an Ancient.
Hegemon Windrain is an Aberrant. None of them had parents, as all
three were born from the primordial chaos.” Ning said softly, “But
I, however, was born in the mortal world and slowly trained my way
up. When I see someone like you, who used the lives of little babies
to master your secret arts, I have only one thought in my mind… to
kill you! I was worried about being unable to find you, but you
actually delivered yourself right to my doorstep.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
were many evil cultivators who used babies to train in secret arts or
divine abilities; infant placenta, for example, was used in countless
evil techniques. This was because newborn infants represented the
genesis of new life; they were filled with tremendous vitality and
infinite potential.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was filled with the utmost of loathing for these types of
cultivators. Whenever he encountered one, his response could be
summarized in one word: Kill!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ahahaha!
There are plenty who wish to kill me, even amongst Eternal Emperors…
but so what? I’m still doing perfectly fine.” Emperor Nightwell
roared with laughter, his deep Immortal energy causing his laughter
to echo throughout the chaotic void around them. “There are only a
few who can actually kill me, and I stay the hell away from them. As
for you? Daolord Darknorth, you are still just a Daolord. You, kill
me? Hah! Archon Silksnow himself isn’t able to kill me, but you
think you can? Haha…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Nightwell similarly detested people like Ning who wished to kill him
just because he was ‘evil’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Snick.
Snick. Snick…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
six Northbow swords simultaneously flew out of their sheaths. Ning
manifested three heads and six arms, holding all six Northbow swords
at the ready.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth is standing right in front of me, and he’s actually going
to attack me. Don’t worry, Archon; there’s no way I’ll let him
escape.” Emperor Nightwell sent word to Archon Silksnow while
immediately executing his legendary [Nightwell] secret art.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
his bizarrely white skin suddenly extended in every direction like a
giant sack, with the opening of the sack aimed directly at Ning and
sending a surge of sucking power straight towards him. Inside the
giant white sack, only endless darkness could be seen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
held all six Northbow swords as he quietly watched his opponent
charge towards him. The giant white sack quickly flew towards Ning,
seeking to swallow him within the opening. An enormous, hideous face
suddenly appeared at the opening as well. This was Emperor
Nightwell’s face, and that face opened its giant mouth, the teeth
glistening like a hell of countless knives as he bit down towards
Ning, seeking to swallow Ning whole.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
can die now.” Ning showed no mercy at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
A pair of dazzling wings suddenly appeared in the air above Ning. At
the same time, countless arcs of sword-light appeared as well around
Ning. The two instantly combined to form an enormous Yin-Yang
Chaosworld which completely trapped the giant sack within it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
a titanic heartworld projection came descending as well. The
heartworld projection had mountains, rivers, lakes, grasslands, and
prairies that could be seen with clarity. The giant ‘sword
mountain’ at the very center caused a particularly strong sense of
awe and dread. The heartworld projection merged together with the
Yin-Yang Chaosworld perfectly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash!
Slash! Slash! The white sack was instantly torn asunder.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
is this possible?” Emperor Nightwell reappeared in his original
form, but faced by the double dangers of the Yin-Yang Chaosworld and
the heartworld projection, he only felt a sense of tremendous fear.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_36_Chapter_009__Daol"></A>
Chapter 9: Slain</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Prior
to accepting this mission, Archon Silksnow had gotten a clear
understanding of Ji Ning’s strength. An old, insidious fellow like
him would naturally memorize everything. He had never dared to show
the slightest bit of overconfidence; if he had, he wouldn’t have
been able to survive all these years! But no matter how careful he
had been, he had never imagined that Daolord Darknorth’s secret
arts alone would have reached such a terrifying level of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had never encountered such powerful secret arts or such a powerful
heartworld projection before! In fact… he felt that it was highly
likely that there were no Archons whose secret arts could match up to
Daolord Darknorth, even if he factored in all of those old freaks who
had gone into seclusion! Even if there were some who were a match,
there were only three at most!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Faced with such a terrifying Sword Dao world, Emperor Nightwell was
unable to maintain his divine body. He immediately transformed an
inky-black mist that was filled with vileness and which immediately
began to flee. This was Emperor Nightwell’s invulnerable form, and
the reason why he had been able to survive for so long.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
need to escape.” He immediately moved to tear through spacetime as
he fled. “…What’s going on?! Why can’t I escape?” He could
sense that spacetime around him had been completely locked down. What
he didn’t know was that Ning’s Omega Sword Dao had allowed him to
easily tear through spacetime, even at the third stage. Now that Ning
had reached the fourth stage, his Omega Sword Dao – Yin-Yang gave
him tremendously powerful control over spacetime, allowing him to
completely suppress it. Only someone whose Dao surpassed Ning’s in
this regard would be able to tear through spacetime; no one else
would.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">To
surpass Ning? Perhaps only a Hegemon could accomplish it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
treasures.” Emperor NIghtwell immediately sought to try and
activate his treasures meant for fleeing… but it was too late.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Exterminate.”
Ning transformed into a streak of light that charged straight towards
Emperor Nightwell. At the same time, he executed his [Heartforce
Eradicator] technique.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The soundless [Heartforce Eradicator] instantly sliced through the
void and struck against the fleeing black mist.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ahhh!”
Emperor Nightwell could sense the terrifying, eradicating will
collide straight against his soul and truesoul. Ning’s current
heartforce was on a completely different level of power than before.
There was likely no way that an ordinary supreme Daolord would be
able to resist it. However, Emperor Nightwell was someone who had
relied on vile techniques to become an Eternal Emperor and had been
alive for an extremely long period of time. As a result, his
Dao-heart was extremely powerful and he was able to completely endure
Ning’s strike.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The [Heartforce Eradicator] was immediately followed by the
[Dreamstar] art! This time, Emperor Nightwell wasn’t able to endure
the attack and he was drawn into an illusory world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
frantically fleeing black mist suddenly slowed down dramatically, and
the mist even began to slowly condense. Clearly, Emperor Nightwell’s
mind had been swept into the illusions. Without his mind controlling
his invulnerable form, it began to slowly disperse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Die.”
By now, Ning had already caught up, and he showed no mercy at all as
he delivered a fatal strike with all six of his Northbow swords.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Omega
Sword Dao – Heavenbreaker.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Heartsword,
stance twelve – Swordtide!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Each
of Ning’s swords truly did seem like a tidal wave of power, like a
detonating volcano. The strikes rumbled through the black mist… and
right at this lethally dangerous moment, Emperor Nightwell’s strong
Dao-heart finally allowed him to break free of the illusions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
go-” In the exact instant that he broke free from the illusions and
regained his clarity of mind, Emperor NIghtwell saw the six
terrifying sword-tsunamis sweep towards him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Nightwell instantly felt despair, and his invulnerable form began to
break apart under the terrifying attack. Before he regained
consciousness, he had already lost a total of 30% of his invulnerable
form! Now, he had regained consciousness, true… but though he
strove to defend, he realized that he was completely unable to resist
this killer attack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Emperor…
you lied to me. You said he’s slightly weaker than you? He’s far
more powerful than you are! Not even my invulnerable form can endure
his strikes. He’s definitely at the level of a supreme Archon. Most
likely, only the two leaders of the Dao Alliance are on par with
him.” Emperor Nightwell felt despair. He was completely unable to
defend against this type of sword-stance, and his invulnerable form
was unable to ablate enough of the attack power. It was simply beyond
what he could endure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was much like how Ninedust’s invulnerable form would only be able
to protect him against ten or so strikes from Archon Silksnow before
Ninedust would perish. Emperor Nightwell’s invulnerable form was a
bit better than Ninedust’s, but those six strikes Ning had just
unleashed… they were simply terrifying. Emperor Nightwell wasn’t
able to resist them at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
all took time to describe, but in reality Ning struck with incredible
speed. The six sword-tusnamis swept through the black mist,
completely annihilating it. Emperor Nightwell continued to struggle
in the face of death, but it was to no avail. He was completely
eradicated.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Nightwell, a legendary demon who had lived for countless years, died
just like that by Ji Ning’s hands! He became the first person to
lose his life as Ning revealed his true brilliance to the universe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.”
The swords flew back into the sheath, completely clean and unstained.
Everything was calm once more, and everything had vanished. The only
one left behind was the white-robed Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
going on?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
in the world was that enormous world of sword-light?” The Daolords
responsible for watching over the tunnel exit at Flydust Star had all
raised their heads to watch the great battle in the skies. They had
all seen Ning run into Emperor Nightwell in the void, followed by a
battle beginning. As for exactly what had happened in the battle,
they weren’t able to see any of it with clarity. They only saw the
countless streaks of sword-light generated by the enormous Yin-Yang
Chaosworld.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
short while later, the world of sword-light disappeared… and
Emperor Nightwell had disappeared with it. Only the white-robed Ning
was left.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Time
to go.” Ning tore through spacetime and departed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Where’s
Emperor Nightwell?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
saw Emperor Nightwell just a few seconds ago. Why has he suddenly
vanished?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Could
Emperor Nightwell have been defeated?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
that must be it. He was probably defeated and knew that he couldn’t
beat Darknorth, and so he immediately fled.” This was what the
Daolords of Flydust Star believed. None of them dared to believe that
Emperor Nightwell had been slain. Emperor Nightwell had been alive
for far, far too long after all. To slay an old fellow like him would
be far too difficult. Most likely, only the few who truly stood at
the peak of power in the Endless Territories had a chance to kill
him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However…
in truth, Ning already stood at the true peak of power in the Endless
Territories. He was already a match for the two leaders of the Dao
Alliance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
a palace inside the Sacred City of Silksnow. Four figures were seated
around a table here. These were the avatars of Emperor Silksnow and
the three Emperors he had sent off on this mission! Their avatars
were gathered here so they could instantly communicate with each
other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Nightwell, all you need to do is tie him down for a time.” Archon
Silksnow’s avatar was quite relaxed and at ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
easy.” Emperor Nightwell’s avatar laughed as well. A heartbeat
later, Emperor Nightwell’s face turned pale.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
wrong?” Archon Silksnow and the others were startled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He…”
Emperor Nightwell’s avatar began to speak, but his eyes then turned
cloudy and distant as he entered a dazed state. Clearly, he had just
been trapped within Ning’s [Dreamdust] illusions. Moments later,
Emperor Nightwell regained his clarity of mind. A look of terror and
hatred appeared on his face as he cast Archon Silksnow a venomous
glance and growled, “You lied-”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
before his words were finished, his aura completely vanished. The
death of the true body resulted in the death of the avatar as well.
Emperor Nightwell’s avatar slumped over to one side, falling from
his chair onto the ground. This caused Archon Silksnow and the other
two Emperors to turn pale.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
DIED?!” Archon Silksnow was stunned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
is this possible? How could Emperor Nightwell have died?!” The
other two Emperors had turned pale as well. Emperor Nightwell had
been alive for far too long; he had already been an Emperor for many,
many years back when Archon Silksnow had attempted his Daomerge. An
old fellow like him certainly had many powerful life-preserving
abilities… but he actually died, just like that? At the hands of a
Daolord?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Archon
Silksnow had an ugly look on his face. After a few moments of
silence, he said, “Brother Nightwell was momentarily dazed. He
probably fell to an illusion! Most likely, after he recovered he
didn’t have enough time to activate his invulnerable form before Ji
Ning slew him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Agreed.”
The other two Emperors nodded. Neither of them could believe that
Emperor Nightwell would be slain while his invulnerable form was
active. In addition, they saw for themselves that Emperor Nightwell
had indeed fallen to an illusion.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
matter what… the end result was that Emperor Nightwell died,” the
red-robed, red-haired woman said softly. Utter silence met her words.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">True…
he had died. The exalted Emperor Nightwell had died, just like that.
Died by the hands of a Daolord.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“His
illusions are actually as strong as this?” Archon Silksnow murmured
softly, “Last time, when we fought, he shouldn’t have been this
strong… could he have come up with an even more profound illusion
technique?” Daolord Featherdress’ [Featherdress Soulthrall
Melody], for example, would’ve been capable of affecting Emperor
Nightwell. Ning’s illusions weren’t actually that profound, but
his heartworld had reached a far higher level and so his illusions
had become much more powerful than before.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
going to head to the Flydust Star right away.” Archon Silksnow’s
oily green eyes flashed with fierce light. “I won’t let him
escape.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Archon
Silksnow was so enraged that he immediately used his battered
realmship, using it to fly straight to the Flydust Star.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Where?
Where is he?!” The skinny, snowy-robed old man’s white eyebrows
fluttered as he scanned the surrounding void with his oily green
eyes. “Where is Daolord Darknorth? Why can’t I sense him?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Did
he flee? You slew Emperor Nightwell. There’s no way I’ll let you
escape!” Archon Silksnow was burning with rage… but he had no
idea that after slaying Emperor Nightwell, Ning had immediately flown
towards the Sacred City of Silksnow at maximum speed!</P>

Chapter 10: Descending Upon Silksnow City</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sacred City of Silksnow was an extremely beautiful place.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
beautiful.” Two Daolords were flying side-by-side, staring at
Silksnow City from afar. The entire Sacred City was composed of
countless palaces and estates that were connected to each other, each
built atop a cloud. It truly was surpassingly beautiful. In addition,
Silksnow City was perpetually covered by countless drifting
snowflakes, giving it a pristine and holy appearance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Big
brother Ironshow, didn’t you say that Silksnow City is one of the
eight Sacred Cities and is governed by the bloodthirsty Silksnow
Fiend Palace? The disciples of Silksnow Fiend Palace are all
incredibly evil and demonic in nature. All of them are tremendous
sinners… is it really possible that these demons are in charge of
this beautiful Sacred City?” the young violet-robed Daolord
transmitted mentally.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
nothing can be judged by appearances!” The muscular and heavily
armored Daolord Ironshow laughed as he responded mentally, “Silksnow
Fiend Palace is indeed an extremely evil sect, but this is still
their home, one of the eight Sacred Cities of the Dao Alliance. They
naturally have to take good care of it! Look at the snow. It looks
beautiful as it drifts through the air, right? But amongst
cultivators, there is a legend that every single one of the
snowflakes drifting through Silksnow City was formed from the blood
of countless murdered victims…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
violet-robed youth glanced at the beautiful snow drifting through the
skies. When he thought of how they were formed by endless amounts of
blood, his face couldn’t help but pale slightly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Violetflame,
you are a new Daolord. This is your first visit to a Sacred City.”
Daolord Ironshow continued to fly forwards while pointing from afar:
“I’ll explain some of the rules of the Sacred City to you. Look
at those palaces over there. Whenever you are within an area covered
by those barriers, all violence and combat is forbidden no matter how
strong you are. If you do attack someone, that means you are
challenging the authority of the Dao Alliance… and challenging the
authority of Silksnow Fiend Palace! As the rulers of this Sacred
City, they’ll send a large number of major powers to slay any who
violate the laws.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
violet-robed youth hurriedly nodded upon hearing this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thus…
the Sacred Cities are quite safe. Many Daolords have set up residence
in them and engage in secluded meditation, because not even Eternal
Emperors would dare to break the rules,” Daolord Ironshow said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Got
it.” The youth nodded again. Break the rules? Challenge Silksnow
Fiend Palace? Provoke the Dao alliance? How would a new Daolord like
himself even dare to imagine such a thing?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Outside
of the barriers surrounding the palaces, everything is fair game,”
Daolord Ironshow said. “That’s why we have to be careful.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
just keep following you, big brother Ironshow,” the violet-robed
Daolord said. He then asked curiously, “Have there ever been any
major powers who have started a fight within a Sacred City and broken
its rules?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
three legendary Hegemons would definitely dare to do such a thing,”
Daolord Ironshow said, “And the Dao Alliance does have internal
struggles! The Dao Alliance is simply far too vast, which is why
there is quite a bit of combat amongst its most powerful member
organizations. Archon Silksnow is legendary for how many he has
massacred and slaughtered, and a large number of Emperors belonging
to the Dao Alliance have died by his hand. It was slaughter and
murder which gave him his current position and the right to rule over
this Sacred City. He even renamed it ‘Silksnow City’ after
himself!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
eight Sacred Cities all had extremely long histories. Every so often,
their rulers would change. For example, prior to Archon Silksnow
succeeding in his Daomerge, this city had been ruled by a different
organization and had a different name. Archon Silksnow’s rise to
power resulted in many great sinners following him, giving him a
powerful organization of his own. As a result, he was able to take
control over this Sacred City.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Big
brother Ironshow, look! Quick!” The violet-robed youth’s face
turned pale as he pointed off into the distance. Puzzled, Daolord
Ironshow followed his gaze.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
watched from afar as an inky-black tear in space appeared. A
white-robed youth bearing a black sheath on his back emerged from the
spatial tear. The youth stared off into the distance, scanning the
area with his gaze. As he did so, a surge of terrifying power and
presence descended upon the region. It was an enormous heartworld
projection, and it instantly crashed down upon the entire Sacred City
of Silksnow.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“B-but…”
The violet-robed youth and Daolord Ironshow both turned ashen. When
they looked at the heartworld projection around them, they felt a
sense of terror that came from the innermost depths of their souls.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
power of the heartworld projection had yet to be truly unleashed, but
even so it was enough to inspire terror in them. If it was unleashed…
they knew that they would be instantly annihilated.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Their
senses were correct! Given how strong Ji Ning’s heartworld
projection had become, even Eternal Emperors would turn pale before
its might, to say nothing of Daolords.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Who?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Who
dares to suppress the Sacred City!?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Who
dares to challenge us, the Silksnow Fiend Palace?!” The Fiend
Palace was located in one particular corner of Silksnow City, and
auras of tremendous power instantly shot into the skies as various
figures began to fly out. The leader was Archon Silksnow’s avatar!
Behind him were the other Emperors. Some of the Emperors were here in
person, some had their avatars present. In total, an awe-inspiring
process of over twenty Emperors had gathered together. This was a
terrifying array.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Silksnow!”
the white-robed youth called out icily, his voice shaking the heavens
and the earth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
going on?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
is this?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
have so many Emperors appeared?” The many Daolords who were in
secluded meditation within their personal estate all emerged, as did
the various attendants, Daolords, and weaker World-level cultivators
who were within some of the public palaces. They all raised their
heads, stunned and curious, to see what was happening afar. Most
likely, this was something which they would never see again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
white-robed youth was facing off against twenty-plus Eternal Emperors
led by Archon Silksnow. The two sides gazed at each other from afar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Big
brother Ironshow, d-didn’t you just say… that this place is very
safe? That only the thre Hegemons and the most elite organizations
within the Dao Alliance would dare to challenge Silksnow Fiend
Palace?” The violet-robed youth was rather dazed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
are very few who dare challenge them… but that doesn’t mean there
are none.” Daolord Ironshow was rather shocked as well. He
hurriedly pulled his brother away and hid within one of the nearby
palaces that was within the area protected by the barriers. “Let’s
hide for now. We’ll be finished if we get caught up in a battle
between major powers like them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right,
right.” The violet-robed youth nodded repeatedly, but a look of
excitement was in his eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hey…
isn’t that white-robed youth Daolord Darknorth?” A voice rang out
from nearby. It was one of the other watching Daolords.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh,
right!” Daolord Ironshow was stunned and puzzled as he stared from
afar. “He looks identical to the figure I saw in the intelligence
report I purchased. That white-robed youth is Daolord Darknorth! How
is it that he dares to challenge the Silksnow Fiend Palace? No matter
how powerful a Daolord is, he’s not even close to being a match for
the Archons of the Sacred Cities. T-this makes no sense at all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Big
brother Ironshow, is that guy over there really Daolord Darknorth?”
the violet-robed youth asked curiously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“From
his appearance, he should be… but it doesn’t make sense for
Daolord Darknorth to challenge the entire Silksnow Fiend Palace.”
Daolord Ironshow was puzzled. “I really can’t be sure if that is
actually Daolord Darknorth at all.” But right at that moment…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
you really are suicidal.” The leader of that distant group of
Eternal Emperors, Archon Silksnow, spoke out in a booming voice that
echoed in the world. All of the countless puzzled cultivators within
Silksnow City instantly realized that the white-robed youth was in
fact the legendary ‘Daolord Darknorth’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
incredible! A Daolord actually dares to challenge all of Silksnow
Fiend Palace in such a dominating manner? They are one of the eight
organizations which rule over the Sacred Cities!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
absolutely incredible.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
a bold man! Even if he ends up being defeated, I’ll still feel
nothing but admiration for him.” Countless cultivators sighed in
shock and awe, and many of them naturally sided with Ning. This was
because no matter how much they trained, for them to become Eternal
Emperors was an almost hopelessly impossible task. They would at most
become Daolords of the fourth Step… and so they felt absolutely
exhilarated that a Daolord like them would dare to challenge Silksnow
Fiend Palace. Sheer pleasure coursed through their veins at the very
thought.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Yes,
we Daolords might be weak! But the strongest of us, the strongest
Daolords, still dare to challenge even one of the eight rulers of the
Sacred Cities!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
countless watching cultivators all mentally supported Ning. However…
they all believed that Daolord Darknorth had no chance to actually
win. Even his chances to survive this would be extremely slim.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had travelled here at maximum speed. Given his high level of insight
into the Dao, he was able to tear through even greater distances
through spacetime. Finally, he reached the Sacred City of Silksnow…
and he had immediately unleashed his heartworld projection without
hesitation. He wanted to immediately make a show of strength!
Instantly, an entire host of Eternal Emperors had come flying out. He
counted a total of twenty-six of them! However, Ning could sense that
most were merely avatars. Even the leader, Archon Silksnow, was
merely an avatar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Silksnow,”
Ning called out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
front of the awesome, distant group of Eternal Emperors standing in
midair was their leader, Archon Silksnow. Silksnow, however, was in a
rather dazed state of disbelief. He couldn’t believe that Ning had
come to his headquarters to attack him. Was the man suicidal? Moments
later, the Archon let out a laugh: “Darknorth, you really are
suicidal.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
you think you can kill me, come and try.” Ning swept his gaze
across the group of Eternal Emperors, each of them flaring out their
auras mightily. Ning smiled. “Do you plan to all come at once?
That’s fine as well. It’ll be fun for me to beat all twenty-six
of you Emperors at once.”</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning’s heartworld projection covered the entire Sacred City, and so
his voice naturally echoed throughout every part of it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, Silksnow Fiend Palace wanted to contain and minimize this
disturbance as much as possible. Just the very fact that Daolord
Darknorth dared to so flagrantly attack them was already a loss of
face, even though they would kill him in the end. They naturally
wanted fewer people to know about this matter! Alas, as soon as
Ning’s heartworld projection descended they knew that there was no
way to keep this secret.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning,
however, wanted to ‘kill a chicken to scare the monkeys’ in a
display of force. He wanted to let everyone know just how powerful he
had become. Naturally, there was no need to keep anything secret.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Absolutely
dominating.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is exhilarating! Just listening to him talk makes me excited. Will I
ever reach a level where I would dare to stand in front of over
twenty Eternal Emperors and tell them that I’ll fight them by
myself? If I can ever have such a crowning moment of glory, even
dying away the next instant would be worth it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
never been a Daolord this powerful before, right?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
countless cultivators within the Sacred City all felt their blood
begin to boil with excitement when they heard Ning’s words. They
all felt that for a Samsara Daolord to be able to act like Ning just
did was simply incredible. Anything would be worth it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth has actually attacked the Sacred City of Silksnow. He’s
facing off against twenty-six Emperors from Silksnow Fiend Palace.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
battle is about to start right away.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is probably the last fight Daolord Darknorth will ever be in. He’s
probably going to die here.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Move,
move, MOVE! If you don’t get here in time, you won’t be able to
see this battle.” Word quickly spread out. News of this incredible
event almost instantly spread throughout the most elite organizations
within the Endless Territories.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!”
Hegemon Brightshore was shocked as well when he heard this. “He
actually attacked Silksnow Fiend Palace? He’s a Daolord! What gives
him this sort of courage?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
actually attacked Silksnow Fiend Palace?” Emperor Anchen and the
other Emperors of the Aeonians were shocked as well. They had been
frantically searching for traces of Ning, wanting to kill him and
take back that unique omnigeddon bloodfruit tree. “Daolord
Darknorth… what the hell is wrong with him? Has he lost his mind?
Or does he have some special item he’s planning to rely on? But
he’s still just a Daolord, and he’s facing off against one of the
eight Sacred Cities!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go, quick! We’re going to go watch.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
heading off right now.” Emperor Islehide immediately prepared for
departure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
avatar will accompany with you. I want to see with my own eyes what
this Daolord Darknorth character is up to.” Although Emperor Anchen
had always stood guard over the Aeonian Kingdom, even he elected to
send his avatar off to watch this fight.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">News
quickly spread throughout the Endless Territories. The three mighty
Hegemons, some of the more famous Emperors, and some of the
reclusive, lesser-known Emperors all grew curious and began to hasten
towards Silksnow City. No one had ever heard of any Daolord ever
daring to challenge one of the eight Sacred Cities; this was
something that had never happened in all of history! Curious, they
all hurried to the scene of battle. Alas, the distance was quite
great; to actually get there would take some time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Quite
bold, audaciously so. Do you really think that you merit all of us
Emperors working together to kill you?” Instantly, a droopy-browed
and ugly-looking Emperor began to shout at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
doesn’t know his own limits.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
wants to die under our combined might? In his dreams.” These
ancient Eternal Emperors all stared at the distant white-robed youth
with disdain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
they joined forces, even if they killed Ning they would have gained
no face. For Emperors with eternal lifespans, face was of paramount
importance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Even
if you want to die, you still aren’t worthy of twenty-six Emperors
doing the honors together,” Archon Silksnow laughed coldly. He
glanced backwards at an Emperor who had a pair of black wings on his
back and sent mentally, “Brother Blackrot, Emperor Nightwell died
by the hands of Daolord Darknorth. Daolord Darknorth is extremely
strong, just slightly weaker than myself. His illusions are
particularly powerful; Emperor Nightwell died because he fell to
Darknorth’s illusions. You were born with tremendous skill over
illusions; you shouldn’t be susceptible to his heartforce
illusions. You go first and test his power out.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well.” Emperor Blackrot narrowed his eyes as they gleamed with cold
light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Bloodcloud.” Archon Silksnow sent another mental message to the
black-robed elder who stood virtually side-by-side with him. “Daolord
Darknorth is probably just a bit weaker than me, but my true body is
still on the way back from the outside world. My avatar doesn’t
have any good weapons on it; it’s probably not a match for
Darknorth. Of all the Emperors present, you are the only one capable
of defeating him in a head-on fight. You shall be the one to decide
how we are to deal with Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Bloodcloud was one of the old freaks who supported Archon Silksnow
from the shadows. He was Silksnow’s equal in power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
doesn’t have an invulnerable form, does he?” Emperor Bloodcloud
asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
does not,” Archon Silksnow responded with certainty. He had used a
treasure to kill Ning, and back then Ning hadn’t revealed a
invulnerable form. Archon Silksnow felt certain that Ning didn’t
have an invulnerable form! In addition, he had never heard of anyone
developing an invulnerable form based on the Dao of the Sword. Alas,
he had no idea that while it was indeed extremely difficult for the
Dao of the Sword to produce an invulnerable form… there was always
an exception. After Ning’s Omega Sword Dao had reached the fourth
stage, he had finally gained an invulnerable form for himself… the
Shadowless form.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
he doesn’t have an invulnerable form, I’m confident in being able
to kill him.” Emperor Bloodcloud nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
sending Emperor Blackrot to go first and test him out. Watch
carefully,” Archon Silksnow said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well.” Emperor Bloodcloud nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Just
by standing there, the group of Emperors inspired terror in the
countless cultivators who were watching… but Ning was completely
unphased.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth, was it you who killed brother Nightwell?” A cold voice
rang out, followed by an ugly, black-winged alien Emperor flying out
of the group, filled with murderous malice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
was.” Ning’s voice filled the entire region covered within his
heartworld projection. “And you are Emperor Blackrot. Have you
decided to throw your life away, just as Emperor Nightwell did before
you?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">To
use the terminology of the Three Realms, Emperor Blackrot belonged to
the ‘Diremonster’ category. He had been born as a winged monster
who was born with a fondness for eating rotten meat. He had an
extremely strange and evil disposition, and his favorite hobby was
massacring people, waiting for their bodies to rot, and then eat
their rotting corpses. That was it – he murdered people to eat
them. This fiend had long ago offended many other cultivators who
wished to kill him, and so he joined the auspices of Silksnow Fiend
Palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Throw
my life away? To you?” Emperor Blackrot was enraged. “Prepare to
die.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.”
Ning’s body flickered slightly as he manifested three heads and six
arms, then brought his six Northbow swords to the ready.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Blackrot transformed into an enormous tornado of black mist which
swept straight towards Ning. This wasn’t a simple invulnerable
form; in truth, this was the attack which Emperor Blackform was most
skilled in using. Anything touched by this black mist would
immediately rot away until nothing was left. Even supreme Daolords
would be unable to withstand this attack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
addition, a terrifying illusion was hidden within the black mist.
Anyone trapped within it would smile and seek out death without even
trying to fight back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth has started to fight against Emperor Blackrot.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Emperor
Blackrot is an extremely terrifying Eternal Emperor. Not even supreme
Daolords dare to offend him.” The countless cultivators within the
Sacred City all watched.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Suppress!”
Ning let out a cold shout. The formerly-restrained energy of the
heartworld projection instantly flared in the area where the black
mist was located! The terrifying heartworld projection was like a
cage that completely trapped the black mist, causing its flying speed
to lessen dramatically.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
can die now.” The six swords struck out like tidal waves, carrying
an aura of utterly destructive power with them. Countless
tsunami-swords swept through the black mist which so many Daolords
were terrified of. Although it contained extremely strong corrosive
and poisonous properties and was filled with terrifying illusions, it
wasn’t actually less effective than Emperor Nightwell’s
invulnerable form in terms of ablating the power of enemy attacks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“NO!!!”
Emperor Blackrot instantly felt despair, and he let out a horrified
scream. The last thing he felt before perishing was regret… and
venomous hatred towards Archon Silksnow. It was Archon Silksnow who
had warned him that Darknorth’s illusions were very powerful, but
that Darknorth was slightly weaker than the Archon himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Blackrot
had felt certain that even if he had to fight Archon Silksnow, he
would still be able to block a few dozen attacks. Daolord Darknorth,
however, had just annihilated him with just a single attack. Weaker
than Archon Silksnow? He was clearly much, much more powerful!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoooosh.
His black mist form was completely extinguished by Ning’s
sword-shadows… and Emperor Blackrot became the second Emperor to
perish under Ning’s sword since Ning’s decision to reveal his
brilliance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
world returned to its normal calm. Ning called his swords back and
sent them back into their sheaths. He stood tall and simply stared at
the twenty-five completely awestruck Emperors. Archon Silksnow in
particular had a look of utter disbelief on his face. He truly
couldn’t believe what had just happened. Just a ‘short’ while
ago, he had completely dominated Daolord Darknorth… how had the man
become this powerful? This was completely impossible!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No.
No. This makes no sense whatsoever.” Archon Silksnow couldn’t
understand it. How could a Daolord be THIS powerful?</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_36_Chapter_012__Daol"></A>
Chapter 12: All Together!</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Archon
Silksnow and all of his Eternal Emperors were dazed and in a state of
disbelief. They had been accustomed to being exalted figures for
countless years, and they were used to holding Daolords in disdain!
There was a qualitative difference between Emperors and Daolords, and
the chasm between the two was as great as the gap between Heaven and
Earth. Ever since the most ancient of times, there had never been a
Daolord who could stand at the very apex of power in the Endless
Territories.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">What
did the apex of power mean? It didn’t mean you were necessarily the
strongest… but it meant that you did not need to fear anyone.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Archons of the Sacred Cities were capable of making this claim. They
might not be able to defeat the three Hegemons, but at least they
were confident in staying alive in the face of a Hegemonic attack!
Unless, of course, the three Hegemons were willing to pay the
enormous price needed to kill an Archon. Otherwise, killing them
would be extremely hard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">These
people made up the very apex of power in the Flamedragon Realmverse…
and Daolords had never, ever joined their ranks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“H-he’s
a Daolord… how can he be this powerful? He slew Emperor Blackrot in
just one strike?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
so strong! He should be even stronger than Archon Silksnow.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“None
of the eight Archons are necessarily a match for him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Can
Daolords really become as powerful as this?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Can
he have succeeded in his Daomerge and become an Emperor? Given how
powerful he previously was… if he really did succeed in his
Daomerge, he’d definitely become a Hegemon. He’s extremely
powerful, but he doesn’t give me that sense of Hegemonic pressure…
he probably isn’t a Hegemon yet. He’s still a Daolord. But how
can a Daolord be this powerful?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">These
Emperors were filled with many different things. This had completely
overturned their worldview, overturned common sense itself. When Ning
revealed his fierceness, he had completely overthrown the notion that
Daolords weren’t worthy of any consideration!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Far away within the void outside Silksnow City was Hegemon
Brightshore. He had secretly hurried here and was watching from afar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth
is actually this powerful?” Hegemon Brightshore was surprised,
delighted, but also puzzled. He was surprised at delighted by the
fact that the Brightshore Kingdom had finally gained a new major
power (aside from himself) that was capable of overawing the various
organizations within the Endless Territories. His confusion, however,
stemmed from the fact that not even he understood how Ning had
reached such a level of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
faced Archon Silksnow and his Emperors, not even bothering to
disguise the murderous look in his eyes at all. His gaze focused on
Archon Silksnow, and he growled: “What… Archon Silksnow, are you
afraid now? Too afraid to fight me? Do you want to send all of your
Emperors out to surround and attack me?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Archon
Silksnow had an ugly look on his face. His white brows fluttered, and
his oily green eyes were filled with cold light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
are you hesitating? What are you afraid of?” Ning stared at him.
“Haven’t you been doing your best to track me down? I’ve come
right to you, and we’re in front of your base… and NOW you are
afraid?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
were indeed afraid. Of the twenty-five Emperors, only Archon Silksnow
and Emperor Bloodcloud were able to remain fairly calm. The others
felt a sense of intense fear when they stared at the distant
white-robed youth with a black sheath on his back. They did indeed
fear him, because they understood that he could probably kill them
with just one blow! He was even considerably more powerful than
Archon Silksnow himself. How could they not be afraid of him?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
should we do, Silksnow?” Emperor Bloodcloud sent frantically, “This
Daolord Darknorth is much more powerful than you claimed. He’s
stronger than both of us! You want ME to deal with HIM? How?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
panic. Don’t panic!” Archon Silksnow hurriedly sent a mental
message to calm his old friend: “I didn’t expect him to be this
strong either. Back when we fought, he really was weaker than me. In
fact, he died once by my hands! I have no idea how he suddenly became
as strong as this! But don’t worry, my true body is already
returning at maximum speed and will soon arrive. We’ll work
together to command the other Emperors to set up a formation together
to deal with him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Set
up a formation to deal with him?” Emperor Bloodcloud hesitated.
“Using that against a Daolord… we’re going to lose a lot of
face once people hear about it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Face
doesn’t matter at a time like this! Daolord Darknorth is indeed
powerful, and he’s qualified to force us to do this.” Archon
Silksnow’s eyes glimmered with cold malice as he sent mentally,
“Since he’s attacked our home and headquarters, the Silksnow
Fiend Palace, then we should give him what he asks for. All of us
shall join together into a formation to kill him. He walks the path
of the Dao of the Sword; he shouldn’t have an invulnerable form!
That means we have a chance to kill him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
very powerful. Even if we do set up a formation, we won’t
necessarily succeed.” Emperor Bloodcloud still wasn’t convinced
by this plan.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
give it a shot. We still have a chance,” Emperor Silksnow sent.
“All Daolords are madmen when they fail their Daomerge. If Daolord
Darknorth fails his in the future, he’ll act even more berserk than
he is today. If he doesn’t die? We’ll probably have to hide for
the rest of our lives and avoid him. Are you willing to live a life
like that?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fine,
we’ll give it a try.” Emperor Bloodcloud agreed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
true body has just arrived.” Archon Silksnow revealed a delighted
look. His avatar was still significantly weaker than his true body,
especially since it didn’t have any formidable lifeblood weapons on
it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
this all took time to describe, only a few seconds had passed since
Ning had slain Emperor Blackrot and said a few words. Right at this
moment, a dimensional ripple appeared off in the distance. Ning
couldn’t help but turn his head, only to see a skinny, white-robed
man fly towards the city at high speed, his white brows fluttering.
It was Archon Silksnow.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
came quite fast.” Ning chuckled softly. “Killing your avatar is
meaningless. I’ve been waiting for your true body to come.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Quite
audacious.” Archon Silksnow immediately flew forwards, joining
together with Emperor Bloodcloud and the others as he roared angrily,
“Fellow Emperors, Daolord Darknorth has actually dared to assault
us, the Silksnow Fiend Palace. Let us send him to his death.
Everyone, attack!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!”
Archon Silksnow and Emperor Bloodcloud were both filled with the
desire to do murder. As they were the leaders of the group, the other
Emperors all joined together, following their lead to attack.
Although some were here in person, most were mere avatars. However,
Emperor-class avatars had incredibly strong Immortal energy, and when
used to set up a formation they weren’t much weaker than their true
bodies. All of a sudden, an enormous blood-colored wheel appeared and
began to slowly turn as it surged towards Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
killing formation was incredibly famous in the Endless Territories.
It was known as the ‘Seven Killers of the Blood Disk’ formation.
It had been created by a reclusive and ancient Emperor of the Dao
Alliance, and the Silksnow Fiend Palace used it to guard themselves
and fight against their opponents.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
a terrifying killer formation.” The countless cultivators in the
Sacred City all held their breaths. They could sense that this time,
Daolord Darknorth was in real danger. Who could possibly resist such
a grand formation when set up by Archon Silksnow and so many other
Emperors?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
laughed. “A formation? Is that all you got?” An invisible surge
of power swept out from Ning. [Heartforce Eradicator]!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
Omega Sword Dao had already reached the fourth stage, making his
heartforce eradication art even more profound than before. Ning’s
[Heartforce Eradicator] had always been based off the secrets of his
Omega Sword Dao. Now, a terrifying will of annihilation swept out and
struck against the souls and truesouls of all of the twenty-plus
Emperors. Although the formation was formidable, it didn’t hinder
Ning’s heartforce in the slightest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Eradication!!!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
twenty-five Emperors all felt their souls and truesouls suffer a
powerful strike, and they hurriedly relied on their Dao-hearts to
resist the strike.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ahhhh!”
A series of screams rang out. Of the twenty-plus Emperors, five of
them perished on the spot, their souls exterminated.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was rather surprised. His [Heartforce Eradicator] was now far more
powerful than it had been in the past, giving him a chance to slay
even supreme Daolords. However, he knew that these Eternal Emperors
had all been alive for extremely long periods of time, and their
Dao-hearts had been tempered to be incredibly strong. To use the
[Heartforce Eradicator] to slay them should’ve been quite
difficult. How did he just kill five at one blow?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
makes sense. The ones which died were all avatars; avatars only have
part of the true body’s godsense within it, after all.” Ning
suddenly understood.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Avatars
contained part of their owner’s godsense within them. Their souls
were much weaker than the souls within true bodies, and so they were
much weaker when resisting heartforce attacks. Thus, five of them
instantly perished to Ning’s [Heartforce Eradicator].</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
good.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Our
formation’s been broken!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Quick,
assemble into a different formation.” Archon Silksnow and Emperor
Bloodcloud immediately realized that they were in trouble. Now that
five Emperors’ avatars had been exterminated, their formation had
been blown apart. They immediately changed into a different variation
of the formation to make up for their losses. The ‘Seven Killers of
the Blood Disk’ formation had to have at least seven people within
it in order to set up the formation, but it could scale up
indefinitely. All they had to do was to change the formation
slightly, and they’d be able to make up for the breaches. However…
things wouldn’t develop as smoothly as they had hoped.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Dreamstar
art.” After unleashing the [Heartforce Eradicator], Ning
immediately executed his [Dreamstar] illusions.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
[Dreamstar] art was even more insidious than the [Heartforce
Eradicator]. It was harder to defend against and completely
undetectable, capable of causing Emperors to be drawn into illusions
before they even knew what was happening. It must be remembered that
Emperor Nightwell had an extremely strong Dao-heart, but he was still
caught by the illusions. One could imagine how powerful Ning’s
[Dreamstar] art had become! The Archons who were at the same level as
him might be able to resist it, but those who were a level lower than
him would find it quite hard to defend against.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Of
the surviving Emperors, a total of sixteen were instantly trapped
within the Dreamstar illusions. Five had died, while sixteen had been
trapped within the illusions. The entire ‘Seven Killers of the
Blood Disk’ formation crumbled apart before a single blow was
struck.</P>

Chapter 13: Absolute Massacre</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Our
formation! Our formation!” Archon Silksnow and Emperor Bloodcloud
were both flabbergasted. Right now, only five Emperors were still
able to maintain their clarity of mind, the two of them included.
There was no way they could continue to form the ‘Seven Killers of
the Blood Disk’ formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!”
After executing the [Heartforce Eradicator] and the [Dreamdust]
illusions in succession, Ji Ning made his move.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
countless arcs of light appeared in the area around Ning. At the same
time, a dazzlingly beautiful pair of golden wings appeared above Ning
as well. Under the direction of the golden wings, the countless arcs
of sword-light began to form into a chaosworld generated by the Dao
of the Sword. The golden wings then howled through the air, instantly
flying over towards the Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
golden wings simply flew far, far too fast. They had to be at least
ten times faster than Ning’s flying speed!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! Boom!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Omega
Sword Dao – Yin-Yang! This domain had been created via a pair of
partially-mastered Hegemonic secret arts, and its power was so great
as to be inconceivable.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
golden wings howled through the air as they sliced at the divine
bodies of the Emperors who were present in person. The avatars all
had bodies comparable to peak Eternal treasures, making them
impossible to kill… but the ‘real’ Emperors had fairly frail
bodies in comparison. Even though Ning had a precious Hegemonic
legacy, he had to use up an absolutely enormous amount of treasures
in order to train his body to the high-grade Eternal treasure level.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Most
of these Emperors had bodies comparable to low-grade Eternal
treasures. A few had reached the middle-grade Eternal treasure level,
and extremely few had reached the high-grade Eternal treasure level.
If they were able to focus their efforts on defending, they would be
able to do so… but they were trapped in illusions and completely
incapable of fighting back. Ning was able to attack them with
impunity; how could they possibly endure in a situation like this?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was much like what had happened when Ning was still very weak and
paid a visit to the Azureflower Estate. Although his body had been
comparable to a low-grade Eternal treasure at the time, he had nearly
been beaten to death by one of the two overseers. Thankfully, he had
a suit of Hegemon armor on him! These Emperors, however, certainly
didn’t have Hegemonic armor on them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash!
Slash! Slash! In the blink of an eye, the sharp feathers of the
golden wings sliced through six of the Eternal Emperors. They were
chopped apart, then ground into dust by the countless arcs of light.
They died on the spot. Two Eternal Emperors, had sufficiently strong
protective divine abilities that they managed to survive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Six
more down.” Ning showed no mercy at all; he felt nothing save the
desire to kill the Emperors under the banner of Silksnow Fiend
Palace. All of them had gone beyond the bounds of mere dispassionate
selfishness and into the level of being true ‘demons’. That was
why so many Emperors hated them and wished to kill them. However,
these demons had joined forces to form a powerful organization,
making it so that the other Emperors didn’t dare to offend them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clang!
Clang! Clang! Sword-light continuously clashed against the avatars,
creating clanking sounds. The avatars, however, managed to endure the
strikes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for the three Emperors who were able to maintain their mental
clarity, they were completely stunned by this. Six of them had died
almost instantly? Only now did they understand that Daolord Darknorth
had the power to kill them with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Archon,
we can’t fight him head-on.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Archon,
we’re going to leave now.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ah?!”
“B-b-but…” The two who had been trapped by the illusions but
who had sufficiently strong protective divine abilities and thus
survived Ning’s attacks now finally came back to their senses. They
were terrified by what they saw, and they immediately began to flee.
There was no time for them to show sympathy to others; they
immediately used their best escape-type treasures to flee. The twin
suppressive effects of the Sword Dao chaosworld and the heartworld
projection caused their flying speed to be dramatically lowered, and
they didn’t want to spend a minute longer than was necessary.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Just
a few moments ago, Archon Silksnow and Emperor Bloodcloud had been
leading the Emperors in surrounding and attacking Ning… but in the
blink of an eye, six of the Emperors had perished, five of the
avatars had been destroyed, and the remaining avatars had all been
trapped by illusions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
surviving Emperors all began to flee. Only Archon Silksnow and
Emperor Bloodcloud remained safe and sound… for now.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
secret art…?” Emperor Bloodcloud had an ugly look on his face as
he stared at the countless arcs of sword-light and the golden pair of
wings. “Silksnow, you actually tried to tell me that he’s
slightly weaker than you? These secret arts alone are already vastly
beyond our level of power.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
the hell could I have known that he’s this powerful?!” Archon
Silksnow was feeling frustrated and frantic as well. “Eh?” Archon
Silksnow’s face tightened. “Where’s Darknorth? He suddenly
vanished.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“An
assassination art. I’ve heard of his assassination arts.” Emperor
Bloodcloud’s face tightened as well. He also realized that Ning had
vanished, and this was something which shocked both of them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
an endless sea of blood come forth,” Emperor Bloodcloud growled,
immediately unleashing his invulnerable form and transforming into a
vast sea of blood that filled the surrounding area and protected
Archon Silksnow.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash!
A streak of sword-light tore through the bloody waves. “It’s
Darknorth!” Emperor Bloodcloud and Archon Silksnow both turned pale
as the three-headed, six-armed, white-robed Ning suddenly appeared.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
used his six Northbow swords to tear through the waves of blood as he
shot straight towards Archon Silksnow. He snapped coldly, “Silksnow,
prepare to die.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
Godwings were truly ridiculously fast. Ning himself was a bit slower,
but he was still faster than Archon Silksnow, especially now that the
Archon was being suppressed by the heartworld projection. However,
Archon Silksnow refused to admit defeat. He also manifested six arms,
holding a warblade in each as he charged towards Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning’s swords flowed like water, bringing a tsunami of sword-light
with them. They possessed the explosive power of tidal waves but were
also incredibly gentle, almost like the caress of a lover.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Archon Silksnow’s face changed. He strove to use his six warblades
to block the soft and nearly invisible sword-arts Ning was using, but
Ning’s upgraded [Heartsword] made his sword-arts even more ghostly
than before. His attacks were also noticeably faster, giving Archon
Silksnow no chance to block them at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Two
of the streaks of sword-light coiled around his body like fingers,
beginning to tie him up in knots. Whoosh! Archon Silksnow immediately
transformed into countless snowflakes that fled and then reformed off
in the distance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Running?”
Ning felt a bit unsettled as well. He wasn’t sure if he would be
able to kill Archon Silksnow, as his opponent had an invulnerable
form. Good invulnerable forms were just too hard to deal with.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
can he be this strong? His sword-arts are simply too fast. He beat me
in just one exchange!” Archon Silksnow was running around while
panicking. It must be remembered that he previously had been able to
dominate Ning with ease; if it hadn’t been for the Hegemon armor,
he probably would’ve killed Ning already. Now, however, the
difference in power between him and the current Ning was just as
great as the difference between him and the past Ning… except
reversed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
fact… Ning’s advantage was actually a bit greater.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Be
destroyed!!!” Ning put away five of his Northbow swords, then
gripped the sixth with all six of his hands. He unleashed his most
powerful attack with all the power he had available to him… the
Omega Sword Dao – Heavenbreaker.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!!
The entire region of empty space above the Sacred City seemed to have
completely shattered apart. A savage tidal wave seemed to have
appeared in the pitch-black space, a tidal wave which had the power
to destroy all in its path. This was a tsunami of sword-light, and it
caused those who viewed it to feel a sense of powerlessness. Even
Hegemon Brightshore, who was watching from afar, was stunned: “What
powerful sword-arts.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
this instant, even karma was suppress. Spacetime froze, with all
dimensional and temporal bubbles freezing in place. Even Emperor
Bloodcloud, still in the form of a sea of blood, felt a sense of
terror. This was absolute power, and it inspired more terror than
anything else.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Impossible.”
Archon Silksnow could hardly believe it. He strove to use his six
warblades to defend.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
He was like a praying mantis trying to use its arms to block a
chariot. Archon Silksnow was instantly dominated and crushed by the
terrifying tidal wave of sword-light, and his divine power was
instantly crushed apart into countless snowflakes. The snow fluttered
away, reforming far away into an ashen-faced Archon Silksnow. He
wasn’t injured, but the psychological blow he had just suffered had
an enormous impact on him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Silksnow,
Darknorth is far too powerful. There’s no way for us to fight him.
Let’s leave!” Emperor Bloodcloud began to move to flee.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Leave?
And go where? His strike just now was so powerful that it compressed
even spacetime. There’s no way for us to even tear through
spacetime to flee.” Archon Silksnow seemed to have gone mad. He
roared mentally, “We have to use our most important treasures if we
want to escape. Since we are already going to use at least one of
them… let’s use them up and try to kill him! Each of us will use
one of them. We might be able to kill him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Bloodcloud was stunned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
we can’t kill him, we’ll have to hide for as long as he is
alive,” Archon Silksnow said. “Let’s give it a shot! He doesn’t
have an invulnerable form; we might be able to kill him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fine.”
Emperor Bloodcloud also felt that this type of life would be far too
craven. If the two were so frightened as to immediately flee… then
so long as Ning was alive, they would have to remain hidden.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Better
to go all-out and give it a shot. Perhaps they’d actually succeed
in killing this terrifying Daolord.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go.”
Archon Silksnow produced a broken gray longspear, sending it flying
through the air. It looked quite ordinary and didn’t have any
special aura to it, but the countless cultivators within the Sacred
City who saw it felt a sense of absolute horror when they saw it.
They all knew that just the tiniest portion of the power hidden
within the spear would probably be enough to kill them all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill!”
Emperor Bloodcloud produced a curved, glowing object. It was hard to
see the object’s true appearance. Emperor Bloodcloud gritted his
teeth, then sent it flying outwards.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
A dazzling crescent moon immediately appeared in the skies, its light
blurry and gentle. This absolutely beautiful crescent moon flew
towards Ning in a seemingly slow manner, but it actually moved a bit
faster than even the gray longspear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
has to die.” Archon Silksnow and Emperor Bloodcloud both watched
eagerly. This was their last hope.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_36_Chapter_014__Daol"></A>
Chapter 14: Spread Far and Wide</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
light of the crescent moon seemed very slow, but it was actually
ridiculous fast. In addition, the light it released completely
covered Ji Ning, making it so that he couldn’t even evade it via
his ‘Shadowless’ evasion art.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
this is a Hegemon’s power? Perfect for me to test myself out.”
Ning was brimming with the desire to do battle, and his three-headed,
six-armed form wielded all six Northbow swords with defensive
sword-arts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The crescent moon instantly slashed towards Ning, an object of
supreme beauty that was filled with terrifying danger.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
sword-light flared up as well, transforming into gentle tsunami that
swirled around him, forming a whirlpool that then transformed into a
black hole. However, at the borders of the black hole a few ripples
of tsunami sword-light could be seen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash!
The crescent moon ‘gently’ flew into the black hole. BOOM!!!! The
skies above the Sacred City suddenly exploded as spacetime itself
split apart, generating multiple layers of cracked and distorted
dimensional continuums. Even Ning was knocked backwards
uncontrollably by the force of the shockwave.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
could sense how the attack burned through his layers of defenses,
then slammed against him. Ning revealed a smile. His entire body was
feeling a bit numb, but it actually felt nice. All the training he
had undergone and all of the many legacies he had acquired had
finally let him reach a level where he could easily block a Hegemonic
strike. Although the attack still dominated him, his body was quite
stable. He hadn’t even spat out any blood! This meant that the
difference in power wasn’t all that great.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now,
I stand at the very apex of power amongst the Archons. I’m very
close to the Hegemons, while my sword-arts are highly defensive…
the treasures which Archon Silksnow and Emperor Bloodcloud are
launching at me aren’t of much threat to me any longer.” Ning
smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Right at this moment, that plain-looking gray longspear flew towards
him. The longspear’s tip was filled with an extremely terrifying
destructive force.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Judging
from how it looks… it should’ve been a relic left behind by the
Sithe.” Ning watched as the spear flew towards him, feeling quite
relaxed as he evaluated its power. “I wonder what technique the
Sithe used to infuse a spear-tip with such terrifying power.” The
sword-tsunami once more appeared around him, then transformed into a
black hole that began to defend against the attacking gray spear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Crack!
Spacetime began to shatter around him, revealing a jagged wound in
the fabric of reality as a surge of gray power tore straight through
it. Ning was once more knocked flying backwards by the strike.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
this took time to describe, the consecutive attacks by the crescent
moon and the plain longspear were actually nearly instantaneous. Ning
was knocked flying backwards and clearly at a disadvantage, but he
didn’t even vomit any blood, much less suffer serious injuries!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?
B-but… how is this possible?!” Archon Silksnow and Emperor
Bloodcloud were now completely stunned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
was actually able to face a Hegemonic strike head-on! And he wasn’t
even injured?!” Archon Silksnow felt a sense of a rage and
disbelief… but he also understood that the difference in power
between himself and Daolord Darknorth was now simply enormous. Not
only did Daolord Darknorth have formidable attacks, he had even more
terrifying defenses. He had defended against a Hegemonic strike, just
like that!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Silksnow,
we’ve lost. We were defeated. We can’t beat him! We have no
chance at all!” Emperor Bloodcloud was filled with pain, but he
tore open a spacetime tunnel and fled into it like a giant wave of
blood.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Right
now, Archon Silksnow’s mind was filled with many thoughts. Just a
short while ago, he was one of the most elite figures of the
Flamedragon Realmverse, one of the eight Archons of the Sacred
Cities. Today… a mere Daolord had beaten him into a sorry state
where he was forced to retreat. Archon Silksnow understood that his
power was not even close to being enough to battle Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
lost. I lost. However… this doesn’t end here. I’m definitely
not going to just give up.” Archon Silksnow cast Ning a deep look.
The Daolord he had once held in contempt had now become the most
terrifying foe he had ever made. Archon Silksnow then cast all other
thoughts aside, tearing open a spacetime tear and fleeing into it.
Ning had been blasted back by the Hegemonic strikes, resulting in his
Omega Sword Dao – Heavenbreaker losing its suppressive effect upon
local spacetime. This was why Archon Silksnow and Emperor Bloodcloud
were able to easily tear through spacetime and flee.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Archon
Silksnow and Emperor Bloodcloud both understood the difference in
power between them and their foe. They wisely chose to retreat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning once more stood up within the empty void of space. There were no
longer any cultivators around him; Silksnow and Bloodcloud had
already torn through spacetime to flee, while the surviving avatars
of the Emperors had taken advantage of the moment when Ning was being
assaulted by the crescent moon and the plain longspear to flee in
every direction. Creating a powerful avatar wasn’t easy or cheap,
after all; they weren’t willing to give themselves up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">And
so… the only person in the air above the Sacred City was the
white-robed youth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
countless cultivators within the Sacred City, including tens of
thousands of Daolords, all stared at Ning. They were completely
stunned. None of them had imagined that this would be the final
result.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Archon
Silksnow fled. The other Emperors either died or fled as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Death
or flight… the only one left is now Daolord Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
too powerful.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth… he beat over twenty Emperors into utter submission.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
even the eight Archons are a match for Daolord Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
countless cultivators were so excited, they were about to go crazy.
They all hurried to send word of this result to their friends. This
sort of unprecedented, unheard of result spread throughout the
Endless Territories like mad. Every single Daolord who received word
was completely stunned, as were the reclusive Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">What?
A Daolord had actually defeated Silksnow Fiend Palace, the rulers of
one of the eight Sacred Cities?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?
H-he’s actually this strong?” Emperor Islehide and Emperor
Anchen’s avatars were still in the process of hurrying over from
the Aeonian stronghold, but they were completely stunned by what they
heard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
move there immediately.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Quickly!”
Both moved at their maximum speed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
Daolord actually beat Silksnow and Bloodcloud into flight? He
actually blocked Hegemonic attack-treasures head-on?” A
white-haired, black-winged elder walked out of the highest tower
within a palace that was located inside a beautiful world of
boundless light. A stunned look was on his face. “I’ve been in
seclusion, hoping to train to the Hegemon level… I never would’ve
imagined that the Flamedragon Realmverse would give birth to such a
powerful Daolord. How could a Daolord become this powerful? Perhaps
I’ll learn something from him that can give me a better chance at
reaching Hegemony.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
black-winged, white-haired elder took a single step forwards,
transforming into a streak of light that shot through spacetime and
disappeared without a trace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Impossible.
Did you perhaps mishear things? How could a Daolord be that powerful?
But… even the Emperors of the Dao Alliance are telling me the same
thing. How can a Daolord be this powerful!?” A wrinkly-faced old
granny walked out of a wooden house. A number of ordinary mortals
were living in the area as well. The old granny’s appearance
quickly changed to become noble and regal, while her robes became
beautiful to behold.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
graceful old lady waved her hand, tearing a hole in spacetime and
then stepping into that hole.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Many
ancient Emperors who had been in seclusion for many years and who
were thought to be dead were coming out of hiding. They normally
preferred not to get involved with the outside world and at most kept
in touch with some of their oldest friends… but once they heard the
news from those friends and they learned of what had happened in
Silksnow City, they began to grow restless.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
reason why they had gone into seclusion was because they didn’t
want to be bothered by mundane affairs. They wanted to quietly train
in peace and live the type of life they wanted. They all sought to
one day reach Hegemony. There had been some Emperors, after all, who
had slowly trained until they had one day reached the Hegemon level!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Now
that they heard how powerful a Daolord had become, they naturally all
grew quite curious.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Brightshore had been the first to arrive, and he had watched
everything personally from hiding. Although surprised, he was still
fairly calm at first… but when he saw how Ning managed to defend
against the crescent moon and the plain longspear in a head-long
clash, Hegemon Brightshore was truly stunned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Those
were treasures left behind by the Sithe which were comparable in
might to a Hegemon’s full-power strike.” Hegemon Brightshore was
rather shocked. “Although they were a bit weaker than a full-power
hit from me, it had reached Windrain and Netherlily’s levels.
Darknorth actually managed to rely on mere sword-arts to block two
consecutive attacks from incredible Sithe treasures.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
was overpowered, true… but he still managed to endure the strike
head-on. He is now at a level of power where he is on par with the
most supreme of Archons. Most likely, he’s on par with the two
leaders of the Dao Alliance.” Hegemon Brightshore was stunned.
“Unbelievable, simply unbelievable. His only flaw is that he
probably doesn’t have an invulnerable form. Those who train in the
Dao of the Sword generally do not have invulnerable forms… and
without one, his life-preserving abilities will be slightly lacking.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">What
he didn’t know, obviously, was that Ning DID have an invulnerable
form… the Shadowless form. However, a ‘mere’ Hegemonic strike
wasn’t enough to force him to use it.</P>

Chapter 15: The Most Powerful Daolord</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“His
defensive sword-arts are far too powerful. He can probably rely on
his sword-arts to defend against attacks from Netherlily and
Windrain. As for me? He’s a member of the Brightshore Kingdom;
there’s no way I’d act against him.” Hegemon Brightshore
suddenly laughed. “I really never would’ve imagined that this kid
Darknorth would reach a level where he needs fear no one at all
within the Flamedragon Realmverse.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
a Daolord. How did he reach this level of power? I have never, ever
heard of a Daolord as powerful as him, not even in the legends. He
must have some secret about him.” Hegemon Brightshore looked at Ji
Ning, an inquisitive look in his eyes. Even he was deeply intrigued
and wanted to learn Ning’s secrets, as they might be of use to him
in growing stronger as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Brightshore was the number one Hegemon of the Flamedragon Realmverse,
yes, but there were other realmverses and otherverses to worry about.
There were still many who were stronger than him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-robed Ji Ning was the only person left within the skies above
the Sacred City. Ning swept the area with his gaze, then glanced in a
certain direction. He could vaguely sense that it was most likely
Hegemon Brightshore who was hiding over there, and that there were a
number of other major powers watching from the shadows.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Silksnow
Fiend Palace.” Ning’s gaze finally turned to the towering palace
which was the seat of Silksnow Fiend Palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Ning suddenly transformed to become a three million meter titan. He
reached out with his two hands to claw at Silksnow Fiend Palace,
trying to tear it upwards. This instantly caused many runes to light
up as the barriers around the palace sought to protect it. When the
runes lit up, Ning began to analyze them carefully. The reason why he
was using brute force at first was so that he would have a chance to
better analyze all of the mysteries contained within the barriers.
That would make it easier for him to defeat the barriers and then
annihilate the entire Silksnow Fiend Palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Wow.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth is trying to uproot Silksnow Fiend Palace.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Is
he really going to tear out the entire palace?” The countless
cultivators of the Sacred City only grew even more excited. Low-level
cultivators like them naturally delighted in chaos; to them, the more
Emperors died, the more interesting topics of conversation they would
have.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
as Ning tugged at Silksnow Fiend Palace, he manifested three heads
and six arms. Four of those arms wielded Northbow swords as he
prepared to breach the barriers through raw power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth.” A voice rang out. The titanic three-headed, six-armed
Ning raised his three heads to stare into the skies. A furry gold
alien had appeared in the skies. The alien’s entire body was
covered with glowing golden fur, and his aura was so mighty as to be
on par with Ning’s.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Emperor
Goldisle,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth, you killed many Emperors and sent Silksnow and Bloodcloud
fleeing… that’s enough,” Emperor Goldisle said. “There’s no
need for you to annihilate Silksnow Fiend Palace. It is, after all,
one of the eight organizations which rule over the eight Sacred
Cities in accordance with the pact they made with the Dao Alliance.
Even though you have defeated them, if you fail your Daomerge then
108,000 chaos cycles from now they will once again rise to power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
frowned. He wasn’t certain of his Daomerge chances. If he failed
his Daomerge, he would eventually die… and indeed, Archon Silksnow
and the others would once more reappear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Whether
Silksnow Fiend Palace rises or falls 108,00 chaos cycles from now…
is something for them to worry about 108,000 chaos cycles in the
future.” Ning’s voice was sonorous, shaking both Heaven and
Earth: “So long as I, Darknorth, am alive I shall be working to
destroy Silksnow Fiend Palace! If I hear word that anyone dares to
proclaim himself as a disciple of Silksnow Fiend Palace, I’ll
definitely kill him and show no mercy.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
long as I, Darknorth, am alive I shall be working to destroy Silksnow
Fiend Palace!” These words echoed throughout the world around them.
Ning was openly proclaiming the decision he had just made. He was now
someone who stood at the very apex of power in the Flamedragon
Realmverse. Not even Hegemons would be able to do anything to him!
Few would be willing to challenge his decisions, and that only after
careful consideration.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alas.”
The midair Emperor Goldisle shook his head slowly upon seeing this.
“If you’ve already made up your mind, then I won’t try to
dissuade you. Let me remind you, however, that Silksnow Fiend Palace
still has a large number of Eternal Emperors within its ranks. You
might be able to kill a few, but many are scattered throughout the
territories. They can avoid you while you are in your prime, but once
you die your children will probably be in danger…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
cold light flashed through Ning’s eyes. Archon Silksnow and his
Emperors were all devils! If Ning was to die, they would come for
revenge… and they would most likely take their vengeance upon the
Three Realms and Vastheaven Palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Still,
the reason why Ning dared to do this was because he didn’t fear
these devils. First of all, the Three Realms were hidden quite
securely. Its location had never been made public, and no one knew
that his Three Realms was his homeland.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Second,
he was planning to make another visit to the Stone Hellephant Wall
and take away those four Archon-class golems as well as some of the
Sithe discs. He was going to place them all in the Three Realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">No
matter what… if he truly did fail in his Daomerge and perish, he
would ensure that things were taken care of. As for Vastheaven
Palace? There was no need for him to worry about it. Emperor
Solesky’s greatest forte was his invulnerable aquaform; not even
Archons would be able to do anything to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Take
revenge upon me?” Ning looked at Emperor Goldisle. “If they want
to take revenge… they need to stay alive until the day I die.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Goldisle’s eyebrows raised slightly. He couldn’t help but sigh in
amazement: “Daolords! Most of them really don’t care about life
and death, and they are absolutely crazy. I pity Silksnow Fiend
Palace for having offended Daolord Darknorth, the poor bastards.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
eyes were filled with coldness. He had certain options available to
him. He had only trained for a brief period of time and had already
reached his current level of power. It wouldn’t necessarily be
impossible for him to succeed in the Daomerge! Besides, his
[Heartsword] art had more room for improvement, as did his heartforce
secret arts. It must be remembered that his heartforce illusions were
actually still weaker than the Daolord Featherdress’; the reason
his heartforce attacks had already become this powerful was purely
due to how strong his heartforce was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Once
he upgraded his heartforce and secret arts further… Ning’s
heartforce abilities would definitely inspire terror in countless
Eternal Emperors. If they were attacked by Hegemons, they might be
able to flee… but once they were trapped in Ning’s illusions,
they would have no chance to escape. This was what made Eternal
Emperors who were Heartforce Cultivators so terrifying.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
take things one step at a time.” Ning was quite relaxed, continuing
to try and uproot Silksnow Fiend Palace with two of his arms as
countless runes flickered over its surface. As for his other four
arms, they wielded the Northbow swords, executing sword-arts as Ning
started to break the formations and barriers apart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">By
now, not a single Emperor remained within Silksnow Fiend Palace; all
of them had fled. If an Emperor was left, it probably would’ve been
a bit more difficult for Ning to break these barriers apart… but
since no one was actively managing them, Ning was able to forcibly
tear through them with his overwhelming power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Boom! A large number of formations began to be torn apart by force.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
the servants and retainers throughout Silksnow Fiend Palace began to
flee in terror as Ning began to rip the palace out from its
foundation. After just ten or so breaths of time, Ning’s Northbow
swords managed to tear apart all of the formations.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning managed to uproot the entire Silksnow Fiend Palace just like a
giant carrot.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three-headed, six-armed Ning was over three million meters tall, and
the sight of him uprooting Silksnow Fiend Palace caused all of the
countless cultivators in the Sacred City to sigh in amazement. They
would probably never be able to forget this sight… and they would
forever celebrate the fact that they had witnessed this with their
own eyes. This was, without question, the most freakishly powerful
and talented Daolord who had ever existed in the annals of history.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come
here.” With but a thought, Ning drew Silksnow Fiend Palace into his
estate-world. The Sacred City of Silksnow looked just as peaceful and
calm as before… but the place where Silksnow Fiend Palace had once
been was now completely empty.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Silksnow
Fiend Palace is finished.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They’re
doomed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
one will dare to claim membership in Silksnow Fiend Palace for at
least 108,000 chaos cycles.” The cultivators all sighed with
emotion. Most of the members of Silksnow Fiend Palace were ordinary
cultivators, after all; there were only thirty or so Emperors to
begin with! Eight had died today, leaving only twenty-plus Emperors.
The rest were all Daolords or World-level cultivators, but there was
no way they would be able to live past 108,000 chaos cycles.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thus…
for the vast majority of cultivators, the formerly awe-inspiring
Silksnow Fiend Palace was truly and completely finished, its
foundation destroyed. Only the Emperors were left, but all of them
had gone into hiding in fear of Ning discovering them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
skies above the Sacred City. Ning, who had just uprooted Silksnow
Fiend Palace, was standing face-to-face with Emperor Goldisle.
“Daolord Darknorth, please follow me,” Emperor Goldisle said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
turned to glance at him. He saw a gold-colored world rapidly
expanding within the void, and within it Ning was able to vaguely
make out the forms of Hegemon Brightshore, Hegemon Nightlily, Hegemon
Windrain, and a number of other figures who emanated auras of
incredible power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
three Hegemons and quite a few of the more reclusive Emperors have
all shown up. They wish to meet with you, Darknorth.” Emperor
Goldisle smiled. “You truly are the most powerful Daolord to ever
exist since the ancient days. All of these old fellows wish to meet
you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
do indeed need to meet them.” Ning nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come
on over, Darknorth. There’s nothing for you to worry about,” the
distant Hegemon Brightshore sent mentally from within that golden
world. No matter what, Ning was a member of the Brightshore Kingdom;
as the Brightshore Hegemon, he was definitely going to stand on
Ning’s side.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Coming.”
Swoosh. Swoosh. Ning and Emperor Goldisle immediately flew towards
the golden world. As the two flew inside, the golden world became
completely sealed off. The world had been established just a few
billion kilometers outside the Sacred City of Silksnow, but ordinary
Eternal Emperors would never be able to discover it.</P>

Chapter 16: The Great Flamedragon Conference</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning swept the golden world with his gaze after entering it. In front
of him were nine clouds, and each cloud had upon it a table covered
with precious Immortal wine and fruit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Seven
of the clouds were occupied by seven major powers who were seated in
the lotus position. They included the white-robed, white-bearded
Hegemon Brightshore, the green-haired Hegemon Windrain, the
dazzlingly beautiful Hegemon Netherlily, and the black-robed,
black-haired Emperor Blackcloud of the Dao Alliance. As for the other
three, Ning had never met them before. Their auras, however, were
quite extraordinary.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Incredible.”
Ning’s heart clenched. “The reclusive old experts of the
Flamedragon Realmverse have probably all come out.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
sit.” Emperor Goldisle pointed at the two clouds which were still
empty.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“After
you, Emperor Goldisle,” Ning said modestly. Emperor Goldisle was
one of the two leaders of the Dao Alliance, after all. The two flew
forwards together, then parted to sit down atop each of their
respective clouds. Now, all nine major powers were present.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha…
it’s rare to have such a lively gathering.” Emperor Goldisle
swept the others with his gaze after sitting down, then let out a
ringing laugh: “It has been a long time since I’ve seen my old
friends here… and now, I’ve seen you all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
has indeed been quite some time.” A gold-haired, gold-robed man
seated off in the distance smiled. “It is all thanks to fellow
Daoist Darknorth that all of us have a chance to meet today. Haha…
I suppose we can consider this a new Great Flamedragon Conference.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Of
course it is. All of the major powers who usually take part in the
conference have all gathered here today.” Emperor Blackcloud nodded
and smiled. “All of you normally spend your time in seclusion; it
isn’t easy to meet you! Today, however, all of you have come on
your own volition.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Given
how impressive fellow Daoist Darknorth is, how could we not come out
to meet him?” The graceful, noble-looking woman smiled as she
spoke.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Of
course we came for the sake of fellow Daoist Darknorth. I’ve seen
your tired old faces plenty of times already,” a silver-haired,
black-robed youth said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Goldisle turned to look at Ning, then smiled. “Darknorth, let me
make the introductions. I’m sure you already know the three
Hegemons over here: Hegemon Brightshore, Hegemon Windrain, and
Hegemon Netherlily. I don’t need to introduce Emperor Blackcloud
either…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded, continuing to listen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
gentleman,” Emperor Goldisle pointed towards the gold-robed,
gold-haired man, “Is pretty much the longest living Emperor of the
Dao Alliance. His name is Emperor Goldface, and long ago he was once
an Archon of a Sacred City! However, he later gave it up and
retreated into seclusion. He now rarely shows himself, and very few
people even know about him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Emperor
Goldface!” Ning immediately said, “So you are Emperor Goldface.
Although Darknorth has heard of you before, I knew very little about
you. Today, I finally have the chance to meet with you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Goldface was definitely an awesomely famous Emperor. He was the most
dazzling figure of an era, the most illustrious Emperor of his time.
Later on, for some unknown reason, he had become a very low-key
figure and had disappeared without a trace. He was so ancient and
long-lived that he was already quite famous when the Dawn War first
began.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
worth mentioning, not worth mentioning.” Emperor Goldface felt
quite smug, but he spoke in an artificially humble manner.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
me make another introduction…” Emperor Goldisle pointed at the
graceful and noble-looking woman. “This is Empress Jade Phoenix.
She is actually the youngest member of of our little group.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Greetings,
Empress Jade Phoenix,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
need to be courteous, fellow Daoist Darknorth.” Empress Jade
Phoenix nodded and smiled at him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Finally,
Emperor Goldisle looked at the silver-haired, black-robed youth.
“This is Daoist Bluestone. He is, without a question, the number
one expert of our Dao Alliance.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
praise me too much,” the silver-haired, black-robed youth said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was briefly startled. Bluestone? He couldn’t help but think back to
Spring Grass and her little brother, but in the next instant he
focused on what Emperor Goldisle had just said. The number one expert
of the Dao Alliance? If he was making that claim in front of all
these people… it was probably true.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
suddenly heard the voice of Hegemon Brightshore ring out in his mind:
“Darknorth, all of these ancient members of the Dao Alliance have
gathered here today because of you. That’s why you need to be
careful. Emperor Goldface and Empress Jade Phoenix are nothing to
worry about, but you have to be wary of Daoist Bluestone. He is
incredibly strong. Although he’s not a Hegemon, he’s strong
enough to stand as equals to the three of us.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was rather shocked upon hearing this. “Then why have I never heard
of Daoist Bluestone before?” Ning sent back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Because
of the five Emperors of the Dao Alliance before you, Daoist Bluestone
has the best temperament and is the most low-key. He doesn’t care
about empty titles and reputation; his focus is purely on the Dao.
Although he is the undisputed number one figure within the Dao
Alliance, there are very few who even know about him. That’s why,
although you need to be careful with you, you don’t need to worry
too much. He’s an extremely even-tempered and amiable man,”
Hegemon Brightshore sent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
not a Hegemon. Why is he able to stand alongside Hegemons in power?”
Ning sent back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daoist
Bluestone rose to power as a mortal cultivator, and so he has both a
true body and a Primaltwin. After succeeding in his Daomerge to
become an Emperor, he focused all of his efforts on secluded
meditation and training, resulting in him becoming one of the most
elite members of the Dao Alliance. He sent his true body roving
through the outside world… and roughly three hundred thousand chaos
cycles ago, he found a Sithe relic site. He allowed his Primaltwin to
undergo the Ritual Sacrificium, converting it into one of the Black
Emperors of the Sithe race while his true body remained ‘normal’.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now,
his true body continues to train in seclusion while his Black Emperor
Primaltwin goes out exploring. He has more treasures than anyone else
in the entire Dao Alliance. You absolutely cannot make an enemy out
of him. He might be an extremely amiable person, but if you really do
manage to somehow piss him off, the consequences would be absolutely
unimaginable.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was speechless. Black Emperor? That referred to those onyx humanoid
figures, right? Those things definitely had Hegemonic levels of
power! During the Dawn War, a single one of the onyx humanoids had
been enough to drag two Hegemons to their deaths. Daoist Bluestone
had converted his Primaltwin into one of them? No wonder he was able
to sit alongside the three mighty Hegemons as peers!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
two communicated in secret quite quickly, and now Ning had a better
understanding of those who were before him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Goldface looked at Ning, a smile on his face: “Fellow Daoist
Darknorth, you truly are impressive. You were able to defeat over
twenty Emperors as a Daolord! Even when Silksnow and Bloodcloud
joined forces, they still weren’t able to withstand so much as a
single blow from you. I’ve never even heard of a Daolord like you.
I rarely admire others, but I have to say that I truly do admire you,
fellow Daoist Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
praise me too much,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
need to be humble, Darknorth.” Hegemon Netherlily spoke out in
praise as well. “You are indeed the most powerful Daolord I have
seen or even heard of. My horizons have truly been broadened. I now
know that even Daolords can reach such an incredible level of power.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
all of our horizons have been broadened,” Daoist Bluestone said
with a sigh. “For a Daolord to reach this level of power… if you
can succeed in your Daomerge, you’ll probably be far stronger than
other Hegemons. You might even become comparable to an Otherverse
Lord.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Otherverse
Lords were generally Hegemons who managed to seize control over an
alternate universe and who were able to control the prime essences of
that universe, borrowing from it to dramatically strengthen
themselves.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
I’m quite puzzled.” Hegemon Windrain spoke out as well.
“Darknorth, my young friend… why is it that despite being a
Daolord, you have reached such an incredible level of power?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
puzzled as well.” Emperor Goldface looked at Ning. “Would you be
willing to relieve us of our confusion, fellow Daoist Darknorth?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
of the Emperors, including Daoist Bluestone and the three mighty
Hegemons, were all staring straight at Ning. Even though Hegemon
Brightshore stood on Ning’s side, he was still curious about Ning’s
Dao. Every single cultivator hoped to be able to walk as far along
the path of the Dao as they could, and so they were naturally
interested in Ning’s Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">How
could a Daolord be this powerful? What was the reason behind it? If
they knew the reason, perhaps they would be inspired by it. Perhaps
it would be of help to them. Naturally, every single one of the major
powers were extremely intrigued in it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
wasn’t surprised by this. Everything was as he had expected. He
himself was a cultivator; he knew just how much cultivators cared
about the Dao. It was precisely because he knew that his sudden
explosion in power would attract quite a bit of trouble and that many
other major powers might appear to cause trouble for him. Although he
wasn’t afraid of them, if he ended up fighting and offending a
large group of people then things would become troublesome for him
the future.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">That
was why he had decided to just ‘kill a chicken to scare the
monkeys’, stunning and warning everyone, especially the weaker
ones, that he was not to be trifled with. In the end, only the most
elite major powers of the entire Flamedragon Realmverse were
qualified to come speak with him about it… but even then, they had
to behave with courtesy and treat him as an honored guest! This was
indeed the best possible outcome which Ning had hoped for.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
nice, peaceful discussion; how wonderful would that be? He would be
able to resolve his potential future troubles at one go. Even if a
few ended up becoming his enemies, it would be within the realm of
what he could handle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
group could indeed be described as the most powerful force within the
entire Flamedragon Realmverse. The only ones here aside from the
leaders of the Dao Alliance were the three Hegemons! Figures like
Emperor Anchen, the supreme leader of the Aeonians, were individually
comparable to the likes of Emperor Goldface… but the Aeonians as a
race were far too weak. They were also mortal enemies of the Dao
Alliance. As a result, they were naturally excluded from this event.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thus…
the only ones invited to take part were the five supreme Emperors of
the Dao Alliance and the three Hegemons.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_36_Chapter_017__Daol"></A>
Chapter 17: Omega Sword Dao</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning swept his gaze across the eight supreme experts of the
Flamedragon Realmverse, then smiled: “Since you are all curious,
I’ll chat a bit about it. However, this involves some of my
personal secrets. I hope that you will not casually spread it to
others; the fewer who know about it, the better.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
goes without saying,” Emperor Goldface said hurriedly. Was the kid
joking? The fewer who knew a secret, the more precious the secret
would be. If everyone knew it, the eight of them wouldn’t have any
advantage at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
other major powers were all delighted as well. None of them had
expected Ning to be this easy-going about it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
path of cultivation is a stratified one; there are greater Daos and
there are lesser Daos,” Ning said. “World-level cultivators must
develop their own Daos and use them to become Samsara Daolords. Some
gain insight into ordinary Daos, some gain insights into formidable
ones, and a few will gain insight into Supreme Daos. At the very apex
are those who fuse multiple Supreme Daos together into a perfect
whole.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three Hegemons and the five Emperors of the Dao Alliance all nodded
slightly. Ning continued, “So fusing multiple Supreme Daos is the
apex, the highest level of power possible, right? This is what almost
all cultivators believe… but I did not believe this.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Are
you telling me this isn’t the case?” Hegemon Windrain rumbled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fusing
multiple Supreme Daos has to be the apex, right?” Daoist Bluestone
said, puzzled. Normally, they would state with absolute certainty
that it was the apex, but facing them was Ji Ning! All of them spoke
rather hesitantly; clearly, they weren’t as confident as they had
been in the past.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
smiled. “It is not the apex!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
are even stronger Daos than that?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But…”
The three Hegemons and the five Dao Alliance Emperors were all
stunned when they heard the certainty in Ning’s response. The fact
that fusing multiple Supreme Daos together was the apex of
cultivation was considered common knowledge and believed
unquestioningly by countless cultivators. This was the most difficult
path possible… and once one succeeded in the Daomerge, one would
become a Hegemon! However, Ji Ning was now telling them that there
was something above that, an even more difficult and even more
exalted path.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Above
fused Supreme Daos is an even superior Dao… and it is this type of
Sword Dao that I used to become a Samsara Daolord,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
that’s the reason.” Hegemon Netherlily nodded slowly. “As a
Daolord, I did realize that my Dao was able to slowly grow and
improve in strength as it drew upon the mysteries of the other Daos I
trained in, allowing me to develop increasingly powerful ultimate
attacks. Even back then, I was slightly puzzled by this… why was it
that my fused Supreme Daos could benefit from other mysteries and
continue to grow even more powerful? Was it possible that there was
something above them? Now that I see Darknorth… I finally
understand.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
smiled. Right. Daolords who walked other paths were able to use the
mysteries of other Daos to perfect their own while training, allowing
them to develop stronger techniques. For example, even someone who
had fused three Supreme Daos of Water would not have a Dao that fully
encompassed everything pertaining to the essence of water. Naturally,
he would be able to drawn more from other Daos to slowly perfect his
own understanding of water.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning,
however, was different. His path was that of the Omega Sword Dao; it
represented the true apex! At each individual stage, there was
literally nothing further he could learn regarding the sword. This
was why, once he made a breakthrough, he gained immediate access to
the most perfect versions of the five stances of his Omega Sword Dao
and was unable to create better techniques. He was different from
other Daolords.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
have named my Dao the Omega Sword Dao,” Ning said, then laughed.
“But of course, I’m just assuming that it is the true apex.
Perhaps, after countless years pass, yet another dazzling genius will
appear and will tell me that there’s something that’s even
superior to to my Dao. Haha…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
your Omega Sword Dao surpasses even fused Supreme Daos… it really
should be the apex.” Hegemon Brightshore nodded slowly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
it’d be ridiculous if there was anything more powerful,” the
others agreed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
smiled. When he had developed his Omega Sword Dao, a resonance had
been generated with the prime essence of the Dao of the Sword. In
that instant, Ning had immediately understood that he had developed
the most perfect and complete Sword Dao possible. He was a true
master of the Dao of the Sword.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Above
fused Supreme Daos was an even more profound type of Dao! Ning had
long ago prepared to divulge this secret. If he said nothing at all,
he would only attract even more suspicion from the various major
powers. It was better to explain things clearly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">And…
just telling them about it wouldn’t impact him personally. So what
if they learned that a stronger Dao existed? It must be remembered
that there were plenty of World-level geniuses who had fused multiple
Supreme Daos together, and quite a few even had Hegemonic legacies.
In each era, however, only a tiny number of them managed to become
supreme Daolords.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Heartsword had made his [Heartsword] art available for public
dissemination, and many had studied this set of sword-arts… but to
this very day, the only person to truly master it remained Emperor
Heartsword himself! None of those who had come later had been able to
truly master it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
‘Omega Sword Dao’ was even tougher to master than the
[Heartsword] art! It was on a much higher level than fused Supreme
Daos!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Such
a difficult Dao… even if Ning actually made it completely public as
the [Omega Sword Dao] manual for others to study, who knew how long
it would be before another peerless genius would be able to reach
Ning’s level in it? And of course… Ning wasn’t planning to make
it public!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Omega Sword Dao.” This name caused the major powers to all sigh in
amazement. It was too late for them to learn of Omega Daos… they
had all become Emperors thanks to fused Daos. Once a Dao had been
chosen, there was no way to go back on it!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fellow
Daoist Darknorth.” Emperor Goldface smiled. “Now that I’ve
heard of these incredible Omega Daos, I truly feel admiration and
awe. I wonder… would you be willing to let me inspect your [Omega
Sword Dao] technique and broaden my horizons? Although there’s no
way for me to start over on my path of cultivation, it would at least
allow me to learn a few things.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
frowned. Let him take a look at it? Broaden his horizons? How could
he casually allow others to inspect his Dao? Although there weren’t
many who would be able to learn the [Omega Sword Dao], Ning didn’t
want to just hand it out to people!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
Omega Sword Dao shall be transmitted to my disciples in the future. I
cannot casually show it to others,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
can share our Daos and exchange our insights,” Emperor Goldface
said. “I’d naturally be willing to share my Dao with you, as well
as show you all of the other legacies I have accumulated in exchange,
fellow Daoist Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Goldface,
you go too far. How can you compare your Daos with fellow Daoist
Darknorth’s? His Dao is that of the Omega Sword Dao; it is
completely unique and is superior to even fused Supreme Daos! Not
even Hegemonic Daos are comparable to it.” Empress Jade Phoenix
frowned and said coldly, “If you want to view his [Omega Sword
Dao], you should at least show a bit of sincerity.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Empress
Jade Phoenix then looked at Ning. “Fellow Daoist Darknorth, to tell
you the truth, I’m stuck at a bottleneck myself. I wish to break
through it and become a Hegemon! Alas, breaking through is far too
difficult. That’s why I truly wish for a chance to see your [Omega
Sword Dao]. Perhaps it would give me new insights that would allow me
to break through. I wouldn’t presume to ask to view it for free; I
can swear an oath to you that after viewing it, I won’t transmit it
to any others… and will accede to any request you make!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“As
far as treasures go, I have plenty as well,” Emperor Goldface said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“As
far as treasures go… I probably have the most,” Daoist Bluestone
suddenly said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Everyone
fell silent. Not even the three Hegemons could argue against this
statement. They all knew that Daoist Bluestone had once discovered a
complete, undamaged Sithe relic site, and had thus let his Primaltwin
undergo the Ritual Sacrificium to become a Black Emperor. The other
treasures within the relic site had all fallen into Daoist
Bluestone’s hands as well. No one knew just how many treasures he
had.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fellow
Daoist Darknorth.” Daoist Bluestone looked at Ning. “I only wish
to view your [Omega Sword Dao] once, and I’ll swear an oath to
never show it off to any others! As for any requests you might have…
just name them! I know that a grudge exists between you and Archon
Silksnow. Just give me a nod, and I’ll throw the full force of my
power against the Emperors of Silksnow Fiend Palace. I’ll wipe all
of them out, including Silksnow and Bloodcloud, no matter what the
cost is.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
would be very hard for Daoist Bluestone to kill Silksnow and
Bloodcloud, but if he was truly willing to pay the price he still had
a chance to accomplish it. Daoist Bluestone looked at Ning, his eyes
blazing with eagerness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
was a man who cared about nothing save the Dao. For the sake of the
Dao, he was willing to sacrifice a great deal.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“As
for my treasures… aside from a few treasures that are extremely
important to me, I’ll hand all of them over to you. In other words,
over 99% of my treasures shall be yours,” Daoist Bluestone said. “I
only ask that you let me view your [Omega Sword Dao].”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was startled. To tell the truth, his original plan had merely been to
divulge the existence of Daos that were superior to fused Supreme
Daos. He hadn’t been planning to say anything else. Ning was only
planning to leave his [Omega Sword Dao] behind for the Three Realms
to study, along with a few select disciples of his. He hadn’t
planned to make it public. That way, if he encountered a serious
problem in the future, he would perhaps be able to use the [Omega
Sword Dao] as a bargaining chip to negotiate with Hegemons.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">For
example, he could ask a Hegemon to swear an oath to forever help him
protect the Three Realms, and so on and so forth. However… all of
those things would only happen if he was unable to do something
himself. It was a last-resort option! So long as Ning could handle
things by himself, he wouldn’t be willing to transmit the [Omega
Sword Dao] to others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
today, Ning began to waver when faced with Daoist Bluestone’s
offer. The man truly was sincere! Emperor Goldface had engaged in
beautiful sophistry about ‘sharing Daos’ and ‘exchanging
insights’, but Ning couldn’t be bothered to negotiate with him.
He had over three hundred Hegemonic legacies; why would he care about
Emperor Goldface’s?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Daoist
Bluestone, in contrast, had been extremely sincere. He was willing to
hand out over 90% of his treasures, and he didn’t try to give Ning
any pressure at all. In addition… in his heart, Ning deeply desired
to find someone to reverse the flows of spacetime and revive his
wife. Perhaps Daoist Bluestone’s treasures would be enough to
invite an Autarch to intercede.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was going to choose a good number of disciples in the future and
transmit the [Omega Sword Dao] to them. Letting Daoist Bluestone view
it as well wasn’t out of the realm of possibility.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_36_Chapter_018__Daol"></A>
Chapter 18: Naked Extortion</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daoist
Bluestone has far more treasures than the rest of us.” Emperor
Goldface smiled when he saw the offer Daoist Bluestone had made.
“But… the [Omega Sword Dao] technique is just a technique;
showing it off to a few more people won’t cause you to incur any
losses, Daolord Darknorth. We naturally will make sure you are
properly compensated for it, and you can always use a few more
treasures, right? As a Daolord, you haven’t trained for all that
long. You probably don’t have many treasures yet, eh?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning frowned. Why was this Emperor Goldface so irritating? “It’s
not for you to lecture me on who I should teach my [Omega Sword Dao]
to, Emperor Goldface!” Ning’s voice was ice-cold, devoid of his
earlier humility.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Goldface’s face tightened “You…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
imagine that the three Hegemons, Emperor Goldisle, and Emperor
Blackcloud all know what I want the most.” Ning didn’t even look
at Emperor Goldface, instead turning to glance at the other major
powers. “The greatest desire I have had ever since my earliest days
of cultivating has been reviving my Dao-companion! However… only an
Autarch can do it. Thus, if someone can give me enough treasure to
ask an Autarch to intervene on my behalf, I’m willing to fully
record every aspect of my Omega Sword Dao for him to view.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ask
an Autarch to intervene?” The three Hegemons traded a glance while
the five Emperors fell silent. Ning watched carefully, only to see
that all of the major powers were completely silent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
while later, the distant Daoist Bluestone finally spoke out: “Fellow
Daoist Darknorth, asking an Autarch to help out is no easy task. If
all three Hegemons pooled all of their treasures together… they
might have just barely enough to get an Autarch to intervene.
Although I was fortunate enough to acquire some Sithe treasures, it
probably isn’t enough to get an Autarch to intervene. The materials
to create a Black Emperor, I already used up. The remaining treasures
won’t be enough. Brightshore, Windrain, Netherlily… would you
three Hegemons be willing to work with me to come up with the sum
needed to approach an Autarch? Darknorth, would that work for you?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
fine.” Ning pondered for a moment and nodded. “I’m fine with
allowing Daoist Bluestone and the three Hegemons to view it
together.” For the sake of reviving Yu Wei, anything would be worth
it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can probably provide thirty to forty percent of the value needed to
ask an Autarch to intervene.” Daoist Bluestone looked towards the
other three Hegemons. “Can you three jointly come up with the sixty
or so percent needed?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
too much.” Hegemon Netherlily shook her head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
a lot to ask. Invite an Autarch to help out? I’ve never even seen
an Autarch!” Hegemon Windrain shook his head as well. “The price
is too high. I think we’ll pass.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
we’ll pass.” Hegemon Brightshore shook his head as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Daoist
Bluestone was startled for a moment, then nodded his head in
understanding. “I’m so embarrassed. I forgot that although this
[Omega Sword Dao] is extremely enticing to me, due to my efforts to
step into the Hegemon level, it is of much more limited use to the
three of you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
understood what was going on. Daoist Bluestone, Emperor Goldface,
Empress Jade Phoenix, Emperor Blackcloud, and Emperor Goldisle all
deeply desired to train to the Hegemon level. But the three Hegemons?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Their
Daos would need to advance by an absolutely huge amount before they
could reach the inconceivably powerful level of Autarchy. This ‘step’
was as vast as the gap between heaven and earth. Although the [Omega
Sword Dao] was an extremely profound Dao, Ning had thus far only
developed it to the fourth-step Daolord level. A mere Daolord-level
[Omega Sword Dao] would be of limited assistance to Hegemons. It was
virtually impossible for them to use Ning’s insights to reach
Autarchy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
must be remembered that not even the combined treasures of all three
Hegemons would necessarily be enough to invite an Autarch to help
out. To have the three of them jointly come up with sixty percent of
the necessary funds represented them essentially bankrupting
themselves. For them to sacrifice the majority of their treasures
simply to view the [Omega Sword Dao]… the three Hegemons weren’t
willing to do such a thing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
embarrassing.” Daoist Bluestone looked towards Ning. “Fellow
Daoist Darknorth, I’ve already offered as much as I can! To ask an
Autarch to help out is just far too difficult. Perhaps the only
person belonging to the Flamedragon Realmverse qualified to do such a
thing is Emperor Waveshift, but he’s always been roaming the
outside world. There’s no way to even locate him… and even if you
somehow found him, he probably wouldn’t be willing to give you that
much treasure. He might be weaker than Hegemons in actual combat, but
he has definitely reached the Hegemon level in the Dao of Numerancy.
Your [Omega Sword Dao] would be of limited use to him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
understood. His [Omega Sword Dao] was of limited interest to the
Hegemons; it was of far more interest to the Emperors who were
trapped at a bottleneck and who sought to break through it to reach
Hegemony.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Well,
you know my offer. I’m willing to give you the vast majority of my
treasures, and I’ll even be willing to do anything you ask me to
do.” Daoist Bluestone smiled. “If you decide to accept, you can
come seek me out whenever you wish.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Dao which Daoist Bluestone had chosen was the Dao of Black and White.
Black and white… they encompassed all things, including both evil
and good, darkness and light. They were all-embracing. His mindset
was quite calm and even – acquire what he could, but not to force
what he could not.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
a cultivator, his behavior had to match up to his Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
could sense Daoist Bluestone’s sincerity. In fact, Daoist Bluestone
hadn’t tried to threaten him or give him the slightest bit of
pressure. He was someone who even the three Hegemons were wary of,
but he didn’t try to threaten Ning at all. Ning couldn’t help but
admire him for this… causing him to change his mind! Reviving Yu
Wei via reversing the flows of spacetime would be incredibly
expensive, and it would be very hard to accumulate all the treasures
needed at once.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Since
that wasn’t possible… he would slowly accumulate the amount
needed. Given that he already had the verdant azuresoul and the
mutated omnigeddon bloodfruit tree, if he added in Daoist Bluestone’s
treasures… some more time and adventuring would give him a chance
at acquiring what he needed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Bluestone,” Ning suddenly sent mentally to Daoist Bluestone. Daoist
Bluestone’s heart trembled, but he kept his face expressionless to
ensure that no one could tell.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“After
this conference concludes… let us discuss the Omega Sword Dao in
private,” Ning sent mentally.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well. I, Bluestone, won’t forget the kindness you have shown me,”
Daoist Bluestone sent back. He was extremely excited. Daoist
Bluestone had already reached the maximum level he could reach in
secret arts, divine abilities, or treasures. Although he had many
treasures, none of them were really useful in increasing his level of
power. To further refine and perfect his Dao was just far too
difficult, which was why this inconceivable ‘Omega Sword Dao’ had
truly stirred his interest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning was merely a Daolord of the Fourth Step, but the power of his
Dao was already comparable to that of Daoist Bluestone’s. Daoist
Bluestone felt certain that this inconceivably profound Sword Dao
would help open up a new path and new horizons for him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
two spoke mentally in private, agreeing to chat after the conference
but not revealing any hint of the decision outwardly. There were far
too many who were interested in the [Omega Sword Dao], after all;
even if Ning was to agree, he wouldn’t agree publicly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.”
Emperor Goldface let out an angry snort as he rose to his feet. He
pointed at Ning and yelled, “Fellow Daoist Bluestone has shown you
great sincerity, but still you refuse? Where does a mere Daolord like
yourself get the gall to act so arrogantly before the three Hegemons
and we five Emperors? Hmph. Everyone says that you are powerful, but
I haven’t had the chance to witness it myself. I really don’t
believe it. Why don’t you show me if you really have the power to
back up your arrogance.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Right
after speaking, Emperor Goldface flew off his throne. His entire body
began to glow with golden light that swept towards Ning like a
crushing wave.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What,
you want to try and take it from me by force?” Ning smiled coldly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“And
what if I do? Let’s see if you are strong enough to keep it for
yourself!” Emperor Goldface had always been an extremely
overbearing Emperor, far more so than Bluestone or Jade Phoenix. This
was why even Ning had heard of him, despite so many aeons having gone
past since those early days; he had caused quite a stir!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Jade
Phoenix and the strongest of the three, Daoist Bluestone, were both
very low-key to the point where Ning had never heard of them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Darknorth?” Daoist Bluestone sent mentally to Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
need to intervene,” Ning sent back. “This Goldface character was
already starting to piss me off. I’m going to teach him a lesson.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
good! I quite dislike Goldface as well. Help me teach him a good
lesson,” Daoist Bluestone sent mentally.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
Ning had defeated Bloodcloud and Silksnow, the battle had concluded
far too quickly. He had defeated all the enemies in an extremely
short period of time, and so the only ones to witness it in person
had been Hegemon Brightshore and Emperor Goldisle. Even Hegemon
Netherlily and Hegemon Windrain had been just a step too slow, much
less the other Emperors. None of them had personally witnessed how
Ning had defeated Silksnow’s group, they had only watched as he had
uprooted Silksnow Fiend Palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Puny
Daolord, I’ll teach you a lesson and let you know that there’s a
time for arrogance and a time for humility.” Emperor Goldface’s
entire body glowed with golden light, but his gaze was as cold as
ice. “When I’m around, you’d best show some humility.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
was Emperor Goldface. Only the three Hegemons and Daoist Bluestone
were truly superior to him. He held others in no regard at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Soon,
you’ll learn what humility actually means.” Ning rose to his feet
as well. His body blurred as he activated [Three Heads, Six Arms] and
all six Northbow swords flew into his hands.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_36_Chapter_019__Daol"></A>
Chapter 19: Dispersed</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“And
who will teach me? You? You don’t even have a Universe treasure to
your name!” Emperor Goldface smirked. “Makes sense, though. You
are just a Daolord. It’ll be almost impossible for you to convince
a Universe treasure to submit to you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Even
without a Universe treasure, I’ll still knock you flat on your
ass,” Ji Ning said coldly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You’ll
lose the attitude soon enough.” The look on Emperor Goldface’s
face was growing uglier by the moment. He had already manifested six
arms and wielded six long shuttles in his hands, each of which glowed
with golden light. One of the six had an especially extraordinary
aura. It looked semi-translucent, and the cold aura radiating from it
caused Ning to instantly understand that it was a Universe treasure!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Of
Emperor Goldface’s six weapons, one was a Universe treasure while
the other five were most likely lifeblood weapons.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Of
the major powers present, Hegemon Brightshore was on the best terms
with Ning. He knew just how powerful Ning had become, as he had
watched that earlier battle from start to finish. This was why
Hegemon Brightshore did not move to stop this fight, while Ning had
personally waved off Daoist Bluestone. As for the other major powers,
they naturally didn’t move to prevent the fight. They were all
curious and wanted to see just how powerful Ning’s [Omega Sword
Dao] was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Endless flower petals began to appear around Emperor Goldface. Some
were red, some were black, some were blue, some where violet… the
multi-colored petals all danced through the surrounding area,
pressing down upon Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
didn’t hesitate at all in unleashing his own secret arts. Countless
arcs of sword-light appeared around him, while an incomparably
beautiful pair of golden wings appeared right above him. The two
worked together perfectly in accordance with the profound principles
of the Omega Sword Dao – Yin-Yang, with the golden wings being
escorted by countless arcs of sword-light. It looked like a phoenix
being escorted by countless lesser birds, hurtling through the skies
and sweeping towards Emperor Goldface. At the same time, a massive
heartworld projection descended as well, with a giant sword-mountain
at the very center of it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">[Grand
Diffraction Sword]! [Lumisword Godwings]! The two had been merged
together via the Omega Sword Dao – Yin-Yang, then reinforced by the
descent of Ning’s heartworld projection.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! The countless flowers instantly began to crumble. A
single strike was all it took for Emperor Goldface’s secret art to
begin to crumble.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
‘Hundred Flowers Realm’.” A look of rage appeared on Emperor
Goldface’s face. “Kill!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swish!
In the end, secret arts were external sources of assistance. He,
Emperor Goldface, was most skilled in close combat. His fame had been
gained from his genuine abilities.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill!”
Ning charged forwards as well. Swish! Swish! Swish! Six tidal waves
of sword-light clashed against the six shuttles. Both sides used very
bizarre and rapid attacks. Ning was using his Omega Sword Dao –
Shadowless and his Omega Sword Dao – Blood Drop. He was extremely
confident in his close combat abilities. However, Ning’s face soon
tightened. “He’s fast.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Goldface walked the path of the Dao of Light, after all; in terms of
raw speed, not even Daoist Bluestone was a match for him! In
addition, the Dao of Light was omnipresent and omniscient. There were
no openings at all, making it so that even Ning’s unpredictable
sword-arts found it hard to break through Emperor Goldface’s wall
of shuttle-light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
addition… one of those six shuttles was a Universe treasure! Thus,
some of Emperor Goldface’s attacks were incredibly powerful. This
made it quite hard for Ning to battle him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hm?
He’s pursued speed to the utmost, focusing all of his efforts on
it. Even I am inferior to Goldface in terms of speed… but I didn’t
expect for Daolord Darknorth to be able to block these attacks.”
Daoist Bluestone laughed as he evaluated the progress of the battle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Goldface’s
path is that of the Dao of Light, after all. He is indeed highly
skilled in speed and agility.” Empress Jade Phoenix nodded as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and Emperor Goldface continued their furious battle, but this sort of
fight was quite uncomfortable for Ning. It reminded him not to
underestimate anyone who had nearly reached Hegemonic levels in the
Dao. Even though he was suppressing his opponent with a heartworld
projection and two secret arts, his foe was still able to move with
unbelievable speed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break
for me!” Ning suddenly let out a furious roar, and his
sword-stances changed. Previously, his attacks had been fast and
bizarre, but now they completely changed to become incomparably
brutal and explosive. Ning was now using his most overwhelming
powerful attack, the Omega Sword Dao – Heavenbreaker.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! His attacks exploded with power, causing the surrounding
spatial fabric to collapse. The three spectating Hegemons hurriedly
moved to stabilize spacetime, calming it down in the area around
them. However, spacetime the area where Ning and Emperor Goldface
were battling had been completely annihilated.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!”
Emperor Goldface suddenly turned pale as he saw a terrifying flood of
sword-light crash towards him. This tsunami of sword-light was
incomparably ferocious, so mighty as to cause even him to feel a
tinge of fear. The only person in the Dao Alliance who had ever given
him such a sense of pressure was Daoist Bluestone.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Block!”
Emperor Goldface hurriedly strove to defend against the attack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Ning’s six swords continued to
furiously chop out against him in accordance with the principles of
the Omega Sword Dao – Heavenbreaker. Emperor Goldface was
completely unprepared for this avalanche of attacks. He had reached
an apex of speed and agility, and there was no one in the Dao
Alliance who could compare to him in this regard. However, what he
feared the most was having to deal such overwhelmingly powerful
attacks that he had to face head-on.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Daoist
Bluestone had crushed him in just this manner. Long before Daoist
Bluestone’s Primaltwin had been transformed into a Black Emperor,
the two had fought a public battle. Daoist Bluestone’s staff-arts
had struck down like titanic meteors, causing Emperor Goldface to
turn completely pale with fear. This was why he had chosen to go into
seclusion and had trained so painstakingly in private. He wanted to
one day wipe away the humiliation of that loss.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Alas…
he wasn’t able to exceed Bluestone in power. When he heard that
Daoist Bluestone’s Primaltwin had been transformed into a Black
Emperor, he had instantly felt despair.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
told you that I’d knock you on your ass, and that’s what I’m
going to do.” Ning’s six Northbow swords howled down angrily like
an endless storm of strikes. Delightful, truly delightful! No wonder
so many cultivators chose Daos that were focused on crushing foes
with overwhelming power. But of course, if one purely focused on such
techniques then one’s foes would be able to avoid your lethal
strikes with superior agility. Ning’s advantage lay in the fact
that his Sword Dao was truly perfect. Foes were unable to avoid his
strikes… and so even Emperor Goldface was being smashed down to the
brink of defeat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
Emperor Goldface’s face turned uglier and uglier to behold. With a
swooshing sound, he transformed into a dazzling line of light that
quickly retreated far away at incredible speeds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
battle came to a temporary halt as Ning simply stared at the distant
Emperor Goldface.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Goldface felt incredibly ashamed and enraged. He roared loudly,
“Everyone, Daolord Darknorth is nothing more than a Daolord, but
his sword-arts have already reached incredible heights. This [Omega
Sword Dao] truly is extraordinary! I imagine that it would be very
useful even for Hegemons; the three of you might gain much from
studying it. However, he asks too much!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daoist
Bluestone offered him many treasures, but he still refuses to show us
his technique… and he dares act with such gall before us! Since he
refuses to give us face, why should we give him any face? I think we
should join forces to capture him and force him to hand over his
[Omega Sword Dao]! Let’s work together. He won’t be able to
escape!” Emperor Goldface roared.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Everyone
fell silent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Empress
Jade Phoenix glanced at him, then turned to look at the other
Emperors and Hegemons.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Netherlily watched silently, not saying a word.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Blackcloud glanced at his peers as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
entire region fell into an unnatural, awkward stillness. Ning’s
face tightened slightly. He then turned to glance coldly at Emperor
Goldface. If they all worked together, he would indeed be in quite a
bit of trouble… but logically speaking, Hegemon Brightshore and
Daoist Bluestone probably wouldn’t act against him. If so, he
wouldn’t be in that much danger. He had yet to reveal his
‘Shadowless body’. In truth, even if all of the major powers
present struck against him simultaneously, the end result would at
most be him being forced to disperse his body and reveal his
invulnerable form.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Enough!”
Daoist Bluestone barked coldly. “Goldface, you go too far.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
trying to help you out, Bluestone!” Emperor Goldface was rather
irritated.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
didn’t ask for your help,” Daoist Bluestone said flatly. Emperor
Goldface instantly felt even angrier.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Since
we weren’t able to come to terms, let us bring the conference to an
end.” Hegemon Brightshore spoke up as well, breaking the unnatural
stillness. Just now, there had indeed been a few major powers who
were intrigued by Goldface’s suggestion… but since Hegemon
Brightshore and Daoist Bluestone had both spoken up, that little ploy
came to no fruition.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
Hegemon Brightshore glanced at Ning and smiled. “Come and visit
whenever you like.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
you are ever willing to let me view your [Omega Sword Dao],
anything’s negotiable,” Hegemon Windrain said with a smile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
Ancient cultivators would also welcome a visit from you whenever you
wish to come, fellow Daoist Darknorth.” Hegemon Netherlily rose to
her feet as well. All three Hegemons were quite interested in Ning’s
Omega Dao… but there was a limit to how much they were willing to
pay for it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.”
Emperor Goldface let out a cold snort, then waved his hand and tore a
hole through spacetime. He stepped into the hole and then vanished.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Goldisle, Emperor Blackcloud, and Empress Jade Phoenix said a few
words to Ning before leaving. This realmverse conference had come to
an end, and the various major powers all departed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and Daoist Bluestone simultaneously appeared at the peak of a
mountain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Bluestone.” Ning smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Darknorth.” Daoist Bluestone smiled towards Ning as well. It was
time to chat.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_36_Chapter_020__Daol"></A>
Chapter 20: Whitethaw</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
cool mountain wind howled past the two. Daoist Bluestone immediately
began to swear an oath: “I, Bluestone, swear on my very life itself
that I absolutely will not show fellow Daoist Darknorth’s [Omega
Sword Dao] technique to anyone else…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
words to the oath echoed within the mountains. Ji Ning smiled, then
waved his hand and gently tapped the air. Instantly, a crystal formed
from his godsense flew out from his finger. This godsense crystal
contained extremely detailed information regarding Ning’s Omega
Sword Dao, as well as images of how each stance was used and
executed. Since Ning had already chosen to engage in this trade, he
wasn’t going to be miserly about it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Godsense?”
Daoist Bluestone was overjoyed upon seeing this. He immediately said,
“Brother Darknorth, I really must thank you.” He had thought that
Ning would simply record information about the technique into a jade
slip for him to view. Who would’ve thought that Ning would actually
use a small portion of his godsense to transmit the legacy to him?
This was a form of transmission that was far more detailed than
information written within a jade slip could ever be. Jade slip
transmissions were via diagrams and characters, but godsense
transmissions included many actual demonstrations.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is nothing more than a wisp of my godsense,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
here are the treasures I promised you.” Daoist Bluestone waved his
hand. Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh. Instantly, a series of fist-sized drops
of silver liquid appeared next to him. Every single drop was
perfectly round. Despite Ning’s visual acuity, he could see no
flaws in the perfect spherical shape of the silver drops… but he
could vaguely make out light flowing inside the spheres!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“These
are the ‘Silver Daolord bodies’ of the Sithe.” Daoist Bluestone
pointed at the silver droplets. “If you undergo the Ritual
Sacrificium, you can send your soul and truesoul into the liquid and
become one with it, transforming yourself into a Silver Daolord!
Every single Silver Daolord has a body that contains Archon-level
power, but your insights into the Dao will determine how much of it
you can bring to bear.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
knew this already. When he had been in the world inside the Stone
Hellephant Wall, he had encountered those three clan elders. They had
a very low level of insight into the Dao, and thus they weren’t
able to unleash the amount of power which Silver Daolords should’ve
been capable of.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However…
Ning truly felt shocked when he saw those twenty-five drops. Those
twenty-five drops represented twenty-five Silver Daolords!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
have that much?” Ning said in surprise.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Daoist
Bluestone nodded. “I originally acquired a total of twenty-nine
drops. I gave four drops to others long ago, leaving behind these
twenty-five. This is all I have.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Bluestone, there’s no need for you to give them all to me,” Ning
said hurriedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
are of no use to me.” Daoist Bluestone shook his head. “The
friends and family I truly cared about… they died long ago. Given
my current level of power, these things are of no use to me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
couldn’t help but sigh. Indeed, the most powerful person in the
entire Flamedragon Realmverse was Hegemon Brightshore. If you wanted
to help train and strengthen a cultivator through using external
tools, you would at most be able to help that person break through to
become a Daolord of the First Step via using certain pills and
treasures. However, it would be extremely difficult for that person
to make any further breakthroughs. Thus, if one wished to become a
Daolord of the Fourth Step then one would have to rely on his or her
own abilities and slowly train away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for the Daomerge? Nobody could help you there! Not even the legendary
Autarchs could help you with the Daomerge. If they could, then they
would be able to ‘manufacture’ Hegemons on a large scale. The
battle against the Sithe wouldn’t have been so difficult!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was precisely because no one could help anyone else with the Daomerge
that virtually no cultivators could live beyond the 108,000 chaos
cycle limit! The major powers who were able to live past that were
all generally quite lonely. At most, they would occasionally befriend
other Eternal Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Some
of them might feel regret… but most of them were able to see the
bigger picture. Take Ning for example; if he was able to accompany
his family and friends for 108,000 chaos cycles and then die
alongside them, it would all be worth it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Aside
from these Silver Daolord ‘bodies’, I have an even more important
treasure to give you,” Daoist Bluestone said. “Silver Daolord
bodies might be viewed as highly valuable by various organizations,
but Autarchs probably won’t be interested in them. This treasure,
however… even an Autarch might take some notice.” As he spoke, he
waved his hand and caused a strange creature to appear at the top of
the mountain. This creature was completely covered in slick white fur
and was extremely muscular. It looked humanoid, and it had a very
honest, amiable look on its face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.”
The strange, white-furred creature bowed respectfully to Daoist
Bluestone.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is a Sithe Protector,” Daoist Bluestone said. “It is a very
special golem.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
golem?” Ning nodded slowly. As soon as he saw the creature, he
could sense that it didn’t have any lifeforce within it. He had
already guessed that it was a golem.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sithe generally created three levels of combat golems. The weakest
are comparable to supreme Daolords, the average ones are comparable
to Archons, while the most powerful are comparable to Hegemons,”
Daoist Bluestone said. “However… there are a few other rare types
of golems. Extremely high-status or influential members of the Sithe
who were weak would generally be assigned Protectors!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
reminiscent look was in Daoist Bluestone’s eyes. “Come to think
of it… its previous guardian was a fairly high-status individual
who was both greedy and afraid of death. That’s why he left behind
so many treasures for me to find. A pity… if I had found those
things earlier, then my little sister…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
but I digress.” Daoist Bluestone came back to his senses and said
towards Ning, “You can bind this Sithe Protector. It will recognize
you as your master, and it is very good at being a guardian. With it
by your side while you are out adventuring, it might be able to save
your life if something bad happens. In the more distant future, you
can give it to an Autarch. The Autarch would probably be interested
in it, as these Sithe Protectors are quite rare.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Whitethaw,
from this day forth your new master shall be brother Darknorth.”
Daoist Bluestone looked at the white-furred creature.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master…”
The white-furred creature was a bit reluctant to part from him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Brother
Bluestone, this golem should still be of use to you, right?” Ning
couldn’t help but speak out. Daoist Bluestone’s Primaltwin was a
Black Emperor and was out adventuring; it truly had the power of a
Hegemon and didn’t need protecting. Daoist Bluestone’s true body,
however, wasn’t that powerful. If this Protector was meant for
guarding high-level Sithe, its protective abilities had to be
exceptional. Why wouldn’t Daoist Bluestone keep it for himself?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
need to worry about that. I have other options available,” Daoist
Bluestone said. Ning nodded, no longer arguing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
main treasures of interest are the Sithe Protector and the Silver
Daolord bodies. The other treasures are of little use to you and no
use to an Autarch.” Daoist Bluestone casually tossed a gourd to
Ning. “There are some Dao-seals and other treasures here of varying
power. The best four or five are Hegemonic in power; you can go ahead
and gift them to your friends, I suppose.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Ning smiled and accepted the treasures. These things truly were of
limited use to him, as even a strike from an actual Hegemon would not
be able to injure him. In fact, it might not even be enough to force
him to reveal his invulnerable form! However, they would make fine
gifts for friends, family, or disciples.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had acquired quite a few treasures from the Eternal Emperors he had
slain. Most of those things would be of limited use to him. At his
level, there were fewer and fewer items that were of use to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Is
there anything you need?” Daoist Bluestone asked. “If there is,
just tell me. I already told you that I can help you deal with Archon
Silksnow and Emperor Bloodsnow. It might be difficult, but given
enough time I’ll be able to handle it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
need for now.” Ning smiled. “If in the future I fail in the
Daomerge… then before I die, there will be a few things I would
like to request of you, brother Bluestone. I hope, when the time
comes, you won’t refuse.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
minor matter.” Daoist Bluestone nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh,
right. Brother Bluestone, do you have a detailed map of the Terror
Starsea?” Ning asked. He needed to accumulate treasures… which
meant in the future he would definitely adventure through the Terror
Starsea! The most detailed maps were kept highly secret by the
various major powers, and they wouldn’t casually reveal those maps
to others. During the Dawn War, the cultivator civilizations had been
very unified. Now, however, the Sithe had been extinguished. There
was no external pressure to force the various cultivators to share
everything selflessly with each other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
you are asking the right person!” Daoist Bluestone laughed loudly.
“That great fortune I encountered, I encountered while adventuring
within the Terror Starsea. My Primaltwin often adventures within the
Terror Starsea as well. I’m not sure if I know more about the
Terror Starsea than everyone else in the Flamedragon Realmverse, but
I definitely rank in the top three for sure.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Here.
Here’s a detailed map of the Terror Starsea.” Daoist Bluestone
tossed out a golden scroll. He added, “But you have to be careful.
The Terror Starsea was one of the battlefields where the Dawn War was
fought. Many major powers on both sides fought there and fell there.
Even Hegemons perished in large numbers! The place is filled with
danger, and many of those dangers can annihilate even Hegemons with
ease. You have to be cautious.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”
Ning unfurled the star map and took a look at it, quickly memorizing
its contents.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha.
If there’s nothing else, let us part ways now. If there’s
anything you need, you can seek me out through the Dao Alliance.”
Daoist Bluestone waved his hand, causing the distorted field of
spacetime to return to its normal calm. He then ripped open a
dimensional hole next to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Farewell,”
Ning said. He watched as Daoist Bluestone stepped into the
dimensional tear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
stood there by himself atop the mountain. He nodded slowly. “It is
time to visit the Azureflower Estate… but prior to that, I need to
pay a second visit to the Stone Hellephant Wall.”</P>

Chapter 21: Archon Silksnow’s Plan</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
conquest of the Sacred City of Silksnow had concluded long ago. As
time flowed on, word began to spread through the Endless Territories.
By now, even many ordinary Daolords had gradually begun to hear the
word. By now, even the World-level cultivators of the Twelve Palaces
of the Brightshore Kingdom had heard the stunning news about Daolord
Darknorth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Countless
cultivators had been completely stunned by this this revelation. News
of the battle had stirred waves in the realmverse. Everyone was
talking about how ‘Daolord Darknorth crushed over twenty Emperors
by himself’ and how ‘Darknorth blew through eight Eternal
Emperors and annihilated them with ease, then sent Archon Silksnow
fleeing and the others fleeing for their lives’. They spoke of how
‘Daolord Daolord is close to the Hegemon level of power’, how
‘Daolord Darknorth has surpassed the eight lords of the Sacred
Cities in power’, and how he was the ‘number one Daolord to ever
exist’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
sorts of flattery could be heard. All of the cultivators felt proud
that one of them, a Daolord, could achieve such a level of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">At
first, those who heard the news were rather puzzled. They couldn’t
believe that it was true. However, as more and more information
spread out, they began to understand that all of these stories were
real! They naturally began to spread the stories even more
vigorously, and the legend of Darknorth began to spread even more
energetically than the legends of Emperor Heartsword had! Emperor
Heartsword had been an Eternal Emperor, after all… but Darknorth
was just a Daolord!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">How
was it that a Daolord had reached such an incredible level of power?
It could be said that within just a few short centuries, everyone
within the Endless Territories was talking about the legendary
Daolord Darknorth! He was the topic of every get-together. It could
be said that Daolord Darknorth’s fame and reputation was now second
only to the three legendary Hegemons!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
desolate, barren planet. Every so often, a few flickers of flame
would appear on the surface of the planet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
skinny, white-browed Archon Silksnow had hidden himself within a
valley inside this planet. When the flames moved close, they would
naturally part before him. He sat there in the lotus position within
the valley, a cold and dark look on his face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn
him. He’s forced me to go into hiding at the very margins of the
Endless Territories.” Archon Silksnow’s face was downcast, but
there was nothing he could do. If he was a bit closer to Ning, both
would be able to sense each other due to the resonance between their
realmship parts! His only choice was to hide far, far away. He knew
that he absolutely could not reveal the fact that he owned a
realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Even
Nign and Ninedust merely believed that Archon Silksnow also had a
realmship part… they had no idea that what Archon Silksnow had was
a complete, albeit damaged, realmship that was actually usable!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was a secret which Archon Silksnow had never made public. He was the
only person who knew this secret. If it was ever made public, he
would be in serious trouble. Most likely, even the three Hegemons
would hunt him down with all the resources available to him, seeking
to kill him no matter what the cost. A complete realmship would allow
one to easily travel between realmverses and otherverses. It was
definitely every bit as valuable as Crimsonwave Temple!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
of course, Archon Silksnow’s realmship was damaged and needed
repairing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.
Darknorth!” Archon Silksnow’s eyes were filled with hatred and
malice. He was by nature a savage and violent man. It was this brutal
nature of his that caused so many evil Daolords and Emperors to
choose to follow him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Bloodcloud was just as strong as him, but he wasn’t as decisive. He
wasn’t determined enough or ruthless enough when necessary. Only
Archon Silksnow was ruthless and dominating enough to become the
leader of their group.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
rush, no rush. What I need to do is to repair the realmship as soon
as possible. Once I repair it, I’ll be able to use it to escape
with ease. Not even Hegemon Brightshore would be able to stop me,
despite his unparalleled mastery of the Dao of Spacetime.” Archon
Silksnow felt quite confident, because a fully operational realmship
was truly unmatchable in terms of tunnel through spacetime. It vastly
surpassed Hegemon Brightshore in this regard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right.
If I can’t handle Darknorth, I should go find Ninedust. Ninedust
has a realmship part on him as well.” Archon Silksnow nodded
slowly. “Perhaps the part he holds will be enough to repair my
realmship.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ninedust…
hmph. He seems to be extremely good friends with Darknorth. If I
can’t kill Darknroth, I’ll kill Ninedust. Hmph. Let’s see what
Darknorth can do about it.” Archon Silksnow’s eyes flickered with
dangerous light, but he then frowned. “However… I need to first
locate Ninedust. Based on the information I uncovered, he entered the
Terror Starsea a long time ago. How suicidal of him! Still… the
places he would dare enter would probably be of no danger to me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“To
the Terror Starsea I go!” Archon Silksnow decided to head to the
Terror Starsea to hunt down Ninedust and take the realmship part.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">For
now, Ning had left all his troubles and worries behind… because he
had already left the Flamedragon Realmverse. He had entered the Great
Dark and was hurrying towards the Stone Hellephant Wall.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Here
we are.” Now that he was a Daolord of the Fourth Step, he was far
faster than before. Just a short while after heading out, he reached
the Stone Hellephant Wall.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
entrance to the enormous silver Stone Hellephant Wall remained open.
Prior to Ning and Ninedust’s original arrival, the local
cultivators had long ago searched the insides of the Stone Hellephant
Wall and had realized that there was no way out. Thus, even though it
had been hundreds of millions of years since Ning had left the Stone
Hellephant Wall, not a single one of them had exited via the
entranceway! Even if they did, though… when faced with the endless
darkness of the Great Dark, they probably would’ve been completely
lost.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning flew into the passageway, quickly descending upon that world
inside. Darknorth Palace remained the preeminent power of this
planet… and no one even realized that Ning had already left and
then returned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
The headquarters of the Fumo clan, one of the ‘three great clans’.
This was a place protected by many barriers and a Sithe disc, but an
enormous explosion suddenly rang out as a terrifying, watery streak
of sword-light tore straight through the layers of barriers with
overwhelming power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“W-what’s
going on?!” The countless Fumo clan members were all shocked and
terrified.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Sithe
discs were used by the Sithe to construct and stabilize large-scale
barrier formations. They were generally used in sets of nine, twelve,
or more in order to set up the formations. These locals, however,
didn’t really know how to use them properly. They didn’t have
enough of the discs anyhow, and so they merely used a single disc…
and with Daolord-level energy, at that! Despite that, the barriers
were still strong enough to defend against ordinary Archon-level
foes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
they had eleven more discs and used them properly with an Emperor
controlling them, not even ten Hegemons working together would be
able to burst through the barriers! Alas… the original attacker had
been Autarch Bolin. He had blown trhough the formations with ease,
destroying everything with impunity. Quite a few Sithe discs had been
destroyed by his assault. Autarch Bolin wouldn’t even bother to
look at ordinary treasures; he only took away the precious ones, such
as the complete realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Spare
us!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Spare
us, Lord Darknorth!” The Fumo clan members finally saw the
white-robed youth standing in midair.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hand
over all of your Emperor-class golems,” Ning called out from the
skies. “You are permitted to keep a single royal golem.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”
Although the Fumo clan members were both terrified and reluctant to
comply, no one dared to voice an objection. In the past, they had
been the rulers of this planet… but they were completely unable to
fight back against Ji Ning. Even their protective Sithe disc had been
torn apart. How could they even think about resisting?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Soon,
Ning departed with the Emperor-class golems and the royal golems
(comparable to Daolords of the Fourth Step) in tow. He also took away
many of their magic treasures. The Fumo clan now only had a single
royal golem left to them. This was now the most powerful force they
had to muster. With it, they would probably be able to stay strong…
but if they spread themselves too thin and attracted an entire host
of enemies, they would still be doomed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
couldn’t be bothered with intervening in the lives of the local
cultivators on this planet. He was now on a completely different of
level compared to before. He simply blew through the barriers
protecting the three great clans, then swept them clean of their
Emperor-class golems, royal golems, and treasures.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Now
that no one had access to any Emperor-class golems, no clan on this
planet was overwhelmingly more powerful than any other clan. No one
was invincible any longer… and so, the planet entered a brand new
era.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
once more entered the secret Sithe ruins located within this planet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Whitethaw,
guard the entrance.” Ning waved his hand, causing that
honest-looking Sithe Protector to appear by his side.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
Master,” Whitethaw said respectfully, then stood in front of the
entranceway to the ruins.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. He had once sparred against this golem… and even when he
fought with all his power, he still wasn’t able to seize any
advantage over it! Whitethaw was like an immovable mountain. Even if
a Hegemon came, he would still be able to protect Ning for a time.
With Whitethaw watching the entrance, there was no way any of the
golems within the ruins would be able to escape.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning transformed into a streak of light as he flew into the shattered
palace ruins. A number of Emperor-class golems secretly watched him
from behind the barriers that were still active within the vast
ruins. For now, Ning ignored them as he flew straight towards the
core regions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
again?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
how dare you return!” Four streaks of light flew over towards Ning.
It was the four Archon-class golems.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
slowed down when he saw them, then smiled. “My four old friends,
join me in leaving these ruins. Life here is far too boring. The
outside world is much more interesting.”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_36_Chapter_022__Daol"></A>
Chapter 22: Sparrowfiend Crystals</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Even
Ji Ning had to sigh in amazement at the aura which the four golems
off in the distance emanated. All those years ago, he had been forced
to fight with all his power to just barely tie down one of them, and
by relying on defensive sword-arts at that! Every single one of the
four golems brought him a tremendous sense of pressure, even though
they were slightly weaker than Archon Silksnow.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Back
then, that had been more than enough power to truly crush Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
you actually dare to return? Do you have a new trick up your sleeve
or a powerful helper?” The four golems flew over, actually feeling
quite excited inside. Life without any opponents to fight was truly
boring and lonely, and they were never permitted to leave the
restricted area they were guarding.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
helpers. I just wanted to invite you to come out with me.” Ning
waved his hands, causing two of his Northbow swords to fly out from
the sheath and into his palms. Ning then strolled forwards, almost
like he was taking a walk through a park.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go.” The four golems exchanged a glance, then immediately charged
towards Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
twin swords transformed into two streams of water, easily piercing
past his enemy’s scimitars and defenses. The Northbow swords became
extremely soft and flexible, easily wrapping around and completely
tying up one of the golems. Ning murmured softly, “In you go.”
The golem was drawn into his estate-world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
caused the other three golems to immediately feel shocked. One
against four, Darknorth was able to capture one of the golems with
ease? The difference in power between them was enormous!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
must be remembered that Ning was able to defeat even Archon Silksnow
with a single blow! When faced with these four golems who had weaker
techniques and weaker insights into the Dao, gaining victory was
simplicity itself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
fought for the amount of time needed to boil a kettle of tea before
finally capturing the last of the four golems. The reason it took
this long was because two of the golems had transformed into
invulnerable forms, making them quite difficult to catch. Ning was
forced to use his secret arts and his heartworld projection to
furiously deplete their energy stores. Only when their energy stores
were depleted was he able to capture them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
bound all four of the golems to himself, making himself their master.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
you aren’t going to wipe out our golem-spirits, are you?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
no need to worry. The three great clan leaders of this world were
worried about their secrets leaking out, which was why they wiped out
those golem-spirits in the past. I’ve already wiped these ruins
clean; what would be the point of doing that? And, if I did, the new
golem-spirits would start at a very low level of intelligence and
insight. It would take forever for them to reach your current level
of power.” Ning smiled. “I’m not going to cause trouble for
myself like that.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Only
then did the four golems calm down. In truth, they were indeed
willing to accompany Ning. That way, they wouldn’t be forever
trapped within this tiny little area! However, they had to obey the
orders of their masters to resist any intruders with all their might.
To be able to leave would be absolutely blissful! However, it would
be a tragedy if their golem-spirits were erased; to them, this was
the equivalent of a cultivator losing his truesoul.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
when can we leave?” the tall, skinny golem asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Soon.
I’m going to do an in-depth sweep of this place and take away all
of the Emperor-class golems. After that, I’ll go with you,” Ning
said with a laugh. “Ninedust and I already swept through all of the
treasures in the ruins, including the various corpses. There probably
isn’t much left.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Last
time, Ning and Ninedust had done a fast sweep of the area before
leaving. This time, they were planning to do a more thorough
inspection.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
this warship was named Tigerhill. It was an extremely powerful weapon
of war which the Sithe used in their conquests. However, the main
systems of the warship have been completely destroyed, and many of
its critical components have been takean away,” the axe-bearing
golem said. “Although not many valuable treasures are left, based
on what we know there should be one of exceeding importance.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Exceeding
importance?” Ning’s eyes lit up. These four golems were
responsible for guarding the restricted areas; they naturally knew
quite a bit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.
Master, as you may know this place used to house over thirty thousand
Sithe. There were many barriers protecting it, but the barriers
stretched out to cover a great amount of area and were extremely
strong. They had to have energy sources, right?” The tall, thin
golem continued, “The energy source is located below the entire
palace complex.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
revealed a look of delight. “Lead the way!” Ning instructed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.”
Golems were absolutely loyal and devoted to their masters. They
previously were completely devoted to the Sithe. Now that Ning had
bound them, they were completely devoted to Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
the energy sources for the barriers consisted of a total of eight
‘sparrowfiend gems’. They are located in eight different parts of
the palace complex. This place here is the very first one.” The
tall, skinny golem pointed to a tattered palace off in the distance.
“If you dig through the ground, you should be able to find a
sparrowfiend gem somewhere within a hundred kilometer radius.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ah.”
Ning nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
me do the digging.” The spear-wielding golem looked at Ning, who
nodded. The spear-wielding golem immediately plunged his spear into
the ground, breaking through the layers of stone and tearing through
the ground. The palace had already been in very bad shape. Soon, an
enormous crater had been dug in its foundation, revealing a
sparrowfiend gem at the bottom.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
giant crater held a black altar which was covered by countless runes,
and the runes all led to a completely blood-red gem. The vague
outline of a bird could be seen flying within it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“When
Autarch Bolin wrecked this place, he destroyed all of the formations,
making the energy sources irrelevant.” Ning nodded slowly. “Right.
Tell me more about the sparrowfiend gems. Are they very valuable?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Highly
valuable,” the spear-wielding golem said. “The Tigerhill was
divided into a ‘combat zone’ and a ‘habitation zone’. We are
currently within the habitation zone, and it was powered by this
sparrowfiend gem! The outer layer was the ‘combat zone’ and it
was more important, meant for combating against opponents. Thus, it
used the even more powerful ‘dragonprime stones’. A single
dragonprime stone is worth more than ten sparrowfiend gems, and the
combat zone had a total of ten of them. They made the Tigerhill
completely invulnerable, allowing it to easily travel between
realmverses and slaughter countless foes.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Dragonprime
stones?” Ning’s eyes lit up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
imagine the dragonprime stones were taken long ago. They are simply
too obvious and eye-catching. Amongst the Sithe, a single dragonprime
stone is enough to trade for a Black Emperor body,” the
spear-wielding golem said. “However, it is probably impossible for
cultivators to unleash the true power of a dragonprime stone. All you
can do is perhaps plant them into some of the Sithe warships and
vessels which the Sithe left behind.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded slowly. He couldn’t help but ask, “Why are the Sithe so
much more advanced than us cultivators in so many areas?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sithe had an extremely stable foundation. Artificing,
construct-making, blacksmithing… they vastly surpassed the
cultivator civilizations in all these areas. They created countless
golems on our level! However, the ‘Autarchs’ of the cultivators
were simply too powerful. Although the Sithe did have supreme powers
who were capable of battling Autarchs, they were still weaker… and
the cultivator civilizations continued to give birth to more and more
experts. One batch would die, followed by the rise of another batch.
If the war dragged on for long enough, the Sithe would invariably be
the ones to lose.” The greataxe-wielding golem chuckled. “This is
what we conjectured when we chatted amongst ourselves. To be honest,
the Tigerhill was wrecked long ago by one of those Autarchs, and so
we aren’t sure why or how the Sithe ended up losing. All we know is
that the Sithe feared the Autarchs very much, and they also feared
how quickly the cultivator civilizations propagated.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. Every planet and star was capable of giving birth to
extremely large numbers of cultivators. If one chose to transmit the
best legacies and techniques to them while holding nothing back, it
would definitely be possible to allow a large number of powerful
cultivators to arise from each world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Now
that the cultivator civilizations had actually won, they became
stingy and miserly in transmitting techniques to others! Acquiring
supreme legacies was extremely difficult, which was why the rate at
which powerful cultivators rose had slowed down dramatically compared
to before.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
barriers here had long ago been destroyed, making it quite easy for
Ning to take away the sparrowfiend gems. Six of them were acquired in
rapid order, with the seventh taking a bit more time. As for the
eighth, the barriers protecting it were in fairly good shape, and
they had the ‘damage reflection’ property. Ning had his most
powerful servant, the Sithe Protector Whitethaw, personally attack
the barriers. Whitethaw was sent flying back from the explosion, but
had of course managed to endure the damage with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
we go.” After six hours of hard work, all eight sparrowfiend gems
were in Ning’s hands. Ning revealed a look of delight. This was the
greatest fortune he had acquired within the Stone Hellephant Wall.
The eight sparrowfiend gems were probably close to a Black Emperor in
value.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“An
unexpected windfall.” Ning was very happy. He then had his Sithe
Protector and the four other golems to work together and quickly
capture the various Emperor-class golems who were hiding throughout
the runes. The Emperor-class golems were simply too weak. Ning didn’t
even want to bother with them himself… but he still cared about
them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
spending over half a month destroying quite a few barriers, Ning
managed to capture a total of eighty-six Emperor-class golems. There
were only six places within the ruins that he was unable to destroy,
and the few remaining golems were all hiding within these final six
places of refuge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
what a fortune.” Ning was jubilant. Virtually every single Sith
ruin was a treasure trove. Ning’s gains from this one were perhaps
just a bit less than what Daoist Bluestone had gained from his, since
there was no ‘Black Emperor body’ here. Yes, the sparrowfiend
gems were quite valuable, but that was in the eyes of the Sithe. In
the eyes of cultivators, Black Emperors were more valuable. Still…
he had gained quite a bit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mm.
Now, it’s time to head off to the Azureflower Estate. If I can gain
another fortune from there, I might just be able to ask an Autarch to
help out.” Ning was filled with eagerness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Azureflower Estate was definitely another treasure trove. However,
whether or not he would actually be able to take any treasures out of
it was up to his own abilities. The natives of the three great clans
had long ago discovered the Sithe ruins here, but they had been
unable to take much from it. Ning himself had only acquired these
four Archon-level golems and the eight sparrowfiend gems because of
his dramatic increase in power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go.” Ning once more silently departed from the Stone Hellephant
Wall. It would be a very long time before he would ever return to
this place. As for the internal struggles within this place… he
would leave it to them to resolve.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
tore through spacetime repeatedly as he headed back to the Three
Realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Outside
the Three Realms. The white-robed Ning and the black-robed Primaltwin
Ning were facing each other. Ning waved his hand, tossing out a
mirror. This was an estate-world treasure that held the four
Archon-class golems as well as many Emperor-class golems and Sithe
disks, as well as other treasures. Ning was leaving them here for the
Three Realms. Ning gave the four Archon-class golems permission to
wander through the Three Realms. If he was to perish, these four
Archon-class golems would serve as a hidden trump card for the Three
Realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Three Realms held far too many friends and family who he cared about.
His parents and his daughter were incredibly important to Ning. He
naturally had to leave some treasures behind in the Three Realms to
protect it. Only then would he feel confident in going out
adventuring.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Azureflower Estate.” Ning stared off into the primordial chaos of
the void, his eyes filled with the desire to do battle.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_36_Chapter_023__Daol"></A>
Chapter 23: Returning to the Azureflower Estate</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Azureflower Estate wasn’t that far away from the Three Realms.
Given Ji Ning’s abilities to traverse spacetime, he was able to
reach the region of pure emptiness that was outside the Azureflower
Estate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
an invisible wave of power was fluctuating and sweeping through this
area, forcing even the prime essences of the universe to stay away.
Ning couldn’t help but feel stunned once again when he beheld this
sight. He had seen it before, and he was now much more powerful than
before… but he still felt this was utterly inconceivable.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“To
be able to permanently repel the prime essences of the Chaosverse…”
Ning now was at a much higher level of understanding with regards to
the Dao and was beginning to understand: “This sort of ability
vastly surpasses anything a Hegemon could possibly accomplish. Most
likely, not even Otherverse Lords are capable of it. Could it be that
an Autarch created the Azureflower Estate? That means the origins of
the Nine Chaos Seals are even more incredible than I believed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">At
the same time, Ning was puzzled. Early on, the Nine Chaos Seals had
been tremendously useful to Ning. Now that he was a Daolord of the
Fourth Step, his divine power and his Immortal energy had become even
purer, as had his azureflower mist energy. However, at the highest
levels of cultivation, cultivators primarily relied on their insights
into the Dao. By now, the azureflower mist energy was of fairly
negligible assistance to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">So…
why did the Autarch create a technique like this, then work to guide
cultivators of the technique to this place?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh.
Ning flew through the emptiness of the void at incredible speeds. He
passed through it, entering the region of golden mist. Although he
still saw deluxe hellgold on his way in, he was now in a much
different place financially than before. He had already slaughtered
quite a few powerful Emperors; the deluxe hellgold was of no interest
to him anymore.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Here
we are.” Ning slowly decelerated before coming to a halt in front
of the gates of the towering, ancient estate. The words ‘azure’
‘flower’ continued to hang right above the gates to the
Azureflower Estate, radiating an aura of beautiful sanctity.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Here
I am again.” Ning smiled as he advanced. Ruuuumble. The gates to
the ancient estate once more opened by themselves as Ning advanced.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
strolled inside. He glanced at the three fruit trees within the
estate, then waved his hand and caused his Protector golem,
Whitethaw, to appear. Whitethaw’s massive body appeared right next
to Ning. The golem called out respectfully, “Master.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Stay
behind me.” Ning said rather seriously, “This place is probably
filled with many dangers.” This was most likely a place which an
Autarch had spent time and effort constructing, going so far as to
capture a large number of Emperors and bring them here. Clearly, the
creator of this place had put much more effort into the Azureflower
Estate than Autarch Bolin had into the various beastworlds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood,”
Whitethaw said respectfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
advanced with Whitethaw watching his back. The two quickly reached
that bridge once again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Milord
Emperors! Long time no see.” Ning smiled as he looked at the two
gray-robed elders who were seated facing each other within the
grasslands up ahead.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
The two gray-robed figures turned to glance at Ning. The blood-eyed
elder smirked: “Kid, you came back.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
was pretty fast. We barely had time to finish a few games of chess
before you came back, my young friend.” The silver-eyed elder was
quite courteous.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was speechless. A few games of chess? Fine… for immortal Emperors
who were trapped here for all eternity, perhaps he really hadn’t
spent much time cultivating.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Azureflower Estate has continued to attract my interest. After
cultivating for many years, I felt that I was perhaps strong enough
to pass its trials, and so I came to give it another try,” Ning
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Judging
from your aura… you haven’t completed the Daomerge and become an
Emperor yet, have you?” the silver-eyed elder asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
have not.” Ning shook his head. Eternal Emperors all had auras that
were tinged with the hint of inextinguishable eternity.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ugh.
I already told you last time, although a few extremely talented
Daolords of the Fourth Step might be able to defeat the two of us,
things will only become even more dangerous as you advance! If you
aren’t careful, you will die. I really urge you to at least
complete the Daomerge before you try your luck again.” The
silver-eyed elder let out a sigh. “You are being far too rash.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
want to give it a try.” Ning chuckled. “Maybe I’ll succeed. If
I don’t, I’ll come back later.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.
If you insist on dying… let me see just how strong you have
become.” The blood-eyed elder walked straight towards Ning as he
was saying these words.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Sure,
let’s give it a try.” Ning walked towards him as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Last
time, you were completely unable to resist my power. Quite a few
years have gone by since then. I hope I’ll be pleasantly surprised
by your improvements. Otherwise, this will be boring.” A baleful
look flickered in the old man’s blood-red eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
silver-eyed elder didn’t try to stop him this time. As he saw it,
Ning should’ve already learned just how powerful the two of them
were from his first visit. Given that the kid was back, the kid was
probably was confident in his chances. If the kid still ended up
being killed, he’d have no one to blame save his own dumb self.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
walked past the bridge and onto the grasslands.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go.”
The blood-eyed elder waved his right sleeve, sending it sweeping
through the skies and sending a surge of overwhelming power towards
Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
responded by casually waving his palm as well. Boom! Ning’s palm
struck out very casually, but it contained the dominance of his Omega
Sword Dao – Heavenbreaker.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Both
attacks were extremely dominating in nature, and they came together
in a thunderous clash. The blood-eyed elder was instantly sent flying
backwards like a streak of light, smashing hard against a distant
mountain. The barrier protecting the mountain instantly flickered but
was completely undamaged. The blood-eyed elder, however, was
‘planted’ into the barrier in an extremely ungainly manner. It
took him a full second before he landed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
stared at Ning in disbelief. “Y-you…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ah,
a golem body?” Ning nodded slightly. He didn’t have any desire to
kill these two Emperors at all; they were rather pitiful, after all,
having been captured and imprisoned here for so long.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
were able to reach such a level of power?” The silver-eyed woman
walked over as well, stunned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
do alright.” Ning nodded. These two guardians were significantly
weaker than even Ninedust. Ning was able to effortlessly defeat them
with just a few punches and kicks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
didn’t use any treasures. You don’t even have glove-type
treasures on your hands!” The blood-eyed elder stared at Ning in
disbelief. “You were able to crush me with ease using your palms
alone. Not even the most powerful supreme Daolords are able to do
such a thing. You should be the most powerful Daolord of the current
era.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. “I am.” But it wasn’t just of the ‘current era’; he
was the most powerful Daolord to have ever existed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
completely convinced by your power.” The blood-eyed elder pointed
at the passageway behind him, then said coldly, “Go on inside. The
estate is filled with even greater dangers. Beating me doesn’t mean
you’ll necessarily survive them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Be
careful, my young friend. If you feel that you cannot overcome your
foes, you should immediately retreat and flee,” the silver-eyed
elder said. “So long as you survive, you’ll have other chances in
the future.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”
Ning said, “Whitethaw, let’s go.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
Master.” The Sithe Protector silently fell in line behind Ning. The
blood-eyed elder and the silver-eyed elder watched as the two of them
headed into the passageway.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Do
you think the kid will make it?” the blood-eyed elder said softly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
extraordinarily powerful, even amongst supreme Daolords,” the
silver-eyed elder said. “It’ll be extremely hard for him to make
it into the depths of the estate… but he should be able to keep
himself alive.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hard
to say.” The blood-eyed elder smirked. “Overconfidence can easily
lead to death.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
Ning walked along the passageway, he soon reached a point where he
saw an azure stone plaza off in the distance… and in front of the
plaza was a giant palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
plaza was covered with over a hundred figures who were broken up into
groups of two or three. Some were seated, some were facing each
other, some were drinking, some were chatting. When Ning and
Whitethaw appeared, all of them turned to stare at him. The invisible
aura of might emanating from them caused even Ning to tremble. He
could instantly tell that these hundred-plus Emperors were all
extraordinary figures.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
A white-bearded elder suddenly appeared on the stairs before the
plaza. The white-bearded elder was dressed in deep blue robes and
emanated an aura of ice. He looked at Ning: “I am the spirit of
this estate, and have been guarding it on Master’s orders.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was briefly startled. Still, almost all ‘major powers’, including
both weaker ones like Emperor Waveshift as well as supreme ones like
Autarch Bolin or the creator of the Azureflower Estate would
generally leave behind estate-spirits. This was the best way to
ensure that their goals and orders were followed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
estate is protected by three deadly trials, each one deadlier than
the last. The one you just passed on the outside was the simplest
trial, the first trial,” the white-haired elder said. “If you can
pass all three trials, you will encounter no further dangers.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“According
to what Master said, you’ll earn certain things each time you pass
a trial.” The white-haired elder tossed out a jade-green leaf
towards Ning. “This is a ‘Lifeblood’ Dao-seal; it can revive
virtually all Daolords.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was startled. It seemed as though there were others besides Emperor
Maniseal who were capable of creating these types of Dao-seals.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“However…
Daolords of the Fourth Step who trained in one of the legendary Omega
Daos have completely surpassed all other Daolords and are on a
completely different level. A Samsara-class Dao-seal of this kind is
unable to revive them. They must use an Eternal-class ‘Lifeblood’
Dao-seal if they wish to be revived,” the white-bearded elder said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
narrowed his eyes. Omega Dao? The spirit of the Azureflower Estate
actually knew of the existence of Omega Daos?</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_36_Chapter_024__Daol"></A>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
‘Omega Dao’,” Ji Ning began to say, but he was interrupted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
ask any questions. If you pass the second trial, you’ll learn about
it… and if you fail, you aren’t worth of learning about it.”
The white-bearded elder remained as cold and distant as ever: “You
are a Daolord. To pass the second trial, you need merely face and
pass through ten of the weakest Emperors here. As long as you can
make it to the palace gates up ahead, you’ll have passed. Also…
your golem is not permitted to interfere. If it does, it’ll count
as your loss.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded slowly. “Understood.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-haired old man transformed into an illusory blur, flying across
the entire plaza and landing in front of the gates of the palace.
There, he watched what would unfold with calmness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
these are trials which an Autarch left behind for posterity, eh?”
Ning was quite relaxed. It was much like the trials which he himself
had set down for those who wished to acquire his legacy. Not just
everyone was qualified to receive his techniques; they had to pass
very stringent tests. The Autarch must’ve put quite a bit of effort
into constructing this giant Azureflower Estate; it only made sense
for him to put down a few trials as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Those
who were too weak would die. Being able to survive and flee was also
a form of strength… but only those who were able to truly pass the
trials would earn the rewards which the master of the Azureflower
Estate had left behind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning stepped forward, moving up the stairs and towards the plaza with
the muscular Whitethaw behind him. Ning instructed, “Whitethat, you
are not to intervene unless directly ordered to.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood,”
Whitethaw said respectfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
it is a Daolord…” The hundred-plus Emperors in the plaza were
clearly a bit disappointed when they saw the white-robed youth stride
towards them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
mere Daolord. Only ten of us are allowed to fight, and the weakest
ten at that.” An evil-looking Emperor who had azure eyebrows and
emanated the strongest aura out of the group shook his head. “When
will an Emperor come? That way, all of us would be allowed to have
some fun.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Booooring.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ve
been here forever, unable to leave this plaza.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
long will it be before we are granted our release?” The Emperors
chatted casually amongst themselves. They had once been filled with
rage and venom, as they had been restricted to this plaza for tens of
millions of chaos cycles by now… and it was possible that they
would be for all of eternity. This sort of loneliness would drive
even Eternal Emperors insane. However… time dulls away all things.
By now, they were quite relaxed and simply waited silently.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Besides…
the master of the Azureflower Estate did arrange for certain
conditions by which they could be released.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
Swoosh! Swoosh! The other Emperors continued to chat while ten of
their peers flew over at high speed, preventing Ning from advancing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hey
kid, don’t blame us if we end up killing you. Everything is as the
master of the estate has ordained.” One of the Emperors was a
skinny old man with cold eyes, and a deep green mist begin to emanate
from him as he spoke.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
has been a long, long time since I’ve seen a Daolord. Let’s not
be hasty, gentlemen. Let’s take the fight against this kid slowly.
If we move too fast, it’ll be boring. We’ll want to to enjoy
killing him, slicing him apart one cut at a time. Oh my… I can
hardly wait,” a youth with a ruddy face and long, blood-red hair
said, his tongue forked like a snake’s.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
do it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
let him escape. Surround him.” The ten Emperors were all quite
evil-looking, and they emanated murderous auras.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-robed Ning nodded slowly when he saw this. “Ah. I now
understand why the master of the Azureflower Estate captured you and
sentenced you here as punishment. If I was the master, I would’ve
killed you long ago.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You?
Kill us?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Such
arrogance.” The ten Emperors were instantly enraged at being
criticized by a Daolord in this fashion. They couldn’t help but
feel both embarrassed and angered by his words.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Spirit
of the estate.” Ning glanced at the white-robed elder standing in
front of the distant palace entrance, then called out: “Can I
capture them?” If he was permitted to capture them, it would be up
to him if he wanted to kill them or not.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
distant white-robed elder’s voice remained as cold as ever: “If
you kill them, I’ll kill you!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
blinked. Moments later, he understood. After the lord of the
Azureflower Estate captured these Emperors, he had apparently
‘modified’ them in some way. They weren’t true cultivators any
longer; they were more like golems! They had been placed here to test
future trial-takers, and Ning was just one of them. If he captured
the Emperors, how would those who came after him be tested?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha…
if that’s the case, I’ll just wrap it up quickly.” Ning
stretched out his hands, causing two of the Darknorth swords to fly
out of the sheath on his back and into them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Arrogant
brat.” The ten Emperors instantly transformed into mist, light,
flames, and other things as they started to surround Ning, wanting to
ensure that he wouldn’t be able to escape.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
casually sauntered forwards, with Whitethaw behind him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom.
Boom. Boom. All sorts of various attacks filled the skies as they
flew towards Ning. Ning could immediately tell that these ten
Emperors were roughly at the supreme Daolord level! Ning couldn’t
help but shake his head: “They really are the ten weakest
Emperors.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
twin swords began to move. Whap! Whap! Whap! Whap! Whap! Whap! The
Northbow swords transformed into ferocious streams of water, striking
back against the attacks like waves slapping against the shore. The
streams of water struck straight upon the bodies of the Emperors,
sending them flying backwards like swatted mosquitoes. Even though
they had transformed into their invulnerable forms, Ning was able to
beat them back into their original forms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
difference in power was simply too great. Ning was able to crush even
Archon Silksnow, who was in turn able to slaughter supreme Daolords
with ease. One could imagine how puny these ten Emperors were
compared to Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
Daolord… h-he…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Has
he succeeded in his Daomerge? But he clearly doesn’t have that
whiff of eternity about him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
many other Emperors who had been watching from afar were all stunned
as well. A Daolord was able to crush ten Emperors like this? How?!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, prior to the trip to Crimsonwave Temple, Ning would at most be
able to fight them to a standstill. Now, however, Ning had made
breakthroughs in his [Heartsword] art… but even more importantly,
he had reached the fourth stage with his Omega Sword Dao. He truly
was one of the most supreme powers of this realmverse, and was
naturally able to dominate these common Emperors with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Emperors all stared, stupefied, at Ning as he casually strolled
across the plaza and arrived at the entrance to the palace. As for
Whitethaw, he continued to walk straight behind Ning with
incomparable calmness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom.
The white-haired and elderly estate-spirit watched in shock as Ning
stretched his hand out and pushed at the palace gates. With a deep
booming sound, the giant palace gates swung open.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You…?”
The white-haired elder stared at Ning, rather puzzled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Estate-spirit.”
Ning looked at the white-haired elder respectfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
tri-force fusion technique?” the white-haired elder murmured
softly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was startled for a moment before realizing that he was referring to
the [Heartsword] art. “Precisely.” Ning nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
[Heartsword] art was a technique which perfectly merged heartforce,
divine power, and Immortal energy together. In truth, even if Ning
hadn’t made a breakthrough with his Omega Sword Dao, his mastery of
the twelfth stance of the [Heartsword] art would’ve still put him
on par with Archon Silksnow. That by itself was enough to
effortlessly sweep these Emperors aside. Now that he HAD broken
through? He was probably invincible against anyone save for the
Hegemons, and of course Daoist Bluestone.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
tri-force fusion technique…” The white-robed elder’s gaze grew
distant. “Heartforce is indeed incredible. Even though the
technique which Master created is capable of transforming and merging
all types of energy, heartforce is still special and unique. The
legends say that if a heartworld can truly reach the apex of power,
the treasures formed within it will become real and can be actually
used. The heartworld shall become a real world that you can
manipulate at will. If someone could reach that level, that person
would become truly invincible.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
heartworld… a real world?” Ning deeply desired to reach that
level, but he knew just how ridiculous and inconceivable it was. It
meant that if he imagined a hundred realmships into existence within
his heartworld, then a hundred real realmships would be formed. If he
willed an army of Black Emperors into existence, all of them would be
real as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
level of power that would represent…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Yes,
from a theoretical standpoint once a heartworld reached the true apex
of power, it was possible to manifest real objects within it… but
no one had ever been able to accomplish such a thing. The cultivator
civilizations had its Autarchs, but there had never been a Heartforce
Autarch!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“For
you to have mastered a tri-force fusion technique is a sign that you
are quite talented.” The white-haired elder nodded slowly. “Since
you have passed the second trial, take your second reward.” The old
man tossed out a rolled-up jade scroll.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
immediately accepted it, then asked, “What is this?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
were asking about Omega Daos, yes?” The white-haired elder
explained, “This jade scroll was left behind by a truly dazzling
Daolord which my master once encountered. He was so unspeakably,
monstrously talented that he was able to enhance his Dao of Fire to
the absolute apex, and then train to become a Daolord of the Fourth
Step with his Omega Fire Dao! Alas, the Daomerge for an Omega Dao is
far, far too difficult, far more difficult than for those supreme
Daolords who seek to become Hegemons.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
the end, that Daolord failed his Daomerge as well. After he failed
his Daomerge but before he died, he ran into my master… and he
passed down the secrets of his self-created Omega Fire Dao to my
master,” the white-haired elder said.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_36_Chapter_025__Daol"></A>
Chapter 25: Knockout</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning felt a surge of excitement as he listened. His path was that of
an Omega Dao as well, and he had also become a Daolord of the Fourth
Step. The next step to take was that of the Daomerge. As Ning knew,
for the Daomerge he would need to take every single insight he had
ever gained into the first, second, third, and fourth stages of his
Omega Sword Dao, and then completely transform them into a truly
perfect Eternal Omega Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
he succeeded in the Daomerge, his Omega Sword Dao would become truly
perfect to the point where it wouldn’t be affected in the slightest
by the passage of time. Only a Dao such as this was qualified to be
called ‘eternal’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thus,
every single successful Daomerge would result in the new Emperor
skyrocketing in power by two full levels! Second-tier Daolords would
be catapulted to the Archon level of power, while supreme Daolords
would rise straight to the Hegemon level of power!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
would be a similarly incredible rise in power for a successful
Daomerge with the Omega Sword Dao… and the increase would be due to
the power of a Dao that was truly eternal! Thus, what Ning needed to
do was to create an Eternal Omega Sword Dao… and that was going to
be indescribably difficult.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
fellow Daoist died. Will I be able to succeed?” Ning asked himself.
He wasn’t sure of what the answer would be.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Omega
Daos are extraordinary and unfathomable. They are truly above all
other Daos and are the ultimate Daos.” The white-bearded elder
looked at Ning. “You might not train in the Dao of Fire, but you
can still study this Omega Dao. It might help inspire you and be of
use to you, increasing your own chances at the Daomerge
dramatically.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
clenched the jade scroll, sending his godsense into it. There were
certain barriers within it, forcing him to swear a lifeblood oath not
to transmit it to others in order to study it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
immediately swore the oath. Instantly, a large amount of information
flooded into his mind as the jade scroll in Ning’s hands
transformed into bits of dust.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was unspeakably profound. This was the Dao of Fire, but visualized to
the utmost apex. It included every single type of fire possible,
including blazing flames, icy flames, negative-energy flames,
explosive flames… all types of flames could be controlled by it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Daolord who created this ‘Omega Fire Dao’ was capable of
releasing flames that were truly terrifying.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
truly was the embodiment of fire, the master of all flames,” Ning
sighed in amazement. It made sense. When he created his Omega Sword
Dao, there was an instant resonance with the prime essence of the
sword. In that instant, he immediately understood that he was now the
master of the Dao of the Sword. As for the deceased creator of the
Omega Fire Dao, he was most likely the master of the Dao of Fire.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
the white-haired elder saw Ning open his eyes, the elder said in a
icy voice, “You have already passed the first two trials. Only one
more remains before you, and if you can survive it you won’t face
any more danger. In addition… you will earn something which is far
more valuable than even the Omega Dao you were just shown!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Far
more valuable?” Ning’s eyes lit up. Something that was far more
valuable than an Omega Dao… what could it be? What had the master
of the Azureflower Estate prepared?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
reward will naturally be the most valuable thing within the entire
estate. My master would’ve have wasted all this time and effort for
just the Omega Dao of a single Daolord of the Fourth Step,” the
white-haired elder said coldly. “However… not just anyone is
worthy of the true treasure. You must pass the third trial first. If
you die in the attempt, you can only blame yourself and your own
uselessness. Alright. Time to go in.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Ning nodded, then stepped into the palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">From
the outside, the palace had been blocked by an invisible screen of
energy that prevented him from seeing anything inside it. As soon as
he stepped inside, everything became clearly visible. He saw that the
great palace had a total of sixteen giant golden pillars within it,
with a royal throne located at the highest part of the palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
turned his gaze to glance at the two figures seated in the lotus
position at the edges of the palace. One figure was a figure dressed
in long violet robes and who emanated an aura of incredible power
that was comparable to that of Hegemon Brightshore or Hegemon
Windrain! The other had a significantly weaker aura and was dressed
in black robes. He was thin and had long, slender eyes that were
brimming with cold malice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hm?”
The two figures simultaneously opened their eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
Daolord?” The violet-robed man glanced sideways. “How boring. It
is time for you to go to work, disciple.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry, Master.” The skinny black-robed man narrowed his eyes as he
looked at Ning, cold malice flashing within them. “I’ll
definitely take ‘good care’ of this young Daolord.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
frowned slightly. He could sense that the black-robed man was
brimming with murderous intentions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-haired old man had walked in alongside Ning. The old man now
said in a cold voice, “You are a Daolord, and so your opponent
shall be someone who has reached a level of power comparable to the
Archon-level Eternal Emperors of your Flamedragon Realmverse! All you
need to do is defeat him by knocking him out of the palace, and
you’ll have succeeded.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Knock
an Archon out of the palace?” Ning was rather surprised. This trial
wasn’t too hard for him, but it was almost impossibly hard for a
Daolord.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Do
you feel this is difficult?” The white-haired elder said coldly,
“If you were an Emperor, you would have to defeat the Hegemon and
knock the Hegemon out of the palace in order to win. These two,
master and disciple, are limited in their movements because they
aren’t able to leave the palace. If you can force them out, then
the formations will activate and slay them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
you are telling me that if I succeed in passing through the third
stage, the guardian will definitely die.” Ning was secretly stunned
at how ruthless the master of the Azureflower Estate was. If Ning was
an Emperor, he would’ve had to defeat the Hegemon by knocking the
Hegemon out of the palace? Not even a true Hegemon would necessarily
be able to succeed! Only one of the more elite Hegemons would be able
to accomplish it. The Flamedragon Realmverse only had three Hegemons
to begin with!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for a Daolord capable of knocking out an Archon of the Sacred Cities?
That meant the Archon had to either train in an Omega Dao or have
reached an extremely high level in a technique similar to the
[Heartsword] art. Only then would they be capable of such ludicrous
levels of power. How many monstrous Daolords of that level had the
Flamedragon Realmverse ever even given birth to?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
trial is ridiculous,” Ning muttered silently to himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
you aren’t a truly peerless and dazzling figure, you are not worthy
of challenging the third trial. Not even average Hegemons are
worthy,” the white-haired elder said coldly. “Alright. Time to
begin.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Heh
heh heh…” The black-robed man slowly sauntered forwards, not
disguising his murderous intent in the slightest as he let out an odd
laugh. “Daolord boy, if you must blame someone, blame the master of
this estate for his callousness. I once enjoyed a wonderful, carefree
life roaming through the outside world, killing whoever I pleased. No
one dared to stand in my way! Now, I’ve been forced to stay within
this estate forever… but don’t worry. I won’t kill you too
quickly. I’ll let you die a slow, agonizing death. I’ll take my
time enjoying a delicate little morsel like yourself.” The
black-robed man’s eyes were filled with excitement.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
stretched out both hands, causing two Northbow swords to fly out of
the sheath and into his grasp. He was an incredibly talented Daolord
who had reached the fourth stage of his Omega Sword Dao, and he also
had his [Heartsword] art. Even if he had to fight the Hegemon, Ning
was certain he would be able to leave this place safely.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill.”
The black-robed man made his move. Whoosh! A long black serpentine
shadow appeared in the skies, moving with ghostly speed as it
instantly charged towards Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Ning casually tossed out one of his swords. Sword-light flew outwards
like a surging tsunami, slamming into the black serpentine shadow
with overwhelming and crushing power. The shadow was instantly
destroyed, revealing the figure of the black-robed man within it. The
man was wielding a long saber in a two-handed grip, and the blow
smashed him into the ground with a loud boom.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
earth trembled violently. Only after a moment passed was the
black-robed man able to rise to his feet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Another
golem-body?” Ning shook his head. His opponent was no longer a true
cultivator.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Y-you…”
The black-robed man stared at Ning in shock.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Ning continued to swing his Darknorth swords, sending one blow
after another towards his opponent. His opponent wasn’t able to
dodge the attacks at all and was sent flying repeatedly by Ning!
After a mere five strikes, Ning was able to send his foe flying out
of the palace gates.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No…!”
The black-robed man let out a terrified scream. The power of Ning’s
strike was simply too great, and he was sent flying backwards while
completely unable to control his body.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the instant that he flew out of the palace gates, a blurry golden
light suddenly appeared at the gates and brushed past his body. The
black-robed man’s aura instantly vanished, his body separating into
multiple different components that were whisked away by the golden
light, which they vanished as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
died.” The violet-robed Hegemon within the hall watched as his
disciple died, a hint of sorrow in his eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had once been an exalted Hegemon, a man of great glory and honor. He
had an entire host of Emperors serving him, and no one had ever dared
to oppose him!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
then the master of the estate had shown up. The Hegemon had been
captured with nothing more than the wave of a hand. It was as easy as
capturing a little baby chicken! He and his disciple had then been
transformed into golem-like creatures who would forever stay here and
obey the orders they had been given. Now, his disciple had died…
and even the final remnants of his soul and truesoul had vanished.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“When
will it become my turn?” the violet-robed Hegemon mused. A fierce
light flashed through his eyes. “I won’t make it easy. I’m a
Hegemon, and I’ve been training here for many years. I’m much
more powerful now than when I was first captured. And… the master
of the estate promised that I would have a chance to regain my
freedom in the future.” The violet-robed man looked at the distant
white-robed Ning. “Given how powerful this Daolord is… perhaps he
is the hope which was promised to all of us captured Emperors?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had easily passed through all three trials. This stunned the
white-robed elder.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
passed the third trial, right?” Ning glanced at the white-robed
elder.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
passed.” The white-robed elder nodded. “Follow me, then.”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_36_Chapter_026__Daol"></A>
Chapter 26: As Vast as the Sea</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-haired elder led the way as Ji Ning and Whitethaw followed from
behind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Put
away your golem. There will no longer be any danger here,” the
white-haired elder instructed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
senior.” Ning waved his hand, putting away the Protector golem.
This trip to the Azureflower Estate had been much smoother than he
had anticipated… but when he thought about it, it made sense. The
master of the estate had left behind two levels of challenges; one
was meant for Daolords, the other was meant for Emperors. The
Daolord-level trials had already been quite ridiculous; if Ning
hadn’t mastered the [Heartsword] art, even the fourth stage of the
Omega Sword Dao wouldn’t have been enough for him to win with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-haired elder led the way until they reached a great palace.
Boom! The palace walls parted before them, revealing a doorway. They
entered through this side passageway and quickly reached a private,
quiet hall.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
is this place?” Ning looked about, rather stunned. This giant hall
was filled with enormous bookshelves which leaned against the walls.
Every single bookshelf was at least thirty kilometers long, and there
were hundreds of layers for each one. Every single layer was filled
with jade slips, and they truly were numerous beyond measure. Ning
could see no end of them!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was rather dazed. Just a cursory scan indicated that there had to be
over a hundred billion scrolls here… and that was just a rough
estimate! This was a staggering, unheard-of figure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“These
are all of the more powerful techniques which my master acquired
after scouring virtually the entire Chaosverse.” The white-haired
elder had a rather complex look in his eyes as he continued slowly,
“It doesn’t just have cultivator techniques, it also has Sithe
techniques. Master collected and modified them all, making them
suitable for us cultivators to use.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
other words… this place holds all of the countless elite techniques
which were created by the cultivator civilizations and the Sithe
civilization.” The white-haired elder looked at Ning. “What you
need to do… is to read through all of them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
cultivator civilizations? The entire Sithe civilization?” No matter
how steady Ning normally was, he couldn’t help but begin to tremble
inside. This was simply inconceivable.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
his original planet of ‘Earth’ in the Three Realms, there was a
saying: ‘After you read over ten thousand books, you can write like
a god.’ The creation of every single technique represented the
accumulated wisdom and insight of one particular cultivator! The
reason why Ning was able to become a Daolord of the Fourth Step was
in large part due to Ning having the chance to inspect the three
hundred-plus Hegemonic legacies which Autarch Bolin had left behind
within that special region. They had been incredibly important, as
they had broadened Ning’s horizons and let him gain many new
insights and epiphanies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">And
now?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
fruits of all cultivator civilizations were before him. Even the
techniques belonging to the Sithe had been modified and retrofitted
so that cultivators could make use of them. Countless techniques were
gathered here. Their value was truly incalculable! They would be of
far more help to him in understanding the Dao than any other
treasure. This library was far more valuable than the Voidsea
Jadeseal had been; even a Hegemon would go crazy for a chance like
this!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
scoured virtually the entire Chaosverse for these techniques, and
even overhauled the techniques of the Sithe civilization…” Ning
murmured softly. “Senior, can you please tell me who the master of
this estate was?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
master didn’t plan to accept any disciples,” the white-haired
elder said. “This is nothing more than the inheritance he has
entrusted to later generations. Since you have passed his trials, you
are deserving of what is here.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Inheritance?”
Ning narrowed his eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Your
guess is correct. Master is dead.” The white-haired elder glanced
at the countless jade scrolls. His face was still cold and calm, but
his gaze was rather distant and his voice very soft.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Dead?”
Ning could hardly believe this. “H-he… did he die in battle
against the Sithe?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.
You overestimate their abilities.” The white-haired elder laughed
coldly. “The cultivator civilizations ended up winning our great
war against the Sithe! But even if we lost the battle, as an Autarch
my master would never have died to them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
how is it that he died?” Ning truly couldn’t believe it. An
Autarch, someone who stood at the very apex of all cultivator
civilizations, had somehow died?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
was a form of suicide.” The white-haired elder shook his head.
“Enough questions.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was rather dazed. A form of suicide? Autarchs had to have incredible
Dao-hearts; how could one possibly choose to commit suicide? But
then, Ning quickly understood. A ‘form of suicide’… that meant
it wasn’t true suicide! Otherwise, why would the estate-spirit add
the qualifier ‘a form of’? However, since the estate-spirit
didn’t wish to speak further, Ning no longer pursued this line of
questioning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Senior,
you tell this junior who the master of this estate was? Given the
grace he has shown to me, I simply must know his name,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
master’s Daoist title was simply ‘Awakener’. He was referred to
as Autarch Awakener.” The white-robed elder’s eyes shone with
light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
immediately turned and knelt down towards the countless jade slips in
front of him as though he was facing his master. “This junior is
named Darknorth. Senior, although you are not my master in title, you
are my master in practice! This junior shall forever remember the
benevolence you have shown me.” Ning then kowtowed nine times
solemnly, wishing to express the gratitude and excitement he felt.
Ning then rose to his feet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
are quite conscientious.” The white-robed elder nodded slowly when
he saw this. “The benevolence Master has shown you vastly surpasses
that which most teachers show their students. Not even most of
Master’s actual students were permitted to see this techniques;
only two were granted access.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mm.”
Ning nodded and then asked curiously, “Are you saying that Sithe
techniques are not appropriate for us cultivators to train in? They
have to be retrofitted first?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
are certain fundamental differences between us and the Sithe,” the
white-haired elder said. “We are simply completely different on the
most basic of levels. They were a different type of lifeform, a very
unique type of lifeform, and they had a civilization and culture
which belonged to them and them alone! We are not able to use the
majority of their techniques, with just a few minor tricks available
to us.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Enough.
Go ahead and read through these first,” the white-haired elder
instructed. “Also – before doing that, go ahead and swear an oath
that you will not transmit anything you see here.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. The lord of the Azureflower Estate, Autarch Awakener, hadn’t
even permitted most of his personal disciples to view this place.
Ning was lucky to even have a chance to read in this place; how could
he possibly be permitted to transmit these techniques as he pleased?
It had taken even Autarch Awakener an incredible amount of blood,
sweat, and effort to accumulate all these techniques.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">And
so, Ning began a new life devoted to reading. He buried himself in
the countless jade slips while surrounded by a field of accelerated
time that was a hundred times faster than normal time. He memorized
one jade slip after another.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
truly was a sea of techniques, and they came from different races,
different realmverses, and different otherverses. They represented
the accumulated wisdom of countless mighty cultivators, and Ning’s
horizons were truly broadened. In fact, he was beginning to rapidly
gain tremendous amounts of insight into the other Daos he was fairly
skilled in, such as the Dao of Water and the Dao of Lightning! He was
even gaining more insights into the [Omega Sword Dao] and the
[Heartsword] art, both of which had already reached incredible
heights.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
reading alone was enough to help him upgrade his insights. This was
because he was reading and absorbing the accumulated wisdom of
countless cultivators.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
began to feel himself change and transform as he subsumed himself
within this sea of techniques. A new foundation was being
established. Reading and memorizing all of these countless techniques
was a way for him to dramatically expand his foundation of
understanding! Right now, he had merely done some cursory reading;
later on, he would train in each technique in detail. He would
improve even more then! These countless techniques represented an
inconceivable treasure in terms of cultivating the Dao. This was why
Ning hadn’t hesitated at all in kneeling down and kowtowing as
though he was in front of his master. He truly felt grateful.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">For
the first time… Ning began to feel that he had a chance at
succeeding in the Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">By
now, Ning was incredibly powerful and was able to read incredibly
fast. It took him merely 130 million years to completely read through
everything once. But of course, if one factored in the usage of
temporal acceleration then Ning had actually spent over 13 billion
years reading.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
done reading.” Ning put down the final jade slip. His very aura
itself had begun to change a bit. He had become more reserved and
more ordinary-looking.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Over
the course of reading for the past millions of years, Ning felt as
though he had gained a picture of all cultivator civilizations as
well as the entire Sithe civilization. He had bathed in the
accumulated wisdom of two entire civilizations, and he no longer felt
the slightest bit of pride in himself. So what if he had developed an
Omega Dao? What was so pride-worthy about that? He was nothing more
than someone who, prior to becoming a Samsara Daolord, had a few
special ideas and encountered enough fortunate experiences that he
was able to embark upon the path of the Omega Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Hegemons weren’t necessarily less talented than him, just not as
lucky… and the likes of Emperor Heartsword, who had developed the
[Heartsword] art, was also a freakishly talented figure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
cultivator civilizations, as a whole, had far too many incredibly
talented figures.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Done
reading?” The white-robed elder’s voice rang out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
raised his head to look at the elder, then nodded. “I’m done
reading. I feel as though the pride I felt previously was absolutely
laughable.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
the great sea of the various cultivator civilizations, only Autarchs
are truly supreme and transcendent. All others are quite common and
ordinary.” The white-robed elder waved a finger, causing countless
streams of light to appear midair within the palace. The light surged
forward and opened a door which led to a hidden dimension… and from
that hidden dimension flew out a series of jade slips as well as a
single dazzling and eye-catching godsense crystal.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
godsense crystal was far more dazzling than any gemstone. It caused
even Ning’s heart to shudder.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Here
are eleven scrolls of Omega Daos as well as my master’s own Dao,”
the white-haired elder said.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_36_Chapter_027__Daol"></A>
Chapter 27: The Second Palace</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning was stunned. A godsense legacy… and ten scrolls filled with
Omega Daos? The master of the Azureflower Estate, Autarch Awakener,
didn’t have a master-disciple relationship with Ning, but in truth
he had done far more for Ning than any ordinary master would.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“These
eleven scrolls of Omega Daos represent eleven absolutely dazzlingly
Daolords,” the white-haired elder said. “All of them trained to
become Daolords of the Fourth Step… but unfortunately, they all
failed in the Daomerge. Despite that they left behind their Daos to
posterity. Factor in the first one you received earlier, and you have
won for yourself a total of twelve Omega Dao scrolls. These are all
of the Omega Dao techniques which my master has collected.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
all failed in their Daomerge?” Ning felt a tremendous sense of
pressure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
my guess is correct… your path should be that of the Omega Dao as
well.” The white-haired elder looked at Ning, who nodded. Given how
easily Ning had knocked the Archon-level guardian out of the palace,
the white-haired elder had quickly come to this conclusion.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Daomerge for any Omega Dao is extremely, extremely difficult,” the
white-haired elder said. “Anyone who succeeds in the Daomerge for
an Omega Dao would gain inconceivable power, after all. It only makes
sense that its Daomerge is incredibly difficult.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded in understanding. Samsara Daolords all chose different Daos.
It was much like constructing a building. Ordinary Daolords who
walked ordinary Daos merely had to build a thatched cottage! Even if
they succeeded in the Daomerge, they would always remain within that
cottage. They would be correspondingly weak.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Omega Dao, however, required the construction of a giant palace that
was tens of thousands of meters tall! That meant it needed a far more
stable foundation… and even if the cultivator failed the Daomerge,
he would still be able to easily dominate those weaker Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">To
become a Daolord of the Fourth Step meant that all of the basic
preparations had been completed. One could attempt the Daomerge at
any time. If you failed the Daomerge, your palace would begin to
crumble. If you succeeded, it would be completed and eternal.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
of course, this was just a metaphor. To master an Eternal Omega Sword
Dao was far more complex than creating any so-called palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
fully mastered all eleven scrolls of the Omega Dao, then accepted the
crystal of godsense.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The godsense surged into his body, causing an awesome scene to appear
within his mind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
graceful youth dressed in a white robe with blue trims appeared in
Ning’s mind. The youth looked ordinary at first, but the more one
stared at him the more one would feel that he was deadly attractive.
After becoming an Autarch, every single inch of his body had become
naturally filled with the unspeakable aroma of the Dao! This sort of
Dao-aroma would naturally generate feelings of irresistible
attraction to weaker cultivators.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
graceful youth was standing within an ordinary-looking study,
teaching a group of children. Ning had become one of the children as
well, and he listened obediently as the young Awakener taught him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Soon,
the image changed to become that of an army camp. A military officer
was drilling his soldiers with the spear. The military officer was
the graceful youth, while Ning had become one of the soldiers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Then,
the scene transformed to become a barbarian tribe. The witch-doctor
who led this tribe was teaching the young tribesmen, with Ning one of
the tribesmen and the graceful youth the witch-doctor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">One
scene after another played out. They all seemed ordinary, but they
carried an ineffable, indescribable aura to them. Time flowed on for
what felt like a trillion years. Ning started as a mortal, became a
cultivator, and now was a Hegemon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
graceful youth stood there in the void, a group of cultivators
standing behind him. All of their auras were at the Hegemonic level,
with Ning amongst them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The graceful youth waved his sleeves, sending an ordinary-looking
gust of wind towards Ning and the other cultivators. However the
power of this gentle wind suddenly skyrocketed to become a billion
times more powerful. The wind instantly reached an absolutely
inconceivable level of power, instantly annihilating Ning and the
other cultivators. However, Ning and the others then reappeared once
more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is my Dao. All of you have seen what there is to see. You may leave,
now. Shoo.” The graceful youth smiled as he waved gently at the
group.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
suddenly came back to his senses.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
woke up?” The white-haired elder looked at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
up,” Ning said. “I feel as though a trillion years have gone by…
but I can sense from the local spacetime that only a day has actually
gone past.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
felt indescribable emotions in his heart. In the process of accepting
the legacy, he had been ‘trained’ from a child to the point of
becoming a Hegemon. Autarch Awakener had indeed displayed his Dao…
but he had done so through countless demonstrations over the course
of what felt like trillions of years. Ning felt a strong sense of
attachment to him, as though the Autarch truly was his master and
elder. When he thought of how Autarch Awakener had already perished,
Ning felt a sense of sorrow in his heart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You’ve
already viewed everything there is to view in the first palace. You
can now enter the second palace, which is the final palace,” the
white-haired elder said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
second palace?” Ning was startled. The first palace already
contained the countless techniques which belonged to the cultivator
civilizations, and even included countless retrofitted Sithe
techniques. It even held Omega Daos and Autarch Awakener’s own Dao!
What could the second palace possibly hold?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Follow
me.” The white-haired elder walked forwards.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.”
Ning followed from behind. They walked to the end of this palace
hall, where a passageway appeared in the walls. They entered the
passageway, arriving at a second hall.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
could see that the second hall was clearly much smaller, roughly
three hundred meters in size! It was laid out in accordance with the
principles of the Eight Trigrams, and the four walls were filled with
bookshelves and jade scrolls. However, the jade scrolls here numbered
in the tens of thousands at most. There truly were far fewer here
than in the previous hall.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Are
there even better techniques here?” Ning was puzzled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You’ve
already seen all of the techniques of two different types of
civilizations. What ‘better techniques’ are you expecting?” The
white-haired elder gave Ning a glance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
these jade scrolls…?” Ning stared at the surrounding area.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You’ll
know soon enough.” The white-haired elder pointed at the very
center of the second hall, at the center of the Eight Trigrams. As he
pointed, the ground in the center began to bulge upwards,
transforming into a stone dais that was shaped like the Eight
Trigrams and clearly meant for use as a meditation mat. The stone
dais was black with a few specks of white light glowing on its
surface. “Sit there.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
didn’t hesitate. Given how might Autarch Awakener was and how
powerful the wards within the Azureflower Estate were, it would be
easy for the estate-spirit to kill him. Hell, even Hegemons would be
slain with ease. Ning didn’t worry about any tricks or traps at
all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
walked over, then sat down in the lotus position atop the stone dais.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
A bone-chilling cold instantly pervaded his entire body. Ning
shivered. He could sense that the speed at which his truesoul
‘thought’ had just skyrocketed. He was now able to think
unfathomably faster than before.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
master spent untold amounts of effort to construct this Azureflower
Estate… and its heart is this stone dais,” the white-haired elder
said as he pointed at the stone dais. “The countless formations in
this estate have pooled their power within it, ensuring that it has
an absolutely incredible supportive effect! Sitting on it is akin to
being in a prajna-state of constant epiphany.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. When he sat atop this stone dais, the effect was indeed much
stronger than that of the Stone Censer of Reunion. Ning couldn’t
help but lower his head to look at the stone dais. This was simply
too incredible and marvelous. With this stone dais, he would be able
to cultivate the Dao much more quickly than before. Most likely, even
his chances at the Daomerge would be improved by a bit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
master originally constructed this stone dais for himself. He spent
his time cultivating atop it, and he paid an absolutely astronomical
price to create it. Now, he has left it to those who are linked to
this place by karma and destiny.” The white-haired elder watched as
Ning excitedly lowered his head and gently stroked the stone dais,
then continued; “Now that you have passed the trials, you can come
use this stone dais for as long as you are alive. I suspect that it
is highly unlikely a second destined person will make it here in the
next 108,000 chaos cycles.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded excitedly. This was definitely a truly supreme and peerless
treasure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Calm
down first. Once you’ve completely calmed down, I’ll talk to you
about something else,” the white-haired elder said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Ning could sense that his heart was still trembling. He had first
viewed the countless techniques belonging to two different types of
civilizations, then discovered this stone dais which vastly surpassed
the Stone Censer of Reunion. Ning naturally was in a state of shock!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
long while later, Ning finally began to calm down. He looked at the
white-haired elder, his heart tranquil.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
that you are calmer, I’ll explain.” The white-robed elder said,
“The reason why my master left behind so many arrangements and even
permitted you to view all of these techniques… is because of a
final, dying wish he had.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
final wish?” Ning was stunned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.”
The white-robed elder nodded. “You should have already trained in
the ‘Ninespace’ technique, yes?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
‘Ninespace’ technique?” Ning was startled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Those
Nine Chaos Seals,” the white-haired elder explained. “My master
created the Nine Chaos Seals. They allow you to establish a brand new
space within your sea of consciousness where an azure flower will
bloom. This is the ‘ninespace’ region. It can convert Immortal
energy, divine power, heartforce, and all other types of energy into
a single mist-like form of energy. Of all the techniques which my
master created in the countless years after he reached Autarchy, this
is his proudest… but also his greatest regret. Even when he died,
he still felt regret over this technique.”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_36_Chapter_028__Daol"></A>
Chapter 28: Creating Ten Techniques</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“His
greatest regret?” Ji Ning was rather puzzled. The Nine Chaos Seals
were indeed quite marvelous. They were capable of transforming his
heartforce, his divine power, his Immortal energy, and even the chaos
energy of the outside world. It made the energy inside his body far
more pure, and was extremely nourishing to the soul and truesoul.
Wasn’t it perfect?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes…
his greatest regret. Master had always felt regret over this
technique and was unhappy with it,” the white-haired elder said
with a nod. “The ‘Ninespace’ technique has many inherent flaws.
For example, one can only master it before reaching the World level!
Otherwise, there will be no way to establish the ninespace region
within the sea of consciousness. For another example, there’s no
way the mist-energy can leave the body.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. This was true, and the reason why in the past he had always
relied on close combat. However, the more powerful one became, the
more important one’s mastery over the Dao would be. By now, the
additional strength granted to him by the azureflower mist energy was
negligible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
these are all small flaws. If Master spent a bit more effort, he
would be able to perfect them,” the white-haired elder said. “The
fatal flaw to this technique… is that the ninespace region is at
most able to convert the power of Samsara Daolords! The divine power,
heartforce, and Immortal energy of Eternal Emperors cannot be
converted at all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was stunned. “Eternal-level energies cannot be converted?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right.
Thus, this technique is only useful to cultivators below the Eternal
Emperor level.” The white-haired elder shook his head and sighed.
“My master’s original plan was to create a total of twelve of
those chaos seals! Not only would this technique be able to convert
the energies of Eternal Emperors… it would even be able to convert
the energies of Autarchs! Only then would this technique be
considered perfect. If it could convert an Autarch’s energy, it
would be of huge benefit to even the Autarchs!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
could only nod. He didn’t really understand what Autarchs were
truly capable of, but being able to convert their energies had to be
quite helpful.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
reason why my master created this technique was because the Sithe
race relied upon a source of energy that was very pure and similar to
this mist energy,” the white-haired elder said. “Every member of
the Sithe race, from the weakest to the strongest, all used something
akin to your mist-energy.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ah?!”
Ning was stunned. “They don’t use divine power or Immortal
energy?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
do not.” The white-haired elder shook his head. “Their energy
source can be used the same way as divine power or Immortal energy is
used, but is even more powerful. Why would they need divine power or
Immortal energy?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was truly stunned now. It seemed as though the Sithe truly were
fundamentally different from cultivators; even their techniques were
completely different! Perhaps there were justa few simple techniques
like the [Daoheart] or the [Vitalis] arts which both sides could use.
This was the reason why Emperor Waveshift had moved Crimsonwave
Temple to his home without destroying the [Daoheart] or [Vitalis]
techniques.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“To
create an entirely new system of cultivation is unspeakably
difficult. Master labored by himself for untold aeons to find a way
to merge divine power, Immortal energy, heartforce, and all other
types of energy into this mist energy,” the white-haired elder
said. “This was Master’s greatest goal, and he poured all of his
effort into it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
scoured the cultivator civilizations for techniques, and even
retrofitted countless Sithe techniques for us to use… but his true
goal was still to create the Nine Chaos Seals.” The white-haired
elder looked at Ning. “Master is dead now, and his dying regret was
this technique. Thus, he hopes that his successors will be able to
create a tenth chaos seal… and perhaps help him realize his
hypothesized eleventh and twelfth chaos seals.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded slowly. He couldn’t help but ask, “If even the Autarch
failed, how could we successors possibly succeed?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Do
not underestimate any cultivator. Master was able to become an
Autarch due to his talent, but also due to the countless strokes of
good fortune he encountered. You juniors aren’t necessarily less
talented than my master… and in fact, you yourself were able to
develop an Omega Sword Dao at the Samsara Daolord level. When my
master was a Samsara Daolord, he wasn’t even close to being a match
for you,” the white-haired elder said. “There are some things
which you can do which my master might not be able to.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was enlightened. Indeed, every single extremely talented cultivator
had their own experiences and insights, and they would create
techniques with those different thoughts in mind. Autarch Awakener
had failed, but that didn’t mean that all cultivators would fail.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master
once lived here for many years, coming up with all sorts of
techniques.” The white-haired elder pointed at the stacks of jade
scrolls. “These are the various cultivation techniques which Master
collected. They include many techniques meant for mortals. These are
meant for ‘Foundation’, ‘Golden Core’, and ‘Nascent Soul’
cultivators… those over there are meant for the ‘Yin God’,
‘Thunder Tribulation’, and ‘Yang God’ cultivators… and
those are meant for ‘Core Formation’, ‘Nine Cycles’, and
‘Truth’ level cultivators. All sorts of cultivation techniques
are here, and they represent different paths of cultivation. However,
everything eventually points towards the path of divine power and
Immortal energy.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master’s
original plan was to create a completely new system of cultivation
from scratch, but it was simply too difficult. Thus, in the end he
developed the Nine Chaos Seals instead. These jade scrolls include
many of Master’s thoughts about creating new techniques as well as
other avenues he had considered.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
stared at the tens of thousands of jade scrolls on the bookshelves
around him. He couldn’t help but imagine how Autarch Awakener had
once sat on the stone dais, meditating on how to create better
techniques.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
was an exalted Autarch… and his dying regret was this technique?
Ning couldn’t help but sigh emotion. However, it made sense. As an
Autarch, Awakener had been completely and truly invincible. He was
able to create even alternate universes with ease. Autarch Bolin had
created the Aeonian race! As for Autarch Awakener, he had poured his
efforts into creating a technique that could convert Autarch-level
energies. Alas, the Autarchs had to be incredibly lonely; to be
invincible truly did mean to be lonely.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“As
a Daolord who was able to pass the trials, you are a truly dazzling
figure amongst your peers.” The white-haired elder looked at Ning.
“I hope you can help my master accomplish his greatest dream.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
won’t ask much of you. If you can create a tenth chaos seal,
that’ll be enough,” the white-haired elder said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. Ning was in a state of constant epiphany thanks to being
seated on the state dais, and countless insights were flashing
through his mind. However, the more he thought about the Nine Chaos
Seals, the more unfathomable and marvelous he found it to be. Ning
couldn’t help but feel a sense of true veneration. Anyone capable
of creating such a technique was truly inconceivable… how was he
supposed to make a further improvement to it?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
pondered there for many hours, then finally spoke: “It’s too
hard.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
of course it is hard! Master spent countless hours working on it to
no avail. How could it be so easily accomplished?” The white-haired
elder continued, “That is why master left a treasure behind to help
you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
listened attentively.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“However…
prior to me givng it to you, you must create ten different
techniques!” the white-haired elder said. “As you are a Daolord…
the complexity and profundity of every single technique must reach
the Archon level.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ten
different techniques, each of which must be at the Archon level?!”
Ning was flabbergasted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right!”
The white-haired elder nodded. “As a Daolord, if you can create ten
different Archon-level techniques, it will be considered proof that
you are quite talented when it comes to creating new techniques. In
that case, I can give you the other treasure which Master left
behind, and it will be of great use to you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
need to create ten techniques for just one treasure?” Ning felt as
though Autarch Awakener’s requirements were far too high. “But
creating a tenth chaos seal to add onto the original Nine Chaos Seals
will be of no use to me.” Ning shook his head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
tenth chaos seal would allow Eternal Emperors to convert their
energies… but the greatest problem facing Ning right now was the
Daomerge!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
treasure is an extremely valuable one. It is of great use to
cultivators, especially those facing the Daomerge like yourself.”
The white-haired elder added mysteriously, “Even the Autarch was
extremely reluctant to part with it, which is why he insisted that
you create ten techniques to prove your worth. Only then will he give
you the treasure. Otherwise, it would be wasted on you. My master
isn’t going to waste his resources like that.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is of great use to those facing the Daomerge?” Ning’s eyes lit
up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right.”
The white-haired elder laughed. He knew that this was what intrigued
Daolords the most. Every single Daolord was unable to resist the
allure of something which would aid them in the Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is ranked number one in the entire Chaosverse with regards to help
cultivators cultivate… and that naturally extends to the Daomerge
as well,” the white-haired elder said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is ranked number one? What about the Voidsea Jadeseal?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
heard of those things. They can only be created by Emperors who are
extremely talented in the Dao of Numerancy, but they are of no use to
cultivators like yourself, because you train in the Omega Sword Dao.
Right?” The white-haired man continued, “No number of Voidsea
Jadeseals would be of as much use to you as this treasure. However,
you have to first prove yourself in terms of your skill in creating
techniques before I’ll give it to you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ten
techniques, all Archon-level?” Ning nodded. “Fine, then. I’ll
create ten techniques.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">And
so, Ning began to create new techniques all by his lonesome within
the Azureflower Estate just outside the Three Realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had already reached the fourth stage with his [Omega Sword Dao], and
so it counted as his first Archon-level technique.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
[Heartforce Eradicator] technique was also extremely powerful and at
the Archon level in might, but its underlying mysteries were based on
the Omega Sword Dao and so it did not count. The [Dreamstar] art,
however, was a type of illusory art which was merely at the supreme
Daolord level. It was far too weak; it didn’t count.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thus…
at present Ning had only created a single Archon-level technique, the
[Omega Sword Dao]. He needed to create nine more before he would be
acknowledged as a gifted technique-creator by the spirit of the
estate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Luckily,
Ning had been given the chance to see countless techniques which had
been created by the cultivators as well as the Sithe, and was seated
atop that stone dais. He was constantly in a prajna-state, and so he
began to focus on his meditations. His first goal was to perfect his
[Dreamstar] art, as it had already reached the supreme Daolord level.
He only needed to upgrade it by one full level and it would be at the
Archon level of power.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_36_Chapter_029__Daol"></A>
Chapter 29: One Chaos Cycle</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Planning
was easy. Actually carrying it out was extremely difficult.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Since
Autarch Awakener, master of the Azureflower Estate, had decided that
creating ten Archon-level techniques was the trial which Daolords
needed to pass, there was no way that it would be easy for Ji Ning to
accomplish it. Daolord Featherdress had been an incredibly dazzling
Heartforce Cultivator and Daolord, but she had only created a single
supreme technique, the [Featherdress Soulthrall Melody]! Ning now
needed to do the same, but this would require a sufficiently deep
foundation in the art of illusions. If he hadn’t build up enough
experience, there would be no way he could possibly create such a
technique.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Illusions…”
the white-robed Ning sat there on the stone dais, runes swirling over
its surface as time moved a hundred times faster than in the outside
world. His eyes were closed as he continued to meditate, with one
technique after another flashing through his mind. These were all the
various heartforce illusion techniques which the cultivator
civilizations and the Sithe civilization had created.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Heartforce
was a very mysterious type of energy! It was able to merge with other
types of energy and allow one’s power to increase by an explosive
level. Ning was merely at the Archon level of enlightenment, but the
twelfth stance of the [Heartsword] art allowed him to stand above
virtually all other Archons. He was extremely close to the Hegemon
level of power. This was what was so marvelous about heartforce!
Heartforce illusions, in turn, were extremely common as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
cultivators and the Sithe had both created many different types of
heartforce illusions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Illusions
can be used like this?” Ning continuously analyzed and dissected
one illusory technique after another. The weakest were at the Archon
level, the stronger ones were at the Hegemon level, and a few were
even more profound than that. Previously, Ning had merely read
through them and memorized them; now, he was truly analyzing them. As
his analyses grew deeper and deeper, Ning began to accumulate a
steadily deepening foundation in the art of illusions, and his
[Dreamstar] art naturally began to slowly improve as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Every
single illusory art had profound mysteries hidden within them. Even
though the stone dais let him remain in a constant prajna-state, it
still took Ning an extremely long period of time to fully analyze and
dissect every single technique. The easier ones took as little as a
million years, while the longest took over a hundred million! And
this was with him only analyzing them up to the Archon level; for
now, he was completely unable to analyze the more profound mysteries.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
total, it took Ning over fifty-six billion years to finish analyzing
all of the illusory arts. If it hadn’t been for the stone dais, it
probably would’ve taken him ten thousand times as long!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Next,
Ning began to sort out and arrange the various insights he had
gained. He began to merge them together, seeking to create an
illusory art that belonged to him and him alone! After gaining so
many new insights, he immediately concluded that his [Dreamstar] art
was far too simple and crude; in fact, Ning felt that there were some
fundamental problems with its most basic underpinnings. Thus, he
chose to completely start from scratch and create his own illusions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Another
three billion years went by, at which point Ning finished sorting
through and merging all of his many insights together into a new
illusory art, which he named the [Unfettered Dreamlands].</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the second hall inside the palace. Atop the stone dais. Ning was
still seated in the lotus position, but his demeanor and aura had
both somewhat changed. In the past, this white-robed youth’s aura
had been stately and reserved, almost like a blade that had been
hidden within a sheath; when drawn, his sharpness would be on full
display! Now, however, Ning’s aura had become a bit more ephemeral
and ghostly. He was like a drifting cloud, a gust of wind, a
fluttering leaf, a ray of warm sunlight that broke through the
darkness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Cultivators
who saw him would feel a very comfortable feeling, and in their
hearts they would naturally feel very well-disposed towards Ning.
Even cultivators who had originally been nervous or depressed would
feel much more relaxed just by looking at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“To
be free and unfettered… for cultivators, this is far too rare. In
my illusions, however, I can find perfect, unfettered freedom.”
Ning smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
[Unfettered Dreamlands]… as the name suggested, the crucial parts
to it lay in the words ‘unfettered’ and ‘dreamlands’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">‘Dreamlands’
– Ning would set up an artificial world of dreams within the
illusions, with Ning being the one to envisage and design the
elements within this world! In fact, Ning could even set up a special
region within his actual heartworld and use it to simulate the
appearance of his ‘dreamlands’. Ning’s goal was to make the
dreamlands as real-looking as possible, while also filled with fatal
allure. He would then adjust it slightly in accordance with each
target.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">‘Unfettered’
– This referred to how the goal was to cause the opponent to
unconsciously be seduced by the illusions. There were some things
that simply couldn’t be forced; only when you managed to lower the
natural resistance generated within the depths of your foe’s
Dao-heart would you be able to make it more difficult for the foe to
escape your illusions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Think
about it; why was it that even the more shallow illusions were often
focused on the flaws in people’s hearts? For example, Ning deeply
desired to revive his wife, and so illusions targeted at Ning would
often conjure up images of Yu Wei and allow Ning to ‘reunite’
with her! This was because Ning wanted to see this more than anything
else, making his Dao-heart less resistant to it. If Ning’s
Dao-heart was weak, he might succumb to the illusions and be trapped
in them for longer, increasing the chances of him dying.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
a battle between experts, a second of slumber could result in death.
The words ‘unfettered’ and ‘dreamlands’ served as the nucleus
of the [Unfettered Dreamlands], which then transformed into countless
arcane and profound illusions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Senior,”
Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hm?”
The distant seated white-robed elder opened his eyes to look at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Here
is the second technique.” Ning pulled out a jade scroll upon which
was recorded the information regarding the heartforce illusion
technique which Ning had created, the [Unfettered Dreamlands]. The
jade scroll flew over to float in front of the white-robed elder.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-robed elder accepted it, inspected it carefully, then nodded.
“You spent just over half a chaos cycle and have managed to create
an Archon-level illusory art. Not bad, not bad. It seems you might
have a chance to actually create the ten necessary techniques.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
explained, “I’ve always been skilled in heartforce, which made
analyzing those illusions fairly easy! As for the other Daos… there
are some which I’m not skilled in at all. Creating techniques for
them shall definitely be far more difficult.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
was the most highly skilled in the Dao of the Sword. He had already
created the fourth stage of the [Omega Sword Dao] before arriving at
the Azureflower Estate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
was just slightly less attuned to heartforce, but thanks to the
effects of the stone dais he had been able to create the technique
after nearly sixty billion years. However, if you factored in
temporal acceleration, he had actually spent over half a chaos cycle!
<SUP><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">1</FONT></SUP> Finally, he
had been able to develop the [Unfettered Dreamlands] technique.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
cultivators calculated their lifespans, they calculated based on the
‘real’ time they had spent, excluding the benefits of accelerated
time. By now, Ning had spent more than half a chaos cycle in ‘real’
training.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Next,
Ning needed to accumulate insights into the Dao of Water and the Dao
of Lightning. After that would come the Dao of Fire, and then would
be the Daos of Space, Time, Earth, and a few others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, cultivators generally focused on a single Dao and wouldn’t
waste time on multiple other Daos. If you reached an extremely high
level in a single Dao, you would gain access to movement techniques,
invulnerable forms, defensive abilities, offensive abilities, and
more. This was true for all Daos, and so there was no need to
diversify. The Ninedust Sectlord, for example, focused exclusively on
the Dao of Water.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However…
from another perspective, it could be said that training in multiple
Daos had its own benefits as well. The differences between the Daos
could bring inspiration, as all Daos were linked together!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“With
the stone dais helping you, you should be able to do it.” The
white-haired elder looked at Ning. “Creating these ten techniques
will be of help to you as well. The Daomerge for the Omega Daos is
simply too difficult… creating multiple Archon-level techniques
will only benefit you, not harm you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”
Ning nodded. He had to admit this was true.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">And
so, Ning began to focus on analyzing the Dao of Water.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Dao of Water was a vast Dao which many, many people trained in. Ning
began to analyze one technique after another. There were many major
powers who had become supreme Daolords thanks to the Dao of Water.
Some had become Archons, while a few had become Hegemons! However,
everyone had a different interpretation of the Dao of Water, even
though the Dao itself was the same.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Alas,
Ning felt tremendous regret that despite there being countless
techniques pertaining to the Dao of Water, there was no ‘Omega
Water Dao’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Obviously,
Ning would need to spend much more time on the Dao of Water than he
had on illusions. And so, time slowly flowed on.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the blink of an eye, Ning had spent over an entire chaos cycle of
‘actual time’ training within the Azureflower Estate… and he
was still absorbed in his studies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Everything
was so peaceful and calm. No one in the Flamedragon Realmverse knew
that during the past chaos cycle, an utterly terrifying Heartforce
Cultivator had arisen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ever
since the Flamedragon Realmverse had lost its Heartforce Hegemon, it
had never given birth to another Eternal Emperor who was also a
Heartforce Cultivator. And indeed, it was extremely rare for Eternal
Emperors to be Heartforce Cultivators.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
Ning’s heartforce was quite strong upon him becoming a Daolord of
the Fourth Step, allowing him to easily trap a large number of
Emperors with illusions during the battle for Silksnow City, his
actual skill in illusions was rather low. He had completely relied on
his powerful heartforce to gain victory. Ning’s illusions had been
completely ineffective against Archon-level opponents.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Now,
however… Ning’s weakness in illusions had been addressed. He had
truly skyrocketed to a brand new level, the Archon level.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
stability of the Omega Sword Dao ensured that Ning’s heartworld was
probably second only to that of a Heartforce Hegemon’s! This made
his heartforce indescribably powerful. Now that both his heartforce
and his illusory arts had reached incredibly high levels, even a
number of the Archons of the Sacred Cities would fall to his
illusions. In a life-and-death battle, being trapped in an illusion
for even a brief instant would make it so that you lost control over
your invulnerable form… and Ning would take advantage of that
moment to slay his foe with ease.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_36_Chapter_030__Daol"></A>
Chapter 30: Heading Off</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was difficult for the three mighty Hegemons to slay Archon-rank
Emperors, precisely because the Emperors could use their invulnerable
forms to flee. However… if they were trapped in illusions, they
would be unable to escape or to maintain their invulnerable forms.
Their minds would’ve been drawn into the illusions, allowing them
to be killed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Heartforce
Emperors were the terrifying stuff of legends. The entire Flamedragon
Realmverse didn’t have a single Heartforce Emperor in it at
present. For Heartforce Cultivators to succeed in the Daomerge was
far more difficult than for those who trained in any other Dao; most
likely, it was second only to those who walked the path of the Omega
Dao. Heartforce Cultivators had to have extremely large and stable
heartworlds if they wished to have a chance at the Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thus,
Heartforce Cultivators would generally improve themselves to at least
the supreme Daolord level. Only then would they have sufficiently
large and stable heartworlds for them to even consider the Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
Ning had visited the alternate universe, he had seen the corpse of a
Heartforce Hegemon. He had also seen the Heartforce Hegemon who had
died in combat against the Sithe. Both of those were Emperors!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was virtually guaranteed that a Heartforce Cultivator who succeeded
in the Daomerge would become a Hegemon-rank Emperor! Only a tiny,
tiny fraction of them would end up as Archon-rank Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning,
however, was already comparable to Archon-rank Heartforce Emperors in
power! Although he wasn’t able to threaten Hegemons, he was more
than capable of threatening the other Archons.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">While
Ning was training, other things were happening within the distant
Terror Starsea.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
countless streams of fire formed a giant whirlpool that surrounded
and filled this vast territory. The flames were incomparably
beautiful, and they actually converged to form flowers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
skinny white-haired, white-browed man simply stood there at the edge
of the beautiful vortex of flames, staring into it. His white brows
fluttered as his oily green eyes stared intently into the very center
of the vortex.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.
Ninedust… no matter how crafty you are and how much you struggle,
you’ve still fallen into my trap.” Archon Silksnow smiled coldly.
“It took me a hundred million years, but I’ve finally found you.
Did you think I really want you dead? No… killing you is just a
perk. The person I really want to kill is Daolord Darknorth?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
frenzied, murderous look was in Archon Silksnow’s oily green eyes.
“You have chosen a path of death. You are actually helping me out
tremendously by charging into the ‘Jadefire Realm’! Haha… all I
need to do is send word of your predicament, and I trust your dear
friend Daolord Darknorth will come here to rescue you. I’m not able
to kill him… but the Jadefire Realm is!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
two of you will both die here.” Archon Silksnow’s eyes burned
with savage hate. In truth, when he had first entered the Terror
Starsea, his plan had been to kill Ninedust and steal his treasures.
He had carefully searched through many places within the Terror
Starsea. He was much more powerful than Ninedust and had the
assistance of his realmship, which meant that he was able to escape
from some of the more dangerous places thanks to its help. Even
though the Terror Starsea was a vast place, he was still able to find
the Ninedust Sectlord.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ninedust
had felt that he was already quite deep within the vast Terror
Starsea. Logically speaking, it wasn’t very likely for Archon
Silksnow to be able to locate him. This was why he had chosen to
carry the realmship part alongside him in a rather casual manner…
but who would’ve thought that thanks to luck and the realmship
resonance, Archon Silksnow had really ended up finding him?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ninedust
had immediately fled in terror. He moved fairly slowly, and so he
immediately used his escape-type treasures to flee! Archon Silksnow
was forced to pursue him, and this pursuit lasted for quite some
time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">No
matter how he tried, Ninedust was unable to shake his pursuer. In the
end, he had gritted his teeth and charged straight into the
legendarily lethal ‘Jadefire Realm’. “Hmph, I want to see if
Archon Silksnow would dare to come in as well.” All Daolords were
possessed of a certain defiant and fearless madness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
thought I wouldn’t dare to go in? Of course I would. I’d rather
die than live such a miserable life… but it won’t be me who dies.
Not only will you die, Daolord Darknorth will die as well.” Archon
Silksnow was legendary for his savagery, even amongst Emperors. He
was savage to others but even more savage to himself. He immediately
road his realmship straight into the vast flaming vortex.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Nightfall.
Vastheaven Palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
golden-robed Ning was seated at the peak of a mountain. The mountain
wind blew past him as he sipped some wine. Su Youji was next to him,
seated upon a large boulder and sharing the wine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
true body was training within the Azureflower Estate with the help of
the Autarch’s stone dais. This allowed him to train at a
terrifyingly fast speed. Whether or not Ning’s avatar ‘assisted’
didn’t really matter, as it was of little help in speeding up his
cultivation further. As a result, he now had a chance to relax and
enjoy life.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
two drank together, exchanging a few casual words in conversation
from time to time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master…
can you tell me about your Dao-companion?” Wine gourd in hand, Su
Youji suddenly asked this question.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
smiled. “She was my senior apprentice-sister. When I first joined
our sect, she was more powerful than me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“More
powerful than you?” Su Youji was surprised. In her eyes, Ning had
always been a dazzling figure. He was the most powerful Daolord in
the history of the Flamedragon Realmverse!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.
Back then, she held a very high status within our sect,” Ning said.
“The two of us actually took part in the Conclave of Immortals
together. She really was quite talented. Unfortunately… she
concealed a great secret within her heart which prevented her from
fully and truly devoting herself to cultivation.” Ning let out a
sigh. “Come to think of it… she was a truly tragic figure in both
her past life and in this life.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Her
happiest days were most likely when she was pregnant and living
together with me in peace.” Ning smiled. He would never forget
those days, never forget how he trained in sword-arts while the
pregnant Yu Wei watched him, a merry smile on her face as she gently
stroked her protruding belly. Those days of peace and bliss, when the
war had yet to truly erupt, were the most beautiful memories he had.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Our
daughter is all grown up, and the plotters are all dead. My homeland
is at peace… but she is gone.” Ning raised his head to gulp down
the wine, then put down his gourd. “I’ve focused on the Dao my
entire life. Part of it is because I wish to gain a grander
understanding of the universe and see more of its sights… but the
other part is because I wish to one day be able to resolve those
regrets and have our family of three be reunited once more.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You’ll
definitely succeed, Master,” Su Youji said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
the past, it was just a wild dream… but now, I can feel that I’m
closing in on success.” Ning smiled. “This is proof that even the
wildest of dreams can be made real.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
the three of us can be reunited, everything will have been worth it,
haha. So what if I pass the Daomerge? So what if I become a Hegemon
or an Autarch? I’ll still just be living a life of solitude.”
Ning raised his head up high to drink more wine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
wind continued to blow, but the night was very calm. Su Youji just
watched Ning silently. She could sense that Ning’s innermost heart
had already been filled. There was no way at all for another person
to enter it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth!
Darknorth!” A cry rang out from afar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Big
brother?” Ning turned, only to see a figure fly towards him from
afar. It was Emperor Solesky. “Come, come! You came at just the
right time. Let’s drink!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
have important news to report!” Emperor Solesky landed on the top
of the mountain, a worried look on his face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Important
news? Tell me about it,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Ninedust Sectlord has been trapped within the ‘Jadefire Realm’ of
the Terror Starsea! His life could end at any moment,” Emperor
Solesky said frantically.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!”
Ning turned pale as a solemn look appeared on his face. “The
Jadefire Realm of the Terror Starsea?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Jadefire Realm was a deathtrap which the Sithe had set up during the
Dawn War. Countless Emperors of the cultivator civilizations had died
there during that great war! In the end, the Sithe had been defeated
and the Jadefire Realm badly damaged… but it remained a place of
great danger. Not even Hegemons dared to go too deep within it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
Ning wasn’t afraid of it. He had his Shadowless form as well as his
Sithe Protector golem, ‘Whitethaw’. Hegemons were able to enter
and scout the outer areas safely, which meant that he was strong
enough to deal with the dangers as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
the Jadefire Realm.” Emperor Solesky nodded. “This information is
absolutely trustworthy. My good friend, Daolord Badlands, sent me the
same information a while ago. He said that he engaged in some
Numerancy to test it, and found it to be genuine. The Ninedust
Sectlord is indeed in great peril. However… Badlands told me to
warn you that you are the real target. He was unable to calculate if
you will be in danger or not.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
the real target?” Ning nodded slowly. “Help convey my thanks to
brother Badlands.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ninedust
didn’t ask me for help. That means he is worried about implicating
me in this affair… but somehow, news of it still spread. That means
this is likely an enemy plot.” Ning nodded. “If Badlands’
Numerancy says that this is a plot targeting me… the person who
holds the greatest grudge against me is Archon Silksnow and the
Emperors under his command. Alternately, it could be the Aeonians.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
the Jadefire Realm is a legendary deathtrap of the Terror Starsea.
Not even Hegemons dare to go too deep into it,” Emperor Solesky
said worriedly. “Don’t let yourself fall for their schemes.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded: “Don’t worry, big brother.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Azureflower Estate. The second hall. Ning stood up on the stone dais.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hm?”
The nearby white-bearded elder opened his eyes. He said with
surprise, “You’ve developed the third technique already?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
yet.” Ning shook his head. “Not even close. Right, senior… I
need to leave on some business. My Primaltwin can come here and
train, right?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Of
course! I told you, so long as you are still alive, you may come and
train whenever you please,” the white-haired elder said with a nod.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Good.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
short while later, the black-robed Ning arrived at the estate. He
entered it, sat down on the stone dais, then continued the training
process. This was an Autarch’s training chambers, after all; it was
far more effective than the Stone Censer of Reunion, which Ning had
already left in the Three Realms for his master Subhuti, his
daughter, and his parents to use. In the future, it would be the
supreme treasure of the Three Realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for Ning’s true body? He left the Azureflower Estate by himself,
beginning to advance through the Flamedragon Realmverse towards the
Terror Starsea.</P>
