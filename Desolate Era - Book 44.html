had never been kind to Ji Ning. Wracked by illnesses and infirm his
entire life on Earth, Ning knew early on that he would die as a
teenager. What he didn’t know was that there really was such a
thing as life after death, and that the multiverse was a far larger
place than he thought. A lucky twist of fate (one of the few in
Ning’s life) meant that Ning was reborn into a world of Immortals
and monsters, of Ki Refiners and powerful Fiendgods, a world where
Dynasties lasted for millions of years. A world which is both
greater…and yet also smaller…than he ever could imagine. He would
have the opportunity to join them, and in this life, Ning swore to
himself, he would never let himself be weak again! The Era he was
born into was a Desolate one, but Ning would make it his era.

Chapter 1: Grand Army, Mobilize!</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
peaceful, beautiful, and vast world where Hegemons and Emperors
resided.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come,
try this new dish I came up with.” Three Hegemons and five weaker
Emperors were seated next to each other. A curly red-haired man
walked out from a nearby hall, a smile on his face as he called out
to them. He then waved his hand, causing the platters before him to
fly towards his eight friends. Each platter was filled with red
strips of meat covered by some sort of sauce.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
absolutely must try brother Bluefive’s delicacies.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Whoah,
not bad. It’s quite crispy. The flavor goes all the way down to my
toes! I feel absolutely wonderful. Unnngh… in fact, I almost feel a
bit tipsy…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
delicious, absolutely delicious.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Bluefive,
bring out some more. We’re almost finished!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Hegemons all praised the food and asked for more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Calm
down! This is something I just finished concocting. If you like it,
I’ll make some more in a bit,” the red-haired man chortled. He
felt quite delighted and proud that his friends loved his food.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Right
at this moment…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
Sithe warriors, prepare to receive the orders of almighty Iyerre!”
a voice suddenly thundered. The words echoed throughout the world,
reverberating throughout every inch of it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
nine of the Hegemons and Emperors who had been eating and chatting,
including Bluefive, instantly turned pale.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
a vast, blurry pillar of light suddenly appeared at the highest point
in the very center of this world. A humanoid figure slowly began to
take form within the pillar of light. It was the balding, barefoot,
gray-robed Iyerre. The tall and muscular Iyerre stared downwards upon
everyone in the world. This was just a projection, but it was enough
to cause all the Hegemons and Emperors to quiver with fear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
the Hegemons and Emperors, be it the ones who were training in their
estates or the ones who were partying with friends, all came out to
bow with incomparable reverence, demonstrating their respect and
submission towards this man.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Warriors
of the Sithe.” Iyerre stared downwards at them, a smile on his
face: “You have all come from our homeland to this foreign
Chaosverse… and for what?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“To
fight! To fight a war that will change all of our destinies, both
yours and mine! We have to win this war! If we win, all of you will
gain absolute freedom for yourselves… and I, Iyerre, shall forever
remember you and treat you kindly,” Iyerre said. “Our last war
was nothing more than a trial run. This one, however, shall be the
final war! There is no way out for any of us. Once we lose this
battle, we’ll have no chance of winning in the future.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
the Hegemons and Emperors felt their hearts clench. No way out? They
had a way out last time; when they saw that things were turning
against them, they retreated to this place.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“An
Eternal Omega Dao has arisen within this Chaosverse! If we don’t
attack now, the natives of this Chaosverse shall quickly become so
powerful that we’ll have no chance of defeating them at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thus…
this time, we have to win no matter the cost! Those who perform well
shall all be rewarded. Even if you die in battle, I’ll reverse
spacetime to bring you back. Those cowards who elect to flee,
however… even if they manage to survive, I’ll put them all to
death!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now,
everyone shall mobilize! Follow the plan we prepared long ago and
advance to the various realmverses of the native cultivators!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
vast airborne image of Iyerre slowly began to dissipate. A sense of
pressure quickly began to press down upon all the Hegemons and
Emperors within this great world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
the final war is finally beginning.” Hegemon Bluefive, standing
amongst his eight friends, murmured softly: “I was lucky enough to
survive the last war, then were given so many years of blissful peace
in this world. This was more than we had any right to expect!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Some
of us came later on, after the first war had already come to an end.
But… Bluefive, we already know everything there is to know about
these cultivators. We’re going to win this war.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right.
We’ll definitely win.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
no way out. Only victory will grant us release.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fight.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fight.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fight!”
The Hegemons and Emperors exchanged glances with each other. They
could sense the firm resolve and combative auras emanating from their
peers. Their destinies had been set down in stone long ago; they had
to obey Iyerre’s orders, and Iyerre had ordered them to this
Chaosverse. Here, they had quietly waited for the war to begin. Their
only hope lay in victory.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
had all come here for the sake of gaining victory in the final war.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Follow
the plan which was set down long ago. Board the warships and prepare
to mobilize!” a loud voice boomed out, echoing throughout the
world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Prepare
to mobilize!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Board
the warships!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Move
faster!” Voices rang out from throughout the world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
get ready to go.” Bluefive and his eight friends transformed into
streaks of light that shot off into the distance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
just the time needed to boil a kettle of tea, a series of enormous
warships began to soar into the skies. Each warship held a total of
roughly twenty Hegemons and many more Emperors, as well as many
golems and mighty treasures.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Activate!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
space began to tremble as the power which had lain dormant for so
many years in this mysterious dimension was finally activated. It was
like an enormous flower had begun to bloom.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
particular dimension had been hidden within a part of the Great Dark
of the local Chaosverse. It had been buried here for countless years,
and the cultivators had never discovered its existence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
veritable throng of warships simultaneously flew out in every
direction.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Good
luck.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Take
care, elder brother Svastika.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Best
of luck.” Many friends bade each other farewell.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Countless dimensional tunnels
appeared around them. Each warship flew into a dimensional tunnel,
warping away at high speed. They were able to warp through spacetime
much more quickly than realmships could; each of them was comparable
to the Blacksun in this regard! These ancient warships had been
created for the express purpose of battle and transportation, and
they were incredible in both aspects.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">On
this day, a total of eighteen different hidden dimensions located in
different regions simultaneously released countless warships unto an
unsuspecting Chaosverse. The Sithe had spent countless aeons filling
these hidden dimensions with many mighty experts! Many of them had
been sent over from the Sithe Chaosverse after they had lost the
first war.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
native cultivators had produced many new experts over the aeons, but
the Sithe Chaosverse had produced even more. Many of them had been
sent over to this Chaosverse, where they had hidden themselves and
awaited Iyerre’s orders. Now that the orders had arrived, they all
mobilized and began to spread throughout the Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Flamedragon Realmverse. The Three Realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning was in secluded meditation on Brightheart Island. He was under
the effects of 100x temporal acceleration and was diligently focusing
on the mysteries behind the sphere of annihilation at all times. He
had the feeling that if he used it as a guidepost to create a
matching Sword Dao, that Sword Dao would possess absolutely
incredible power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning suddenly opened his eyes, breaking his meditations. This was the
exact moment those eighteen hidden dimensions had suddenly revealed
themselves, blooming into existence and releasing an enormous number
of warships which had quickly spread themselves throughout the
Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
that instant, Ning could sense a deep, forboding aura of danger come
crashing down upon him. It was as though dark stormclouds had
suddenly blotted out the sun above him. This invisible pressure made
it impossible for Ning to remain calm and collected! Not even the
appearance of the Annihilation Hive had generated a sense of danger
as great as the one Ning felt right now. The premonition of danger
was so great that Ning could feel his heart shuddering.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
going on? What the hell just happened?” Ning had an inkling, but he
wasn’t certain of it. He didn’t dare believe it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Last
time, Ning could distinctly sense where the sense of danger was
originating from. This time was different! The danger was completely
omnipresent, as though every single part of the Chaosverse was in
grave danger. There was no way to find the ‘source’ of it, and as
a result Ning didn’t know what to do.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mogg.
Titanos. What’s going on? Do you know what just happened?” Ning
immediately sent a message through the Autarch message-talisman.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the ancient temple that levitated in the skies above that island in
the outer perimeter of the Sithelands. Autarch Mogg and the others
were all gathered here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
the hell? What the hell just happened? I-I…” Autarch Ekong had a
frantic, fearful look on his face. This sense of danger caused him to
feel extremely uneasy. It was as though the entire Chaosverse had
just been plunged into darkness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
Autarch Mogg, Autarch Skyfeeder, Autarch Stonerule, and Autarch
Titanos were all quite calm. They simply exchanged a glance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
has finally begun,” Autarch Titanos said softly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
nightmarish feeling of doom… I never wanted to feel it again, but
here it is.” Autarch Skyfeeder shook her head. She would never be
able to forget what a calamitous war the Dawn War had been. Far, far
too many of their Hegemons and Emperors had died in that war.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Our
greatest fear has been realized.” Autarch Mogg shook his head. “Our
seals really were useless against them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Mogg could sense that Ning had just sent them a message. He took out
his message-talisman, then sent a single message out:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
the war has begun!”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_44_Chapter_002__The"></A>
Chapter 2: Ji Nings First Massacre</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
The door to a private room swung open, followed by the white-robed Ji
Ning striding out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Father.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Young
master.” Brightmoon and Autumn Leaf were the nearest, and they
immediately came over to greet him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
looked at his daughter and his ‘elder sister’, then turned to
gaze at the world around him. His gaze saw past the walls of reality,
allowing him to see all of the chaosworlds of the Three Realms at a
glance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
hope that the flames of war will not scorch the Three Realms,” Ning
murmured softly to himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nuwa,”
Ning sent mentally. Whoosh! A figure warped through space and
immediately appeared before him. It was Mother Nuwa.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
why have you summoned me?” Nuwa smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
war against the Sithe has already begun,” Ning said. Nuwa and
Brightmoon both turned pale. Autumn Leaf, however, simply had a
puzzled look on her face. She was at a very low level of power, and
so there were many secrets which she simply didn’t need to know.
Brightmoon was both a Daolord of the Fourth Step and Ning’s
daughter. She was more or less considered a member of the Three
Realms’ highest echelon, and so she was naturally informed of many
secrets as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Father,
the war has begun?” Brightmoon looked very anxious. “Th-then…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
war has begun. The Sithe are targeting the various Hegemons of our
realmverses,” Ning said. “As for the countless mortals,
World-level cultivators, and Daolords? They don’t really care. They
won’t even waste too much energy on hunting down the weaker
Emperors. It’ll be safer for you to stay in the Three Realms.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
one of the paramount leaders of the cultivators, Ning naturally had
to lead the charge! He would go wherever there was the most danger.
The Sithe had failed during their last attempt. Given that they dared
to come again, they had most assuredly made ample preparations and
adjustments based on their past experiences. The Annihilation Hive
alone proved to Ning that the Sithe were to be dreaded! Most likely,
even their Autarchs would be at risk of dying.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
meant it would be very dangerous for his friends and family members
in the Three Realms to accompany him. It was actually far safer for
them to remain behind in the Three Realms instead.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Take
good care of the Three Realms.” Ning looked at Brightmoon then
instructed solemnly, “Do everything you can to keep it safe.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
Father,” Brightmoon said hurriedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded slowly. He had long ago fashioned many formations and other
treasures which would ensure that the Three Realms was almost
completely impregnable! Even Sithe Exalts would have a difficult time
breaking into it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nuwa,
I’ll send you to the front lines,” Ning said. Mother Nuwa nodded.
As a Hegemon, she had to take part in this war!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Before
leaving, Ning gave a lingering final glance to the world behind him.
This was the world he had loved and had roamed for so many years. He
had spent many years here in secluded meditation, teaching his
disciples, and even gardening…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go.” Ning said nothing else, immediately leading Mother Nuwa in
warping away from the Three Realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
vast, empty region outside the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance. This
place had long ago been designated as a major battlefront, much like
the Terror Starsea of the past.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Here
we are.” Ning only needed to warp through spacetime three times
before arriving at the battlefront, Nuwa in tow. The dimensional
ripples generated by their arrival meant that the two of them were
almost instantly discovered, and the disheveled-looking ‘Realmslord
Windgrace’ personally came to greet them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Emperor
Darknorth,” Realmslord Windgrace said with incredible respect.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Have
you finished preparing the battlefront?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
finished long ago. The many treasures which Autarch Titanos gave us
made the process quite quick.” Realmslord Windgrace was filled with
confidence. “The battlefront before us is a first-class
battlefront. The Hegemons and Emperors of the Sixteen Realmverses
Alliance and many other nearby realmverses have all been gathered
here. We have over 105 Hegemons alone, and many of them brought their
avatars. If the Sithe dare come, we’ll wipe out as many as they
send.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Realmslord
Windgrace was very confident because back during the Dawn War, the
cultivators didn’t have nearly as many powerful weapons as they did
right now. They had relied purely on formations, and as a result they
had suffered incredibly heavy casualties.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
had won the Dawn War, and they had acquired many Sithe weapons as a
result! Autarch Titanos had also spent countless aeons forging many
similar weapons which were even more suitable for cultivators to use.
Autarch Titanos normally kept them in reserve, because he didn’t
want to let these super weapons throw the entire Chaosverse into a
state of turmoil! However, ever since Ning and the others had begun
to suspect that the seal over the Sithe heartlands had failed, they
had immediately begun to make the necessary arrangements. They had
started to prepare battlefronts in secret, with the Hegemons and
Emperors all gathered there.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Nuwa
was responsible for helping Ning protect the Three Realms. As a
result, she was a bit of an outlier and was permitted to remain in
the Three Realms. When the battle began, Ning sent her over in
person.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Brightshore and the others had long ago travelled to this
battlefront. Most of them had only left behind weak, newly-created
avatars behind in their respective realmverses. Once the war actually
began, they would immediately discard those avatars and focus on
maintaining and strengthening a single mighty avatar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
good.” Ning smiled. “This is going to be a long-lasting war. We
need to conserve as much of our power as possible, even as we try to
slay as many enemies as is possible. The Sithe have been lying in
wait for many, many years. Now that they have arisen anew, you
absolutely must not be complacent or underestimate them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood,”
Realmslord Windgrace responded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
off then.” Ning gave Nuwa a final glance, then turned and
disappeared without a trace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Mother
Nuwa and Realmslord Windgrace both watched as Ning disappeared. They
knew that as an Autarch-class combatant, Ning was responsible for
many battlefronts throughout the entire Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
Ning appeared at the margins of a different realmverse. His godsense
was so great that it was able to cover an area a hundred times vaster
than a single realmverse. As a result, he was able to investigate
everything within this realmverse with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
are no Sithe here.” Ning immediately warped away once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
war had already begun. The six Autarchs and Ning had long ago
prepared their strategy for fighting this war! Countless Hegemons and
Emperors had long ago been gathered in various prepared battlefronts
which were spread throughout the Chaosverse! Every single battlefront
varied in size, based on how many Hegemons and Emperors resided in
the surrounding area. The region around the Flamedragon Realmverse
didn’t actually have all that many Hegemons and thus probably
wouldn’t be a high-priority target, but since it was his homeland
Ning was going to do a wide-ranging inspection of it before leaving.
As a result, there was no need for any other battlefronts to be
prepared anywhere near the Flamedragon Realmverse!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
reason why the battlefront Mother Nuwa and Realmslord Windgrace were
in was actually located extremely far away. Ning had to warp through
spacetime three times before he could reach it! The sheer number of
experts they had gathered there was why it was classified as a
first-class battlefront.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hm.”
The white-robed Ning appeared out of nowhere above a grayish planet.
His godsense stretched out once more as he scanned for any traces of
the Sithe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nothing.”
Ning disappeared once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Starting
from the Flamedragon Realmverse, Ning began an inspection of all the
nearby realmverses. If he found any hint of the Sithe at all, he
would immediately be able to trace them and then slay them!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
six Autarchs and Ning, along with their respective avatars, were all
responsible for watching over different regions. They began to
‘sweep’ through their assigned locations. However, each ‘zone’
was so incredibly vast that it would take time. It must be remembered
that it would usually take them months traveling in a straight line
at top speed to pass through these zones! This was a testament to how
truly vast the Chaosverse was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Right
now, they had to carefully inspect every single part of their zones
in detail. The only reason they dared to do this was because they
were so much faster than everyone else. They would get rid of the
Sithe they encountered as soon as possible, so as to relieve the
pressure on the Hegemons and Emperors on their side.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
six of our battlefronts have discovered Sithe warships and moved to
engage them,” Autarch Titanos sent through the message-talisman.
“The Sithe have already sent out their grand army. More and more
Sithe warships will begin to launch attacks throughout our
Chaosverse. We need to destroy as many of them as possible, since we
have fewer Hegemons, Emperors, and treasures than the Sithe.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Ning nodded. He also knew that the Sithe were better at producing
Hegemons and Emperors. Given how much time had passed, they had
probably also sent many new Hegemons from their homeland. Without a
doubt, the Sithe had a significant advantage in cultivators and
treasures. It was up to the six Autarchs and Ning to make up for that
advantage!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Whoosh! Whoosh! Ning continued to sweep through one realmverse after
another. Thankfully, he was able to scan at extremely great
distances. His techniques were also so incredible that he could
detect even remnant auras left behind by already-departed warships.
Thus… after the time needed to boil a kettle of tea, Ning found
what he was looking for.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“An
aura?” Ning’s godsense quickly discovered a faint rippling aura
from somewhere far away in the Great Dark. This was an aura which the
Chaosverse itself was pushing back against.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Sithe!”
Ning immediately recognized the aura and began to charge towards it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
Swoosh! Swoosh! Just a few short warps later, Ning was able to see an
enormous warship cruising through space in front of him. This warship
was so large, it was on par with the Tigerhill warship Ning had
discovered all those years ago.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
person responsible for inspecting spacetime instantly discovered Ning
warping through spacetime towards them. They detected Ning’s entire
body blazing with such dazzling, luminescent power that the Sithe
couldn’t even look at him directly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
one of the native Autarchs!” The Sithe Hegemons and Emperors within
the warship instantly felt despair. Encountering one of the native
Autarchs midflight… this was their worst nightmare.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flee!
Flee, everyone! Let as many escape as is possible!” None of the
Sithe believed they could possibly resist one of the Autarchs.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_44_Chapter_003__The"></A>
Chapter 3: Miserable</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
warship was in control of spacetime in the surrounding area, making
it impossible to warp through spacetime once you entered the range of
a hundred billion kilometers around it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?
The warship actually blocks out heartforce?” Ji Ning had been
planning on using his ‘Heartforce Eradicator’ technique to kill
them, only to find that it wouldn’t go through the hull of the
ship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Quick,
let’s flee!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Run
away!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Give
him a blast first!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
A terrifyingly large dimensional blade shot out through space,
smashing at Ning with Autarch-level power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
immediately transformed into a storm of wind and lightning, instantly
traversing the distance of a hundred million kilometers in a ghostly,
unpredictable manner. The giant dimensional blade which had shot out
of the warship couldn’t even come close to touching him, and just a
heartbeat later Ning had reached the warship itself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
Swoosh! Swoosh! Hegemons and Emperors had begun to appear outside the
vast warship. They were beginning to scatter and flee in every single
direction. Every single person who survived would represent a ‘win’
for them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Die.”
Ning swept them with his cold gaze, and an invisible surge of power
instantly swept across them. This powerful heartforce assault
instantly wiped them out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
I go.” Ning touched the outer hull of the warship, instantly
blinking inside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ahhh!
Not good! The Autarch has come inside!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Doomed.
We’re doomed.” The Hegemons and Emperors inside the warship all
discarded any notions of escaping, because it was now clear that
certain death awaited them outside as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Revered
Autarch, are you willing to spare these weak children?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Spare
us! We were forced to do this.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Cultivator
Autarch, you can kill us, but I would like to ask you to spare our
children. They belong to your Chaosverse and are part of it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Some
of the Hegemons begged for mercy, while some accepted death but asked
for mercy for their descendants.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
soon as Ning had entered, he had immediately been able to scan every
inch of the warship with ease via heartforce! With but a thought, he
would wipe out all of the Sithe present. This was what made
heartforce so deadly! If Autarch Bolin or Autarch Ekong had arrived,
they would’ve had to waste time breaking through the various
defenses. Heartforce cultivators, in contrast, were able to wipe out
large numbers of opponents from afar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Get
in here.” Ning flickered past over a hundred Hegemons and Emperors
who had already given up. With a wave of his hand, he drew them into
his estate-world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">With
another flicker, Ning arrived at the centermost region of this entire
warship. A large number of Sithe descendants lived here. Once the war
had begun, the various hidden dimensions were exposed and no longer
safe. Over the course of countless aeons, those hidden dimensions had
produced many Sithe descendants. They naturally had to accompany the
warships in leaving.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“These
Sithe descendants…” Ning shook his head slowly, then waved his
hand and drew in all the thronging masses of Sithe descendants as
well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
rest can die.” There were a number who were still struggling to
flee. They were scattered throughout the warship, and Ning had no
time to waste on capturing them one-by-one. He simply cast his
‘Heartforce Eradicator’… and with a thought, all of them were
slain!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, Ning knew that many of the Sithe warriors had been forced into
this war. However, this was a clash of civilizations that would
result in the destruction of one! Ning’s time was extremely
precious. He was willing to capture and imprison a few Sithe instead
of killing them if it didn’t take up too much time, but if it did?
He’d rather just wipe them out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
you go.” After exiting the warship, Ning collected both the warship
as well as several realmships floating around next to it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Generally
speaking, the warships which Ning or Autarch Stonerule were
responsible for attacking would be captured in perfect condition.
Autarch Ekong and the others mostly used highly destructive attacks,
resulting in the warships being damaged or destroyed. As for this
particular warship Ning had captured, it was a transport warship that
had been filled with many artifacts and treasures that hadn’t even
been used yet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Twenty-six
different battlefronts are under attack. They are located…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">New
information came from Ning’s Autarch message-talisman. As one of
the supreme leaders of the cultivators, Ning naturally knew where all
their forces throughout the Chaosverse were located. Thus, he
immediately knew which ones were under attack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
very close to the Springsea battlefront. I’ll head there
immediately,” Autarch Stonerule sent to the other six. The Autarchs
were all exchanging information with each other, ensuring that they
were on top of the situation overall.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
flowed on. More and more battlefronts became embroiled in war. Given
how far the various battlefronts were from each other, the Autarchs
and Ning were all separately responsible for different theaters and
could only do their best to cause as much damage as possible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
one of the native Autarchs!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
dazzling figure of golden light suddenly appeared. The Sithe Hegemons
and Emperors who were assaulting the battlefront were all stunned.
They knew that encountering a native Autarch represented doom.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Die.”
Ning swept his gaze across the Sithe. In order to keep his true
identity hidden, during battle he intentionally kept his aura flared
to the max, making it impossible for the Sithe to know who he was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">An
awesome wave of heartforce immediately spread out, covering an area
comparable to more than half a realmverse. With but a thought, Ning
eradicated over 99% of the Sithe who were spread out throughout the
battlefront, even the ones who were located within forts and castles!
Only the few who were lucky enough to be inside castles and warships
which blocked out heartforce were able to survive, but Ning simply
spent a few more seconds mopping them up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sithe in the Rearlake battlefront have all been exterminated.” Ning
sent word to the other six Autarchs, then hurried to his next
destination.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Autarchs and Ning seized every moment, continuing hastening across
the Chaosverse continuously scanning for threats. Every so often,
they would make a stop at a nearby battlefront that had already been
embroiled in war! As for the more distant ones, they wouldn’t be in
a rush to go to them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
war began to expand in both scale and ferocity. By now, there were
multiple battles going on throughout the Chaosverse at every moment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Things
weren’t so bad for Ning and Autarch Stonerule, as they were able to
use their heartforce powers to instantly exterminate large numbers of
Sithe! The other Autarchs had a much rougher time of it. Many of the
Sithe were protected behind castles or formations, and these Autarchs
had to go through the time-consuming process of breaking through
those defenses.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Keep
on killing them for all I care. How many can you possibly get rid of,
Autarchs?” Iyerre sat upon his throne. He was quite calm despite
the many messages he received from the squads he had sent out. “I
have far, far more warriors under my command than your civilization
does, and I have far more powerful treasures as well! Even if you
massacre half of them, the other half is more than enough to ensure
that countless Hegemons and Emperors belonging to your Chaosverse
will die.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
didn’t care at all about the casualties his subordinates had
suffered. Even if they died, their truesoul fragments would return to
the Sithe Chaosverse; there was no permanent loss at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
when the native Hegemons and Emperors perished their truesouls would
be devoured by Sithe techniques, resulting in this Chaosverse being
weakened. Eventually the sheer magnitude of deaths would result in
the Chaosverse being so weak that he, Iyerre, would have a very good
chance of becoming the Lord of Chaos for this Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Just
keep fighting.” Iyerre was in full control of the war. He knew
exactly how many losses he had suffered and the cultivators had
suffered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning was feeling increasingly anxious. He killed at a very fast pace,
but the majority of his time was spent traveling. The Chaosverse was
simply too vast! The Sixteen Realmverses Alliance was only possible
because those sixteen realmverses were quite close to each other.
There were many realmverses which were extremely far from each other,
which was why the empty space between realmverses was known as the
‘Great Dark’ to many. Ning would usually need anywhere from half
a day to two days to travel from realmverse to realmverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
more he and his six peers slew, the fewer of their own Hegemons and
Emperors would die. But if things continued the way they currently
were, they were going to suffer enormous losses in Hegemons and
Emperors on their own side as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Skywitch battlefront is in desperate need of assistance.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Ninelamps battlefront is in desperate need of assistance.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Dragoncaller battlefront is in desperate need of assistance.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">One
report came after another. A total of twenty-six battlefronts were in
dire straits right now. They had achieved great successes in some
battlefronts, but these twenty-six were in grave danger! The Sithe
had their own ‘elite squads’, and these squads were
extraordinarily powerful.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
was nothing Ning could do. All twenty-six of these battlefronts were
very far away from him. It would take him over half a month to reach
even the nearest one.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
go to the Dragoncaller battlefront,” Autarch Skyfeeder replied.
“I’ll need three days to get there.” She was the only one who
could go respond. None of the other Autarchs would get there in time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">‘Desperate
need of assistance’ meant that the situation was so grim, they
wouldn’t be able to last much longer without help. In the end, they
were only able to preserve half their forces in the Dragoncaller
battlefront. They lost everyone else in all twenty-five of the other
battlefronts! Clearly, while the Autarchs were busy massacring the
Sithe they found, their own Hegemons and Emperors were being slain on
the field of battle as well. This was a truly ruinous war of
attrition.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Many
Sithe died, but at least they would have a chance at being brought
back to life! Those native cultivators who had been slain, however,
could never be brought back if the soul-eater technique was used
after their deaths. They became true martyrs for this war.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had no choice but to suppress the rage he felt. Early on, he
imprisoned as many of the Sithe as he could… but now, he was
beginning to kill more and more of them!</P>

Chapter 4: Powerless</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
giant black warship hovered in the empty silence of space, completely
unmoving. A white-robed figure was standing directly above the giant
black warship. He seemed tiny in comparison, but his aura was utterly
overwhelming and his eyes were ice-cold.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
just too big. The Chaosverse is too damn big.” Ji Ning felt a sense
of powerlessness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">More
than half a year had gone past since the war had erupted. During this
half year, all seven of the most powerful leaders of the cultivators
civilizations had been scouring the Chaosverse for any and all traces
of the Sithe, but the Chaosverse was simply enormous! Usually,
battlefronts would consist of groupings of at least ten different
realmverses, sometimes even more! Every single battlefront was very
far away from the others, and the Sithe warships were just as sparse
and hard to find.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sithe were constantly making adjustments as well. Each time Ning and
the other Autarchs attacked a location, the Sithe would adjust for it
and make it even harder for the Autarchs to find their other
warships.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
warships were doing their best to avoid the Autarchs, while Ning and
the others were doing their best to find them!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Tongwu battlefront is in desperate need of assistance.” Yet another
report came flying in.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Tongwu battlefront?” Ning sighed to himself. “It is too far away.
It would take me twenty days at maximum speed to get there!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Time
to continue.” Ning waved his hand, collecting the warship and then
continuing to warp through space and search for the Sithe. It was
like searching for a needle in the bottom of the sea. This was a very
robotic and numbing process; the Autarchs were relying on their
overwhelming strength to scan large areas and ‘fish’ out a
warship or two! This process was clumsy, yet it was also the most
efficient process available.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Have
you noticed? This war has been quite odd,” Autarch Titanos sent to
the other six. “The war has gone on for over half a year and the
battles have been fierce. Now that the Sithe know where we are, it
has become harder and harder for us to find their warships. All of
this is expected, but… we haven’t encountered any Sithe Exalts at
all!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">While
hunting and killing, the Autarchs continued to exchange messages with
each other. The hunting process wasn’t all that mentally taxing,
after all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right.
I haven’t found any Sithe Exalts,” Autarch Ekong agreed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
haven’t found a single one of them either. Judging from the various
reports which have been sent by cultivators throughout our
Chaosverse, no Sithe Exalts have appeared at all,” Autarch
Stonerule said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
haven’t found any either. Logically speaking, the Sithe should have
many Exalts ready to fight,” Ning replied.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They’ve
lain dormant for aeons… I wouldn’t be surprised if they had
dozens of Exalts ready to take part in this battle. But, they haven’t
deployed a single one. This is extremely odd. Everyone, while hunting
down the Sithe you need to constantly stay on your guard! I’m
worried that there’s some sort of a plot behind the Sithe Exalts
remaining in hiding,” Autarch Titanos sent mentally.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Skyfeeder agreed, “Perhaps they don’t know that Darknorth has
become an Emperor, but they know that we have an Eternal Omega Sword
Dao! Thus, the Sithe should know very well that this war against us
is their final chance. If they lose, we’ll only grow even more
powerful in the future and they won’t stand any chance against us.
By all rights, they should be throwing everything they have against
us! As soon as that behemoth hive appeared, I could tell that the
Sithe had made extraordinary preparations for this war. For no Exalts
to have appeared a full half-year after the war began… we really do
need to be careful.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Agreed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Stay
on your guard.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Keep
scanning at all times. Don’t let yourself fall into a trap.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
six Autarchs and Ning were all quite confident in their abilities.
They weren’t like the Sithe, who suffered from rejection by the
Chaosverse and were unable to use the Dao! Ning and the Autarchs had
access to virtually limitless amounts of power. During the previous
war, not a single Autarch had fallen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Purejade battlefront is in desperate need of assistance!” Suddenly,
another report arrived.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Purejade battlefront?” Ning was startled. He reflexively scanned
his mental map of the Chaosverse, mentally placing the Purejade
battlefront. It was fairly close to him. “I need two days. I’ll
go right away.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright,
Darknorth. I’ll leave it to you. I’ll tell them to hold on until
you arrive,” Autarch Stonerule said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
Ning began to fly at maximum speed towards the Purejade battlefront.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
he spent these two days slowly scanning, he might be able to locate
one or two Sithe warships… but rescuing more of their own
cultivators was more important than killing the Sithe! This was
because when their cultivators died, their truesouls would be
devoured by the Sithe soul-eater technique. This would harm the
Chaosverse itself and make it impossible to revive them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
hope they can hold on until I arrive,” Ning murmured softly. The
leaders in a battlefront would only beg for assistance when they
could sense that they really weren’t able to hold out for much
longer. This would generally only happen once the enemies revealed
their full power and launched a final, all-out attack! Thus, the
battlefronts were usually lost shortly after the distress calls were
sent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Sometimes,
the cultivators would last for four or five days. Other times, the
cultivators would be wiped out before a single day passed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Purejade battlefront. This was a place where an awesome astral river
flowed through the region in multiple looks, almost like a snake
coiling around itself. At the very center of the coiling flows of the
river was an enormous castle, and the castle held over a hundred
figures within it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Nearly
half were Hegemons, while the rest were all normal Emperors. They
poured all of their Immortal energy into maintaining this powerful
castle, which was the core of the mighty defensive formation which
protected them. Many of their avatars and comrades were situated
throughout the astral river, where they were responsible for
protecting important spots and were fighting against the Sithe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch
Stonerule sent word,” a red-bearded Hegemon roared. “Two days! In
just two days, an Autarch will arrive to save us!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’re
saved!” Some of the Hegemons and Emperors who had been on the verge
of despair instantly grew excited. This was just a second-class
battlefront! They didn’t expect that one of the extremely powerful
Sithe elite squads would attack this place. At first, the Sithe had
hidden their true power. They had first battled for more than a month
to verify the defensive strength of the local cultivators, then had
revealed their true prowess and launched a final assault.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Once
the Sithe revealed their true power, the cultivators were instantly
beaten backwards and forced to retreat to their final defensive lines
within and around this castle. All they could do was try to delay as
long as they could.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Two
days! Just two days! If we can hold on for just two days it’ll be
the damn Sithe who die, not us!” the red-bearded elder howled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
brothers and sisters, fight on! If we can hold for two days, we’ll
all make it out alive!” The voice rang out from the castle and
echoed in the minds of the Hegemons and Emperors who were stationed
within the astral river which coiled around the castle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hold
on! We must hold on!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
only need to hold on for two days.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
battle continued. The Sithe furiously pressed the assault, while all
of the defenders were equally frenzied in resisting. Even so, more
and more of the defenders were defeated. First, it was their avatars
which were destroyed. After that, it was up for them to use their
true bodies to endure and fight on.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Remember,
even if you know you are going to die, you need to try and stay a
safe distance away from them. Avoid that truesoul-eating technique or
you’ll never have a chance of being brought back!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
you are out of options, self-detonate after you reach a sufficient
distance.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Bang!
One defensive formation after another began to collapse, with most of
the various Hegemons and Emperors electing to self-detonate. In doing
so, their truesoul fragments blasted outwards and then quickly
vanished. The Sithe soul-eater technique was limited in range, and
self-detonation often caused some of the truesoul fragments to blast
so far out that they returned to the Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hurry
up! It’s been two days. Hurry up and come!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
hasn’t he arrived yet?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Hegemons and Emperors were still fighting back, hoping beyond hope…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
Suddenly, a figure stepped out of nowhere in the empty space above
the coiling river. His entire form was blazing with energy, making it
impossible to see him clearly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“AUTARCH!!!!”
All of the surviving cultivators let out cries of joy and excitement.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
one of those native Autarchs! Quick, flee!” The Sithe who had been
pressing the assault using their many treasures were stunned by the
Autarch’s arrival. They had been trying to wrap things up as soon
as possible, so that they could immediately depart and move to the
next target. It would be quite hard to locate them after they left…
but unfortunately, a cultivator Autarch had made it here in time!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
dazzling golden figure above them stared downwards coldly. Boom! A
wave of invisible energy instantly swept across the region,
extinguishing the auras of the attacking Sithe. Only a tiny percent
of the Sithe who had been inside heartforce-proof warships managed to
survive, but just a heartbeat later all of them died as well. The
only ones Ning spared and took away with him were the ‘lucky’
Sithe descendants.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thankfully,
at least half have survived.” Ning surveyed the castle below him,
nodding to himself when he saw how many Hegemons and Emperors had
made it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you, Autarch!” The Hegemons and Emperors all felt excitement and
gratitude. They knew that the vast majority of distress calls went
unanswered, as the Autarchs simply couldn’t make it in time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded, then turned and left. He didn’t take any of the warships
with him, electing to leave them behind with the survivors in a bid
to strengthen their decimated forces.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
saving that battlefront from defeat, Ning began to patrol the cosmos
once more. Every so often, he’d exchange a message with the other
Autarchs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Hiddencloud battlefront is in desperate need of assistance.” Yet
another report came. This time, it caused Ning to blink. The
Hiddencloud battlefront? Wasn’t… wasn’t that the place where
the disciple he was proudest of, his second disciple ‘Green Bamboo’
Yang Quding, was located?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Few
of Ning’s friends were taking part in this battle, and those few
that did take part were the ones in the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance,
such as Nuwa. As for ‘Green Bamboo’ Yang Quding, he was fighting
alongside his own friends in the Hiddencloud battlefront. Ning had
naturally memorized his location.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
more than twenty-six days away from me.” Ning’s heart turned
cold. He couldn’t help but send mentally to the other six, “Can
any of you make it there? My disciple Green Bamboo is there.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Your
disciple, Darknorth?” At a time like this, no one would bother
accusing Ning of selfishness. Who could be truly and completely
selfless?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can’t make it in time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
too far away.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
closest ones to it are the two of us, Darknorth,” Autarch Skyfeeder
replied. “I need nineteen days to get there. That’s too much
time, and they won’t be able to hold out for that long. Thus far,
the maximum survival time after sending a distress call has been just
barely ten days.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
fell silent. There was nothing he could do... Nineteen days…
Autarch Skyfeeder could probably wipe out over ten warships during
that period of time. It wasn’t worth it to give that up just to try
and save the Hiddencloud battlefront, especially seeing as how that
battle would almost assuredly be completely lost after nineteen days.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
wasn’t just Green Bamboo’s master. He was also one of the seven
most powerful leaders of this Chaosverse, responsible for
safeguarding every part of it!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nineteen
days is too long,” Ning replied softly. “Considering the grand
scheme of things, it isn’t worth it. Forget it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
said nothing else. He went back to hunting for Sithe in the Great
Dark.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">* *

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">RWX's
Thoughts</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Taking
bets on if Green Bamboo makes it or not. Whaddya think?</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_44_Chapter_005__The"></A>
Chapter 5: Death Holds No Fear</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning continued his search for the Sithe throughout the Great Dark,
his heart filled with sorrow and anxiety.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Green
Bamboo… there’s nothing your master can do. I cannot save you.
You have to escape. You have to,” Ning murmured to himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">With
no Autarch nearby to render assistance, it was all-but guaranteed
that the ‘Hiddencloud battlefront’ which Yang Quding was located
in would be overwhelmed. When this happened, the Hegemons and
Emperors wouldn’t be so foolish as to just fight to the bitter end.
Once they knew that they were going to lose and that no help was
forthcoming, they would begin to flee and focus on keeping themselves
alive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
the Sithe had many Hegemons and even more treasures. The fleeing
cultivator Hegemons would scatter in every direction, but they would
be hunted down one-by-one. The number of Hegemons who managed to
successfully escape could be counted on one hand, and in some cases
none would escape.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning,
however, still held out hope. His disciple ‘Green Bamboo’ had a
perfect Dao-heart, was an Otherverse Lord, and had treasures which
Ning had given him. He was absolutely one of the most powerful
Hegemons around, far more powerful than the Lonely King had ever
been. In fact, he was close to the Blazesun Ruler in power! Alas, no
individual no matter how strong could possibly withstand an entire
army. Still… Ning felt that there was some hope that this disciple
of his would be able to escape and stay alive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn.
Damn! If my avatar wasn’t trapped in that hive, it could also take
responsibility over a zone. I might be closer to the Hiddencloud
battlefront and able to rescue my disciple.” Ning felt rather
resentful.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Right
now, a total of thirteen Autarch-class combatants were scattered
throughout the entire Chaosverse, each responsible for a specific
zone. Ning’s avatar was also an Autarch-class combatant, but it was
tied up in the Annihilation Hive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the black tower at the nexus of the Annihilation Hive. The
golden-robed Ning was seated in the lotus position in midair, his
eyes closed in meditation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
an awesome aura of energy was swirling around him in rippling layers.
These circular ripples of power emanated the aura of the deep earth,
of grass and vegetation, of flowing water, of blazing flames, of
indestructible ores. All the different ripples were circling around
Ning, and as they moved closer and closer towards him, they gradually
began to transform into ripples of space and ripples of time… and
at the very heart, on Ning himself, they transformed into ripples of
terrifying destructive power. Everything near Ning was being devoured
and then annihilated.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was raw, pure annihilation! All types of energy were being
annihilated, and not even the Chaosverse was able to resist this
annihilatory power. The profound mysteries behind this power
surpassed even the Destruction Daobirth Essence of Autarch Ekong, the
Autarch of Annihilation. If Ning could truly and successfully master
this technique, he would have gained access to a technique of
absolutely incredible power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
still not quite there yet. It just isn’t quite right.” Ning had
drawn upon his six million chaos cycles of training and the many
insights he had gained from the sphere of annihilation, but he still
felt that it was a bit too artificial and forced.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Dao was, above all else, natural. Only a Dao which was complete and
natural, not artificial, could be described as ‘perfect’. If you
simply tried to artificially imitate this destructive power, which
Ning called ‘Oblivion’, you would end up being far off from the
real thing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oblivion…
it utterly destroys all things in its path. All forms of energy…
the Five Elements… Yin and Yang… Darkness and Light… space and
time… everything in the Chaosverse can be devoured and destroyed.
This is what ‘Oblivion’ represents.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
started with a foundation of the Five Elements, then drew upon the
mysteries of Yin and Yang as well as that of the Cycle of Light and
Dark, transforming them into pure spacetime which is then
obliterated, producing fundamental particles where space and time no
longer exist.” Ning continued to ponder this problem. He didn’t
know what insights he was lacking, but this process had indeed
resulted in him gaining a much deeper level of understanding in all
of his Daos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
it hadn’t been for him meditating on ‘Oblivion’, he never
would’ve understood how the Five Elements could be completely
converted into spacetime.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Space
and time were two unique types of wave-particle energies. When the
two acted upon each other, they gave birth to Yin and Yang, Light and
Dark, and also the Five Elements which birthed countless other
things.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
lacks… a soul. It lacks that quintessential quality of being part
of nature itself.” Ning continued to dissect many different Daos,
ruminating over their connections to each other as he compared them
to how the ‘sphere of annihilation’ operated…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
avatar continued to meditate on the Oblivion Sword Dao, and there was
really nothing else it could do. Only when it learned how to destroy
the ‘sphere of annihilation’ would it be able to leave this
place. Until that happened the avatar would have to stay there,
continuing to maintain the reverse-vortex formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
distant Hiddencloud battlefront. The native Hegemons and Emperors
here suffered one defeat after another. They had already retreated to
the final, most powerful defensive formation they had.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
a beautiful world of flowers and grass. An azure-robed man was
staring into the skies… and the skies were trembling. Dimensional
cracks could be seen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Green
Bamboo, any news?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Sword
Immortal Green Bamboo, will the Autarchs come and save us?” Behind
him was a host of Hegemons and Emperors. Thus far, over 70% of their
original forces were still alive! This was because they had all
sacrificed their avatars during the most dangerous parts of the
battle. Now, their avatars had all been destroyed. Even Sword
Immortal Green Bamboo’s avatar had died in battle!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
had already retreated to the back lines. So long their final defenses
remained, they could keep fighting… but once their defenses were
breached, they would all be massacred.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Calm
down. I’ve already asked for aid,” Sword Immortal Green Bamboo
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
other Hegemons and Emperors were waiting anxiously as they maintained
the defensive formation. Sword Immortal Green Bamboo was the disciple
of the legendary Daolord Darknorth, and was someone favored by
Autarch Ekong. Even though the fact that Ning had succeeded in his
second Daomerge and become an Emperor remained a hidden secret, many
felt certain that the Autarchs would come to save Green Bamboo so
long as they could make it in time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly,
Sword Immortal Green Bamboo’s face turned grim. “The Autarchs
won’t be able to make it in time.” He swept his gaze across the
other Hegemons and Emperors, all of whom turned pale. The hope they
had felt instantly vanished, with many revealing looks of despair.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’re
out of options. We’ll have to fend for ourselves,” Green Bamboo
said. “The ‘microworld’ formations protecting this grand
formation have all been defeated. Even if we keep fighting, we’ll
only be able to last another two or three days before being
completely overwhelmed. By then, none of us will be able to escape.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
the Hegemons and Emperors present agreed with this assessment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thus…
we should begin coming up with ideas for how we can escape,” Green
Bamboo said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
supreme leaders of the cultivators had long ago given them their
orders – if they couldn’t win, they were to flee! Every single
survivor counted! If they died in battle, they would see their
truesouls devoured by that soul-eater technique. Their very
Chaosverse itself would be weakened by this! In other words, just
surviving was a form of victory.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sithe have set up many scanning formations, and they have even more
Hegemons and Emperors than we do. Even if we scatter and flee, our
chances are very low,” an Emperor said worriedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
always a chance,” Green Bamboo said. “Let’s do our best to
deceive the Sithe and force them to disperse their forces. Every
single survivor counts as a victory to me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
can use many of the other formations and treasures scattered
throughout the Hiddencloud battlefront which we previously abandoned
to slow the Sithe down.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
myself am very skilled in using illusions and creating dopplegangers.
Given the right treasures, I can make it difficult for the Sithe to
know where our real members have gone.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
various Hegemons and Emperors all had their own specialties, and they
all began to propose ideas. However, they all knew that the Sithe had
their own specialties as well. The Sithe warship was a particular
problem. It was so fast that it was on par with the Blacksun. Only
Autarchs were able to catch them and destroy them! The warships also
were outfitted with extremely sensitive tracking formations as well.
Thus, very few of them would probably be able to escape its pursuit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Green
Bamboo.” There were four men and women standing next to Green
Bamboo. One of them, a muscular and crimson-armored man, said in an
awkward voice: “It’s all my fault. I was the one to invite you to
join us here at the Hiddencloud battlefront. If you were alongside
Nuwa, Realmslord Windgrace, and the Paragon of Pills in their
battlefront, you wouldn’t be in this situation.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
battlefields were all divided up according to rank and status. The
Sixteen Realmverses Alliance and the otherverse the Paragon of Pills
lived in were all very close to each other, and so they were grouped
together into a single battlefront. That was the battlefront which
would protect the homeland of ‘Daolord Darknorth’, a first-class
battlefront which would be very difficult to overcome.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
only reason Green Bamboo had come here was for the sake of his
lifelong friends who had also come here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
fine. To live and die amongst my friends is a blessing. What is there
to fear?” Green Bamboo smiled as he looked at these four dear
friends of his.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Green
Bamboo.” A red-robed maiden looked at Green Bamboo, then suddenly
reached out to take his hand in her own.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Green
Bamboo immediately revealed an excited, happy look as he gazed at the
red-robed woman. “Dawnclear…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
woman was the real reason why Green Bamboo had chosen to come to this
battlefield. He had wooed Hegemon Dawnclear for many years now, but
she had always hesitated. Now that she had taken him by the hand, she
had clearly chosen to truly accept him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hahaha…
death holds no fear for me!” Green Bamboo laughed loudly,
deliriously excited and happy.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_44_Chapter_006__The"></A>
Chapter 6: Fangs Revealed (Part 1)</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Dawnclear
smiled as well. She knew that it was very likely that both of them
would die, and so she cast away all her misgivings and followed her
heart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Congratulations,
Green Bamboo. Cognratulations, big sister Dawnclear.” the other
female Hegemon next to them said with a smile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Congratulations!
Who would’ve thought that something so wonderful would happen
during this calamity? Once we all leave this place safely, we’ll
have to hold a proper celebration,” the muscular man said with a
laugh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
we must celebrate!” The other nearby Hegemons and Emperors all
agreed. They were searching for a ray of light to illuminate them in
this darkest hour. In truth, they all knew that the number of
survivors could probably be counted on one hand… and if they
weren’t lucky, every single one of them would die!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
spending an hour in discussion, Green Bamboo’s group of Hegemons
and Emperors came up with an escape plan. They would separate into a
total of fifty-nine squads which would flee in different directions.
That way, they would stand the best chance of making it out alive. If
they stayed together, they would be wiped out together.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Everyone.”
Green Bamboo swept his gaze across all the others present. “The
plan has been settled. Let us carry it out! I hope that after this
all ends, we’ll be able to meet again.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
meet again.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
meet again.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
meet again.” The many Hegemons and Emperors nearby all echoed his
words. They were all filled with the desire to stay alive and were
determined to risk it all in one final clash attempt.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
short while later, a towering warship appeared before the grand
formation which protected the Hiddencloud battlefront. In front of
the warship was a large group of Sithe Hegemons and Emperors who were
employing their treasures to furiously assault the giant globe-shaped
formation before them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly,
streams of power began to shoot out from deep within the formation.
Some looked like streams of dark mist, some looked like bolts of
thunder, some looked like pillars of solid light. These various types
of energy all shot out in a counter-attack, instantly suppressing the
Sithe offensive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They’ve
launched their final counter-attacks! Haha! Keep attacking! They’re
at the brink of collapse!” The Sithe leader who was watching within
that towering warship felt extremely confident as they watched from
within… but moments later, his face turned grim.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Whoosh! Whoosh! Countless figures shot out of the formation and began
to flee, each going in a different direction.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They’re
running away! There are so many of them. Which ones are the real
ones?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can’t tell, can you?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Captain,
which ones are real?” The many Sithe battling outside were all
waiting for orders.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
want to escape?” The Sithe leader stroked his long beard. His
warship could detect even the approach of an Autarch! Its scanning
abilities were absolutely unparalleled, and it almost instantly was
able to detect which figures were real and which were false.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They’ve
split up into a total of fifty-nine squads, with three in each squad
at most. Many of the squads are single-person squads. They’ve split
up into fifty-nine different directions. I now order you to…” The
Sithe leader began to issue his orders, deploying different Sithe
warriors to chase after different squads. This warship was composed
of Sithe elites, and it had an extraordinary number of Hegemons and
Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Chase
after them separately. Let none escape,” the Sithe leader commanded
mentally.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flee!”
A green-robed Emperor was fleeing for his life. “I’m too weak.
The Sithe would probably be able to track even Hegemons who tried to
warp through spacetime. A normal Epmeror like myself would stand no
chance at all.” The green-robed Emperor knew just how slim his
chances were. “We spent an enormous amount of effort in prepping
the Hiddencloud battlefront. There are many powerful formations here
that are intact; we were simply forced to abandon them. If I hide
inside one of them, they wouldn’t necessarily be able to find me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
was going to hide inside one of the remaining formations to catch his
breath. Once the danger was past, he would then flee to a more
distant location.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh.
The green-robed Emperor quietly snuck into a nearby formation, easily
taking control over its great power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh.
Swoosh. Swoosh. Three figures simultaneously appeared outside. All
three were Sithe Black Emperors. The Sithe knew that this target was
just an ordinary Emperor, and so they had simply sent three Black
Emperors to deal with him. Each of them had Hegemonic power, after
all; catching an ordinary Emperor would be very easy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
fled into a formation?” The three Black Emperors exchanged a
glance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Seal
off the entire area around the formation. I’ll stand guard outside
while the two of you follow him inside,” one of the Black Emperors
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go inside.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
mere hour later, the green-robed Emperor who had fled inside the
formation had been driven to the brink of despair. Finally, one of
the Black Emperors used a sky-blotting palm to smash him into dust!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
run!” Two Hegemons fled in a blind panic, warping through spacetime
over ten times. When they saw that they were about to be caught, they
finally brought out a realmship. “Let’s run.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
two Hegemons immediately began to flee within the realmship. As they
did, the Sithe squad pursuing them came to a halt and sent a message
back: “They have a realmship. We aren’t able to catch up to
them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
a brief period of time passed, the Hegemons began to breathe a bit
easier. “Our realmship is flying very fast. We have a chance to
escape.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
have to make it out of here.” The two Hegemons both clung onto
hope… but suddenly, the realmship was unable to warp through
spacetime any longer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Both turned to stare outside the ship. An enormous, towering black
warship had just appeared before them, and it was suppressing
spacetime for a wide area around it. These warships had all been
painstakingly created by the Sithe leader. Even if Ning and other
Autarch-class combatants were here, they would have to slowly fly
towards the warship rather than simply teleport through spacetime to
it. Its power was tremendous!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’re
finished.” Looks of despair appeared on the faces of the two
Hegemons. They exchanged a final glance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Bang!
Bang! The two didn’t hesitate at all. They immediately exploded
into two enormous plumes of light which blasted out, reverberating
within the realmship. They had chosen to self-detonate! They were far
enough from the Sithe that their truesoul fragments stood a good
chance of escaping once they self-detonated.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Autarchs had long ago instructed them to do this. If they
self-detonated they might be brought back to life in the future, even
if they were Hegemons!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
the Autarchs saw it, they might not be able to revive the Hegemons
who died in the endless void between realmverses, but things would be
different once their Chaosverse gave birth to a Lord of Chaos. A
Chaoslord should be able to bring them back! They believed this
because they had seen from the memories of captured Sithe that slain
Sithe Hegemons could be brought back to life. In fact, even Exalts
who died in battle could be brought back to life! However, the price
was so great that they generally wouldn’t be given such
preferential treatment unless they had rendered great merits unto the
Sithe forces.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The Sithe warship began to emit an invisible, terrifying sucking
power which caused the realmship to tumble helplessly towards an
enormous opening at the bottom of the warship. Moments later, the
opening in the bottom vanished.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
self-detonated right after we found them. Damn! Most of their
truesoul fragments probably escaped us. Let’s go back.” The black
warship immediately warped through spacetime to return to the
Hiddencloud battlefront. This entire process had merely taken a few
brief moments; they had almost instantly located and eliminated the
realmship, then returned to their normal position.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
won’t be able to escape… but those damn Sithe can forget about
devouring my truesoul!” a horned, willowy woman howled angrily.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
She transformed into a burst of light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Self-detonation.
Self-detonation. Killed. Self-detonation…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Some
who weren’t able to self-detonate in time ended up being killed by
the Sithe, as did some who hesitated. The majority, however, had the
wisdom to understand when flight was hopeless and thus chose to
self-detonate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Green
Bamboo and Hegemon Dawnclear were escaping together. As for their
other friends, they had all scattered into different groups. If they
all fled together, they would probably all be caught together.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Dawnclear smiled as she glanced at Green Bamboo, who was using all
his power to bring her alongside him in his flight.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
do you keep staring at me?” Green Bamboo teased. Even though they
were being pursued, they were both quite relaxed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
nothing,” Hegemon Dawnclear said with a smile. “I just suddenly
feel so very, very happy. Even if we don’t manage to escape, dying
together is fine as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
nonsense are you spewing? We’re definitely going to escape. Don’t
worry.” Green Bamboo continued to flee at top speed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Suddenly, a planet-sized castle appeared behind them. A voice boomed
out from within the castle: “You must be the leader of the forces
stationed in the Hiddencloud battlefront. You brought us quite a bit
of trouble, kid. Now stop struggling! There’s no way you’ll
escape.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Green
Bamboo paled slightly. His greatest fear was this. He had been the
most powerful cultivator in the Hiddencloud battlefront. When he had
sent his avatar to battle against the Sithe, the Sithe had been
forced to pay a very high price to defeat it. Without question, the
Sithe were paying close attention to him as he fled. They had even
sent one of their planet-sized castles to pursue him! Those things
warped through spacetime far faster than realmships could.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Dawnclear,
remember to bind the treasure I gave you earlier. It’s something
which will allow you to warp a tremendous distance through spacetime
and escape,” Green Bamboo immediately sent mentally. “I’ll stop
them for now. You need to run! Once you reach a safe distance, use
that item. It’ll let you flee incredibly fast, and if you can avoid
detection for ten seconds they won’t be able to find any trace of
you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No…!”
Hegemon Dawnclear grew anxious. “What about you? Are you just going
to throw your life away?”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_44_Chapter_007__The"></A>
Chapter 7: Fangs Revealed (Part 2)</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
a Hegemon, Dawnclear had an extraordinary Dao-heart. She had already
discarded all of her previous concerns and had chosen to become
Dao-companions with Sword Immortal Green Bamboo. How could she
possibly fear death?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
we delay, neither of us will escape,” Green Bamboo sent
frantically. “Dawnclear, you aren’t strong enough to slow them
down. Only I can do that! Don’t worry. After you flee, I’ll do my
best to escape as well. If I cannot, I’ll choose to self-detonate.
I’ll tell you a secret which you absolutely cannot share with
anyone else – my master Darknorth has used the ‘Truesoul
Everlasting’ technique and has redone the Daomerge. He’s now
comparable to Autarchs in power. So long as any of my truesoul
fragments remain, I’ll definitely be brought back in the future.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Dawnclear was startled. So the legendary Daolord Darknorth had
actually successfully used that technique to repeat his Daomerge?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
other words, even if I am forced to self-detonate I’ll still be
brought back,” Green Bamboo said urgently. “And I have other
tricks up my sleeve as well. I’ll stand a good chance of escaping
on my own. Hurry up and go! If you die, there’d be no point in me
living.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fine.”
Hegemon Dawnclear no longer hesitated. She knew that as she was much
weaker, it would be harder for her truesoul fragments to escape the
Sithe soul-eater technique.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Hegemon Dawnclear turned and immediately fled. After fleeing for a
time, she managed to leave the reach of spacetime suppression. She
turned to glance backwards, seeing Green Bamboo already engaged in a
fight against the Sithe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ll
definitely be together in the future.” Hegemon Dawnclear gritted
her teeth, then immediately warped through spacetime and disappeared.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ahahaha!”
Green Bamboo himself was in an excellent rule. A total of nine
leaf-shaped treasures were around him, and he was able to use them to
shockingly powerful effect with his perfect Dao-heart. Each of his
strikes was comparable to attacks from the Blazesun Ruler!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! The two sides continued to blast attacks at each other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
cultivator leader of this battlefront is really powerful. Given his
might, I imagine he has a perfect Dao-heart.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Anyone
who can gain a perfect Dao-heart in this backwards Chaosverse has to
be one of its truly peerless geniuses.” The Sithe continued to
launch attacks from their castle. They held the upper hand and it was
clear that victory should be in their grasp… but somehow, it
continued to elude them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, this was a strategy which Green Bamboo was using. He wanted to
give these Sithe the feeling that they could kill him by themselves,
and so they wouldn’t be in a hurry to report it to their
higher-ups.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
battled for ten full seconds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ugh.
This cultivator leader is a pain to deal with. Hurry up and report it
to our superiors. Who knows how long it would take for us to kill
him? Hurry up and report it to them so we can hunt down that female
cultivator next.” These warships were able to scan a
realmverse-sized area in a twinkling! Even realmships would produce
trails when flying that could be picked up by Sithe scanners, which
was why escape was very difficult.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Green
Bamboo felt rather relaxed. “It’s been over ten seconds.
Dawnclear has probably escaped by now.” He had told Dawnclear that
Darknorth would revive him so long as his truesoul fragments escaped,
but that wasn’t the complete truth. Green Bamboo knew a great deal
about this war. He knew that this was the last chance the Sithe had,
and that they would battle to the bitter end. It was possible that
even his master Darknorth would die! If that happened, Green Bamboo
might not be brought back either.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
suddenly, a spacetime ripple manifested. A heartbeat later, a
towering warship appeared as well, once more suppressing spacetime in
the surrounding area.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
good.” Green Bamboo’s face tightened.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
All nine leaf-type treasures instantly flew back to circle around
Green Bamboo, ‘gripping’ him as they then transformed into a
streak of light that flew away at incredible speeds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
think you’ll escape?” The Sithe immediately moved to pursue.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
The distant streak which was Green Bamboo suddenly blew apart into an
enormous blast of light as he exploded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Even
as he self-detonated, he remained calm. A little smile was on his
face to the very end. It was all worth it. So long as his beloved
survived, everything was worth it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Another
self-detonation. Ugh. How many of his truesoul fragments did we
manage to capture?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Just
part of it, I think. Almost all of these natives have chosen to
self-detonate from afar. We’re usually only able to capture part of
the fragments.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Continue
the hunt. He had a woman with him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
forcing Green Bamboo to commit suicide, the Sithe immediately began
to chase after Hegemon Dawnclear. Alas, no matter what they tried
they were unable to find any traces of her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">An
iridescent ring-shaped treasure was warping through spacetime with
ease, moving just as fast as the Blacksun but with even greater
secrecy. Ten seconds after its initial use, all traces of its
activation would vanish. This had been Green Bamboo’s personal
escape treasure. He had only trained for a short period of time but
had a perfect Dao-heart. This meant that he was viewed as an
incredibly talented prospect for this Chaosverse who could very well
become an Autarch in the future.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was why he had been given such a valuable treasure… but in the end,
he had given it to Hegemon Dawnclear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No…”
While fleeing, Hegemon Dawnclear suddenly turned to stare at the
direction from where she had just fled. She could vaguely sense
through the power of karma that the most important person in her life
had just perished. The karma binding them together had fallen apart,
leaving behind an empty feeling that tore at her heart. Her tears
began to fall.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Green
Bamboo, you promised me that you’d be able to escape. You
promised.” Tears blurred Hegemon Dawnclear’s vision. “I’m
sure they’ll bring you back. You are senior Darknorth’s disciple.
They definitely will.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the end, Hegemon Dawnclear was the only person to survive the battle
at the Hiddencloud battlefront. Everyone else died.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was soaring through the Great Dark, searching for Sithe and
destroying them when he found them. Suddenly, he turned pale and his
heart trembled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
turned to stare towards the direction of the incredibly distant
Hiddencloud battlefront. “Green Bamboo!” Ning could sense through
the power of karma that his disciple was gone. He had vanished from
this Chaosverse. Clearly, his truesoul had been destroyed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
even someone as powerful as Green Bamboo was able to escape?” Ning
was filled with agony.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, if Green Bamboo had fled on his own he would’ve had a 30% -
40% chance of escaping. Instead, he had given this chance to Hegemon
Dawnclear and had gone to delay their foes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“SITHE!!!”
Ning cast away his pain, replacing it with a cold and hard
determination. This was war… a war which would determine the
destinies of two different civilizations! Many, many Hegemons had
died and would die in this war. Green Bamboo was just one of them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“DIE!”
Ning knew that all he could do was to annihilate as many Sithe as he
could.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
continued to flow on, and the war only grew increasingly deadly. Four
years of frenzied warfare went by in the blink of an eye. The initial
wave of frenzied Sithe attacks finally began to ebb, as they suffered
so many casualties that they were unable to continue assaulting all
of the various battlefields.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">During
these four years, Ning and the rest of the thirteen Autarch-class
combatants had been hunting them down nonstop. They had annihilated
so many Sithe that in many areas, the remaining Sithe Hegemons and
Emperors were only able to pose low levels of danger.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
of you shall die.” Autarch Ekong descended upon a battlefront,
immediately blinking inside the towering Sithe warship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Die,
die, die!” Autarch Ekong was the Autarch of Annihilation, and he
used his awesome power to completely massacre the many Hegemons and
Emperors within the warship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Right
at this moment, Autarch Ekong’s face suddenly turned grim. He
immediately blinked outside the warship, only to see that the
battlefield had just changed completely.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">An
absolutely massive temple complex had just appeared in the area, and
he was inside the complex. The warship he had just destroyed was
miniscule by comparison! The vast temple had a total of seven
miniature temples surrounding it, and within each of the temples was
a figure seated in the lotus position. Judging from their auras, all
of them were Sithe Exalts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
the Sithe Exalts have finally shown themselves… seven at one go!”
Autarch Ekong turned pale. He could sense the incredible threat they
posed to him. They could kill him. This vast temple was entirely
capable of destroying him!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch
Ekong, I presume? You won’t be able to escape.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Prepare
to die.” The seven Sithe Exalts had frenzied looks in their eyes.
They knew just how powerful Autarchs were, and so they had made
plentiful preparations for this battle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Ekong immediately sent word to Ning and the other five Autarchs. Four
years after the war had erupted, the Sithe Exalts were finally making
their move. The Sithe had finally revealed their fangs!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">During
the Dawn War, the Autarchs had also encountered multiple dangerous
situations. They didn’t even dare to truly assault the heart of the
Sithelands and instead chose to simply seal away the outer
perimeters! Creatures like the giant tree, which Autarch Titanos and
Autarch Mogg had spent a fairly long period of time to kill, was just
one of many tools the Sithe had prepared for this war.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Annihilation Hive had shown without the shadow of a doubt that the
Sithe were terrifyingly powerful. They were more than strong enough
to threaten the Autarchs now.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
the Autarchs were truly invincible, Ning and the others could’ve
simply gathered all the Hegemons and placed them into their own
estate-worlds. If the seven of them just stayed together in one place
they would be guaranteed to win, right?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
the truth was that the Autarchs weren’t truly invincible… and
they knew it. It was possible that they could be killed, which was
why they had the Hegemons be scattered across the Chaosverse. This
would at least ensure that they weren’t destroyed in a single alpha
strike! Even if the cultivators lost a few battles, they would still
be able to recover in the future.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“After
four years of war, the Sithe Hegemons and Emperors are no longer much
of a threat to us. The Sithe have finally begun to mobilize their
elites,” Autarch Titanos sent mentally. “This will be the last
great war we shall face! If we win, we’ll be able to grow so
powerful that we’ll never need to fear any invaders ever again.
We’ll be truly free… but first, we have to win this war.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
will be the final war, the Dusk War. Let us fight! In victory, we
shall be without worries for all of time. If we fail, we may never
recover.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the six Autarchs all understood this concept. Their hearts were
filled with unprecedented resolve. There was nothing and no one
capable of shaking their will for battle. They would fight!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Now
that the weaker Hegemons and Emperors were no longer a threat, the
Sithe Exalts had joined the fray. The final battle had begun!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
we win, I might be able to one day revive Yu Wei and my friends and
disciples. If we lose, everything will be lost. My parents,
Brightmoon, my teacher… they’ll all be gone. All of civilization
will be gone.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
war to reclaim our destinies has now truly begun.” Ning’s eyes
were blazing with determination.</P>

Chapter 8: The Vast Temple</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">What’s
the situation, Ekong? How strong is that Sithe temple?” Ji Ning and
the others were all worried about Autarch Ekong. Given how long the
Sithe Exalts had been biding their time, they definitely had been
preparing something truly extraordinary to use against the Autarchs.
The worst part of it was, Autarch Ekong’s true body was in the
trap!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
it had been his avatar which fell into the trap, Ning and the others
wouldn’t feel all that worried. If his avatar died, he would merely
need a few more years to rebuild a new one. In truth, given the
benefits of temporal acceleration just half a month would be needed
to create an avatar, albeit it would have at most 50% of his full
power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
a war against the Sithe, that extra 20% of power made a great deal of
difference… but if his true body died, then his avatar would die
along with it. That was a far greater loss, an irrecoverable one.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can’t see anything at all!” Autarch Ekong sent back hurriedly.
“Moments ago, I saw that those Sithe Exalts were seated within
seven small temples surrounding a big one. They suddenly activated
the power of the main temple, causing my surroundings to transform.
I’ve now been trapped inside a giant formation in the form of a
massive hallway. No matter where I go, I’m unable to escape this
hallway. I can’t see through any of the mysteries behind this
formation at all!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
formation?” Ning, Titanos, Skyfeeder, Mogg, Stonerule, and Bolin
were all shocked. Not even an Autarch could make heads or tails out
of this formation… how powerful did it have to be?! If Autarch
Ekong was unable to escape it, all he could do was wait and endure
terrifying attacks from the Sithe Exalts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth
and I have some skill in formations. I’m closer to you than he is.
Ekong, take care of yourself. My avatar is headed straight towards
you and should get there in twelve days!” Autarch Titanos sent.
Avatars were just as effective as true bodies when it came to
understanding and disassembling formations.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.
Hurry up! Trapped inside this formation, I can’t even find my
foes.” Autarch Ekong was rather anxious.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
hallway was merely thirty meters wide, but he could see no end to it.
No matter how long he walked, he wasn’t able to walk out of it!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for the walls? Autarch Ekong had already tried to break through them
with force, but clearly there was no way for him to tear through a
formation which seven Sithe Exalts had set up with the help of this
temple.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Trapping
me here was probably just the first step. Their actual killer attacks
will be coming soon.” Autarch Ekong manifested six arm, with three
of them holding shields and the other three holding a saber, a sword,
and a shuttle. As the Autarch of Annihilation, he was naturally
skilled in many different weapons. It was rare, however, that he was
forced to use shields to defend himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Twelve
days. I have to last for at least twelve days.” Autarch Ekong’s
eyes were very tranquil, but he was on high alert.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was very worried about Autarch Ekong, but for now sending Autarch
Titanos’ avatar was the best option they had! Ning himself had
devised the Sword Formation Dao, but Autarch Titanos had spent
countless years analyzing Sithe artifacts and researching Sithe
formations. He was just as skilled in the Dao of Formations as Ning
was, but he had far more experience in dealing with Sithe techniques.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Last
time, Autarch Titanos hadn’t even needed to enter the Annihilation
hive before devising the reverse-vortex formation. All he had needed
was the information Ning and Mogg had provided!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
the various Autarchs were most skilled in their own Daobirth
Essences, they had other specialties as well. For example, Autarch
Bolin had been unable to create the Samsara Daobirth Essence, but he
still far eclipsed the Hegemon level when it came to understanding
life and death. Not even Ning was a match for him in this regard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for Autarch Titanos, he was not only the master of the Karma Daobirth
Essence, he was also tremendously skilled in creating and
deconstructing powerful artifacts and formations.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Five
days after Autarch Ekong had first been trapped.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Whew.
That was close. Gentlemen, I nearly died just now,” Autarch ekong
sent to Ning and the others. “Thankfully, combat is my forte. I was
forced to use my invulnerable form to endure those repeated attacks
and actually used up over half of my energy. I came so close to
dying, haha! But I managed to make it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the others all had nervous looks on their faces. This was just
day five; Autarch Titanos needed twelve days! How terrifyingly
powerful were those attacks, for them to exhaust half of an Autarch’s
energy reserves in just a few days? Autarchs had nigh-limitless
amounts of energy because of how quickly they replenished their
energy stores.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Be
careful. You have to hold,” Autarch Skyfeeder sent frantically.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
we’re lucky that I’m the one stuck inside. If it was you here,
Skyfeeder, you probably wouldn’t have been able to withstand those
terrifyingly powerful attacks. You’d be dust by now,” Autarch
Ekong teased. “Don’t worry. I’ve already taken the worst they
could dish out. I’m an Autarch, you know! I’ve already
replenished my energy stores.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
did they use to attack you? How are these attacks so powerful?”
Ning sent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
attacks are powerful but quite clumsy. Anywhere else, I’d be able
to dodge or redirect those attacks with ease. The problem is, I’m
trapped in this hallway and have nowhere to go. The attack comes in
the form of a faint azure seal which is completely linked to the
hallway and seems to be part of it. It just comes smashing at me,
giving me nowhere to dodge at all. My only choice is to meet it
head-on!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
grand seal is marvelously made and it can launch a total of 352
explosive attacks before the energy in it is used up, following by
the seal itself dissipating. In the end, I was forced to transform
into my invulnerable form in order to endure the terrifying
destructive power of the seal’s attacks. Otherwise, I would’ve
been crushed to dust and my truesoul annihilated.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
frowned when he heard this. So it was just a giant seal which came
smashing at you? But the problem was that when you were trapped in
the hallway, there was nowhere to run at all. You had to take those
attacks head-on. Autarch Ekong was being treated as a punching bag!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
I was attacked by three or four of these things in a row, I’d
definitely be doomed,” Autarch Ekong said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry too much,” Autarch Ekong said. “The Sithe are different
from us. They are foreigners to our Chaosverse. We can endlessly
replenish our energies from our Chaosverse, but they cannot; if they
try to take power from the outside world by force, the process will
be incredibly slow. They must have prepared many different
energy-generating treasures, and each time they use such a powerful
attack it will cost them greatly. Most likely, a single giant seal is
their absolute limit. There’s no way they can just generate four of
them in a row without resting. If they could, they would’ve done so
long ago.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hah!
Killing an Autarch won’t be that easy,” Autarch Ekong laughed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
more time passed, the Sithe used many different techniques in an
effort to kill Autarch Ekong. They first started with grand seals,
then switched to insidious and strange techniques. However, the only
ones which truly brought him to the brink of death had been that
grand seal and a strange tentacle-attack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">On
the twelfth day, Autarch Titanos’ avatar finally arrived. He was
unable to breach the formations from outside, and so he had no choice
but to charge into the temple.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Immediately
report to our superiors that we’ve already tied down two
Autarch-class combatants. One of them is Autarch Ekong, and it
appears to be his true body! If we can kill them, it’ll be the
equivalent of reducing three Autarch-class combatants from the ranks
of the native cultivators. Our temple is mainly meant for trapping
foes, which means its attacks aren’t quite strong enough. Hurry up
and tell our superiors to send us more forces to wipe the two of them
out.” The seven Exalts within the vast temple were all extremely
excited.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the others continued to stand guard over their respective zones,
catching and wiping out Sithe Hegemons and Emperors. The overall
situation in the Chaosverse had taken a turn for the better, with the
native Hegemons now being under much less pressure. However, there
were still a number of formidable Sithe warships roaming about.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Five
days after Autarch Titanos’ avatar joined Autarch Ekong inside that
formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Die!”
Ning had just discovered a vast black warship which was suppressing
spacetime in the surrounding region. However, Ning transformed into a
storm of wind and thunder as he shot towards the warship, intending
to blink inside and slaughter the Sithe within.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
good! That’s an Autarch!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flee,
quick!” The Sithe Hegemons and Emperors in this warship were
members of an elite squad. They had survived the first waves of the
war and had achieved many accomplishments, destroying a total of
three cultivator battlefronts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
After blinking into the warship, Ning showed no mercy at all to these
‘successful’ Sithe warriors. Their ‘accomplishments’ came
from murdering local Hegemons.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
of you can die.” A vast wave of heartforce instantly swept out,
causing the many Sithe to perish.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly,
Ning’s face turned grim and he immediately blinked outside the
warship. There, he discovered that the outside world had just
changed. He was now within a vast grayish-white temple complex, and
there were a total of eight stone pillars surrounding the temple at
its margins. A figure was seated in the lotus position atop each of
the stone pillars. Although their mighty auras were inferior to
Ning’s, Ning knew without a shadow of a doubt that these were all
Sithe Exalts. There were eight of them!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Judging
from how you Autarchs have been sweeping through our Emperors, it
would seem that you have a total of thirteen Autarch-class
combatants! If we factor in the one within the Annihilation Hive,
that means you have fourteen in total.” A tall, thin Sithe Exalt
who was seated atop one of the stone pillars stared at Ning with
glowing eyes. “If each of you has one true body and one avatar…
that means you have a total of seven Autarchs! Six we already know
about. Now… who is the seventh? Is it a newly promoted Autarch, or
is it an Emperor Darknorth who had used a ‘Truesoul Everlasting’
technique?”</P>

Chapter 9: Iyerre's Response</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sithe Exalts seated on top of the eight stone pillars stared intently
at the glowing humanoid before them. None of them could clearly see
who that person was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Who
was the seventh leader of the cultivator forces? Was it a new
Autarch, or was it an Emperor Darknorth?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was a question the Sithe paid close attention to. Even Iyerre wanted
to know the answer for sure! They would rather see a new Autarch rise
than for Daolord Darknorth to have mastered a ‘Truesoul
Everlasting’ technique and become an Eternal Emperor! Someone who
was so incredibly talented as to be able to produce a ‘Truesoul
Everlasting’ technique would be extremely dangerous to the Sithe.
The pressures of war might well result in him breaking through to
becoming an Omega Autarch!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
don’t you guess.” Ning laughed loudly as he transformed into a
streak of light that shot off into the distance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Just
as Ning moved, the vast grayish-white temple suddenly burst with
power. The eight Sithe Exalts had activated it, causing spacetime to
twist and distort around Ning. Ning could sense his surroundings
changing, transforming to become a dazzlingly beautiful world of
white clouds and fragrant flowers. Ning stood in the center of all of
it… and a strange little smile was on his face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“An
illusory formation?” Ning mused. “Playing around with illusions
in front of a Heartforce Cultivator… what a joke!” He was both a
formations expert and a Heartforce Cultivator. With the aid of his
heartforce, he was easily able to understand some of the secrets
behind how this formation operated.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
Ning was completely confident in his chances, he was still very
careful and immediately went into his three-headed, six-armed mode
with all six Northbow swords at the ready.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break!”
Ning’s sword-light lashed out, and it cut cleanly through the
beautiful illusory world as though the formation was nothing more
than tofu. Just like that, the seemingly-formidable formation was
defeated! Ning then transformed into a storm of lightning and wind as
he flew off into the distance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
impressive! You actually defeated our illusions with ease. Of the six
known Autarchs in your civilization only Autarch Stonerule, the
master of the Illusion Daobirth Essence, would be able to accomplish
this. However, we already know that Autarch Stonerule is quite far
from here… which means you are most likely Emperor Darknorth,” an
ancient voice said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Emperor
Darknorth, we merely cast those illusions so that we could be sure of
your identity. Did you really think you’d actually be able to
escape so easily?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Await
death, Emperor Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Seal!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">With
a rumbling sound, the titanic grayish-white temple complex began to
swivel in place, its outer walls rising upwards while its heart sank
downwards. Ning had transformed into a storm of lightning and wind,
seeking to escape, but just moments later the entire temple had
completely transformed in shape. It was now shaped like a hemispheric
prison cell that had been completely sealed off, trapping him inside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
was completely locked into this place. Ning glanced at the
securely-fashioned hallway which imprisoned him, then reached out to
touch the walls while following his senses.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning frowned. “Yet another spacetime-sealing formation?” With but
a thought, Ning blinked past the wall and appeared outside… only to
see a vast region of empty space. The only thing within this void was
many miniature spacetime continuums. The large ones were ten billion
kilometers in size, while the small ones were merely tens of
thousands of kilometers in size. All of them came together to form an
extremely complicated sealing formation that locked away spacetime!
There was no way to simply fly out of this place. If he wanted to
escape, he would have to first solve the formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Sealed
spacetime…” Ning’s head hurt. In the Annihilation Hive, he had
encountered countless spacetime bubbles which were linked together
into a complicated formation that was used to devour energy from his
Chaosverse! It didn’t have much of a bewildering or trapping
effect, as that wasn’t its primary purpose. This one, however,
existed solely for the purpose of trapping powerful foes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
I’ll destroy spacetime here!” The three-headed, six-armed Ning
sent six streams of sword-light flooding through the area, using his
Spacetime Sword Dao to assault and destroy one spacetime bubble after
another. Alas, the destroyed ones were quickly replaced by others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can’t do it by force. I have to understand the mysteries behind
this formation, then breach it.” Ning began to consider his next
steps.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
eight Sithe Exalts seated on the stone pillars all exchanged a
glance. They could see and sense everything Ning was doing inside
their formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Anything
involving Emperor Darknorth is extremely important. Report this to
our superiors immediately,” one Exalt said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
A black-haired man nodded as he produced a silvery formation-base
before him. This formation-base had a total of three loops above it
which were slowly spinning in place. Gradually, a blurry pillar of
light appeared within the loops which resolved into a humanoid
figure. A second later, the blurry figure completely solidified into
the tall, muscular, gray-robed Iyerre.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
was seated upon his throne, eyes closed in meditation. Only after
fully manifesting did he open his eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Almighty
Iyerre.” The black-haired man remained seated, but he still bowed
downwards in respect.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
is it?” Iyerre glanced down at the man from his throne.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
eight of us have captured an Autarch-class combatant using the temple
you gave us! We suspected that this person is the mysterious ‘seventh
Autarch’, and so we first used illusions to test him out. He almost
instantly defeated our illusions, and so we now believe that there is
at least an 80% chance he is Emperor Darknorth,” the black-haired
man said respectfully. “We know just how major this is, so we
immediately decided to report it to you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Emperor
Darknorth?” Iyerre’s previously placid gaze suddenly shone with
terrifying light. This was the variable which worried him above all
others!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
had made many, many preparations for this war! The Sithe Hegemons and
Emperors he had poured into the vanguard had been nothing more than
cannon fodder. Iyerre didn’t feel the slightest bit of guilt over
their deaths, because they had no impact at all. So long as they died
killing native Hegemons and Emperors, it could be said that they had
succeeded in their purpose! Only when he sent out the Sithe Exalts
would the final battle have truly begun.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
it wasn’t for Emperor Darknorth, Iyerre was certain that he had
over a 99% chance of success! This was why he hadn’t shown himself
a single time. He was confident enough to continue lying in wait,
biding his time. Once he did finally reveal himself, it would be in a
way which shocked everyone.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However…
Emperor Darknorth worried Iyerre. Someone who had failed the Daomerge
and yet was able to devise a ‘Truesoul Everlasting’ technique
before dying was undoubtedly a figure of absolutely unearthly talent!
If Emperor Darknorth took that one final step, he would become an
Omega Dao Autarch! Omega Autarchs in their own Chaosverses were
absolutely invincible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“An
80% chance it is him?” Iyerre murmured softly. “Good. Very good.
My first target shall be him, then! Use everything you have to keep
him trapped and wait for my arrival! I’ll head there at maximum
speed and kill him myself.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
are coming in person?” The black-haired man was shocked. Iyerre had
yet to personally take part ever since they had entered this
Chaosverse and launched the war against the local cultivators. They
all knew how powerful Iyerre was! Although he was unable to summon
the power of the Dao in this Chaosverse and was rejected by it, he
had prepared many trump cards for this war. Once he made his move, he
would undoubtedly be able to kill this ‘Emperor Darknorth’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.
We’ll use every tool at our disposal to keep Emperor Darknorth
contained,” the black-haired man said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well. I’m heading out right away.” The pillar of light began to
vanish, and the last thing they saw was a fuzzy image of Iyerre
rising from his throne.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
still wasn’t completely sure if the seventh native ‘Autarch’
was Emperor Darknorth or not. Even if it was someone else, killing a
trapped Autarch wouldn’t be a complete waste of his time. If it
really was Emperor Darknorth, things would be perfect!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thus,
to make sure that nothing unexpected might happen, Iyerre elected to
personally deal with this new variable.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
stared at the countless spacetime bubbles in the void. He was able to
almost instantly tell that he wouldn’t be able to solve this
formation right away, and so he quickly sent word to the other six.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Gentlemen,
I’ve also become trapped within a Sithe temple. Mine has eight
Sithe Exalts controlling it,” Ning sent via the message-talisman.
“I’m now trapped within a spacetime formation. It’ll take me
some time to break out of it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!
Darknorth, you’ve been trapped as well?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
I’m not too far away from you. I’ll come help out,” Autarch
Stonerule replied immediately.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
need. I’m quite skilled in both spacetime and formations. I’m
better suited for dealing with this type of formation than anyone
else,” Ning sent back. “Don’t worry too much. I’m about to
start meditating on how to deconstruct this formation. I’m just
giving you all a head’s up! For both myself and Ekong to be trapped
in short succession means that the Sithe have probably prepared
squads of Exalts for all of us. Don’t let yourselves be trapped as
well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
The other six Autarchs all felt a sense of pressure. Ekong had been
trapped in a temple commanded by seven Exalts, while Darknorth had
been trapped by a grayish-white temple controlled by eight. The Sithe
most assuredly had more Exalts under their command than simply
fifteen!</P>

Chapter 10: Eighty-Two Days</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Starting
today… Skyfeeder, Mogg, Bolin, and Stonerule, the five of us must
cease using our true bodies to hunt down Sithe warships,” Autarch
Titanos sent to the others. “The cultivators across the various
battlefronts are no longer under too much pressure. That means the
hunt for Sithe Hegemons is no longer as pressing as it was
previously! Let’s simply have our avatars engage in the hunt. Let’s
not send our true bodies.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right.
Leave our true bodies in safety. Darknorth and Ekong have both been
trapped; if two or three more of us are trapped, we might end up
losing this war,” Autarch Skyfeeder sent back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
be careful,” Mogg said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Solve
it and escape as soon as you can. Too much time can result in new
variables being introduced,” Autarch Bolin said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Everyone
understood that the longer one was trapped for, the more dangerous it
would be. Even if Ning was able to temporarily survive the
grayish-white temple thanks to his formidable abilities, it was just
a matter of time before the Sithe sent even more reinforcements to
attack him! Thus, the more time they wasted the uglier the situation
would become. He had to escape as quickly as possible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
there’s anything you need us to do, just ask,” Autarch Skyfeeder
said. “Of the seven of us, your life matters more than anyone
else’s.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
understand.” Ning also understood that his fate no longer belonged
to him alone; his death would have an impact on their entire
Chaosverse and all the cultivators within it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-robed Ning stared at the countless spacetime bubbles and the
formation they had been arranged into. Spacetime continuously changed
around him, and Ning simply watched while under the effects of 100x
temporal acceleration. His every thought was focused on understanding
how this grand spacetime formation actually worked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiiip.
A spacetime rift suddenly appeared deep within the Great Dark,
followed by a tall, gray-robed, barefoot man walking into it. His
eyes were warm and gentle, seemingly filled with love towards all
living beings.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.”
Iyerre stared into the void, letting out a slight snort as he
frowned. A strange type of energy was circling around his body,
preventing all forms of karma from touching him! This was the reason
why no one from the local cultivator civilizations had ever been able
to discover his existence, despite the passage of countless aeons.
Given Iyerre’s power, if the prime essences of the Chaosverse were
able to sense him it would’ve immediately ranked him as the most
terrifying threat in all of existence and have warned the Autarchs
long ago.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ugh.
I can’t use even a sliver of the power of the Dao, and I’m
constantly being suppressed. Even my travelling speed is slowed to a
crawl,” Iyerre murmured anxiously to himself. Given his power, back
in his own Chaosverse he was able to travel more than a hundred times
faster than right now. Even in the Infinite Void, he travelled much
faster than he did right now. In this Chaosverse, however, he was
being constantly suppressed to the point where he moved roughly as
fast as the native Autarchs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
will take me eighty-two days to reach the place where we’ve trapped
Emperor Darknorth.” Cold light flashed through Iyerre’s warm
eyes. “I hope nothing happens during this period of time. We’ve
used the ‘Eight Revolutions Spacetime Temple’ to trap Emperor
Darknorth. He shouldn’t be able to escape in such a short period of
time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had been waiting back in the heart of the Sithelands, which was very
far away from the place Ning was trapped. And yet, he would still be
able to reach Ning in just a bit over two months, despite being
unable to use any of the power of the Dao and being suppressed by
this Chaosverse. This was a testament to how truly formidable he was!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Emperor
Darknorth is the only variable which is outside my control. If I can
get rid of him, the six remaining Autarchs will pose no danger.”
Iyerre felt a tinge of worry. “He’s the most unpredictable
variable, and he’s definitely in the highest of favor with the
local Quintessence. The entire Chaosverse will concentrate virtually
all of its luck onto him! This is what allows him to create one
miracle after another… but in the end, going from being an Omega
Emperor to being an Omega Autarch will still be incredibly difficult.
Luck and favor alone will not be enough.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the end, karmic luck was just a form of external aid. It could be
ridiculously helpful to ordinary mortals, allowing them (for example)
to easily acquire various treasures which could allow them to become
Immortals and understand the Dao. For Autarchs, however, luck was
much less useful.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Titanos and the others didn’t care too much about karmic luck
either. It was almost impossible for them to improve any further, no
matter how lucky they were! Ning, however, was the only person in
this entire Chaosverse who stood a chance of becoming an Omega
Autarch. He would definitely be blessed with tremendous luck, but
luck alone wouldn’t be enough to produce an Omega Autarch. It
wasn’t even enough to allow him to come up with a technique like
the ‘Truesoul Everlasting’; such a thing required many other
factors, including personal insights and tremendous hard work!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Generally
speaking, the more powerful you became the better your karmic luck
would also become. When Ning had been reborn via the Netherworld
Kingdom, he had been an unremarkable little fellow in the vast
chaosworld that was the Three Realms. It was only once he grew
stronger that his luck truly improved. Iyerre, in contrast, wished to
suppress the entire Chaosverse and then bind it to him. To an expert
like him, only personal strength was worth putting your faith in.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
might be a variable, but he still has far less than even a 10% chance
of breaking through to becoming an Omega Autarch. I still stand a
very good chance of winning this war. Eighty-two days… so long as
they can hold him for eighty-two days, I’ll be able to make it in
time and get rid of Emperor Darknorth.” Iyerre had an ironclad
will, but he still couldn’t help but feel a bit of anxiousness. He
knew that whether or not he was able to kill Emperor Darknorth was
one of the biggest factors in determining if he could gain control
over this Chaosverse or not.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiip.
He continued to tear through spacetime, warping at Autarch-like
speeds towards Ning’s location.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the Eight Revolutions Spacetime Temple. Ever since Ning had been
trapped here, he had spent all of his time analyzing the complicated
formation around him. He had no idea that a terrifying figure like
Iyerre was heading towards him, but he did know the more time he
wasted, the more dangerous the situation would become.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">On
the fifth day of Ning’s imprisonment. Autarch Titanos and Autarch
Ekong managed to break free of the hallway formation trapping them…
but then, a new danger appeared before them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">On
the ninth day of Ning’s imprisonment. The two Autarchs very nearly
escaped, but all of a sudden the most terrifying danger of all
descended upon them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">On
the tenth day of Ning’s imprisonment. Autarch Titanos’ avatar was
forced to use his own life to block the dangerous attack crashing
towards them, resulting in him dying in battle! However, this allowed
Autarch Ekong to escape unharmed. He was heavily wounded, but at
least he managed to stay alive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
could feel death breathing down my neck. I could literally feel
death’s icy grasp reaching for me! It was all thanks to you,
Titanos. Otherwise, there’s no way I would’ve been able to
escape. Even if I did escape the first hallway, the second trap
would’ve done me in.” Autarch Ekong was extremely grateful. “I’m
ashamed of having caused you to sacrifice an avatar.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
fine. I can make another one! For you to have escaped counts as a win
in my book. Besides, it was my fault for being unable to fully divine
all the dangers of that place,” Titanos said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha!
Ekong, Titanos just saved your life. After this war is over, you need
to offer him some of that fine wine you’ve been stockpiling.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
problem whatsoever,” Ekong agreed straightforwardly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ekong’s
escape was something for the cultivators to celebrate. Of course,
Titanos had to recreate an avatar, which would start off at 50% of
his power at most. This avatar would now be the weakest of their
Autarch-class combatants, which would have a negative impact on their
total combat prowess, but it was still a much, much better outcome
than Autarch Ekong dying.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Now,
the only one trapped was Ning himself. Titanos, Skyfeeder, Mogg, and
Bolin all offered advice and strategies based on what Ning had told
them, and they also tried to help come up with ideas for solving the
formation. Alas, they weren’t able to see the formation in person
and so they could do nothing more than give general advice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">On
the nineteenth day of Ning’s imprisonment. Ning was still unable to
escape, but something else happened. Autarch Bolin’s avatar was
also assaulted by a squad of Sithe Exalts. He had been very cautious,
but he still ended up trapped within an evil black temple.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sithe really do have more squads of Exalts roving around. Damn.”
Autarch Ekong was furious.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thankfully,
only his avatar has been trapped there. If Bolin’s real body was
trapped, we’d be in much more trouble,” Titanos said. “Bolin,
hurry up and try to solve the formation and escape as soon as
possible. Even if you can’t escape, the sooner your avatar dies the
sooner you can start working on a new one and making it stronger.
Every extra day counts. Of course, I hope you can escape intact. That
avatar is an Autarch-class combatant, after all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
they were continuously weakened like this, they might end up being
defeated in the final battle. Small losses of strength could have a
major impact on the outcome of the war.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
you be careful as well. Staying alive matters more than anything
else,” Titanos said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
my avatar’s remained fairly close to you this entire time. It can
probably reach you in around ten days or so. If you ever need my
help, just let me know,” Autarch Mogg sent. “Your life is
extremely important to us. If I can sacrifice an avatar to keep you
alive, that’s a worthwhile trade.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
need. I’m still analyzing the formation trapping me. You coming in
wouldn’t really help me much. If I ever do need you, I’ll let you
know.” Ning felt quite grateful for the offer, but he knew that
Autarch Mogg coming wouldn’t make any difference.</P>

Chapter 11: Breaching Spacetime, Succumbing to Eight Revolutions</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the Eight Revolutions Spacetime Temple.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sithe Exalts remained seated on the eight stone pillars ringing the
outer perimeter of the temple. They were closely watching all of Ji
Ning’s actions within the formation, not daring to be the slightest
bit negligent. Thanks to their control over the formation they were
able to scry and see Ning’s white-robed figured seated in the lotus
position, surrounded by countless divine runes of incomparable
complexity.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
skilled in formations, illusions, spacetime…” A Sithe Exalt
sighed in amazement. “Only an Omega Emperor could be skilled in so
many aspects!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
Sithe Exalts, they had the same level of insight as the native
Autarchs of this Chaosverse. Thus, they were able to tell from the
runes surrounding Ning that the man had reached incredible heights in
both formations and spacetime.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Emperor
Darknorth lives up to his reputation. Still… it isn’t likely that
he’ll be able to solve this formation in just eighty-two short
days. Twenty days have already gone past.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Perhaps
the spacetime formation alone will be enough to trap him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sithe Exalts were conversing mentally with each other. They knew just
how important Emperor Darknorth was to the war. He was most likely
the greatest obstacle to almighty Iyerre taking control over this
Chaosverse! This was why Iyerre was hastening towards them at top
speed. If they managed to successfully keep Emperor Darknorth trapped
for eighty-two days, they would have carried out their primary
mission. Once Iyerre became the Lord of Chaos for this Chaosverse, he
would definitely give them great rewards.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
continued to flow on, one day after another. The spacetime formation
was indeed quite complicated, but on the thirtieth day of Ning’s
imprisonment, an explosion suddenly erupted forth from within the
formation, followed by the faces of the eight Sithe Exalts turning
grim.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-robed Ning had risen to his feet. He had assumed his
three-headed, six-armed form and was using his six Northbow swords to
furiously assault the spacetime formation around him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
seemed to be randomly hacking to the right and to the left, but
somehow his ‘random’ hacks managed to disrupt the functioning of
the entire formation. He had located and broken through some of the
energy nexus points, causing the power of the formation to drop
dramatically.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
discovered the secrets behind our spacetime formation. The formation
is going to break. It won’t hold much longer!” The eight Sithe
Exalts were shocked by Ning’s speed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
The spacetime formation finally collapsed, followed by those
countless miniature spacetime bubbles popping and dissipating.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
thirty full days, he had finally defeated the spacetime formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Incredible.
Simply incredible.” A black-haired Sithe Exalt sighed in amazement.
“He was able to breach the formation in just thirty days. If I was
trapped there, I probably wouldn’t be able to get out even if I
spent a hundred chaos cycles trying.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
aren’t skilled in formations. You’d stand no chance whatsoever.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
really is impressive.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thirty
days have gone past. Only fifty-two days are left. The ‘eight
revolutions formation’ should be able to trap him for fifty-two
days, right?” a Sithe Exalt with golden fur covering his face said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Eight Revolutions Spacetime Temple’s strongest trap-type formation
is the ‘eight revolutions formation’; the spacetime formation
isn’t quite as strong. When I tested the spacetime formation out, I
was able to get an overall sense of what I needed to do and could
calmly meditate on it, but when I tested out the eight revolutions
formation I just felt completely baffled and lost,” a female Sithe
Exalt said. “If it took him thirty days for just the spacetime
formation, the eight revolutions formation will probably take him
over three years.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
no way he’s getting out of there.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Check
out that stupid look on his face.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
he wants to break through via raw force? What a joke!” The Sithe
Exalts all began to laugh when they saw what Ning was doing. They
knew just how powerful their ‘eight revolutions formation’ was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Ning had just broken through the vast spacetime formation. Now, he
surveyed his new surroundings with a frown. He was within a sealed
dimension of raw fire. The flames filled every inch of this
dimension, but they were pushed aside before even getting close to
Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
sealed dimension?” Ning had no idea that he had now entered the
most dangerous and most difficult part of the Eight Revolutions
Spacetime Temple… the eight revolutions formation! This would be
his greatest obstacle to escaping the temple. If he managed to break
through this, the temple wouldn’t have much else left.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
should be able to just tear through dimensional membranes via raw
force.” Ning didn’t hesitate at all, immediately using the
technique which Autarchs favored the most – raw force!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Ning shot upwards while manifesting three heads and six arms. His six
Northbow swords furiously chopped against the dimensional membrane,
with each strike empowered by the mysteries of the Space Sword Dao.
Ning unleashed several hundred chops just the blink of an eye!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
Ning had been trapped within that ‘hidden’ dimension, Autarch
Mogg and Autarch Titanos had used the same principle to break through
the dimensional membrane – raw force! This was because, unlike the
Sithe, they had nigh-limitless amounts of energy here in their own
Chaosverse. There was no worry about running out, whereas the Sithe
had to consider how much energy they had available when planning
their killer attacks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thus,
using raw force to overpower a formation was actually a highly
effective technique, even though it seemed rather brutish and clumsy!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
seems like it is breaking.” Ning could see that the dimensional
membrane was shuddering in the face of his frenzied attacks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the spacetime maze, Ning had tried to furiously assault the spacetime
bubbles in this manner as well. However, all of the spacetime bubbles
he destroyed would release their energies to the local spacetime
field, which would then give birth to new bubbles. As a result, the
actual energy of the formation wasn’t depleted in the slightest.
Raw force was useless against a tactic like this, unless he reached a
level where he was so strong he could tear apart the entire formation
with just one strike of the sword.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Dimensional
membranes, however, were different. They had to endure the weight of
Ning’s strikes head on, and each time that happened they would be
depleted of energy. Eventually, they would be so weak that they would
simply collapse!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
After the time needed to boil a kettle of tea, one of Ning’s
strikes finally tore open a giant wound that was roughly three
hundred meters in size. Through the tear in the dimensional membrane,
Ning was able to see… a vast world of water outside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning turned to stare at the world of fire he was currently in, then
back at the world of water on the opposite side of the dimensional
membrane. The rift in the membrane was already beginning to quickly
heal.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Another
dimension?” Ning frowned, but he didn’t hesitate in immediately
charging through the rift and entering the world of water.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
was fast. The dimensional rift closed after just three seconds.”
Ning watched as the tear he had created vanished before his very
eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
this is a world of water, eh?” Ning flew through the water. The
waves were powerful and heavy, but like the flames they were
incapable of harming Ning in the slightest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
break through again.” Ning once more used his sword-arts as he flew
to the edges of the world, then began to frenziedly assault the
dimensional membrane. It once more took him the amount of time needed
to boil a kettle of tea to once more tear a dimensional rift open…
and this time, he was able to see a world that was filled with
vitality and boundless green light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yet
another world?” Ning had a bad feeling about this, but he still
flew through and continued to assault the dimensional membrane in
this third world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">And
so, Ning began to enter and then furiously chop through one world
after another without stopping. An ordinary person probably would’ve
given up long ago, but Ning spent an entire day chopping through a
hundred different dimensional membranes before stopping. Alas, there
was no end to them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
broken through over a hundred worlds in a row.” Ning was standing
atop a mountain, pondering to himself. “These hundred worlds seem
to be constructed from eight dimensional archetypes. I can view them
as the ice world, the water world, the life world, the earth world,
the mountain world, the fire world, the lava world, and the metal
world. The dimensions continuously fluctuate between these eight
worlds…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
only eight basic ‘types’, but each world I enter seems to have a
slightly different aura than the previous ones.” Ning was growing a
bit nervous. He had spent an entire day analyzing the worlds, but
still had no idea how he was supposed to break through them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
he had been within the spacetime formation, at least he could tell
that there were countless spacetime bubbles that were linked together
into a formation. He was able to glean insights on the workings of
the formation from those bubbles before finally solving it!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
the ‘eight revolutions formation’ he was trapped in simply gave
him a new world once he broke through the previous one. It was a
never-ending cycle of these eight types of worlds, a cycle without
end…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
should I break through? How should I escape?” Ning continuously
pondered this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Can
it be that there are actually only eight worlds in total? No, that
can’t be right. I can sense through my mastery of spacetime that
there should be more than just eight.” Ning simply had no idea as
to how he was supposed to understand the mysteries behind this
formation!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
continued to flow on one day after another. The Sithe Exalts on the
eight stone pillars gradually began to relax. Everything was as they
had predicted. The eight revolutions formation was much more
difficult to break than the spacetime formation, after all. In truth,
every single one of these temples was quite extraordinary. Autarch
Ekong had only been able to escape his temple thanks to Autarch
Titanos sacrificing his avatar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Once
Iyerre gets here, we’ll have completed our mission.” The Sithe
Exalts continued to wait silently.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for Ning, he was now seated in the lotus position at the very center
of a world of lava. Time was sped up to a rate of 100x around him as
he continuously pondered the problem before him. Ning had already
notified Titanos, Mogg, Skyfeeder, Bolin, and the others. All six
Autarchs were helping him with suggestions, but none of them were
able to come up with any true solutions for this deceptively simple
cycle of eight worlds.</P>

Chapter 12: A Murderous Voice</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Oftentimes,
the simpler something was the fewer flaws it had. One of the simplest
measures was to just construct a dimensional cage to imprison
someone, one which was so stable and tough that there was no way to
break through it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
simplicity carried its own stringent requirements. Ji Ning and the
Autarchs were so overwhelmingly powerful and had such limitless
reserves of energy that no mere dimensional cage could possibly
withstand their assaults! The eight revolutions formation went about
it in another way. It generated multiple worlds, each of which Ning
was able to break through fairly quickly… but the worlds continued
to be generated one after another!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
of these worlds are extremely stable. Maintaining this sort of world
can’t be easy,” Ning mused. “And there can’t really be an
endless amount of worlds!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break!”
Ning once more rose to his feet in three-headed, six-armed form. He
transformed into a dazzling streak of sword-light which slammed
against the dimensional membrane. After the time needed to boil a
kettle of tea the dimensional membrane was hacked open, revealing a
freezing world of ice. Ice filled the entire world, making up its
continents, mountains, and valleys.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
stepped through the dimensional rift and into this frozen world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
doesn’t really matter which direction the tear is created in; the
end result will still be a new world. Given how stable these worlds
are, there can’t be that many of them… and yet they continue to
loop in on themselves in an endless cycle. The only way this is
possible is if these eight worlds are actually moving to line up in
front of me! That way, no matter where I go I’ll see an endless
procession of worlds before me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">By
now, Ning had a rough idea as to how this eight cycles formation had
to work. It consisted of several dozen or several hundred worlds that
were perhaps arranged into a spherical shape! Ning was located at the
very center of this sphere, so no matter where he went he would enter
a new world. Once he did so, the other worlds would relocate
themselves to keep him at their center.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">No
matter where he went, he would remain trapped in the ‘center’ of
the formation. He’d never be able to make it out!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was his current theory. Perhaps it wasn’t perfect, but he felt
confident that this was more-or-less how it worked. However, this
theory just made Ning feel even more worried, precisely because of
how simple it was. The simpler something was, the fewer flaws it
would have.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Its
only real flaw is that these worlds have to constantly move and shift
around as I do. If they didn’t, then I would eventually be able to
advance beyond the scope of the formation. This moving process has to
take time. It takes me the time needed to boil a kettle of tea in
order to break through a world, and that’s more than enough for
them to readjust themselves,” Ning mused. “If I could break
through the worlds over ten times faster… perhaps it wouldn’t be
enough time for the worlds to relocate themselves perfectly,
resulting in some openings that I can exploit.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Based
on his current level of understanding, he knew that using force to
breach this formation was completely hopeless. The eight formations
formation would continuously rearrange its internal configuration
with each world he escaped. Power wouldn’t work… what he needed
was speed! He needed to move fast enough that the formation wouldn’t
be able to reconfigure in time, resulting in flaws being revealed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is my only option.” Ning could come up with no ideas save for this
one. “But how am I supposed to break through these worlds faster?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Two
options came to mind. The first was to somehow make himself become
more powerful. For example, if he managed to reach a greater level of
understanding with regards to the Dao of Spacetime, he would be able
to quickly and more easily breach those dimensional walls.
Alternately, if he managed to create the Oblivion Sword Dao then he
could use its all-encompassing destructive force to devour everything
in his path. Ning had the feeling that once he created it, he would
become much more powerful, and he could use that power to more
quickly breach those dimensional barriers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
improving his personal strength was an extremely difficult goal. He
had already devised the Spacetime Sword Dao. Ning had no idea how he
was supposed to upgrade it any further.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
concept of ‘Oblivion’, he had only gained after scrying the
secrets of the sphere of annihilation. This was a form of power that
was capable of destroying an entire Chaosverse. Iyerre had found this
mysterious item from within the Infinite Void, and in all his
countless aeons of existence he had never found a second such item.
Ning’s avatar remained trapped within the Annihilation Hive, and it
had never stopped analyzing this technique.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
second option was to find flaws in the dimensional membranes before
him. If he could find some flaws, he would be able to break through
them much faster with much less effort.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
been constantly training in the Oblivion Sword Dao. There’s no way
to rush it.” Ning inspected the area around him. “My only choice
is to find flaws within these dimensional constructs.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Whoosh. His sword-light became watery, flowing across the dimensional
membrane and causing it to first shudder, then crack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
stared at the cracks, watching them quickly heal. “These dimensions
were created based on the secrets of spacetime. Every single part of
the dimensional membrane seems to be identical. There don’t seem to
be any flaws.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
Ning remained trapped within the eight revolutions formation, the war
outside began to pick up the pace. Autarch Skyfeeder’s avatar ended
up being tricked while hunting down Sithe and was trapped within a
temple, as was Autarch Bolin’s avatar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Stonerule’s avatar was more formidable. He was a wary man and a
mastery of illusions. When the Sithe temple appeared, they discovered
that they had trapped nothing more than a mere projection… and now
that the temple had revealed itself, Autarch Stonerule immediately
set down a grand formation around the temple, securely sealing it
away and ensuring that it was unable to escape.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">For
now the clashes remained fairly low-level, as Autarchs could replace
lost avatars with slightly weaker ones. In the end, the real focus of
the war remained on Emperor Darknorth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
Emperor Darknorth died, the Annihilation Hive would no longer be
checked. It would continue to furiously devour the energies of the
Chaosverse. The only other person who understood how the
reverse-vortex formation worked was Autarch Titanos, whose avatar had
already been destroyed. His new avatar wasn’t strong enough to keep
the Annihilation Hive in check. Titanos would have to go in person if
he wanted to stop the thing!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Darknorth
was the strongest member of the seven cultivator leaders, while
Titanos was the second-strongest. If the former was slain while the
latter was tied down, they would have all-but lost the war.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
we can kill Darknorth, we’ll have won.” Iyerre viewed killing
Ning as a mission of critical importance. As far as he was concerned,
Ning was a greater risk than all six of the other Autarchs combined.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">On
the sixty-ninth day of Ning’s capture.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
recent days Ning would only occasionally break through to a new
world, then spend most of his time strolling about before beginning
to meditate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ah.
So is that how it works?” Ning opened his eyes, his gaze as deep
and fathomless as the starry skies themselves. Countless stars seemed
to be swimming through his eyes. This was a sign that he had reached
a truly incredible level in the Dao of Numerancy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly,
Ning’s body rapidly increased in size. Boom! He transformed into a
towering three-headed, six-armed giant who wielded all six of the
Northbow swords. He strode across the land, his six swords also
increasing in size as he used them to deliver repeated chops of
sword-light against the dimensional membrane all around him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
Ning’s swords moved, multiple sword-shadows appeared around them.
There were chops, stabs, thwacks… all sorts of attacks filled the
area around him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
going on?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Something’s
wrong with that world. It’s destabilizing!” The Sithe Exalts
responsible for maintaining the eight revolutions formation were
quickly shocked. They had only grown more confident in their
formation as they had watched Ning fail to make any progress. They
had allowed themselves to relax… but now, all of them were shocked!
This was because the world Ning was in had begin to shudder, almost
as though the entire world was unable to remain stable and was at the
verge of collapse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can’t send in additional energy!” the black-haired Sithe Exalt
called out in shock. “We’re blocked from sending our energy into
any part of the dimensional membrane of that world. Something’s
disrupting the conduits! The lack of energy is causing the
dimensional membrane to be unable to repair itself. He’s going to
break through much faster than before!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
is this possible? How did he do this?!” The Sithe Exalts were
frantic. Previously, Ning needed the amount of time for boiling a
kettle of tea in order to break through a dimensional membrane. This
was because each time he assaulted the dimensional membrane, the
formation would quickly send in more energy to reinforce it. This was
why even after he did manage to tear a rift open, the rift would
quickly close after just three seconds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
now, the dimensional membrane was no longer being resupplied with
energy. That made the destruction process much faster.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
didn’t make sense. The energy transfer was an invisible, formless
process which saw energy be directed straight into the membrane
itself. By all rights, there should be no way to stop such a thing.
However, to a person who had reached a sufficiently high level of
insights all things were possible, be it creation or destruction.
Ning had spent many days in accelerated meditation, figuring out a
way to accomplish this by joining together his Numerancy Sword Dao,
Spacetime Sword Dao, Light Sword Dao, and Dark Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Three gaping holes appeared in different parts of the world Ning was
trapped in. Ning glanced through the holes, only to see three
completely different worlds. He smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Dimensions,
revolve!” a strange, murderous voice suddenly rang out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly,
Ning saw the three different worlds outside the rifts begin to spin
away. The world he was in became completely detached from them… and
slowly, Ning began to see the fourth and fifth worlds which were
revolving around him.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_44_Chapter_013__The"></A>
Chapter 13: Fatal Trap (Part 1)</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
good.” A terrifying sense of danger instantly flooded Ji Ning’s
mind. “They can no longer hold me, so they are going to try and
kill me instead?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">These
temples were all manned by Sithe Exalts. They could be used to trap,
but they could also be used to kill! Autarch Titanos’ avatar and
Autarch Ekong had to work together to survive the one they were in,
with Titanos eventually losing his avatar in order for Ekong to
escape. These temples were not easy to deal with!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had the vague feeling that staying within this world would be even
more dangerous, and so he immediately transformed into a streak of
light and shot outwards.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
As soon as he exited the world, his face paled. In the past a new
world would greet him once he exited the previous one, but this time
was different. This time, he was within an empty region which had
many enormous pocket dimensions. Above him, below him, to his left,
to his right… the entire area was filled with those spinning
worlds. Ning was able to see over twenty of the things. They all
circled around him, with him being at the very center.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
really is as I had predicted. These worlds are all mobile, which is
why I would always enter a new one after breaking through the old
one.” Ning became all the more certain of his hypothesis when he
saw this. “Now that I’m breaking through the worlds much more
quickly, they aren’t able to keep up and so they’ve chosen to
discard the useless trappings entirely.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Emperor
Darknorth!” a cold voice rang out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Are
you absolutely sure that I’m Darknorth?” Ning replied, relaxed.
His body was glowing with such radiance that the Sithe Exalts were
only able to see a glowing figure and were unable to make out his
features.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can’t imagine anyone save you, Emperor Darknorth, who would be able
to so quickly understand and deconstruct the eight revolutions
formation,” the cold voice replied. “The eight revolutions
formation isn’t just meant for trapping people, it’s also filled
with many killer mechanisms! Emperor Darknorth, our original plan was
simply to trap you. However, you are forcing our hand. We’ll have
to kill you now,” a second deep voice boomed out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hah!”
Ning stared at the many worlds revolving around him, then let out a
loud laugh. “What a joke! If you were able to kill me, you would’ve
done so long ago. In the end, this is my homeland. We cultivators are
far more powerful than you in our own Chaosverse. Kill me? Even if
you have the assistance of this temple, I’ll wager you aren’t
sure of your chances!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
faces of the eight Sithe Exalt stiffened slightly. It was true. They
had to admit that they weren’t 100% sure they could kill Darknorth.
Not even Iyerre was confident that they could accomplish this, which
was why he had merely ordered them to trap Ning and tie him down. If
they could keep Ning trapped until Iyerre arrived, their chances of
victory would increase to 100%! Alas, there was nothing the Sithe
Exalts could do. Now that Ning had already worked out how the eight
revolutions formation operated, he would probably be able to escape
within an hour if left to his own devices!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thus,
they had chosen to transform the ‘eight revolutions formation’
from a trapping formation to a killing formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
of the temples had terrifying offensive powers built into them. The
same was true for the Eight Revolutions Spacetime Temple!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hopefully,
we can kill him. Even if we cannot, we can still use ‘annihilation
mode’ to buy ourselves some more time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
already been sixty-nine days. If we can buy another ten-plus days,
we’ll have accomplished something great.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
forcing us to do this. Attack!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!”
The eight Sithe Exalts immediately activated the offensive functions
in the eight revolutions formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning’s face hardened as he stood there in the empty void, staring
at the vast worlds which were spinning around him. He could clearly
sense that each of the giant worlds were accumulating and preparing
to unleash a terrifying amount of power. Freezing energies, flaming
energies, watery energies, vital energies, metallic energies… all
types of energies were beginning to pour out of the many worlds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
different types of energy were beginning to build together, and in
the end they resolved into eight different types of energy which
materialized in the forms of titanic dragons. The vast energy dragons
all looked completely different, but they were all around ten million
kilometers long and a million kilometers wide. Each energy dragon
contained enough power to cause even Ning to feel a sense of shock.
These things were definitely on the Autarch level… and in fact,
they significantly surpassed Ning in raw might.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
Ning was able to remain quite calm. These were nothing more than
formation constructs which did not possess true sentience. They knew
nothing of the Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
eight enormous dragons slowly began to ‘swim’ through the air
towards Ning, their ponderous bodies blocking out everything in
Ning’s vision.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hm.”
Ning maintained his three-headed, six-armed form and warily waited
for them with his six Northbow swords at the ready.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Finally,
all of them joined together to form a series of loops. Some of them
formed the ‘inner loops’, while others formed the ‘outer
loops’. A dragon that seemed to be formed from stone energies was
the first to move towards Ning, and when it did Ning finally struck.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break!”
Faced with the durable-looking stone dragon, Ning immediately used
the Five Elements Sword Dao. In truth, all eight energy dragons were
based upon the energies of the Five Elements, and so the Five
Elements Sword Dao was the most suitable response for all of them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
sword-light was filled with vitality. It drilled hard against the
stone dragon, exploding with dazzling light as it sought to tear
through it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Five Elements Sword Dao truly was a strong counter for this stone
dragon, but Ning’s full-force strike was only able to just barely
shatter the stone dragon apart. Moments later, the other energy
dragons began to swarm towards him while the stone dragon began to
reform from its shattered parts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Whoosh. Whoosh. The eight energy dragons continuously coiled around
Ning in layers. Ning destroyed one after another, but new ones were
continuously formed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
long is this going to take?” Ning was growing anxious. “Why is it
that I feel escape is even more difficult than it was earlier.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
eight Sithe Exalts continued to maintain careful control over the
formation, not daring to relax in the slightest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Using
the formation like this is consuming far too much energy. It is
depleting energy many times faster than ‘trap mode’ did. We won’t
be able to last too long,” the black-haired Sithe exalts said
worriedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
have to. Even if it costs us every last scrap of energy, we have to
last until almighty Iyerre arrives.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hold
on for as long as you can.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
eight revolutions formation had many different mechanisms within it.
‘Trap mode’ was just the start, ensuring that any foe would find
it difficult to escape. Next would come a terrifying number of
attacks! However, the Sithe Exalts weren’t confident in being able
to actually kill Ning with those attacks, and so they continued to
pour all of their efforts into simply trapping Ning and keeping him
tied down. So long as Ning didn’t escape, they would have ‘won’…
but this process would consume an enormous amount of energy,
especially with Ning launching so many attacks against them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! The three-headed, six-armed Ning continuously assaulted
the energy dragons using his Five Elements Sword Dao. He didn’t
pause for even a second, because he already discovered a flaw in the
formation. “These dragons are formed from energy and given physical
heft, making breaking them difficult. Without a doubt, maintaining
them takes up an absolutely shocking amount of energy at all times.
If I furiously attack, their energy expenditures will be insane!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
refuse to believe they’ll be able to sustain such high levels of
energy expenditure for too long. That’s the weak spot of this
formation – its energy consumption. Break!” Ning didn’t worry
about his own energy running dry. He was an Omega Emperor in his own
Chaosverse; he had an endless supply of energy from the Chaosverse
itself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! He destroyed yet another dragon, and once again a new
dragon came in its stead. The eight energy dragons continued to coil
around him and suppress him, preventing him from escaping but paying
an enormous cost in energy to accomplish this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
six full days of this war of attrition, the Sithe Exalts were finally
unable to maintain it any longer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
this continues, in just one day our Eight Revolutions Spacetime
Palace will collapse under its own weight due to lack of energy.”
The female Sithe Exalt said hurriedly, “Even if we can manage to
last for an extra day, it won’t be enough time. Iyerre won’t be
able to make it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn
this Emperor Darknorth. He’s been attacking nonstop this entire
time. If he took a slight break, we wouldn’t have it this rough. By
all rights, we’ve prepared such a powerful energy wellspring that
it should be more than strong enough to last us until almighty Iyerre
arrives, but Emperor Darknorth won’t stop his crazed attacks!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Well,
we ARE trying to kill him. You didn’t really expect him to just
stand there and wait for death, did he?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Enough.
Let’s attack. Cancel ‘trap mode’ and activate the ‘annihilation
mode’! Annihilation mode has much more powerful attacks. Emperor
Darknorth might be an incredible genius, but he still might very well
die to it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’re
out of other options.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sithe Exalts had been trying to buy enough time for Iyerre to arrive,
since that would guarantee them victory. Alas, they no longer had
enough time. Their only choice was to fully activate ‘annihilation
mode’, with the original ‘trap mode’ having been nothing more
than the first phase of the formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Materialize!”
The eight Sithe Exalts simultaneously began to activate their
respective parts of the formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
the energy dragons that had been coiling around Ning suddenly began
to roil about in midair, tangling around each other as all of them
simultaneously shot towards Ning. Even the enormous linked worlds off
in the distance began to move once more, causing Ning’s face to
change.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">* *

Chapter 14: Fatal Trap (Part 2)</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
‘trap mode’ had worked in a gradual function by pressuring Ji
Ning and slowing him down. Each time he destroyed one of the eight
energy dragons, it would quickly reform and go after him again. The
overall tempo of the battle was fairly slow… but now, everything
suddenly sped up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
eight energy dragons began to simultaneously coil around Ning in a
ferocious fashion. Ning knew just how terrifyingly strong these
dragons were. If he wasn’t able to withstand their attacks, he
would probably be ground to dust! Even his truesoul would be ground
apart by them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break!”
Ning chose to discard all defenses and instead use his sword-arts to
charge straight towards the ice dragon which was closest to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Whoosh! Sword-light flashed like the spokes of a giant windmill,
instantly landing multiple consecutive cuts upon the frozen dragon’s
body and chopping deep into it. Ning seized this opportunity to
burrow all the way inside the dragon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Bang!
All the other energy dragons collided into each other, not even
touching Ning who was now inside the ice dragon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Whew.”
Ning let out a sigh of relief. “There’s no way for me to block
all eight of those dragons head-on at once, but by hiding inside one
of them I was able to sidestep the problem.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The ice dragon Ning was inside of quickly began to crumble and break
apart, taking away Ning’s ‘hiding spot’. A moment later, a new
ice dragon began to reform at the outer perimeter of this region.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
soon as Ning revealed himself, all of the dragons once more swept
towards him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break!”
Ning’s sword-light flashed with incomparable sharpness and
severity, tearing through the body of the water dragon and allowing
him to dodge inside!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">No
matter what dragon he faced, he was able to find the perfect
sword-art to counter it. He would burrow deep inside an energy
dragon’s body, using it to avoid the many other attacks!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.
I wonder how long you’ll be able to keep playing like this.” Ning
wasn’t worried at all, continuing to dive into the bodies of the
energy dragons to avoid their combined attacks. “This increased
tempo means that the energy dragons are breaking apart ten times
faster than they were in the past, with the overall formation
expending far more energy than merely ten times that of before! How
long could they possibly sustain this?” Generally speaking, when
accelerating the attacks of a formation like this, the energy
expenditure would skyrocket an astronomical amount.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
guess was spot-on. After just one hour, the Sithe Exalts were no
longer able to maintain this tempo of battle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
aren’t able to kill him. Emperor Darknorth is just too strong; he
can almost instantly tear through one of our formation-dragons.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Our
energy reserves just don’t last long enough. Let’s go to the
final formation, the ‘eight revolutions annihilator’ formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
hope the ‘eight revolutions annihilator’ is able to kill him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
definitely will kill him. The eight revolutions annihilator is so
powerful that it should definitely be mighty enough take his life.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sithe Exalts were all desperate for victory. The eight revolutions
annihilator formation was the final and most powerful offensive
technique the temple possessed. If even this failed, then Ning would
be able to break the formation and escape shortly afterwards, which
meant that they would have failed in their mission!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
Ning was busy blocking those frenzied attacks, the eight energy
dragons suddenly skyrocketed in power once more. They blasted out
countless streams of power in every direction, aiming them at the
giant worlds which were constantly shifting position in the perimeter
around Ning. The worlds of water, freezing ice, blazing fire, stone,
and more began to link together in an intricate and marvelous manner,
forming a single complete whole.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Above
Ning, the many worlds had come together to form something which
looked like an enormous Eight Trigrams shape. Below him, the many
worlds had come together to form something similar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
two sets of Eight Trigrams were rapidly crashing down towards Ning,
who was trapped between them. It was like the lower set was a
grindstone, while the upper set was a millstone!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
of the worlds surrounding Ning had been completely joined together,
giving him no chance to escape at all. As for the energy dragons,
their energies had been completely merged into this formation as
well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
good!” This was a straightforward crushing attack, spread across
such a vast area that Ning wasn’t able to dodge it at all. His only
choice was to meet it head-on. Ning knew that the most critical
moment had come, and he readied his six Northbow swords while
maintaining his three-headed, six-armed mode.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
all took time to describe, but in truth it took less than a heartbeat
for these worlds to come crashing down towards Ning. They moved at an
absolutely astonishing speed!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clang!
Ning used his own sword-arts to defend. Three of the Northbow swords
executed the Numerancy Sword Dao. The Numerancy Sword Dao was so
incomparably intricate that it could truly be described as peerless
amongst all divination Daos! This formation-attack he was facing was
divided into two parts, and Ning wanted to attempt to redirect some
of their power against each other. Thus, he used the Numerancy Sword
Dao to do just that, lessening some of the pressure off him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
fourth Northbow sword, he used to execute the Spacetime Sword Dao in
generating a spacetime membrane which covered him. He was now within
an independent spacetime continuum which would easily deflect many
attacks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for his final two swords, he used them to execute the Five Elements
Sword Dao. They embodied the gentleness of water, the weightiness of
the earth, the vital energy of wood…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
two Eight Trigrams formations continued to come crashing down towards
each other. Iyerre had called this ‘annihilation mode’, and it
used eight different sources of power to create a single source of
overwhelming power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! Ning began to fight back against the two Eight Trigrams
crashing towards him. He once more was like Pangu cleaving apart
Heaven from Earth, using all six of his Northbow swords to resist the
crushing pressure of this formation! However, Ning quickly sensed
that yet another source of mighty power was crushing towards him.
This caught Ning off-guard, and he hurriedly moved to block this one
as well. And yet, moments later another source of power was crashing
against him…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Eight Trigrams were crashing towards him but were also swiveling,
which generated a strange type of power that clashed against Ning,
making it even harder for him to defend.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Bang!
After defending against the fifth surge of power, Ning could feel his
entire body trembling. Some blood came spewing out from his mouth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
good.” Ning knew that his body was starting to break down under the
stress. It was formed from the power of mana and was as strong as any
Universe treasure, but it still wasn’t able to take this level of
pressure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
instantly transformed his body into a form of blurry sword-light.
This was his invulnerable swordform!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Ekong, when faced with grave danger, had been forced to use his own
invulnerable form. Now, Ning was forced to do the same. His body was
no longer corporeal, making it incredibly resistant to any attacks.
As the master of the Eternal Omega Sword Dao, Ning was most skilled
in the invulnerable swordform. His body was now formed from countless
streaks of sword-light which dispersed the crushing power pressing
against him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Even
though he was now incorporeal, his six arms continued to wield the
Northbow swords in fighting back against the attacks crashing against
him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! Three more surges of power came crashing against him.
This power, the power of the ‘eight revolutions’, came in a total
of eight waves. Ning’s blurry body of sword-light was able to
deflect the majority of it, with the remaining power within the
limits of what he could tolerate. However, his energy was now being
depleted at such a rapid pace that for the first time in many years,
Ning began to feel as though he wasn’t able to keep it up for much
longer. During his previous fights, he had been able to instantly
replenish as much as he used up. He had never felt as though he
didn’t have enough energy!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was simply because the amount of energy he was using to restore and
repair his body was simply too enormous.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
all eight ‘waves’ of destructive energy were finished, the
attacks paused for a brief moment before launching yet another eight
waves… but that brief pause was enough for Ning to completely
recover all of his energy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hah!
This formation of yours is useless against me.” Ning roared with
laughter.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
he endured just three more cycles of annihilation mode… boom! The
dimensional membrane pressing down on Ning from above in the form of
the Eight Trigrams suddenly collapsed. It was unable to endure it any
longer!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
must be remembered that the ‘crushing’ process was carried out by
the dimensional membranes of the various worlds. The dimensional
membranes were very tough, with Ning needing to attack for the time
needed to boil a kettle of tea in order to destroy them, but the
power of the ‘annihilation mode’ simply placed too much strain
upon them, far more strain than Ning himself had to endure. Ning had
been focusing on defending and redirecting its power away while using
his invulnerable swordform to absorb the rest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
great pressure needed to destroy Ning caused the dimensional
membranes to be put under such great stress that they collapsed after
a short period of time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
could technically be considered a flaw, but it wasn’t really. This
was because if three consecutive attack cycles of the ‘eight
revolutions annihilation’ was insufficient to kill an opponent, it
meant that the formation itself just wasn’t strong enough. It had
failed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
soon as the formation above him shattered, Ning immediately charged
upwards to escape. “Break!” Ning immediately used his sword-arts
to slash upwards. He had long ago discovered where the weak points in
the dimensional membranes were, and just six seconds later he
exploded past them. The various worlds outside were still trying to
rearrange themselves; clearly, they hadn’t formed a perfect seal
yet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
Ning transformed into a streak of light, shooting through the seams
that still existed between the moving worlds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Stop
him!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Quick!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ve
already converted all of the worlds into ‘annihilation mode’.
It’ll take time for us to switch back into ‘trap mode’. We
won’t make it!” The Sithe Exalts were panicking.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning was simply too fast. He wasn’t going to just stand there as a
fool and wait for them to reform the ‘trap mode’ and imprison him
once more… and in truth, given his power he would be able to break
through in just an hour.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
‘annihilation mode’ had been very dangerous, but after breaching
through two worlds Ning was on the road to escape.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
After blasting through one final dimensional membrane, the entire
world seemed to change before him. He had already reached the
outsides of that vast temple, and he could even see the endless Great
Dark outside as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had escaped.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
Ning transformed into a streak of light, soaring into the skies. He
immediately saw the Sithe Exalts seated atop those distant stone
pillars, their faces filled with looks of terror.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“None
of you will escape!” Ning’s murderous voice boomed throughout
every inch of the temple.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_44_Chapter_015__The"></A>
Chapter 15: Extermination</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sithe Exalts could sense Ji Ning’s murderous intentions. None of
them hesitated as they all immediately transformed into streaks of
light, charging inside the formation. The difference in power between
them and Ning was simply too great. They had no chance at all of
winning a frontal clash; their only chance was to hide within the
formation!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Heartworld
projection, descend! Sword Dao domain, manifest!” Ning instantly
used all of his most powerful domain-type techniques, sending both
his heartworld projection and his sword domain crashing down upon
them. The Sithe Exalts felt as though they were swimming through
molasses as their flying speeds dropped dramatically. They were very
close to the formation and should’ve been able to enter it in the
blink of an eye, but they were now moving a thousand times slower
than before.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hurry
up and run! Hurry!” the Sithe Exalts continued to do their best to
escape.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Good
luck, everyone. There’s no way he can kill all eight of us at
once.” The Sithe Exalts were quickly able to judge the situation.
The eight of them were scattered in eight different directions around
the vast temple! They were all physically flying towards the center
of the temple because spacetime in the area had been suppressed,
making warping through it impossible. Ning was very fast, but the
eight Sithe Exalts were all very close to the formation. They’d be
able to enter it soon, and Ning wouldn’t be able to kill all of
them before the rest made it inside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Die.”
Ning instantly charged towards the closest Sithe Exalt, a female
whose eyes were filled with terror.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
kill me!” the female Exalt screamed, her voice filled with a
strange cadence that tried to seep into Ning’s soul and truesoul.
This was an illusory technique!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Playing
around with illusions in front of me?” Ning smiled coldly. When he
had been in the failed Daomerge state, his cracked truesoul might’ve
been weak enough to partially succumb to such a technique… but now
that he had succeeded? His truesoul was far more powerful than ever
before, and he had also gained a high level of mastery over the Dao
of Illusions. How could this Sithe Exalt possibly shake him?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Die.”
Sword-light howled past him in the form of countless dimensional
blades. Ning knew that these Sithe Exalts all had such powerful
bodies that one or two blows probably wouldn’t be enough to kill
him, and so he unleashed all six Northbow swords in a windmill of
rapidfire attacks. Given Ning’s power, twenty strikes was all that
was needed to completely annihilate her! Ning then began to fly
towards the other Sithe Exalt close by.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“N-no…”
The fiery-armored Sithe Exalt had a look of despair and resentment in
his eyes as he stared at the eight revolutions formation in front of
him. It was just inches away, but Darknorth’s terrifying domain
pressed down upon him with such might that he was only able to fly
very, very slowly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning,
in contrast, was able to fly at maximum speed. He arrived in just a
moment, and his terrifying sword-light descended as well. Once again
the most terrifying offensive Dao in all the Chaosverse, the Eternal
Omega Sword Dao, revealed its deadly brilliance. Strengthened by
Ning’s perfect mana, it had only become even more powerful than the
past. This Sithe Exalt was tougher than the previous one, but it
still only took Ning a total of twenty-six strikes to slay him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
turned his gaze towards a bald and muscular Sithe Exalt off in the
distance. That Sithe Exalt instantly started to panic. “Run,
everyone! Run!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Ning quickly sped towards the man. Slash! His sword-light hammered
the Sithe Exalt from afar, and the heavily-wounded Exalt just barely
survived it and charged into the formation. By now, the other five
had all entered the formation as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
goodness we made it inside.” The six lucky survivors all felt a
sense of fear wrack their hearts. The Exalts glanced at each other,
their eyes filled with joy at having survived. That had been utterly
terrifying! They were supposed to be Autarchs, but here in this
Chaosverse they had been weakened so dramatically that they were at
most comparable to the Blazesun Ruler in power. This was the natural
disadvantage all invaders faced – they would be suppressed and
prevented from using even a wisp of the Dao’s power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
won’t be able to break through the formation so easily. We’re
safe inside here.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“For
now, we’re saved.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
did our best, but we weren’t able to carry out Iyerre’s orders,”
the Sithe Exalts said to each other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Look
over there!” the black-haired Sithe Exalt suddenly cried out
fearfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Two
of them had perished, but the six of them were still more-or-less in
control over the entire temple and were able to keep the eight
revolutions formation active. Their control over the formation
allowed them to clearly see what was happening outside… and they
saw Ning transform to become absolutely towering in size, on par with
the entire temple itself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
titanic Ning was now far larger than many chaos planets. He was in
three-headed, six-armed form, and his six Northbow swords had
increased in size to match.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“DIE!”
the titanic Ning roared furiously, sending his six gargantuan
Northbow swords descending like the punishment of the heavens towards
the formation protecting the temple.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
being lucky enough to escape once, Ning wasn’t going to be so
foolish as to dive back inside! However, he wasn’t going to let the
Sithe off either.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
far as the other Autarchs, Autarch Titanos had been forced to
sacrifice an avatar to allow Autarch Ekong to escape, and Ekong
himself suffered heavy injuries; he was in no condition to keep
tussling against the Sithe Exalts. Autarch Stonerule had merely used
his avatar to set up a few formations to seal that temple away,
making it impossible for them to escape. Autarch Stonerule didn’t
dare to use his avatar to actually enter the temple and fight them
there.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was the only exception. He had enough power to continue fighting
against and killing these Sithe Exalts! This was because he was
actually capable of defeating even the most powerful formations they
had thrown at him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! Ning sent the six colossal Northbow swords crashing down
with all his power. The outermost dimension protecting the eight
revolutions formation was destroyed in just three seconds, but the
formation quickly began to regenerate and rebuild the destroyed
dimension.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
good. He already knows how to solve the eight revolutions formation,
and there are only six of us left. It’s hard for just six of us to
keep the entire thing active. The formation is going to be much less
stable than before!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hold
on for as long as we can!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Keep
it stable, men!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
eight revolutions formation has many different worlds within it. It
will take him time to destroy them one-by-one, while the six of us
can continue to remake new ones. After attacking for a while, Emperor
Darknorth will probably give up.” The Sithe Exalts clung onto this
faint hope as they struggled to defend.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
was no way Ning would spare them. He continued to use all of his
power to furiously assail the formation with his six Northbow swords,
destroying one world after another. New worlds were quickly reborn,
but this was costing the Sithe an enormous amount of energy!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
short while later, a figure flew over towards Ning from afar. This
was Autarch Mogg’s avatar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
Autarch Mogg’s avatar had actually arrived long ago, but he hadn’t
dared to intervene by going inside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
Mogg! Perfect timing,” Ning laughed. “Give me a hand. It doesn’t
matter what techniques you use, just hammer away at the formation
with all your power.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Sure.”
Autarch Mogg’s body transformed to become absolutely towering in
size, and he manifested a total of six arms as well, each of which
wielded a long and slender saber. He began to furiously assail the
temple’s formation alongside Ning! Ning understood the flaws within
the worlds and so his attacks had already put the formation under
incredible stress. Now that another Autarch-class combatant had
joined him, the stress was further amplified. The worlds began to
crumble even faster than before.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Now,
a world was crumbling every two seconds. One world after another
shattered before their blows…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’re
almost at the point where we can’t keep up with how fast they break
our worlds.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Our
energy stores are almost gone.” The Sithe Exalts were filled with
despair. If they were at full power, they could at least use the
spacetime formation or other formations to protect themselves once
the eight revolutions formation broke apart, but they had virtually
exhausted their energy stores in their attempts to first trap and
then kill Ning. Now, Ning and Mogg were forcing them to use up their
final bits of energy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’re
finished.” Their faces were filled with despair.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! The final worlds were broken apart, causing the six Sithe
Exalts to abandon all hope. As the remnants of the eight revolutions
formation began to crumble, they shared a final glance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
almighty Iyerre succeeds, those of us who died in battle might have a
chance to be revived.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! A series of explosions rang out, followed by the complete
collapse of the remnants of the eight revolutions formation, which
now lacked any controllers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Self-detonation?”
Mogg’s avatar gritted its teeth. “Why are the Sithe so loyal?
None of the Sithe Exalts we captured and tortured after the last war
have surrendered either.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Destroying
one of their temples counts as a victory in my book,” Ning said. He
waved his hand, drawing the remnants of the temple into his own
estate-world. “Let’s go.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
leave.” Mogg nodded. Riiip! The two tore through spacetime and left
side-by-side.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
was still flying through the Great Dark at maximum speed. He looked
calm, but flames could be seen flickering deep within his eyes. He
was eagerly looking forward to the moment where he could kill Emperor
Darknorth. By killing Emperor Darknorth, his victory over this war
would be secured!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The barefoot Iyerre came to a sudden halt within the empty darkness
of space... He stared off into the distance. He could sense the
deaths of each and every Sithe Exalt under his command, and his face
gradually grew increasingly unsightly to behold.</P>

Chapter 16: Rage</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
could sense that two of the Exalts in control of the Eight
Revolutions Spacetime Temple had just been slain. Clearly, the
situation had just taken a turn for the worse. Generally speaking, so
long as the formation protecting the temple was undamaged the Exalts
in control wouldn’t be killed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
short while later, he could sense that the other six Exalts had all
died as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
eight of them died. All they needed to do was trap Emperor Darknorth
for eighty-two days. They just needed to hold out for a few more
days… those useless idiots!” Iyerre felt rage blazing away at his
chest. He had been preparing for countless aeons. Victory had been
within his grasp… but at the most critical moment, his servants had
been unable to keep Emperor Darknorth confined. How could he not be
angered by this?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
I can’t kill Emperor Darknorth, I’ll have to switch to the second
plan and start killing off the other Autarchs one-by-one.” Iyerre
nodded slowly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was a more difficult prospect. Killing Emperor Darknorth would have
given him a 99% chance of success. Now that Ning had escaped, his
chances of success had just dropped sharply. Still, he remained
confident in his overall chances. He knew what forces he had
available and what his opponents were capable of, which was why he
felt so confident.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
suddenly waved his hand. Whoosh! Three figures suddenly appeared by
his side. Their auras were all tremendously powerful, far more
powerful than the auras of ordinary Sithe Exalts. All three of them
appeared humanoid, and it looked as though two were male while one
was female. The first man was dressed in black robes, while the
second was dressed in red robes. As for the woman, she was dressed in
dazzlingly beautiful silver robes and had a soul-stirring smile on
her face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Iyerre.”
The three bowed fractionally to show respect, but they addressed him
simply as ‘Iyerre’ rather than giving him the title of ‘almighty
Iyerre’ as most Sithe Exalts did.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is now time for the three of you to take action,” Iyerre said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
need to remember your promise,” the black-robed man said
sinisterly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry. After this battle is over, I’ll give you your freedom and
also give you treasures as a form of thanks. My master himself has
personally attested to this. Are you really worried that I would go
back on my word?” Iyerre said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three traded glances, then nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Starting
today, we shall operate in two groups,” Iyerre said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?
What’s this? You won’t be needing us to help you against Emperor
Darknorth after all? Oh, I know. Those useless subordinates of yours
weren’t able to tie him down for long enough, right?” the
silver-robed woman laughed. The two men next to her had mocking
smiles on their faces as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
frowned slightly, then continued: “Yes. They weren’t able to tie
him down. Emperor Darknorth has already escaped! Our only choice is
to carry out our second plan. The four of us will work separately,
with you three in one team and me by myself. The cultivators don’t
even know that we exist, so if we are careful we might just be able
to ambush and kill two of their leaders at once.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Agreed.”
The three all nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Remember,
once we separate you need to hide behind the treasure I gave you.
Don’t reveal any hint of your aura at all. Once the Chaosverse
discovers any traces of your auras, the cultivator leaders will also
be instantly warned as to how dangerous you are,” Iyerre said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
was at such a high level of enlightenment that he could cut off all
detection from the Chaosverse by himself, but the Sithe Exalts and
the three people before him could not. Thus, they had to use the
treasure which Iyerre had given them! This was the reason why Ning
and the others hadn’t noticed any of the hidden dimensions prior to
them disgorging their contents at the start of the war.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry. We won’t make such foolish mistakes,” the red-robed man
smirked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is your first time entering a different Chaosverse. It is best to be
cautious, as you are unable to use the power of the Dao here. You’ll
be much weaker than you are used to,” Iyerre warned. These three
weren’t his subordinates, and so he could not command them. All he
could do was offer them warnings, for fear of them making a mistake
and revealing themselves before they managed to kill a native
Autarch. If that happened, this war would become even more difficult
to win.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
cultivator Autarchs were in their own Chaosverse and backed by the
boundless power of the Dao. All of them were mighty beyond measure,
and the only way to kill them was to catch them off-guard! Once
Iyerre revealed himself, the cultivator leaders would be able to
quickly flee and hide from him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for Emperor Darknorth… he was the most powerful of the local
cultivators. If Iyerre had to fight him by himself, victory was far
from assured. Iyerre was still being suppressed by this Chaosverse,
after all! That was why he had brought his second trump card as well.
He had been planning to work alongside those three powerful experts.
Together, they would’ve spelled certain doom to Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
of course… that was only if Ning had remained trapped inside the
temple! Outside the temple, Ning could flee whenever he wanted to. It
was very difficult to kill anyone who was of the same level of
strength.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
head out,” Iyerre instructed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
An ordinary-looking realmship suddenly appeared next to him with a
Hegemon in control of it. This Hegemon was a Sithe descendant who had
been born into this Chaosverse, and so his aura was identical to that
of an ordinary cultivator’s.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Hegemon was responsible for control of the realmship and sending it
hurtling through the Chaosverse, while the three experts would remain
hidden within a treasure the Hegemon carried.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
good.” Iyerre watched as the realmship departed, cold light shining
in his eyes. “Thus far, the cultivators have only lost a few
avatars. None of them have actually perished! I’ll wager that they
have no idea that the temples were only meant to confuse them, making
them lower their guard once they ‘knew’ what they were up
against. Those weren’t my real trump cards at all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come,
then. Let’s see who shall be the first ‘Autarch’ I kill once I
reveal my presence.” Iyerre waved his hand, causing a white lotus
to appear in his palm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
Iyerre’s energy flowed into the white lotus, quickly spreading out
to cover an extremely vast area that was a hundred times greater than
the area Ning could scan using his godsense! Iyerre could accomplish
this because he had vastly surpassed all the others in terms of
insight, even though he was being suppressed by the Chaosverse. As
for the white lotus, it was an incredibly valuable scanning treasure
which his master had helped him forge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So…
who shall be the first to die?” Iyerre smiled as he stepped into a
spatial rift, hurtling through spacetime. He moved to one region
after another, wandering through many different regions. Ever since
the temples had appeared, the cultivator Autarchs had stopped
attacking in person and had only sent out their avatars to do battle.
Thus, actually locating one of them was no easy feat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
flowed on, one day after another. In the end, Autarch Skyfeeder and
Autarch Bolin’s trapped avatars all ended up perishing in battle.
However, the temples ended up being trapped by the other Autarchs who
cast giant formations around them, making it impossible for them to
flee!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thus
far, the Sithe had revealed a total of five temples. These temples
had cost the cultivators three Autarch avatars belonging to Bolin,
Skyfeeder and Titanos. As for the temples themselves? Ning had
captured one, while the other four had been sealed and rendered
immobile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
cultivators had lost three peak power avatars, but they quickly began
to remake new ones, even though the new ones would be significantly
weaker for quite some time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Over
two months after Ning had escaped the Eight Revolutions Spacetime
Temple.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Iyerre’s muscular form suddenly exited a spacetime rift and
appeared within a realmverse. He continued to hold that white lotus
in his hands as he carefully scanned the vast area around him. “Eh?”
Iyerre revealed a look of delight.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">During
the past two months, he had been searching for the Autarchs in a
manner that was reminiscent of looking for a needle in a haystack.
Thankfully, he was able to warp through spacetime just as fast as the
Autarchs were, while his scanning treasure completely surpassed
Autarch-level capabilities! During the past two months, he had
managed to discover Autarch Stonerule’s avatar… but to reveal
himself in exchange for just an avatar? There was no way Iyerre would
make that type of trade!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
finally found one of the actual Autarchs. Hm… this aura seems
familiar. I encountered it countless times over the aeons. Isn’t
this Autarch Mogg, who stood guard over our ‘sealed’ lands for
all those years?” Iyerre revealed a smile. “Perfect. Autarch
Mogg… I’ll use your life and your blood to anoint my war-banner.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
mountain peak which was floating in space. There were some
ordinary-looking log cabins at the top of this mountain, and a tall,
skinny, black-robed figure was seated in the lotus position within
one of those cabins. His face was covered with scales, and his eyes
were shut.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
temples were all quite troublesome to deal with, and so the Autarchs
had chosen to draw back all of their true bodies and only permitted
their avatars to roam the outside world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
mountain peak might look ordinary, but it had been personally
fashioned by Autarch Mogg for him to cultivate in. Without his
permission, not even the other Autarchs would be able to approach
without him noticing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But…
right at this moment a barefoot and gray-robed figure suddenly
appeared before the mountain peak. This figure had a benevolent,
sympathetic smile on his face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was Iyerre!</P>

Chapter 17: Iyerre Vs Mogg</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
stood there in empty space, staring at the floating mountain before
him and the clearly visible log cabin at the very top. Given his
abilities, he was able to sense that within the log cabin sat Autarch
Mogg.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Generally
speaking, for someone like Autarch Mogg, it was impossible for him
not to notice when someone was staring at him. However, Iyerre was
able to do so without him noticing anything at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch
Mogg of the cultivators. He really spent quite a bit of effort
putting this mountain together. It is filled with all sorts of seals
and scanners.” Iyerre smiled as he continued to inspect the place.
Autarch Mogg’s various warning systems and barriers were perhaps
quite troublesome for other major powers on his level, but they were
nothing more than parlor tricks to someone like Iyerre.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
was able to see immediately through the many flaws of these defenses.
This was due to the far superior level of insight he possessed! He
had been able to create things like the Annihilation Hive and the
formation temples, all of which had stunned Ji Ning and Titanos.
Everyone had been certain that only a Lord of Chaos could’ve
created such incredible edifices.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the others certainly weren’t able to create such things, but
finding a few weak spots and exploiting them was much easier. Even
so, only Autarch Titanos had been able to devise the reverse-vortex
formation, while Ning had spent many days before managing to overcome
the Eight Revolutions Spacetime Temple.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was a testament to the difference in insight between them!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
the Autarchs had set down those many layers of seals around the heart
of the Sithelands, they have felt that the Sithe would be unable to
escape… but in truth, those seals had been an utter joke to Iyerre,
who was able to bypass them with ease. The only reason he pretended
his forces were sealed away was to ensure that the cultivators would
lessen their vigilance against him. In truth, he had long ago sent
his countless Hegemons and Emperors to the various secret dimensions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
mountain might be able to stop the Autarchs, but it cannot bar my
path.” Iyerre smiled as he walked closer towards it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
His entire body became vaguely incorporeal and semi-translucent. He
slowly strolled forwards, moving towards the mountain peak and then
climbing up it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
many barriers atop the mountain were completely incapable of barring
his path. Autarch Mogg was highly skilled in the Dao of Space, and
his various seals and barriers were all dimensional in nature.
However, Iyerre was using an even more profound application of the
mysteries of space to become part of ordinary space itself, making
the barriers completely ineffective against him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
walking for ten seconds, Iyerre came to a sudden halt. He frowned
slightly as he stared at the distant log cabin. “A Dao Domain
field?” This was a bit more troubling. Dao Domains were also known
as Essence Domains. Ning had his Sword Dao Domain, while Autarch Mogg
had his Space Daobirth Essence Domain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was a time of war. Although Autarch Mogg’s true body was not taking
part in combat right now, he still vigilantly kept his domain up at
all times. He didn’t put too much effort into it, but it was still
enough to cover half of the mountain. Any enemies who penetrated this
mountain would be instantly discovered by his domain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
power of his domain comes from the Chaosverse itself; it represents a
domain formed by the power of the prime essences. I can avoid the
prime essences and make it impossible for them to detect me, but I’d
be discovered as soon as I entered the reach of his domain.” Iyerre
pondered this question. “Suppressed by this Chaosverse, I’m
unable to use any of the Dao’s power at all. I’m stronger than
these native Autarchs, but not by that much. I don’t have the
overwhelming advantage that I should.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was why he had brought three mighty helpers when he had gone off to
fight Ning. Now that he knew Ning had escaped, Iyerre had parted ways
from the three. They were each responsible for killing one Autarch…
but now that they had separated, Iyerre ‘only’ had a 80% chance
of killing Autarch Mogg, who was even weaker than Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
hidden in the darkness. He has no idea how strong I am. I’ll
definitely be able to kill him in this battle.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Time
to attack.” Iyerre began to make his move. He reached out with his
ivory-skinned right hand, penetrating the Space Daobirth Essence
Domain and sending a series of gentle, comfortable ripples straight
into the mind of Autarch Mogg, who was still seated in the log cabin.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hrm?”
Autarch Mogg suddenly felt very comfortable and at peace. This gentle
feeling caused a hint of a smile to naturally appear around his lips.
Freedom… release… the glorious joy brought by the light filled
his every thought, banishing all his worries and concerns.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
The alabaster hand shot out with incredible speed, piercing through
the various spatial barriers and the impediment of the Essence Domain
to strike towards the log cabin.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
domain had clearly been intruded upon… but right now, Autarch Mogg
only felt a sense of relief and release, as though he had never been
as free and relaxed as he was right now. “It’s all in the past
now. All my worries and concerns are over… wait. No. The war
against the Sithe just started. We’re in the middle of a war! How
could I possibly be truly relaxed and carefree?” Autarch Mogg
quickly came back to his senses, and when he did he immediately ‘saw’
that hand pierce through his domain. By now, it had already reached
the log cabin.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
alabaster hand passed straight through the cabin itself, not damaging
it in the slightest. A tremendous sense of danger filled Autarch
Mogg’s mind, terrorizing him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
could I have ignored it when it passed through my domain? How could I
have been drawn into a state of complete relaxation without even
realizing it?” Autarch Mogg was utterly terrified by the
implications of this. Being trapped in an illusion was one thing, but
this had been no illusion! His spirit and his thoughts had been
manipulated without him even realizing it, even though he was an
Autarch! He had only come back to his senses after sensing the
obvious contradiction of him being at ‘peace’ during a time of
war.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Who?
Who did this?!” Autarch Mogg had no time to analyze things. He
immediately manifested six arms, clasping a saber in each hand and
using them to launch a marvelous coordinated attack against that
alabaster hand. His saber-light flashed like dimensional edges,
moving with inscrutable speed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
alabaster hand ‘danced’ towards him in such a gentle, beautiful,
and graceful manner that Autarch Mogg’s spirit was shaken once
more. Flick! The fingers of that hand gently brushed against the
saber-light, causing it to be dispersed and redirected elsewhere.
Flick! Flick! Two of Mogg’s other sabers were pushed aside as well.
The alabaster hand had used almost no power to defend, but none of
Autarch Mogg’s attacks were able to land on it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Mogg’s
three remaining sabers spun in concert to form a tight defense around
him out of saber-light that was linked together with space itself. It
was as though an independent dimension was standing in front of him,
helping him block.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiip!
The giant hand suddenly became bright and sharp, tearing past two of
the sabers. Mogg’s defensive saber-arts were his pride and joy, but
they were completely unable to defend against this giant hand. As for
the dimensional barrier he had erected before him, it was instantly
pierced through as the giant hand stabbed at Autarch Mogg’s chest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Run!”
Autarch Mogg was truly stunned and terrified. The seven Autarchs had
often sparred against each other and held Dao debates with each
other, but not even the most powerful (Ji Ning) had been able to gain
such a major advantage over him in their fights.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
person is significantly more powerful than even Darknorth!” Autarch
Mogg exclaimed to himself in amazement.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
he retreated, the light from the giant hand had already reached out
to stab him in his chest. Autarch Mogg could sense a sharp,
penetrative force dig deep into his body, causing him to vomit out a
mouthful of blood. He hurriedly summoned the mana in his body to
resist this attack, but the invading energy was extremely difficult
to deal with. In the end, Autarch Mogg was only able to cancel out
the invading energy with his mana by throwing an enormous amount of
energy at it. This had actually cost him more than 30% of his total
power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
single clash had quickly resulted in him being badly wounded!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Autarch Mogg was sent flying into the walls of the log cabin from
this blow. The log cabin instantly blew apart, and even the barriers
surrounding the area began to tremble. The surrounding area
collapsed, transforming into a dark region of primordial chaos… and
from within the darkness emerged a gray-robed, barefoot man who
strode through the collapsing dimension with ease, completely
unaffected.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Who
are you?!” Autarch Mogg shouted frantically. In all his battles
against the Sithe, he had never once encountered any individual who
held such a terrifying advantage in power over him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
name is Iyerre. I’m here to kill you.” Iyerre smiled, but he
moved incredibly fast. He gave Autarch Mogg no reprieve at all,
charging towards him right away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flee.”
Autarch Mogg knew that he had just run into a terrifyingly strong
foe. If this battle continued, he’d probably end up dying here.
Without hesitation, he chose to immediately flee!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
Iyerre saw that Autarch Mogg was trying to warp through spacetime to
escape, he tapped his foot downwards. “Freeze.” An invisible
ripple sprang out, completely sealing off spacetime in the area
around them, making it impossible to warp away!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
actually even more formidable than I am when it comes to the Dao of
Space?!” Autarch Mogg could quickly sense how spacetime had been
locked away. He himself was also capable of suppressing spacetime,
but he wouldn’t be able to do it this easily or to this effect. He
couldn’t help but feel amazed as he transformed into a streak of
light and began to physically flee.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
frowned as he watched Autarch Mogg flee: “These native Autarchs are
able to use the boundless power of the Dao. In my homeland, I could
exterminate these creatures with the wave of a hand… but in their
own Chaosverse, killing them is really quite difficult.”</P>

Chapter 18: Golden Bridge of Freedom</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">An
ordinary chaos planet. A white-robed Ji Ning was seated in the lotus
position atop a boulder, surrounded by a 100x temporal acceleration
field. He was trying to deconstruct and solve the formations
protecting the temple which had been sealed away by Autarch
Stonerule! It remained a source of potential trouble and Ning felt
that it was best to get rid of it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning’s face suddenly tightened. He could sense that a new,
terrifying danger had just appeared far in the distance. This danger
was so great that Ning could sense his heart clenching. It was every
bit as dangerous as the Annihilation Hive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
going on?” Ning was puzzled by this, as were the other Autarchs.
Everyone could sense this terrifying new threat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
soon as Iyerre had attacked Mogg, the prime essences of the
Chaosverse had immediately detected and locked onto him. This was
their first time ‘finding’ him and realizing what a terrifying
threat he posed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Perhaps
he wasn’t an immediate a threat as the Annihilation Hive had been,
but he was an expert who had reached incredible levels of insight. So
long as he was alive, he would cause endless troubles for this
Chaosverse. He could even create new Annihilation Hives! Strictly
speaking, he was more dangerous than anything else around.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly,
Ning could sense a message coming from Autarch Mogg: “I just
suffered an attack from a Sithe expert. He attacked me by himself,
and he was able to completely bypass all of the formations and seals
I set down around myself. He even managed to invade my domain while
influencing me so that I didn’t notice in the slightest. Thankfully
I was able to recover in time, but even so he was able to deal me a
heavy injury in our first head-on clash. He’s too strong, far
stronger than me and significantly stronger than even Darknorth. If I
had to fight him head-on, I’d probably die after just a few rounds
of battle.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!”
Ning was shocked, as were the other Autarchs who were receiving this
information at the same time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Since
when had the Sithe become so powerful as to be able to overwhelm an
Autarch in sole combat? In all these years, it was an ironclad rule
that Autarchs were completely invincible in sole combat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
type of treasures did he use?” Ning immediately asked. Autarch
Titanos and the others were asking the exact same question as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nothing.
He didn’t use any treasures at all. He didn’t even use a weapon.
His hand alone dealt me a grave wound! And… he said his name is
‘Iyerre’!” Autarch Mogg said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
didn’t even use a weapon, but was still able to heavily injure Mogg
in just one clash?” Ning was stunned. “I can’t believe such a
powerful figure managed to remain hidden for so long. He must have
been biding his time for aeons… and now that he’s revealed
himself, he’s definitely going to launch an all-out attack. Why
doesn’t he use a weapon? Is it perhaps because weapons are
essentially meaningless to him? Or is it perhaps that his hands ARE
his weapons? Either way, he’s relying on his own power!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
information which Autarch Mogg had sent over caused many different
thoughts to flicker through Ning’s mind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sithe are suppressed by our Chaosverse and unable to use any of the
power of the Dao at all! For him to be this powerful while
suppressed, how powerful would he be if he could use the Dao?” Ning
mused to himself, “There’s no way he’s an ordinary Autarch, nor
can he be merely an Omega Emperor! It is highly likely that he is
actually an Autarch of an Omega Dao!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">An
Omega Autarch! This was the only possibility Ning could come up with
which could explain this person’s strength. Ning wasn’t the only
one to come to this conclusion; the other Autarchs did as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, they had suspected this possibility long ago. They had long
postulated the possibility that the real instigator of the Sithe
incursion was an Omega Autarch, but all of them had believed that
someone who had reached such an invincible level as the Sithe Lord of
Chaos wouldn’t have taken the risk of entering a ‘foreign’
Chaosverse. Once he came in, he would lose his connection to his own
Chaosverse and be suppressed by the ‘foreign’ Chaosverse,
resulting in him being so dramatically weakened that he could very
well perish.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the outside world, a Lord of Chaos was completely invincible. Why
take the risk? But now, a Sithe named Iyerre had appeared. Could it
be that he was a second Omega Autarch of the Sithe Chaosverse?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
person named Iyerre,” Autarch Mogg continued, “Is overwhelmingly
powerful. I’m absolutely certain that he is an Omega Autarch. I can
think of no other possibilities! He’s reached incredible levels of
insight and is able to suppress spacetime with ease, and he’s even
better at it than me. My insights into the mysteries of space are
like a joke to him. They are completely ineffective. He’s
definitely surpassed me in the Dao of Space!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“An
Omega Autarch!” Ning and the others instantly were certain of this.
This ‘Iyerre’ had a higher level of insight than the Autarchs and
was superior to Mogg in the Dao of Space, which was Mogg’s
specialty. He had to be an Omega Autarch!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Be
careful, Mogg,” Ning sent back. There was nothing they could do to
help, because they were all too far away. It would all be up to
Autarch Mogg himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Mogg was continuing to flee through space.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch
Mogg!” the pursuing Iyerre suddenly roared from behind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
An invisible wave of force instantly surged into Autarcoh Mogg’s
body. Autarch Mogg felt as though the world around him had changed,
transforming into a dazzlingly beautiful ocean while he himself had
become a seagull soaring through the skies above it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break!”
Autarch Mogg had a perfect Dao-heart and a powerful truesoul. This
mighty shout allowed his tremendous willpower to instantly tear the
illusion to shreds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
casting of the illusion and the breaking of the illusion had happened
almost instantaneously. “Your illusions are a bit tougher than
Stonerule’s, but they still don’t amount to much,” Autarch Mogg
replied, his voice echoing in the emptiness of space.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn.”
Iyerre frowned when he saw this. In a foreign Chaosverse, he was
unable to use the power of the Dao and was suppressed as well, but in
at least one area he remained at peak power – illusions! This was
because illusions were aimed directly at the soul and truesoul. The
greater your insights into the art of illusions were, the more
powerful your illusions would become. The Dao had little to do with
it. Alas, Iyerre was an Omega Autarch but had not reached Autarchy
through the Dao of Illusions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
Ning for example became an Omega Autarch, it would be through the
Omega Sword Dao. His specialty would still be the sword! The same was
true for Iyerre, who was skilled in the Dao of Light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
won’t be able to escape.” Iyerre gritted his teeth, unleashing
one of his ultimate attacks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Anywhere
else, he could use any techniques as often as he pleased. Here in
this Chaosverse, however, he had to consider how much energy these
techniques would take up. His energy consumption was commensurate to
his vast insights, and replenishing energy was extremely difficult
for him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Omnipresent
Light!” Iyerre’s body suddenly began to release a vast amount of
light. Countless rays of light soared out in every single direction,
illuminating every part of the vast void around them. The rays of
light illuminated even Autarch Mogg himself, and when they shone upon
him he felt them pressing down upon him with terrifying power, trying
to force him to kneel down. This tremendous pressure caused him to
slow down dramatically.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was the most powerful domain-type technique which Iyerre had created
after becoming an Omega Autarch. Wherever his light reached, all had
to submit to him!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the outside world, his light alone could actually kill ordinary
Autarchs. Here in this Chaosverse, it was dramatically weakened and
so only served to generate a suppressive effect.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
could there be such a powerful binding effect? It’s far stronger
than any of my domains!” Autarch Mogg was shocked. The suppress
effective was so powerful that his speed had been nearly cut in half.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Iyerre flew towards Autarch Mogg, his entire body glowing with
boundless light and a sympathetic smile on his face. “Why must you
fight this, Autarch Mogg? You must be tired.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Truly
impressive, Iyerre. You should be an Omega Autarch of the Sithe race.
I’m thoroughly impressed. Even without being able to use one whit
of the power of the Dao, you still possess incredible power.”
Autarch Mogg smiled coldly. “But this is our homeland. Do you
really think you can kill me? Hmph!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
An enormous golden bridge that was a million kilometers long suddenly
appeared behind Autarch Mogg. The bridge even had a refined,
three-story tower next to it, and Autarch Mogg was standing right at
the entrance to the tower. He smiled coldly as he stared at the
distant Iyerre: “Iyerre, dare you step onto my bridge?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
is this?” Iyerre’s face turned grim. He could clearly sense that
this vast golden bridge was emanating an aura of terrifying power,
power which came from the prime essences of this Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
Sithe have your trump cards, but so do we! Did you think we had none?
Did you think we spent all these countless aeons just waiting for
death like fools?” Autarch Mogg stood there atop his bridge at the
entrance to the tower: “This should be the final, last-gasp attempt
by you Sithe to take over our Chaosverse. We had been planning to
reveal the Golden Bridge of Freedom during the final battle, but you
unexpectedly drove me to the brink of death and forced me to reveal
it now.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Golden
Bridge of Freedom? It uses the power of the prime essences of this
Chaosverse…” Iyerre had an ugly look on his face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.
As you suspect, it is modeled after your Daoguard Towers!” Autarch
Mogg smiled coldly. “We’ve been analyzing your Daoguard Towers
for countless aeons now. Although the Golden Bridge of Freedom isn’t
quite as marvelous as your Daoguard Towers, it is still able to make
use of some of the power of the Quintessence.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
cultivator leaders had known for many years that calamity could
spring upon them anew, and so they had been laboring without pause to
prepare for this day. A Golden Bridge of Freedom had some of the
effects of a Daoguard Tower. While one was standing atop the bridge,
one would be virtually invincible. This was one of the trump cards
the Autarchs had been preparing for this war.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_44_Chapter_019__The"></A>
Chapter 19: Victory</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Only
the power of the Chaosverse itself was truly boundless and without
limit. When Ji Ning had visited the essence wellspring of the
Blazesun Domain, he had discovered that its energies vastly surpassed
that of any Autarch’s! And that was just the tip of the iceberg
when compared to the Chaosverse as a whole. The Chaosverse was so
powerful that just attempting to bind it, even without it fighting
back, would result in death to Ning and the other Autarchs. Trying to
force something like this would result in the collapse of the
truesoul!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Its
power was simply unimaginable. Compared to the Chaosverse as a whole,
the power over the Dao which Ning or the Autarchs could wield was
like a drop of water in a vast sea.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Daoguard Tower was something which could allow powerful experts to
make use of a greater amount of the Chaosverse’s power! Daoguard
Towers were exquisitely designed. After the Autarchs had acquired
several Daoguard Towers from the Dawn War, they had spent many years
analyzing them before finally creating similar treasures known as
Golden Bridges of Freedom which had 30% of a Daoguard Tower’s
power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
native cultivators already had the advantage of fighting on home
turf. Now that they had Golden Bridges of Freedom, their defensive
prowess was dramatically strengthened.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come
on, Iyerre, oh mighty Omega Autarch! Come and do your worst. Show me
just how tough you are! I am in my own homeland and standing atop my
Golden Bridge. If you can still kill me, I’ll gladly admit defeat!”
Autarch Mogg stood at the entrance to the tower, glaring daggers at
the distant Iyerre.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
Golden Bridge of Freedom which is based on our Daoguard Towers, eh?”
Iyerre quickly regained his usual equanimity. He smiled coldly:
“Fine. Let’s just see how powerful you are when standing on your
Golden Bridge!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Iyerre put his palms together as though in prayer, causing an utterly
dazzling streak of light to appear between them. The light slowly
grew brighter and brighter, as though it was the very essence of all
light itself! As for his palms, they had become the sole source of
light in the entire area and was far more dazzling than the Solar
Star of the Three Realms had ever been.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
simply stood there calmly in space, his palms folded in prayer while
emanating increasingly brilliant levels of light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
building up power!” Autarch Mogg’s heart was pounding as he
stared from atop the Golden Bridge. This strike was clearly going to
be far more powerful than the previous one.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
strike could be described as the most powerful strike which Iyerre
was capable of. However, it did have a flaw. It wasn’t very agile
and could only be used as a devastating frontal assault! Even worse,
in this foreign Chaosverse it took him a bit of time to build up
power even when he was simply drawing upon his own energy reserves.
If he had tried to do this earlier when he had ambushed Mogg, the
power build up alone would’ve startled Mogg and sent him fleeing.
As for during his pursuit of Mogg, the two were flying far too fast
and there was no way he could build up the energies necessary for
this technique.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn.”
Autarch Mogg frowned. “In the end, the Golden Bridge of Freedom
remains a pale shadow of a true Daoguard Tower. Its only advantage is
that it is mobile while Daoguard Towers are completely immobile, but
even so it moves very slowly.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
vast golden bridges were slow and not very agile. They were primarily
used to keep their occupants alive, which meant that Autarch Mogg’s
only choice was to watch as Iyerre built up strength and wait for the
attack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for putting away the Golden Bridge and then fleeing once more?
Without it, he would die even more quickly!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Exterminate!”
Iyerre suddenly roared. His left hand drew backwards while his right
hand struck outwards. Instantly, all of the power from those two
incomparably dazzling hands of light became concentrated in his right
palm, causing it to glow even more brightly than before! The mighty
presence and aura of this attack alone was enough to render Autarch
Mogg speechless. If he tried to take this attack head-on by himself,
he would definitely be crushed to death by it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
empty void of space itself seemed to shudder and moan in fear as that
giant right palm of incandescent light reached out towards Mogg.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
happening!” Autarch Mogg immediately summoned his Golden Bridge,
sending it flying upwards to block for him. Alas, while the giant
palm wasn’t very agile it was still far more agile than the
enormous golden bridge. It was easily able to dodge past the blocking
bridge and smashed straight past it. The golden bridge had an awesome
aura of the Dao protecting it, but the giant palm smashed straight
through the barrier like it was nothing and continued straight for
Autarch Mogg.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Golden
Bridge!” Autarch Mogg roared loudly. The tower behind him had six
corners and six highly noticeable windows. The tower suddenly emitted
six rays of prismatic light filled with the entire bridge’s
boundless power and Dao, using them to push back at the giant golden
palm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! The six ribbons of light did their best to push the palm
back, but they were unable to do so. In the end, all they could do
was to bind themselves around the giant palm like chains. The giant
palm continued to press onwards, but it was clearly much slower than
before.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Without
the bridge, I might not be able to withstand you… but standing atop
it, you can do nothing to me!” Autarch Mogg manifested a total of
six arms, each wielding a long saber, then used all of his power to
attack. Countless dimensional ripples filled the air around him,
merging together to form a single giant dimensional blade that
smashed against the giant golden hand head-on.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Explosions
rang out unabated. The giant golden palm quickly dimmed, then
retracted backwards.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Mogg was smashed backwards against the tower. He vomited out a
mouthful of blood, but a crazed smile was on his face: “Haha,
Iyerre, you aren’t strong enough!” Although he was injuried, he
was able to recover before finishing his words.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for the distant Iyerre, he felt a sense of pity in his heart. He had
consumed an enormous amount of power to unleash his most powerful
attack. Still, it had been worth it. Now he knew exactly how strong
the Golden Bridges of Freedom were.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
bad.” Iyerre smiled. Whoosh! He retreated backwards, then
disappeared without a trace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Mogg finally let out a sigh of relief. Iyerre had put him under a
tremendous amount of pressure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the others were all anxiously awaiting news from Autarch Mogg.
All of them were worried about him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
fine, I’m fine!” Autarch Mogg quickly sent word back to them.
Only then did they let out sighs of relief.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
Iyerre fellow really was powerful. Even though I had the Golden
Bridge of Freedom, he was still able to overwhelm me! However, he
wasn’t able to actually kill me. When he saw this, he chose to
leave instead of continuing the fight,” Autarch Mogg said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Tell
us a bit about the fight against Iyerre,” Autarch Titanos said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well.” Autarch Mogg began to narrate the battle in detail. Ning and
the others listened attentively, working together to analyze what had
happened. In truth, it had been a fairly simple battle. Iyerre had
only struck a few times in an effort to conserve energy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can’t believe Omega Autarchs are still this powerful when they are
being suppressed and unable to use any of the power of the Dao.”
Autarch Titanos let out an amazed sigh. “So the Sithe invaders are
definitely led by an Omega Autarch. This is terrible news… and
judging from how Iyerre simply left, it’s clear that he has other
tricks up his sleeve and hasn’t been driven to the brink just yet.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
can’t let our guard down until we win the final battle,” Autarch
Ekong said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
sorry, friends. I had no choice but to reveal the Golden Bridge of
Freedom. Now he knows our most powerful defensive technique,”
Autarch Mogg said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
had prepared some trump cards of their own for the final war, but the
Golden Bridge of Freedom was their strongest defensive trump card. If
even it had been unable to withstand Iyerre’s power, they would’ve
been in serious trouble.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
a war, using unexpected trump cards at a critical moment to catch an
opponent offguard could produce some truly incredible results! Thus,
trump cards generally were saved for the very end. When Ning and
Ekong had been trapped within their respective temples, they had
faced several dangerous situations but hadn’t been driven to the
point of revealing their Golden Bridges of Freedom.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
addition, those bridges had a weakness – they could only be used
for defensive purposes! Using them within the temples wouldn’t have
helped Ning or Ekong actually escape!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mogg,
if you didn’t use the Golden Bridge you would’ve died. Our side
would’ve lost two Autarch-class combatants! That would’ve been a
far greater loss,” Autarch Skyfeeder said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Be
careful, everyone. Iyerre has failed in his first attempt, but he’ll
probably prepare something even more deadly next time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
long as we keep the bridges active, they probably won’t be able to
do anything to us.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the darkness of space. Iyerre stood there in the void by himself, his
body covered with a layer of ripples which blocked the Chaosverse
from detecting him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
A blurry pillar of light appeared before him which slowly resolved
into a trio of figures. These were the three powerful subordinates he
had sent out earlier.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Iyerre,
why have you contacted us?” The two men and the woman looked at
Iyerre.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Have
you fought against any of the cultivator leaders yet?” Iyerre
asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’re
still searching for them. The Chaosverse is simply too large; just
finding them is a task in and of itself,” the silver-robed woman
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
need to warn you that they have something akin to a Daoguard Tower
they can use,” Iyerre said. “Trap them before attacking them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
The three were shocked by this news.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
nodded then broke the connection.</P>

Chapter 20: Grasslands</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Atop
a tall mountain located within a desolate, barren planet. At the peak
of this mountain there was a stone house. In front of the stone house
was a white-haired, dispirited-looking man who was seated by himself
and drinking some wine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was one of the most supreme leaders of this entire Chaosverse…
Autarch Bolin.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Desolation…
destruction…” The white-haired man stared at the vast world
before him. He suddenly splashed the wine in his cup towards the
world, sending it splattering outwards like a fine drizzle which
moistened the earth before him. Slowly, plants began to grow out from
the earth, including trees and grass which caused the planet to turn
green with life.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-haired man frowned slightly as he watched. “The color of
life… can it be that an Autarch is only able to control a single
Daobirth Essence?” He shook his head. “There should be at least a
tiny chance of controlling two.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
felt certain that he had already reached an incredibly high level of
insight into the cycle of life and death; in fact, it wasn’t too
far off from his Claw Daobirth Essence in terms of profundity. And
yet… no matter how he tried, he remained unable to form his Samsara
Daobirth Essence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Death
and life. Life is absolutely marvelous and intoxicating in its
grandeur.” Autarch Bolin watched as the planet transformed, smiling
respectfully as he watched life rise in all its awesome grandeur.
Suddenly, his face tightened and he turned to stare at the empty void
beyond the planet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
space around the chaos planet had suddenly changed. An enormous being
had just appeared within the empty space, and compared to it even the
chaos planet was nothing more than the size of this creature’s
fist. This creature looked like a giant gray bear, and it stared
coldly at the planet and Autarch Bolin with its single cyclopean eye.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“An
Autarch-class void dweller?” Autarch Bolin murmured softly to
himself. “And it seems spacetime has been sealed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Cultivator,
you shall be the first person I kill within this Chaosverse!” the
giant gray bear boomed loudly. It reached out with its giant paw to
swat at Bolin. These void dwellers were born with tremendous natural
gifts and they each had their own specialties. As for this giant
bear, its specialty lay in its terrifying raw strength. Of the
various Autarch-class void dwellers Iyerre had caught in the Infinite
Void, it was without a doubt the physically strongest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiiip!
The planet was surrounded and protected by many formations, but the
giant bear paw caused them all to instantly crumble.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Bolin stared at the incoming paw coldly, a giant golden bridge with a
tower on it appearing before him. Autarch Bolin himself moved to
stand in front of the tower.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was indeed the same type of protective treasure which Autarch Mogg
had used, a Golden Bridge of Freedom. Since its existence had already
been revealed, Autarch Bolin chose to use it right away as he could
sense that this was a dangerous situation he was in.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Die!”
The giant paw came crashing down upon the golden bridge, tearing
through its aura of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Playing
around with claws in front of me?” A hint of a cold smile flickered
across Autarch Bolin face as he manifested six arms. All six of his
hands arced into a claw and then tore at the giant furry bear paw
slamming down towards him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">These
strikes were so ferocious as to cause even the frozen spacetime
around them to twist. Autarch Bolin’s claws were filled with
unfathomable power. They seemed very ordinary, but they also seemed
to contain countless transformations within them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Autarch Bolin’s six claws clashed head-on against that giant bear’s
paw.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Bolin couldn’t help but take two steps backwards, while the
gigantic Autarch-class void bear stumbled backwards as well. It
stared at Autarch Bolin with some astonishment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
aren’t too shabby, cultivator. Die!” The giant bear began to go
berserk, roaring as it pounced at Bolin. It sent out consecutive
blows with its two giant paws, which came crashing down like two vast
celestial objects with so much pressure that even spacetime was
completely flattened. This attack was so powerful that Autarch Bolin
had no choice but to defend himself using the might of the Golden
Bridge of Freedom.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! The giant Autarch-class void bear continued to furiously
assault Autarch Bolin for three full seconds, but it remained unable
to do anything to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Vilesky,
you aren’t going to be able to kill this cultivator as long as he
is standing on that golden bridge,” a loud voice boomed out. “Give
up on trying to do it yourself. You need our help.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Bolin’s face tightened slightly as he turned to stare into the
distant void. He barked from the golden bridge, “Show yourselves!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
‘show yourselves’? You are ordering us around?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Do
you really think you are worthy of giving us orders?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
are too weak.” Multiple voices rang out from the empty space around
the world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Moments
later the vast void itself seemed to change, transforming into an
even vaster grasslands that had a white layer of clouds in the skies
above it. As for Autarch Bolin himself, he was now standing atop the
grasslands.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Autarch Bolin stared at the grasslands which had just appeared around
him. He inspected it closely, carefully attuning himself to the vital
energy contained within every single stalk of grass. “This is an
actual, real grassland?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
does it seem as though the grasslands extend off into infinite?”
Autarch Bolin inspected the world around him clearly. There were
clouds above him, but the grasslands seemed to have no end,
stretching off as far as he could see. Despite his power, he still
wasn’t able to see just how vast this world was! Was this a joke?
He could even see to the ends of a realmverse!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break!”
Autarch Bolin continued to stand atop his golden bridge as he reached
out to tear at the skies, seeking to tear them apart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash!
His two hands clawed at the layers of clouds. Autarch Bolin felt as
though the clouds were incredibly tenacious. He was able to tear
through a few of the clouds, but he wasn’t able to break through
all of them!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
refuse to believe this.” Autarch Bolin began to furiously attack
with all six arms, using them to tear at the clouds in the skies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was what the cultivator Autarchs usually did. They had such boundless
amounts of power that they didn’t fear exhaustion, and so using a
furious barrage of attacks to crush one’s foes was usually the best
method.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
the time needed to boil a kettle of tea, Autarch Bolin finally
managed to completely tear through the final layer of clouds, pulling
open a giant gaping hole in the skies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
The golden bridge beneath him rapidly shrank in size as he rode it
through the gaping hole.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
flying through the gaping hole, Autarch Bolin first stared downwards
at the many clouds he was standing upon, then upwards at the many
clouds which still filled the skies above him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly,
a hoarse voice filled the skies: “Haha, keep clawing your way
through. This isn’t like those puny ‘temples’! Although there
are only nine layers to this world of grass, each layer is thicker
than the last. You have no chance at all of breaking through the
final layer of clouds… and you won’t even be able to get there.
The shifting fields of spacetime here will ensure that you are
forever trapped within the first layer of clouds above the
grasslands.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Who
are you? A Sithe Exalt?” As soon as Autarch Bolin had sensed how
spacetime had been suppressed in this area, he had known that the
danger was tremendous.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
compare me to those pitiable fools. I’m not one of Iyerre’s
subordinates,” a clear voice suddenly rang out in response within
the clouds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Grr…”
Far away, the clouds suddenly parted to reveal an enormous figure.
This was the giant cyclopean bear which had attacked Autarch Bolin
earlier.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiip.
Autarch Bolin immediately turned to stare at two other directions.
The clouds parted in two separate places, revealing two different
creatures which began to fly towards him. The first was a red-eyed,
white-furred humanoid whose body was covered with a bloody red miasma
that radiated a demonic aura. Autarch Bolin couldn’t help but
shudder slightly – this creature seemed to have been born out of
pure malice and spite!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for the second creature, it was like a giant stormcloud. Its body was
blurry and indistinct, but one could vaguely make out hundreds of
evil-looking eyes as well as countless tentacles reaching out from
the clouds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Three
Autarch-class void dwellers?” Autarch Bolin remained quite calm.
“These Autarch-class void dwellers might be on par with me in
strength, but that’s only due to their natural abilities. Their
insights into the Dao are laughably low, while I have the Golden
Bridge of Freedom protecting me. I should be able to keep myself
completely safe… but the world of grass which has imprisoned me is
quite marvelous. The grass should all be real, and it has nine layers
of clouds as well as three Autarch-class void dwellers protecting it.
Thus far, the only place we have seen three Autarch-class void
dwellers has been that behemoth hive. None of the temples had any
inside.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Eight Revolutions Spacetime Temple which had trapped Ning had only
held Sithe Exalts. The same was true for the other temples. None of
them had Autarch-class void dwellers!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Annihilation Hive, however, had three. Now that three more had
appeared within this world of grass… Autarch Bolin had the feeling
that this grassland world was probably far more dangerous than any of
those other temples.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">What
he didn’t know was that the world of grass was arguably the most
deadly weapon which the Sithe had prepared for this invasion.</P>

Chapter 21: Bolin's Death</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
giant one-eyed bear, a red-eyed white-furred humanoid, and a giant
stormcloud! The three Autarch-class void dwellers circled Autarch
Bolin and his golden bridge from three different directions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Bolin didn’t panic in the slightest. He had experience in dealing
with Autarch-class void dwellers, as he had worked with the others to
kill two of them during the Dawn War. Later on, Ji Ning and Autarch
Mogg had captured two in the Annihilation Hive and then negotiated
with the strongest one to have it leave their Chaosverse. Thanks to
these experiences, Autarch Bolin knew two important things about
these void dwellers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">First,
there was no way to compel Autarch-class void dwellers to swear
lifeblood oaths – they had simply entered verbal agreements with
the Sithe which they could renege upon at will. Second… they could
be negotiated with!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Gentlemen,”
Autarch Bolin sent to the three, “We cultivators have fought
against you and your fellow void dwellers on multiple occasions.
During the last war we killed two of your kind, and just recently we
fought against three more in the behemoth hive the Sithe constructed.
We ended up capturing two of them, while the other one decided to
work with us and so we granted it safe passage out of our
Chaosverse.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hrm?”
The three Autarch-class void dwellers circling around Autarch Bolin
were slightly startled. They knew that others had been captured by
the Sithe, but the three didn’t know what had happened to them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
have a decided advantage against the Sithe in this war!” Autarch
Bolin said persuasively, “Not a single one of us Autarchs have
perished in either the Dawn War or this war, while the Sithe have
suffered heavy losses and countless casualties. We’ve captured and
slaughtered a large number of their Exalts! I would wager that the
one you fear the most is their leader, ‘Iyerre’, right?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Heh.
Iyerre should be an Omega Autarch. He’s very powerful, and outside
this Chaosverse he would vastly outstrip us in might. However, this
is our home! The Chaosverse rejects him, preventing him from using
any of the Dao’s power. He’s merely on the same level as us in
power! He tried to ambush Autarch Mogg earlier, but in the end he had
to retreat with his head hanging low.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They’ve
suffered catastrophic losses, while not even Iyerre is able to do
anything to us. All of us are alive and well. Our side stands a much
greater chance of winning this war!” Autarch Bolin continued, “I
know that you have been forced to take part in this war. If you
insist on battling us to the death, once we win there’s no way we
will spare you!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“However,
if you choose to betray them and work with us instead, we’ll help
you out. Afterwards, I’ll send you out of our Chaosverse and grant
you your liberty. I can swear a lifeblood oath on this,” Autarch
Bolin said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Betray
them and join you?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Impossible!”
The three Autarch-class void dwellers instantly sent messages of
rejection.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
fine. I won’t force you to actually betray them. All you need to do
is to pull your punches during these battles. Both of us will hold
back by 50%! All we need to do is put on a show for the Sithe to
watch. I, Bolin, will definitely remember your show of friendship and
can swear an oath that once the war concludes, we won’t make things
difficult for you. We’ll send you out of our Chaosverse.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
the three Autarch-class void dwellers had many misgivings about this,
a short while later they sent back a response: “Fine.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Deal.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ll
believe you for now.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">These
void dwellers might look stupid, but in truth the Infinite Void they
wandered through was unfathomably vaster than any Chaosverse. The
Chaosverses were merely the largest celestial bodies that existed
within the Infinite Void! The Infinite Void was so vast that it
contained truly innumerable lifeforms. As creatures who rose to reach
Autarch-levels of power, they naturally were quite crafty and
understood how to balance pros and cons.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
harbored great hatred for the Sithe, but Iyerre was so overwhelmingly
powerful that there was no way for them to fight back against him.
Still, Bolin’s words had indeed convinced them. There was no
guarantee that the Sithe would truly win this war, and so they wanted
to prepare a way out for themselves.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
mental conversation had been an extremely quick one. Anyone watching
from the outside world would have simply seen a brief staredown,
followed by immediate combat. The three Autarch-class void dwellers
began to launch a frenzied series of blows against Autarch Bolin.
Even though they were holding back on their strikes, they were still
forceful enough to cause spacetime to twist and distort around them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Bolin was at a complete disadvantage and had been completely
suppressed, but his six arms were able to work together in marvelous
fashion, allowing him an airtight defense that completely protected
him against their attacks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Both
sides were holding back by 50%, but no one watching from the outside
would be able to notice anything at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“These
creatures of the Infinite Void do not train in the Dao. They have low
levels of insight, rendering their incredible natural gifts
completely useless. They clearly have Autarch levels of power and are
able to overpower Autarch Bolin, but they aren’t able to kill him
even though they outnumber him three-to-one.” Three people were
conversing via godsense in the void beyond this battle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’re
simply using them to tie him down. They serve well as brutes and foot
soldiers. It’s enough for them to have completely suppressed him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
the end, it’ll be up to the three of us.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
find a chance to make our move.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Bolin continued to fight from atop the Golden Bridge of Freedom. He
seemed to be using all his strength to resist the combined attacks of
these three Autarch-class creatures, and in truth these void dwellers
had been blessed with ridiculous strength and innate power. They
might not have trained in the Dao, but they could break almost
anything with raw power! Mogg had found it quite difficult to handle
just one of them in the Annihilation Hive. Bolin now had the aid of
the Golden Bridge of Freedom, but he still found defending against
them difficult even though both sides were holding back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
reason why he had asked for both sides to hold back was so that he
would have the capacity to deal with something unexpected.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Bolin stood there atop the golden bridge, both himself and the bridge
being sent staggering downwards by the force of the void dwellers’
blows. Both were sent smashing into the thick clouds below them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoooosh!
An iridescent violet-gold chain suddenly shot out of the clouds,
moving as agilely as a snake as it lashed at Autarch Bolin.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Huh?!”
Autarch Bolin turned pale. This whipping motion from the violet-gold
chain had a strange cadence and gave off a strange sensation. Only
someone who had reached an incredibly high level of insight into the
Dao would be able to unleash such a strike. Without question, this
was an Autarch-calibre technique… and the power rippling from the
chain surpassed even Autarch Bolin’s own level of power!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
One of Autarch Bolin’s six arms instantly expanded in size, and he
reached out with a claw-hand to try and seize that chain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Faced
with Autarch Bolin’s full-strength claw attack, the violet-gold
chains suddenly switched from a lashing motion to a coiling motion,
seeking to wrap themselves around him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clang!
Autarch Bolin missed with his grab, but one of his fingers manage to
land a clawing blow upon the chain. However, the chain managed to
easily deflect the power of his blow and continued with its coiling
attack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Right at this moment, yet another violet-gold chain appeared from the
skies above Autarch Bolin. This one descended towards him with
overwhelming power, dealing a furious lashing blow against him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clank!
Clank! Clank! Three more violet-gold chains suddenly appeared from
the clouds above, the clouds below, and to his left. Every chain was
attacking in a manner which was difficult to defend against! At peak
power Autarch Bolin was able to fight with six arms, but he still had
to use at least three of them to defend against the three
Autarch-class void dwellers while pretending to be wounded by them.
And this was with the void dwellers holding back; if they weren’t,
he would’ve suffered a truly heavy injury!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Use
three arms to fight back against five of those violet-gold chains? He
was caught flat-footed and knew that he wouldn’t be able to hold on
for much longer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Finally, yet another violet-gold chain appeared to his right. This
time, Autarch Bolin wasn’t able to defend at all. The chain
violently lashed Autarch Bolin across the chest, catching him
completely off-guard. Bang! His entire body caved in then completely
imploded from the power of this strike, but a heartbeat later his
body transformed into countless specks of light instead. He had just
used his invulnerable form and was trying to heal.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
still trying to survive?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Your
body’s been destroyed. Struggling is useless. You are dead.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Those
six violet-gold chains flew out with incredible speed and power,
showing no mercy at all as they furiously assaulted those specks of
light. Autarch Bolin’s dispersed energies were being repeatedly
annihilated, and just a short while later his fleeing form had been
completely annihilated.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had been completely suppressed in power. Autarch Bolin had been slain
just a heartbeat after the six chains had appeared! He had simply
been overwhelmed by the number of enemies he faced.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
power quickly fled from the levitating golden bridge, and it came
crashing down into the deep clouds below it. It tumbled across the
clouds, with even the tower being twisted by the collision.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
sounds of battle finally fell silent, while the six chains
disappeared back into the clouds once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Well.
That’s certainly a shame.” The three Autarch-class void dwellers
stared at the fallen golden bridge which now lay atop the clouds,
feeling rather regretful. They didn’t like the Sithe one bit, and
they couldn’t help but feel a bit unhappy that the native Autarch
they had just reached a pact with moments ago had perished almost
immediately afterwards.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go.” The three void dwellers quickly departed into the clouds as
well, leaving behind just the fallen golden bridge and a few
scattered treasures.</P>

Chapter 22: Message</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Moments
later, a willowy, silver-robed woman suddenly stepped out of the
silent clouds and moved to stand next to the fallen Golden Bridge of
Freedom.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
weapon Iyerre fashioned is certainly powerful. We were able to crush
and kill this native Autarch with ease.” The silver-robed woman
waved her hand, collecting the fallen treasures and estate-worlds
which lay strewn across the clouds, then gave the bridge a close
look. “I imagine Iyerre will be interested in taking a closer look
at this pseudo-Daoguard Tower.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
With a wave of her hand, she collected the golden bridge as well. She
then scanned the surrounding area, a delighted smile on her face:
“That was pretty easy.” She then stepped away into the void and
vanished without a trace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
a vast sea of fire located within the Great Dark. Many spacetime
rifts could be seen at the borders of this sea of fire, and Iyerre
was walking through it barefooted. He was hastening towards his
proudest creation, the Grassland World… but suddenly, he came to a
halt.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
An eager look appeared on his face. “It seems they have something
to report.” A blurry pillar of light appeared in front of him,
quickly resolving into three figures. It was the two men and the
woman he had sent off earlier. The silver-robed woman was holding a
miniaturized golden bridge in her hands, and she was casually
flipping it up and down.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
Iyerre saw the golden bridge, he couldn’t help but smile: “You
succeeded?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
was very easy.” The silver-robed woman raised an eyebrow. “That
native Autarch named ‘Bolin’ died before we even had to go
all-out against him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch
Bolin?!” Iyerre was unspeakably delighted by this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
he was quite confident in the Grassland World, the most powerful
weapon he had ever created, he had still been worried that something
unexpected might happen. Now that he knew the results, he finally
managed to relax. It made sense. The Grassland World was overwhelming
powerful, and he had to come up with a way to compel those three into
coming here and helping him take control over it. It really wouldn’t
have made any sense if they had failed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Iyerre,
you’ve been suppressed by this Chaosverse to such a degree that
although you are a bit more powerful than the native Autarchs, you
are still on their same overall level of power! In the end, the
weapons you’ve created are actually stronger than you,” the
silver-robed woman teased.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
true.” Iyerre nodded in acknowledgment. “I might be weakened, but
my artificing skills remain untouched.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Back
in his homeland, Iyerre was so overwhelmingly powerful that these
complicated artifacts and treasures were useless to him. A single
palm from him would have far more power than any artifact possibly
could unleash. Here, however, artifacts like the Grassland World were
much more dangerous than even Iyerre himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
should we do next?” the red-robed man asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Shall
we keep ambushing the other natives?” the black-robed man said in a
cold voice. “The Grassland World can hide its aura and prevent the
Chaosverse from sensing and locating it. We can keep hunting them
down.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No.”
Iyerre shook his head. “Without question, the other Autarchs were
notified right away once Bolin died! They’ll be extremely cautious
and won’t give us another chance like this.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
wasn’t a fool, and he didn’t treat the Autarchs as fools either.
Previously, Ning and the others had been certain that they were safe.
They never would’ve imagined that such an overwhelmingly powerful
weapon as the Grassland World would appear without them even being
able to detect it. The Grassland World had been so powerful that it
had only been forced to reveal part of its true power in order to
slay Autarch Bolin!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
what should we do next?” the silver-robed woman asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
that you’ve already revealed yourselves, we should prepare for a
frontal clash,” Iyerre said with a smile. “We’ve already killed
one of the native Autarchs and seized the initiative! Now, hurry up
and send the Grassland World to reinforce the four trapped temples.
Go rescue my Exalts and bring them into the Grassland World. They’ll
be of great use to you there.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fine.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well.” All three agreed to the order. They all knew that while the
Sithe Exalts were individually weak, in sufficient numbers they were
still able to be extremely effective in battle. Unlike those foolish
Autarch-class void dwellers, the Sithe Exalts had all reached
incredibly high levels of insight into the Dao and were the equals of
the native Autarchs in insights.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go. I’ll join forces with you as soon as I can,” Iyerre said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
blurry pillar of light vanished.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
was in a superb mood. There were only seven Autarchs to begin with.
Now that Bolin had died, only six were left! Several of the six had
seen their original avatars destroyed, and their new avatars remained
fairly weak. Another peak avatar had been tied down within the
Annihilation Hive. On the Sithe side, none of their peak combatants
had been lost to date!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Given
the current situation, we should definitely be able to win a head-on
clash.” Iyerre smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had been preparing for this battle for many, many aeons. He had made
multiple plans for victory, and as he saw it they were completely
flawless.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
simplest plan had been to gain victory through the Annihilation Hive!
He hadn’t expected it to be resolved that easily, but fortunately
he hadn’t placed too much hope on gaining victory so easily.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
quiet, ordinary chaos planet. Ning was pacing around, filled with
worry. Just now, he had received a message from Autarch Bolin:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
under attack. An Autarch-class void dweller has appeared, and
spacetime has been frozen around me!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
felt rather uneasy upon hearing this. Autarch Mogg had been ambushed
but had been lucky enough to survive. Now, Autarch Bolin had been
ambushed as well? Did the Sithe feel confident in being able to
breach the defenses of the Golden Bridge of Freedom? Had they really
sent just one Autarch-class void dweller to accomplish this?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
spacetime around me has been subsumed by a vast world of grasslands.
I can’t see to the ends of this world. The skies above me are
filled with a thick layer of clouds that are incredibly tough. I’m
using all my power right now to break through the clouds.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
finally broken through the clouds. There’s actually an even higher
layer of clouds above me!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“An
enemy in this world has just informed me that this place has a total
of nine cloud layers, each of which is harder to breach than the
last. I apparently have no chance of breaking through the final layer
whatsoever, and it is supposedly protected by constantly shifting
spacetime which will keep me forever trapped here at the first
layer.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
being attacked by a total of three Autarch-class void dwellers.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha…
I’ve managed to successfully persuade them into holding back.
They’ve been forced to take part in this war and don’t really
want to battle to the death. It was easy to persuade them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Bolin continued to send one message after another to the others.
Generally speaking, whenever the Autarchs were in a dangerous
situation they would constantly send messages so that even if they
died, the survivors would gain a better understanding of what dangers
the deceased had faced and so wouldn’t repeat their mistakes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
continued to flow on.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
good. A violet-gold chain just appeared from the clouds. Another one
just appeared out of nowhere.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“These
chains are incredibly powerful. They have to be on par with
Darknorth’s full-force strikes! They are not only strong, they are
also incredibly profound. These chains are definitely being used with
Autarch-class techniques. They are very difficult to deal with.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Three
chains… four chains… five chains! I can’t hold on much longer.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Six
chains! I can’t hold!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">These
messages came very fast, one after the other. As soon as the final
message came, Ning could sense that Autarch Bolin’s aura had
suddenly vanished from his message-talisman. The talisman had become
an ownerless object, with Ning no longer able to sense any karma
tying him to Autarch Bolin any further.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
karmic links between them had been completely severed. There was only
one explanation for this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
d-died? Bolin died?” Ning was stunned. Not just him – all five of
the other Autarchs were stunned as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">An
Autarch had died!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
had been dangerous situations in the past, such as when Autarch Ekong
had been trapped within that temple or when Autarch Mogg had been
hunted by Iyerre… but this was the first time in the entire long
history of this Chaosverse that an Autarch had been killed. This was
completely unprecedented! Autarch Bolin had just been killed? He was
dead?!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
felt many complicated emotions. Anxiety, sorrow, pain, grief… and
smoldering rage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
isn’t the time to grieve. Bolin’s dead. He was trapped within
that world of grass, and as soon as those chains appeared he was
killed. That world of grass is a hundred times more dangerous than
the temples we faced prior to this. We have to be careful not to fall
into the same trap.” Autarch Titanos was the first to send a
message to the others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Agreed.
We can’t make the same mistake. Don’t let them succeed with
another ambush! We now have two options before us. The first is to
enter the Quintessence. There’s no way they would be able to enter
the Quintessence without the prime essences discovering them. The
second option is for us to maintain a vast domain-type sea of mana
around us at all times. The mana will be infused with part of our
truesoul, and so we would immediately notice them once they went
anywhere near us no matter what type of masking technique they use,”
Autarch Skyfeeder immediately sent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
can’t set up a sufficiently large domain with our mana. I’m
worried that their world of grass is so vast that it could still
encompass and trap us when used from outside that range,” Autarch
Ekong rebutted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Our
only choice is to join forces,” Autarch Titanos said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
quickly began to discuss what their next steps should be. They had
paid a high price for this lesson; there was no way they could allow
themselves to be ambushed in such a manner again. As for hiding into
the Quintessence? They weren’t really willing to take this option.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Just
as they were negotiating in the midst of their rage and grief,
suddenly… a new message was sent to the six of them from Autarch
Bolin’s message-talisman, even though it no longer had Bolin’s
aura and appeared to be ownerless.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
am Bolin. I’m not dead yet!”</P>

Chapter 23: Trap</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
Bolin reflected on what had just happened, he couldn’t help but
feel both a sense of fear and joy. When he had been assaulted by
those violet-gold chains, he had immediately known that the situation
was extremely grim. The chains were attacking with techniques that
were just as profound as him, and as soon as all six had appeared he
had begun to feel a sense of despair. The difference between them was
just too great! Five chains alone probably would’ve done him in
fairly quickly. Six chains had completely broken through his
defensive lines.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
his body had been lashed apart, he had transformed into his
invulnerable form and attempted to keep himself alive. He wasn’t
willing to give up until the very last moment, but as those chains
had continued to lash away at him and his energies were completely
annihilated, he began to feel a mixture of total despair as well as
deep resentment in his heart!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
that final instant before his death, he had suddenly broken through
the final bottleneck in understanding the mysteries of life and
death. He had reached the level of true perfection, and he
immediately sent the tiny remaining bits of his dispersed energies
which had been mixed into the clouds into a state of ‘false death’!
This was a new technique which Bolin had naturally and instantly
gained when he had mastered his Samsara Daobirth Essence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
‘false death’ state was a state of neither death or life. It was
quite marvelous, causing one’s aura to completely vanish and all
karmic links to be severed. There was no way for anyone to sense his
existence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, Bolin had long ago reached incredible levels of insight into
the cycle of life and death. His very aura had changed due to his
many aeons spent meditating on its mysteries, and his skill in life
and death was very close to his skill in the Claw Daobirth Essence.
If it hadn’t been for the fact that he had already created the Claw
Daobirth Essence, he probably would’ve long ago formed the Samsara
Daobirth Essence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
anyone who already mastered a Daobirth Essence would be influenced by
it, making it incredibly difficult to break through in a second
Daobirth Essence even if one had reached a high level of
enlightenment in it. It wasn’t until the final moments when he
hovered at the brink of death that he managed to understand his final
flaws and reach perfection in this Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
this is how it works. When I had merely mastered ten Hegemonic Daos,
the accumulated insights were enough for me to vault into
understanding the Claw Daobirth Essence… but in understanding the
cycle of life and death, I had to slowly advance one step at a time.
I was able to improve the power of this Dao and reach a level which
was very close to that of my Claw Daobirth Essence, but it wasn’t
until I personally was at the verge of death that I understood how to
truly master it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Bolin
nodded to himself. “When mastering the first Daobirth Essence, it
is easy because nothing interferes with it. The second one, however,
is a hundred times more difficult. It requires constant, nonstop
searching.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fortune
and calamity ride together. I was driven to the brink of despair, but
it allowed me to master the Samsara Daobirth Essence.” Bolin was in
a fairly good mood right now.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
entering the ‘false death’ state he was able to avoid all forms
of detection, but of course he didn’t dare to take any actions at
all. For the sake of making it look real, he had voluntarily
abandoned his Golden Bridge of Freedom and some of his other
treasures. He didn’t discard his message-talisman, however, because
only Autarchs could use them. He had given up his many other
message-talismans. The Sithe had never seen an Autarch
message-talisman before, and so they didn’t realize what was
missing from the many they had taken from him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
knew that his friends would probably be heartbroken once he entered
that ‘false death’ state, and so he waited until the opponent
left with his treasures and his bridge before stealthily sending them
a message through the message talisman:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
am Bolin. I’m not dead yet!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
message completely shocked Ji Ning, Titanos, Mogg, and the others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Bolin,
you are still alive?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Is
this for real?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
can’t I sense your existence?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Are
you truly Bolin? Do you have any proof?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
were all so excited that they could hardly believe it. However, only
the original owner of an Autarch message-talisman was able to use it.
Logically speaking, there was no way for the Sithe to send any
messages once Bolin died! At the same time, they also knew that
Iyerre had reached a much higher level of insight than they had. It
was possible that he might have a way of decoding their
message-talisman, and so they felt a sense of wariness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ahaha!
Don’t worry, I really am Bolin. Ekong, I’ll have my avatar meet
with you shortly. That’ll be enough to prove that I’m telling the
truth.” Autarch Bolin understood his comrades’ misgivings.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the others kept their avatars fairly close together, as they had
been working together on how to deal with the sealed temples. Ning
himself was fairly close to Mogg’s avatar, while Bolin’s avatar
was fairly close to Ekong’s true body.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
just the time needed to boil a kettle of tea, Bolin’s avatar
finished warping through spacetime and reached Autarch Ekong.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ekong.”
Bolin’s avatar, dressed in black robes, suddenly appeared out of
nowhere without causing any sound or stir. No lines of karma appeared
either. It was as though it didn’t really ‘exist’ in this
world, but when he spoke his voice whispered across an ‘empty’
stretch of the void. Moments later, a few ripples could be seen
followed by a towering array of castles appearing in the ‘empty’
region. Autarch Ekong was quite lavish in preparing his dwelling
place.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Is
that really you, Bolin?” Autarch Ekong stared at Bolin’s avatar.
An overwhelming sense of familiarity flooded through him, allowing
him to feel all but certain that this was Bolin, but he was still
wary that this might be one of Iyerre’s tricks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
true body remains trapped within that world of grass and is still in
a false death state. I’ve blocked out all my auras and all karmic
links for fear that the Sithe might be able to find out that I’m
alive through karma, and so I was forced to do the same for my
avatar. I’ll release a bit of energy; test it out for yourself.”
The black-robed Bolin smiled as he waved his hand, causing a stream
of energy to fly out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ekong
was delighted as soon as he sensed it. This type of energy was far
too familiar for him! This was mana formed through the Claw Daobirth
Essence! Each expert’s mana contained its own unique signature
which was completely un-fakable; Ning, for example, had a pure Omega
Sword Dao sheen to his mana!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
spoke of a ‘false death’ state? What type of state is that, for
even us to be unable to sense you?” Autarch Ekong asked curiously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
already taken control over the Samsara Daobirth Essence,” the
black-robed Bolin said. “Many secrets are hidden within both life
and death. Entering a pseudo-dead state was quite simple.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Ekong stared at the black-robed Bolin, his eyes filled with
curiosity. The man was clearly standing right in front of him, but
all of Ekong’s other senses were telling him that ‘Bolin’
didn’t seem to exist. This odd feeling made him sigh with
amazement.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
you’ve come to comprehend two Daobirth Essences? What have you
gained from it?” Autarch Ekong asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nothing
special besides the fact that I now have two Daobirth Essences to
use.” The black-robed Bolin shook his head. “We already know that
Iyerre is more skilled than Mogg in space and more talented in
illusions than Stonerule, and that he vastly outstrips Titanos in
artificing. He’s extremely formidable in every single area, while
his specialty lies in light. Even without the power of the Dao, he’s
still able to crush us in a fair fight. Now THAT is truly
impressive!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Those
of us who reached Autarchy via fused Supreme Daos will remain
‘ordinary’ Autarchs. Even if we gain an additional Daobirth
Essence, we’re still far from reaching the level of the Omega
Autarchs,” the black-robed Bolin said with a laugh. “But of
course, the power of the Samsara Daobirth Essence is tremendous and
I’ve grown quite a bit stronger due to it. I’m also able to use
these two different Daobirth Essences together. Who knows? Titanos
might not be a match for me now, haha…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Different
essences had different levels of power. Previously, Autarch Titanos
had been the strongest save for Ning because his was the Karma
Daobirth Essence. The Samsara Daobirth Essence was also an
extraordinary essence, and given that Bolin had another essence as
well, it made sense that he had grown significantly stronger.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Good,
good, good!” Ekong was overjoyed. For someone on their side to be
strengthened was wonderful news. He quickly sent word to the others,
all of whom were similarly overjoyed. For Bolin to still be alive was
simply wonderful.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Stonerule suddenly sent to everyone, “According to Bolin, that
world of grass seems to be extremely powerful. I’ll wager we
haven’t seen its full power yet.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
it was absolutely terrifying. It completely dominated me! If I didn’t
manage to master the Samsara Daobirth Essence at the critical moment
and avoid detection via the ‘false death’ state, I probably
would’ve died for real. Even at my current level of power, I won’t
be able to escape,” Bolin said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
said, “Given how powerful this world of grass is, we have to come
up with some sort of counter-measure.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
currently right in the middle of that world. I know exactly where it
is, so you don’t need to worry about being ambushed,” Bolin said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Huh?
Ah, right! Haha.” Ekong laughed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Bolin’s
within the world of grass, which means we now have a perfect
understanding of its movements.” Titanos chuckled as well. This was
an unexpected bonus.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Where
is the world of grass right now?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
been advancing at high speed for quite some time. Judging from its
path, it should be headed towards the ‘Nine Cicadas Temple’,”
Bolin said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the others were all enlightened. Of the temples the Sithe had
sent out to attack the Autarchs, one had been defeated by Ning while
four had been sealed away. The Nine Cicadas Temple had been given
that name by the Autarchs because it was covered with extremely
strange carvings of nine cicadas on them. The temple was controlled
by nine Sithe Exalts, the most of any temple they had encountered
thus far.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
it is flying towards the Nine Cicadas Temple, it is probably planning
on rescuing those Exalts,” Ekong said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
can’t let them join forces!” Ning said hurriedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sithe have repeatedly taken advantage of their higher level of
insight to ambush us!” Autarch Titanos said. “Now, thanks to
Bolin, we know the exact path this world of grass is taking. That
means we can set a trap for it and play a nasty little trick on that
terrifying weapon.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right.
Let’s set up a trap!” Ning’s eyes lit up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
give them a good hard beating,” Autarch Mogg agreed hurriedly. He
had been ambushed not too long ago and was itching for revenge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hopefully,
we’ll destroy the entire thing,” Bolin said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
prospect of giving the Sithe a taste of their own medicine was making
their blood pump with excitement!</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_44_Chapter_024__The"></A>
Chapter 24: An Autarch Task Force</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning and the others began to work hard to produce a plan which would
be perfectly tailored to dealing with this terrifying new threat, the
‘Grassland World’. Everyone including Ning knew deep in their
hearts how important this battle would be. In fact, it could be said
that if they won this battle they would probably have won the entire
war! If they lost, then they would probably have lost the war as
well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
price of defeat was simply too great. All of the countless native
lifeforms of this entire Chaosverse, from the lowliest of ordinary
mortals to the most exalted of Hegemons and Autarchs, would be
completely exterminated! Not a single one of them would be left
alive! The entire Chaosverse would be completely remade into one
which was suitable for the Sithe and inimical to all others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
knew that they couldn’t afford to lose this battle! By now, the
Sithe Hegemons and Emperors no longer posed much of a threat. It was
up to the final battle between the supreme elites of each side.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
destroyed one of those temples and trapped four of them! Even if
Iyerre gets personally involved, we should be able to withstand him
via the Golden Bridges of Freedom. Right now, the only thing the
Sithe have which poses a threat to us is that world of grass. In
truth, it is an apocalyptic danger,” Autarch Titanos said. “It
only needed a fraction of its power to kill Bolin. Even though Bolin
now controls two Daobirth Essences, he’s still forced to hide via
the ‘false death’ technique and doesn’t dare to face it
head-on! In other words, none of us are a match for that world of
grass in sole combat.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
agreed with this assessment. The terrifying power which the world of
grass had displayed previously was enough to cause even Ning to
shiver with fear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ll
never have a better chance than this,” Autarch Titanos said. “We
are hidden in darkness, while they stand revealed to us! We can make
all preparations necessary and focus all of our power against the
world of grass.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“When
Iyerre ambushed Mogg, he didn’t produce anything even as remotely
terrifying as the world of grass,” Autarch Bolin said. “That was
his ‘big reveal’, so he definitely would’ve gone all-out in
that attack. For him to not use a ‘world of grass’ leads me to
suspect that the entire Sithe race only has a single such weapon. I’m
sure that it wasn’t easy for him to make such a terrifying weapon.
Hell, I’m amazed they were able to create it at all!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right.
If Iyerre didn’t carry one, that’s probably because there only IS
one.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
we can defeat the world of grass, we would’ve gotten rid of our
greatest threat and essentially won this war,” Autarch Stonerule
agreed. “This is now our last, best chance to gain victory.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
have to win.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
must win!” The seven strongest members of the cultivator
civilizations were filled with determination to win.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the others were going to put everything they had into this fight.
Every single one of them was going to take part, and so they began to
hasten towards the Nine Cicadas Temple from their respective stations
throughout the Chaosverse. Autarch Stonerule was the slowest when it
came to travel speed, and so Autarch Skyfeeder actually went to him
to ‘carry’ him with her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Just
a bit over a month later, they all reunited near the Nine Cicadas
Temple. As for the Grassland World, it was still on its way. It
wasn’t quite up to par with Autarchs when it came to warping
through spacetime.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
still have nearly a month left.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
bulky Nine Cicadas Temple hung there in the void of space, the nine
Sithe Exalts still focusing on defending it from within. Ning and the
others wouldn’t be able to breach its defenses anytime soon, so
they simply left it trapped within their formations.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Autarchs were located in a region of empty space outside the
formations sealing the temple away. Autarch Titanos’ two fleshy
antennae were standing up straight, quivering with killing intent. He
began to make the arrangements: “During this next month, we need to
finish setting up any and all helpful formations. We don’t have
much time. Move fast, everyone.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright,”
Ning, Bolin’s avatar, Autarch Skyfeeder, Autarch Ekong, Autarch
Stonerule, and Autarch Mogg all chorused in unison.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
began to flow in a rapidly accelerated pace around them. Autarch
Skyfeeder was responsible for keeping time sped up, while Ning and
the others were responsible for setting up the formations. They
already knew exactly where the Grassland World would be arriving, and
so they would set up the grand formation there! The entire formation
covered a huge area, as it was meant to encompass the entire
Grassland World.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
order to make the formation as strong as possible, they even infused
some of the mysteries of the Golden Bridges into the formation. When
the time came, the formation would be ready to accumulate an enormous
amount of the Chaosverse’s power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
formation was divided up into two different parts. The outer
formation would be maintained by Ning, Bolin’s avatar, and the true
bodies of the Autarchs. The inner formation would be maintained by
the other five Autarch avatars. The inner formation would serve as
the vanguard for doing battle against the Grassland World; if they
suffered any casualties, the inner formation would be the first to
go.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
I’m done.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
formation’s been set up.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the others had worked hard and quickly. In the end, they managed
to finish the entire grand formation with two days to spare.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
take the Dust-1 position.” Ning stood there within a specific part
of the formation. Boom! The overwhelming power of the Chaosverse
instantly crossed an infinite distance to appear in the region around
him. Ning’s location seemed to have transformed into an endless
vortex of darkness which devoured all of the power of the prime
essences!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
grand formation had two ‘poles’ which represented Yin and Yang.
Ning was responsible for one of them while Titanos was responsible
for the other, as the two were both skilled in formations.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for the other five, they were responsible for helping and
strengthening the power of the formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
formation is complete. All of us are now much more powerful than we
are normally. With so many empowered Autarch-class combatants working
together and joining forces, we’ll definitely be able to destroy
the Grassland World.” Autarch Titanos let out a loud laugh,
completely confident in their chances.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right.
The chains that attacked me were powerful,” Bolin’s avatar
agreed, “But we have so many Autarch-class combatants that we would
have more than enough power to each take on a single chain without
being affected.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Unfortunately,
two of the five avatars at the vanguard are very weak. My avatar and
Skyfeeder’s avatar were both destroyed and had to be remade, and so
they are only at half-strength. Even with the formation supporting
them, they are just barely as strong as they would be at their peak.”
Autarch Titanos shook his head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is enough. The true bodies will be launching attacks from afar in
support, right?” Mogg laughed as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
they spoke confidently, all of them remained quite cautious. They had
an enormous advantage in this battle as they had chosen the
battlefield and prepared formations for it, ensuring that they could
unleash the absolute maximum power possible! However, they didn’t
dare to truly go all-out and leave themselves with no way out. If
they really did die, the cultivators would never again have a chance
of reversing this defeat. Thus, if this battle really did end up
poorly then the true bodies who were located in the ‘outer’ part
of the formation would be able to flee at any time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
reason why Bolin’s avatar was also located in the ‘outer’ part
was to keep his continued existence a secret. Otherwise, the Sithe
would immediately find out that Bolin hadn’t really died.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
total of twelve Autarch-class combatants had gathered together within
the formation, and they were empowered tremendously by it. They were
right to speak with confidence, but also right to be wary of this
terrifying ‘Grassland World’ weapon the Sithe had devised.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
are about to arrive.” Autarch Bolin’s true body was in constant
contact with them. “Five more warps through spacetime and they’ll
arrive.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Make
your preparations, everyone,” Autarch Titanos said. “Hide the
formation’s power. Don’t make your moves until they enter its
range.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Titanos
had been alive for longer than any of the others, and he had been the
most powerful before Ning’s rise to power. Everyone was accustomed
to him giving the orders, and he had been the one to devise the
majority of the components of this formation. Ning and the others had
only played a supplementary role.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Silence.
The entire formation fell completely and utterly silent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the others all stared intently, nervously awaiting the most
critical battle of them all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“According
to the information almighty Iyerre gave us, they should be arriving
soon. We’ll be able to escape.” The nine Sithe Exalts within the
Nine Cicadas Temple were all seated in the lotus position, eagerly
awaiting the Grassland World’s arrival. They had felt extremely
restless and uneasy after being sealed away here, as all they could
do was passively watch and wait for the cultivators to eventually
breach the formations protecting them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
should arrive in just another day or two.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
a dimensional rift suddenly appeared just a hundred billion
kilometers away from the Nine Cicadas Temple, followed by a
silvery-white ship flying out of the rift. This was an
ordinary-looking realmship, while the person commanding it was
nothing more than an ordinary Hegemon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However…
the twelve Autarch-class combatants hidden within this region all
knew the truth. They knew that the Grassland World was hidden within
that realmship, because Autarch Bolin’s true body remained trapped
inside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They’ve
entered the net.” Autarch Titanos’ eyes shone with baleful light.
“Activate.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Activate.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and Titanos were in control of the Yin-Yang poles, and they
simultaneously activated the formation with the other five working in
concert with them. Rumble… an utterly apocalyptic amount of power
instantly filled a vast region of ten trillion kilometers. The mere
flow of power caused the void of space itself to be ground into
countless sand-like particles, instantly disintegrating the silver
realmship. As for the Sithe descendant who was commanding it, he
stared in terror as he himself was disintegrated into dust.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
only thing left behind was a strange ovaloid object.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_44_Chapter_025__The"></A>
Chapter 25: Snake and Sword</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
ovaloid object was the most powerful Sithe weapon… the Grassland
World.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ve
been traped!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
going on? How could there be a trap here? We cut off all connections
to the outside world and are undetectable. There’s no way the
cultivators could’ve tracked us here. How could they have set up a
trap in advance?!” The black-robed man, the red-robed man, and the
silver-robed woman were standing atop the clouds, staring at the
outside world. They were able to see past the Grassland World’s
dimensions with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
world outside had been transformed into a writhing realm of
primordial chaos, filled with such power that even they shuddered at
it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Did
they perhaps manage to guess that we were going to come and rescue
the Exalts and so set up a trap in advance?” the silver-robed woman
asked, puzzled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
trapped a total of four temples. How could they be sure that we would
come to the Nine Cicadas Temple first?” the red-robed man boomed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Could
they have set up traps around all four temples?” the black-robed
man asked in his icy voice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Impossible.
You can see how much power the formation outside is using. The
ambient power alone is enough to annihilate realmships with ease. The
cultivators must have poured all their power into creating a
formation of such power,” the silver-robed woman said. “There’s
no way they could simultaneously maintain four or five formations of
such power.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
red-robed man shook his head. “In the end, this is their
Chaosverse. They must’ve come up with some other way of tracking
our whereabouts. No time to waste on wondering how they did it! Right
now, our biggest problem is that we’ve already been trapped.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
what should we do?” the black-robed man said with a frown.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Unlike
the other Sithe Exalts, they weren’t truly Iyerre’s subordinates.
Thus, they didn’t really care too much about whether Iyerre won or
not. They had only taken part because they had been required to,
while the promised rewards ensured that they weren’t excessively
opposed to helping out! However, when they could sense that they were
in mortal danger, there was absolutely no way they would throw away
their own lives for the sake of this war.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Outside
this Chaosverse, they could kill these Autarchs with ease. Here in
this Chaosverse, these local Autarchs were terrifyingly powerful. Now
that they had joined forces and used a mighty formation, the three
felt even more nervous.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
can’t risk ourselves. Absolutely not. If Iyerre wants to take
risks, let him do it,” the black-robed man muttered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
see just how strong the grand formation is. Let the fools go,” the
silver-robed woman said. “We ourselves can just stand back.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fine.”
The black-robed man and the red-robed man both agreed. By their very
nature, they looked down upon those three ‘fools’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hey,
idiots! Hurry up and get over here!” the silver-robed woman
shouted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Soon,
three enormous creatures emerged from beyond the clouds. The first
was the giant cyclopean bear, the second was the red-eyed
white-furred humanoid, while the third was the tentacled stormcloud.
These Autarch-class void dwellers were extremely displeased at the
contempt which these three powerful Sithe displayed towards them.
They could sense it keenly, but they were weaker than the three Sithe
and so there was nothing they could do.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
do you want?” the giant cyclopean bear rumbled unhappily.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
have business for you, of course,” the silver-robed woman snapped.
“The Grassland World has already been trapped by the cultivators!
We don’t know anything at all about the situation outside, and so
we need you to help investigate it for us.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Investigate?”
The three Autarch-class void dwellers were filled with both rage and
fear. They knew just how powerful these three Sithe were… and yet,
the Sithe were too afraid to go outside and so were sending them out?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
three of you are skilled at staying alive.” The silver-robed
woman’s eyes flashed coldly. “I suggest you go immediately. Don’t
force our hand.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
had to go, whether they wanted to or not! The three Autarch-class
void dwellers exchanged glances, communing in secret.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
can go if you want,” the red-eyed, white-furred humanoid said
hoarsely, “But we’ll need to keep part of our bodies within the
Grassland World. We’ll only let parts of ourselves go outside! That
way, we can be sure to keep ourselves alive. If you want us to
completely depart from the Grassland World, we’d rather die than
comply! It’d be death either way.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right!”
the cyclopean bear and the tentacled stormcloud both chorused.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
so you three idiots aren’t as dumb as you look?” the silver-robed
woman snickered. “Don’t worry. We don’t stand to benefit from
your deaths. All we want to do is to use you to investigate the
outside world. We can agree to your terms… now hurry up and go!
Find out what’s going on outside so we can take the appropriate
counter-measures.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three Autarch-class void dwellers could no longer refuse, and so they
immediately soared upwards through the clouds. They went through one
layer of clouds after another. The clouds were normally quite
resilient, but when they flew through them the clouds all parted
before them. Soon, they reached the ninth and final layer of clouds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Be
careful, everyone.” They exchanged glances, then nervously began to
fly through the ninth layer as the two men and one woman below them
watched intently.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the others were using the formation to blanket and smother this
entire region with their power. After trapping that ovaloid object,
they quickly saw it dramatically expand in size. Boom! Boom! Boom! It
grew to be ten thousand kilometers in size… a hundred thousand
kilometers… a million kilometers… ten million kilometers… a
hundred million kilometers…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Suppress
it!” Autarch Titanos commanded. Ning and the others began to pour
the power of the formation into doing just that.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boundless amounts of power began to coil around the Grassland World,
compressing and crushing it. As it continued to expand in size, the
amount of pressure it faced continued to increase as well. By the
time it reached a size of nine billion kilometers, it was unable to
expand any further! Every single part of its enormous bulk was under
utterly horrendous levels of pressure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can’t believe a mere artifact is able to resist the power of our
formation and still expand to such a great size,” Ning said. “It
really is far more powerful than any of the temples we saw earlier.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Find
its weak points. If we can’t find any, just launch an all-out
attack,” Autarch Titanos sent mentally.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
take a close look at the thing. Ning and the others all began to
inspect the Grassland World from their various vantage points,
searching for weak points. Alas, they couldn’t see anything from
the outside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
short while later, as they were still inspecting the thing, a gray
part of the ovaloid object suddenly began to ripple like the clouds.
An enormous creature began to emerge, quickly resolving into the
giant head of the vast, foolish-looking cyclopean bear. Next to his
head was a stormcloud that seemed to be filled with countless black
tentacles as well as an unremarkable-looking red-eyed, white-furred
humanoid.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Each
just sent parts of their bodies from within the rolling screen of
clouds, keeping the rest of themselves within. They stared curiously
at the outside world, but they saw nothing but a mishmash of chaos.
How could they tell what was going on?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch-class
void dwellers!” Ning recognized them right away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Those
were the three which attacked me previously,” Bolin’s avatar
sent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Perfect.
Everyone, attack! When they retreat, follow them inside the Grassland
World,” Autarch Titanos ordered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Attack!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the others began to carry out the plan they had practiced a
number of times in the past.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
five avatars of Titanos, Mogg, Skyfeeder, Stonerule, and Ekong within
the inner formation all began to activate their respective parts of
the formations. They transformed into an enormous five-headed black
serpent, with each head representing one of the avatars. The main
head of the black serpent was led by Autarch Titanos, who commanded
the other four in attacking.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for the ones in the outer formation, they were even more powerful but
chose to be cautious and launch long-range attacks from afar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go!”
Autarch Mogg waved a finger from afar. Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! A
series of round arcs of saber-light flew out, filled with the
boundless mysteries of the Space Daobirth Essence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Bolin’s
avatar waved a finger as well, causing ten thousand beads to appear
which were filled with the mysteries of the Samsara Daobirth Essence.
To keep his true identity hidden, he did not use his Claw Daobirth
Essence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
other Autarchs all used their most powerful long-distance attacks as
well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
Daos Are The Sword!” Ning willed his six Northbow swords to come
flying out, filling them with the power of his mana and linking them
together with the power of the other Autarchs. Ning was responsible
for guiding the powers of all six Autarchs, because as an Omega
Emperor he was skilled in virtually every aspect. He understood
illusions, karma, the samsara of life and death, and both space and
time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
was a bit weaker than Bolin when it came to life and death and a bit
inferior than Titanos when it came to karma, but he remained
incredibly skilled in all respects. Thus, he was the perfect mediator
for their powers, allowing the six to join together in a flawless
manner and truly transform their attacks. It was a pity that Ning’s
avatar was still tied down within the Annihilation Hive. Otherwise,
he could’ve also taken responsibility over the five avatars
attacking from the inner formation, allowing them to become even more
powerful!</P>

Chapter 26: Unstoppable</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three Autarch-class void dwellers were in the ninth layer of clouds
of the Grassland World, nervously reaching out to the outside world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“See
anything?” the cyclopean bear said, carfully scanning the
primordial chaos outside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
don’t see a damn thing.” The tentacled stormcloud was extremely
cautious as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Look
out!” The red-eyed, white-furred humanoid’s eyes were glowing
with bloody red light as it stared intently towards a distant place,
and it suddenly sent a mental warning to the others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiip!
An enormous black five-headed serpent suddenly slithered forward from
within the mishmash of primordial chaos, its head glaring ferociously
at the three as it charged towards them with an overwhelming aura.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
block it!” The red-eyed, white-furred humanoid was the closest to
the serpent. It felt a sense of fear, but it still sent its two furry
arms forward in an attempt to block.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
The five heads of the black serpent suddenly attacked simultaneously
while using the full power of the entire formation. This strike
completely eclipsed that of any ordinary Autarch’s and was every
bit the equal of Iyerre’s ultimate attack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Dodge!”
After the black serpent crushed the red-eyed, white-furred creature,
it cruised straight towards the tentacled stormcloud. The stormcloud
creature was terrified but it still sent out many probing tentacles
to try and defend against the impact while preparing to flee.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
black serpent slithered closer towards it, the five heads striking
simultaneously once more and tearing countless tentacles apart.
However, the serpent was noticeably slowed down by them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
heartbeat later, the black serpent gave a little wriggle and then
shot out once more, its speed skyrocketing to incredible heights as
it flew towards the final remaining combatant, the giant cyclopean
bear. Autarch Titanos’ avatar was standing in the central head, and
it murmured to itself: “Where there is cause, there is effect.
Karma lies in all things.” The five heads of the serpent struck out
in perfect harmony.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
The giant cyclopean bear furiously struck out with its twin paws,
managing to block the attack of the black serpent head-on. It was the
physically strongest of the Autarch-class void dwellers, and so
although it was at a noticeable disadvantage it wasn’t instantly
destroyed by the clash.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
I’m not as fragile as those other two!” the giant cyclopean bear
laughed excitedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Titanos,
prepare to enter the Grassland World!” Ning sent mentally.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Behind
the giant black serpent, a sword suddenly appeared. The sword shone
with dazzling light and was filled with awesome power. The five heads
of the black serpent were able to cooperate together in perfect
harmony thanks to the power of karma, but this sword had transcended
mere ‘cooperation’ and represented many different powers being
merged into a perfect whole! Ning was commanding all of the
long-distance attacks from the seven Autarchs in the outer formation,
and he manifested them through his Sword Dao to create a terrifying
divine sword that surpassed even the black serpent in power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“CHOP!”
The awesome divine sword came crashing down with such power that even
the cyclopean bear felt a sense of fear. It hurriedly retreated,
seeking to use its paws to defend once again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slaaaash!
Sword-light descended, annihilating all within its path. The upper
body of the giant cyclopean bear was completely destroyed by this
strike.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ahhh!”
The giant cyclopean bear was completely terrified. Thankfully it had
kept its life-core within its lower left leg, and its entire lower
body remained within the ninth layer of clouds. As a result, it was
sable to survive this strike. The three had only agreed to expose
part of their giant bodies, precisely because their life-cores were
what really mattered the most.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
The vast sword stabbed straight into the ninth layer of gray clouds.
It shuddered slightly, seeking to tear through the surrounding area
and rip apart the hundreds of millions of kilometers of clouds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Thanks to the divine sword, Ning immediately sensed a powerful force
resisting him. “Bolin was right. The ninth and outermost layer of
clouds is so incredibly durable that ordinary Autarchs have no chance
of destroying it at all. Even though we’re joining our power
together and summoning the might of the Chaosverse itself, we’d
probably only be able to cut apart a hundred thousand kilometers of
it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarchs
were completely unable to breach the ninth layer of clouds, while a
full-force blow from this divine sword was able to break through a
hundred thousand kilometers of it. This was a testament to the
sword’s might! The more of the clouds you wanted to destroy, the
more power was needed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Titanos,
help me keep the rift in the clouds open,” Ning sent mentally.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Leave
that to me!” Titanos sent the black serpent in to cover the rift
while sending back, “I’ll leave the attack against the world of
grass to you!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
towering black serpent slithered its way into the tear within the
gray clouds, its five heads slowly swiveling around its body and
keeping the tear open, preventing the gray clouds from covering it
back up again! It must be understood that once the tear was closed,
Ning’s squad wouldn’t even be able to sense the insides of the
Grassland World, much less maintain the sword and continue to fuel it
with their mana. They had to keep the tear open and prevent it from
closing!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
black serpent was filled with unearthly power, but it was only able
to just barely maintain a thousand-kilometer sized rift.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Sever
the connection to the outside world! Quick! Sever it!” the
red-robed man shouted frantically. The Grassland World truly was a
complete world unto itself and as such could be completely detached
from the rest of the Chaosverse, making it impossible for the
Chaosverse to sense and detect it. The two men and the woman inside
the Grassland World were absolutely horrified at the power of that
sword.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
no way to break the link!” the silver-robed woman said frantically.
“That black serpent is preventing the clouds from reforming. We
can’t break the connection!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
good! That sword is about to attack!” the black-robed man bellowed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
giant black serpent continued to hold the gray clouds apart within
the ninth layer, while the mighty sword transformed to become
incomparably vast as it stabbed downwards.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
The tip of the sword stabbed through the eighth layer, then the
seventh layer, the sixth layer…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clang!
A violet-gold chain suddenly appeared out of nowhere. The dazzling
iridescent chain flew towards the black serpent which was holding the
rift in the clouds open, and it was quickly followed by yet another
chain as well. The violet-gold chains launched continuous attacks
against the giant black serpent. If they were able to destroy it, the
clouds would close over and sever the tip of the sword from the
outside world, preventing it from controlled and thus causing it to
collapse on its own.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clang!
Clang! Clang!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">More
and more violet-gold chains appeared.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hm?”
The hilt of the absolutely titanic sword remained within the ninth
layer of clouds, while the tip of the sword continued to stab
downwards.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break!”
Ning caused a series of sharp surges of sword-ki to fly out from the
hilt of the sword. Each stream of sword-ki was shaped like a fish,
and a total of thirty-six swordfishes quickly flew out and took up
blocking positions before the black serpent. They then began to swim
together to form a whirlpool of sword-light which smashed outwards at
the encroaching violet-gold chains.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">These
thirty-six streams of sword-ki merely represented 20% of the divine
sword’s power, but this defensive sword-technique in the form of a
vortex of sword-light was still enough to suppress all of the
attacking chains.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">By
now, there were nine violet-gold chains which were furiously
assaulting the whirlpool of sword-light, only to be unable to break
through.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break!
Break! Break!” The toughest layer of clouds was the ninth one. With
the black serpent maintaining the tear, the other eight layers were
now much easier for the gigantic sword to stab through.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! The sword continued to penetrate one layer of clouds
after another.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
sword is too powerful! These native Autarchs must have come together
and used something akin to a Daoguard Tower which allows them to
summon the power of the Chaosverse, then had Emperor Darknorth merge
all of these disparate energies together with his Omega Sword Dao.
This sword is so powerful that not even all three of us working
together can stop it!” The two men and the woman hidden in the
center of the Grassland World began to grow a bit nervous.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
I knew that this was going to happen, I would’ve had us rendezvous
with Iyerre before coming here. Iyerre could’ve dealt with these
problems,” the silver-robed woman said anxiously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
had instructed them to go rescue the Sithe Exalts, while he himself
was coming from a completely different region of the Chaosverse. As a
result, their reunion was delayed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
was overconfident in his Grassland World,” the red-robed man said
frantically. “That sword is about to pierce through the last layer
of clouds!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’re
hidden here in the depths of the Grassland World, while the sword
isn’t able to blink through the earth above us. There’s no way
it’ll be able to injure us,” the black-robed man said coldly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
if we let them cause destruction unchecked, they might end up
destroying some of the important components of the Grassland World.
Once we lose this weapon, the upcoming battles will be even harder,”
the red-robed man said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.
That’s not our problem. Staying alive is what matters; losing a
weapon is a minor matter. We’ve done our utmost,” the black-robed
man said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
sword was filled with the power of seven Autarch-class combatants. It
started at the eighth layer of clouds and stabbed through one layer
after another. The clouds sought to form whirlpools of defensive
energy to resist, causing the sword to come under tremendous
pressure, but it was still able to persevere… and so, just like
that, it punched all the way through the first layer of clouds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Bolin,
return immediately!” Ning sent mentally. Bolin’s true body was
hidden within the first layer of clouds.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_44_Chapter_027__The"></A>
Chapter 27: Quintessence Ignition</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
towering divine sword had stabbed through all eight layers of clouds.
Mana flowed through the area immediately around it, blasting away at
its surroundings. This was the combined mana of Ji Ning, Autarch
Titanos, Autarch Bolin, and all of the others. For their mana to be
there was equivalent to them being there in person, and they could
use mana to scan and scry an area. Every single drop of mana
contained parts of their soul and truesoul, after all. As their mana
surged through the area, it quickly covered the area where Autarch
Bolin’s true body was located.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
finally made it.” An unremarkable spark of energy quickly began to
fly through the mana towards the titanic sword. This was the form
Autarch Bolin’s true body had taken once it entered the false death
stage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you, everyone.” Bolin’s true body only showed itself after going
inside the giant sword, and he immediately laughed loudly and
delighted. All this time, he had been worried that his hiding spot
would be discovered, at which point he would have nowhere to run and
would most assuredly die.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Bolin,
hurry up and take control of the formation! With your main body in
control, we’ll be able to up the power even further,” Ning sent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Bolin’s body quickly sped up through the interior of the giant
sword, rising through the clouds. The divine sword was like a giant
mountain which stretched from the very bottom all the way through the
ninth layer of clouds, allowing Bolin to easily traverse the
Grassland World and stealthily pass through the five heads of the
black serpent which were keeping the rift in the clouds open! No one
was the wiser as he reached the void outside the Grassland World.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
made it out alive.” Only after exiting the Grassland World did
Autarch Bolin finally let out a sigh of relief. He flew through the
void and quickly reached his avatar’s location in the formation,
which he swapped with. The power of the entire formation instantly
increased by another 20%. His avatar had already died once, after
all, and so it was fairly weak. It was by far the weakest link in the
outer formation, far weaker than the true body.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Congratulations,
Bolin!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Bolin,
remember that you owe us some fine wine for saving you from that
calamity.” Stonerule, Ekong, and the others all sent happy messages
to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Bolin smiled. “Easily done! I’ll send my avatar back and hide
inside the Grassland World in my stead. Who knows, it might serve us
in good stead!” He then willed his avatar to fly back into the
Grassland World, following the same path he had taken in leaving.
After mastering the Samsara Daobirth Essence, Autarch Bolin was
superior to all other Autarchs when it came to hiding himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
was able to completely hide his aura and sever all karmic
connections, making it impossible for even the Chaosverse to detect
his existence. Even if his avatar ended up being discovered and
failed its missions, its loss was a minor matter. To let his true
body die while exploring would be a true shame.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
After the towering sword stabbed straight through all of the blocking
clouds, it stabbed into the grasslands themselves. However, the grass
was so extremely sturdy that the sword didn’t manage to pierce too
deeply inside of it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
no way to dig any deeper into the grassland,” Ning sent mentally.
“Gentlemen, what do you think we should do?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Grassland World’s core should be located deep within its depths,”
Autarch Titanos said. “Based on what I’ve seen from researching
various powerful Sithe weapons, the most powerful formations will be
located around the most important regions. Right now, the problem is
that the sword needs to endure the restrictive power of eight layers
of clouds while continuing to drill downwards. It’s only able to
unleash a fraction of its full power, and I don’t think there’s
any chance we’ll be able to damage the core components while doing
so.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right,”
Ning agreed. “Stabbing through the eight layers is already
consuming a bit over half of the power, while those nine chains are
taking up another twenty percent. That leaves just thirty percent to
deal with the grasslands below.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
two of you can decide on what to do,” Autarch Mogg said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
two understand formations better than the rest of us. You decide,”
Autarch Ekong agreed. The other Autarchs were going to let Ning and
Titanos take the lead, because they were the most skilled in the Dao
of Formations. Titanos in particular had spent countless aeons
analyzing artifice and weaponry.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
remaining thirty percent stands no chance of punching through,”
Ning agreed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
let’s get rid of those nine layers of clouds first,” Autarch
Titanos said. “The clouds serve as a protective eggshell around the
yolk. If we can scrape away the clouds, we can deal with the interior
as we please.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Destroy
the nine layers of clouds?” Ning was intrigued.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
core is inside the grasslands, while the nine clouds are outside.
There has to be some sort of formation keeping these troublesome
clouds active,” Titanos said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Which
means if we can destroy the relevant formations, the clouds will
disperse on their own,” Ning agreed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right.”
These two understood formations very well, and they quickly managed
to come up with a method for dealing with the clouds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break
for me!” Ning began to twist and turn the titanic sword, sending it
chopping back and forth through the clouds. Each time it did so, it
created new gaping wounds within the lower eight layers of clouds!
The clouds continued to cover the tears, while the sword continued to
stir its way through them like a spoon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
process continued, with the clouds reforming each time after the
divine sword cut through them. This rapid healing process consumed an
enormous amount of energy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
The mana within the divine sword was able to follow the energy
ripples of the healing process, allowing formation experts Ning and
Titanos to discover nine different energy wellsprings in the time
needed to boil a kettle of tea.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
they are located in nine different places at the farthest corners of
the clouds?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Not
even Autarchs were able to see to the ends of the vast Grassland
World, because there were spacetime formations blocking their site
and hiding nine critical components of the formations powering the
clouds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
sword assaulted the nine points with raw force, stabbing out towards
the ends of the grasslands and blasting through spacetime barriers
with a rumbling sound. Although the sword only had 30% of its full
power left, it still had more power than any full-force strike from
one of the seven operating independently. The spacetime barriers were
completely incapable of stopping it. They completely imploded and
crumbled, revealing the true scene behind them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Here,
there were a series of thick clouds. All nine layers of clouds were
grouped together here, masking something.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nine
layers of clouds are protecting this place?” Ning and Titanos were
delighted. Their guesses had been spot-on; otherwise, why would this
place be so carefully hidden and protected?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
enormous sword first withdrew back to the outermost ninth layer of
clouds, reuniting with the black serpent. Then… “Break! Break!
Break!” Ning and Autarch Titanos worked in harmony, the divine
sword leading the way with the black serpent following right behind
it. The nine violet-gold chains sought to bar their path, but they
were held back by the sword-light radiating from the divine sword.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
divine sword tore through the ninth layer of gray clouds as it made
its way to the place hidden by formations previously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“BREAK!!!”
The black serpent immediately took responsibility for keeping the
ninth layer of clouds ‘open’, while the divine sword pressed the
attack. It quickly broke through all eight layers of clouds,
revealing countless glittering runes and complicated glyphs which
were working together in an unfathomably profound manner. Energy was
being sent from deep within the grasslands into the runes, which then
sent the energy into the layers of clouds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is a conduit formation!” Ning and Titanos were delighted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
incredibly complicated. I don’t understand it at all,” Autarch
Titanos said. “Let’s break it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right.”
Ning didn’t understand it either. Even if they spent ten years
working on it, they probably wouldn’t manage to figure out more
than a tiny bit of it. The best way to deal with a complicated
formation like this was to overwhelm it with power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash!
The divine sword pierced through the opening which the black serpent
was maintaining, carrying apocalyptic levels of force as it cut
through the eight layers of clouds and then stabbed against the
runes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Countless runes and glyphs began to tremble. “Haha, illusory runes
eh? Then I’ll destroy spacetime in the area. Let’s see if your
formation can remain stable then!” Ning continued to violently
attack, striking each blow with maximum power and causing the runes
to shudder and flicker.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Deep
within the depths of the grasslands. The two men and the woman were
beginning to truly panic now.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
should we do? They found the formation linking us to the nine clouds
almost right away.” The red-robed man frowned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Should
we ignite the quintessence core?” the black-robed man said
nervously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ignite
the quintessence core?” The silver-robed woman and the red-robed
man were both stunned. The ‘quintessence core’ referred to the
energy source powering the entire world. The reason why the Autarchs
had been unable to truly break into the Sithelands which had invaded
their Chaosverse was precisely because the Sithelands had its own
miniaturized quintessence. This quintessence core provided the
Sithelands with energy, allowing the Sithe to construct those stable
and deadly Daoguard Towers! However, over the aeons the energy of
that miniature quintessence had been gradually depleted. By now,
there was little remaining.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
reason why the Grassland World was so powerful was because it had a
quintessence core of its own as well! Iyerre had asked his own
teacher to give it to him, and his teacher had obliged. That was the
only reason why Iyerre had been able to create this mighty weapon.
Otherwise, there would’ve been no way to power the Grassland World.
Even the mightiest of weapons needed sufficiently strong external
power sources here. This was a foreign Chaosverse, after all; they
were rejected here and could not draw upon the local prime essences.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Igniting
the quintessence core will consume an enormous amount of energy. If
we use it all up, we’ll have lost this battle,” the silver-robed
woman said. “We should check with Iyerre first.” She immediately
reached out to contact Iyerre.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
short while later a blurry pillar of light appeared which gradually
resolved into the tall, barefoot, balding figure of Iyerre.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
is it?” Iyerre asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
cultivators set up a trap for us here. The Grassland World has been
caught, and the nine layers of clouds are unable to stop them,” the
silver-robed woman said quickly. “They’ve even discovered the
conduit formation powering the nine cloud layers. Soon, they’ll
have destroyed it. Once the nine clouds are destroyed, the Grassland
World will be on the verge of destruction as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“WHAT!?”
Iyerre’s face was drained of all blood, and a look of shock
appeared in his eyes. He was unable to remain calm any longer.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">* *

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Grassland World was Iyerre’s most important, the one he intended to
rely on to utterly defeat the cultivators and conquer this
Chaosverse. It was the main reason why he was so confident in his
ultimate victory. If the Grassland World was destroyed, his chances
of victory would become virtually nil. He’d all but simply have to
wait for defeat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thus,
as soon as Iyerre heard this bad news his mind became filled with
many thoughts. For example, how did the cultivators manage to prepare
a trap in advance? How was it that the protections of the Grassland
World had been breached so easily?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
latter, he had an answer for; he suspected that the silver-robed
woman and the other two weren’t ready to defend it with all their
strength. But the former? For now, he truly couldn’t understand how
the cultivators had managed to set up a trap in advance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
didn’t have any time to waste asking these extraneous questions. He
immediately ordered: “Protect the Grassland World at all costs!
Ignite its quintessence core right away!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ignite
the quintessence core?” The silver-robed woman blinked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right.
I’m on the way and will be there within a day. You have to hold!”
Iyerre’s face was as cold and hard as ice. “I have to win this
war. I have to take control over this Chaosverse! If you can’t hold
on until I get there, don’t blame me for what I’ll do to you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three couldn’t help but shudder. They knew that if Iyerre became
truly infuriated with them… just thinking it chilled their hearts.
If Iyerre’s countless aeons of planning ended up being ruined by
their cowardice, he might actually kill them!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’re
igniting the quintessence core right now. We’ll definitely hold
on!” the three hurriedly promised.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fine.”
Iyerre’s eyes flashed coldly. “Things might seem dangerous, but
we still have a chance! If the cultivators have been able to beat you
so easily, that means that most likely all of them are there. If
possible, trap them all inside the Grassland World! Do your best to
tie them down for as long as you can. Once I arrive, we’ll kill
them all! We stand the best chance if we can make the battlefield be
inside the Grassland World.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood,”
the silver-robed woman and the other two said hurriedly. The two
sides then broke the connection, followed by Iyerre’s figure
vanishing from the pillar of light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three finally let out sighs of relief. They felt a great deal of
trepidation towards Iyerre. He was normally an affable person who
always had a sympathetic smile on his face, but in their homeland he
was second only to the Lord of Chaos. If they truly did cause his
countless aeons of hard work to go up in smoke, no one could predict
how berserk he would become.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ignite
the quintessence.” The three traded a glance, then immediately
activated the quintessence core.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
quintessence core was an indigo sphere that was located at the
deepest depths of the Grassland World. It was filled with an utterly
inconceivable amount of power. This tiny sphere had significantly
more energy inside it than the entire Blazesun Domain! It had once
been an incredibly vast energy source which had spun through the
Infinite Void, but the Sithe Lord of Chaos had ended up harvesting
it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Not
just any quintessence could be ‘harvested’ like this. The ones
which could be harvested while remaining intact and independent were
vanishingly rare.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Right as they began to ignite the quintessence, a thunderous boom
rang out from the outside world, followed by a loud laugh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
we broke one!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
voice rang out excitedly: “Come, let’s break the next one!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
let’s go!” Autarch Titanos was delighted as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
thoroughly destroying the runes and glyphs, they wrecked the entire
formation. It was now incapable of transmitting any more energy to
the ninth layer of clouds, causing its ‘healing’ speed to lessen.
However, destroying just a single nexus wouldn’t be enough to cause
the ninth layer to actually collapse. There were nine formations
providing energy, after all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“One
of them has been destroyed already!” The faces of the silver-robed
woman and the other two turned pale.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
The quintessence core ignited, causing the entire world to flare with
ten thousand times more power than before! The Grassland World became
filled with power, with a blurry blue light appearing everywhere
within it. As for the eight remaining conduit formations, they began
to pump energy out at their absolute maximum capacities! A vast
torrent of energy pumped out, causing all of the formations
throughout the Grassland World to skyrocket to maximum power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Still,
there was a limit to how much the conduits could pass through. The
remaining amount was simply wasted. One of the nine formations
generating the nine cloud layers had been destroyed, after all.
Despite that, the power of the formations still rose by over 60%! If
all of the formations had remained intact, the power would have
instantly doubled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiip!
Autarch Titanos was right in the middle of using his giant black
five-headed serpent to keep a rift in the clouds open while Ning used
the giant divine sword to attack yet another conduit formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
of a sudden, all of the clouds began to glow with blurry white light.
The white light was very comfortable and carried the blessings of
radiance, but it also caused the restrictive pressure generated by
the clouds to skyrocket in power by 60%!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
must be understood that once one reached an extremely high level of
power, improving by merely 10% to 20% was already extremely
difficult. A sudden increase of 60% made it impossible for the black
serpent to keep the rift open any longer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can’t break through it any longer.” The divine sword had to fight
back against the combined assault of the nine violet-gold chains
while also enduring the restrictive pressure of eight different cloud
layers. There was no way for it to keep attacking the formation,
especially now that the power of the violet-gold chains had increased
multifold and the clouds had grown more powerful as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can’t keep holding any longer either.” Autarch Titanos was
similarly anxious. His black serpent was fighting back against the
ninth and strongest cloud layer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Deep
within a giant palace inside the Grassland World. The red-robed man
and the other two were seated here, head raised and staring past the
dimensional barriers to see what was happening in the world outside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Below
them were a host of other figures, including the three Autarch-class
void dwellers and a number of Sithe Exalts. Iyerre had a number of
‘spare’ Exalts who hadn’t been needed to control the various
temples, and they had been assigned to the Grassland World. ‘Bowenya’
was here as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Should
we attack?” the black-robed man said in his cold voice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
just yet.” The red-robed man frowned. “We still haven’t managed
to locate the true bodies of the Autarchs yet. That sword is merely
composed of energy and magic treasures! Now that we’ve ignited the
quintessence core, they won’t be able to cause any further damage
to our formations. Let’s wait for their true bodies to descend,
then trap them inside. When they are inside, we’ll be ready to wrap
this battle up.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Agreed.”
The silver-robed woman nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the others were indeed in a tough situation. The power of the
nine cloud layers in the Grassland World had increased dramatically,
while the violet-gold chains had become several times more powerful
as well. They were finding it difficult to fight back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Withdraw.”
The divine sword, previously capable of piercing through eight cloud
layers, quickly retracted to the ninth cloud layer and then flew over
to help the black serpent push at the rift. Once the rift was closed,
all connection to the outside world be lost. They would no longer be
able to control those treasures using mana or godsense, resulting in
the collapse of the sword.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiiiip.
The divine sword was still mighty enough to tear the ninth layer of
gray clouds open, but it was only able to tear a thousand-kilometer
hole now.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Iyerre
has yet to make his move. That means he probably hasn’t arrived
yet. This is a perfect opportunity which won’t come again. We need
to seize this moment to destroy this weapon!” Autarch Stonerule
sent mentally.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
feel like we should have us attack in person now,” Autarch Ekong
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Agreed.
However, we need to remain cautious. Our true bodies should just
remain in the outermost layer of clouds and keep it open,” Autarch
Titanos said. “We can’t go any deeper inside! Once we do, the
Sithe will probably use certain tricks to keep us trapped in there.
We’d be shut off from the outside world and unable to maintain our
connection to the formation, at which point we would probably all be
wiped out!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the others were all wary of this possibility as well. They
couldn’t afford to take a risk like that.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.
Let’s make our moves.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Just
a short while later, a towering figure suddenly appeared within the
void and strode towards the gray clouds. This vast figure was
barefoot and almost completely naked, wearing just a fur loincloth.
It had seven faces and fourteen arms! The face in front resembled
that of Ning’s, while the three faces to the left side and the
three faces to the right side resembled those of Autarch Titanos and
the rest of the six. The towering figure’s body was covered with a
blurry layer of sword-light, and the very act of walking caused it to
emanate an aura of terrifying destructive force.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the others had such powerful bodies that they were strongest in
close combat. This formation-incarnation was formed by the seven of
them using the power of the outside formations, but led by Ning using
his Omega Sword Dao. All seven of their true bodies were located
inside this formation-incarnation. As soon as it had been created, it
had emanated a natural aura of infinite sword-light. Every single
movement it made was filled with ineffable might.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Being
responsible for this incarnation is incredibly taxing.” Ning could
feel his entire body aching, as could Autarch Titanos and the others.
Not only did they have to keep the giant formation in the outside
world active while controlling the divine sword, they also had to
physically join together in this vast formation-incarnation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Splitting
their energies three different ways like this was no easy task!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“While
we keep the sword active, we’ll only be able to use 70% of this
formation-incarnation’s power,” Ning mused to himself. From a
tactical standpoint, they would become deadlier if they completely
abandoned the sword and instead focused on pouring all of the
formation’s energies into this incarnation, using 100% of its
power! Still, it wasn’t yet necessary for them to take such a
drastic step.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiiip.
The formation-incarnation strode forwards towards the grayish clouds,
its fourteen arms reaching out simultaneously in ripping motions. The
clouds around them quickly began to roil about as a vast area of ten
thousand kilometers was torn open by it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was quite easy for the formation-incarnation to keep this rift open,
freeing up the giant black serpent and the divine sword to continue
stabbing downwards.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_44_Chapter_029__The"></A>
Chapter 29: Iyerre Cometh</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Deep
within the palace located in the depths of the Grassland World. The
silver-robed woman waved her hand, causing an image to appear next to
her which displayed what was happening in the world outside. “All
of you look so nervous. Fine. We’ll let you see what’s happening
outside. That way, you can tell Iyerre that the three of us are being
diligent in our efforts.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three Autarch-class void dwellers and the Sithe Exalts all stared at
the images next to her. They saw a towering, seven-faced titan
dressed in just a fur loincloth reach out with fourteen arms. The
arms were filled with absolutely unearthly power as they tore apart
the ninth layer of clouds and then kept the rift open.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Aside
from the titan, there was also the giant black serpent and the
gigantic sword. The black serpent was under assault by nine
violet-gold chains. The serpent was clearly finding it rather hard to
endure the assault, even though streaks of sword-light were assisting
it in resisting the chains.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for the giant sword, it had pierced through the eight layers of
clouds and was slamming against the runes and glyphs surrounding the
conduit formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash!
Slash! Slash! It was clear to everyone that by the time the sword had
pierced through the eight layers of clouds, it had virtually
exhausted all of its power and posed very little threat to the divine
glyphs and runes. They didn’t even tremble!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’re
in no danger.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“After
we ignited the quintessence core, these cultivators are no longer a
threat to us,” Boweyna and the other Exalts agreed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
only thing they have which could threaten us is that titan. It has to
be a formation-incarnation! Given its power, I imagine the cultivator
leaders are located right inside of its body,” a skinny Sithe Exalt
said. “We’ve ignited the quintessence core, but it’s still able
to handle the ninth layer of clouds with ease. That means it has to
be even more powerful than the sword!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kiblo
is right. Our greatest threat right now is that
formation-incarnation,” another Sithe Exalt immediately agreed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
two men and the woman at the front of the temple let out cold
chuckles. The silver-robed woman explained, “Actually, our only
worry is that the formation-incarnation will NOT come inside. If it
dares to do so, we’ll be ready to launch a full-strength
counterattack against it. We’ll do everything possible to cut off
its connection to the outside world! Once that happens, it’ll no
longer be reinforced by the might of the outside formations, at which
point the incarnation, the black serpent, and the giant sword will
all be dramatically weakened. Their fates will be in our hands!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Iyerre
has already issued orders,” the black-robed man continued coldly,
“To seize this opportunity to trap them inside the Grassland World.
Once Iyerre arrives, we’ll launch our final killing strokes and
annihilate them all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
what if they don’t come inside?” a Sithe Exalt said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
why we aren’t attacking yet,” the black-robed man said. “The
more power we display, the more vigilant they will be. Let’s just
wait patiently. They’ll begin to grow impatient once they realize
they cannot destroy the Grassland World, at which point they might
charge inside.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sithe Exalts below all murmured amongst themselves. These three
clearly had completely different attitudes. The Exalts had to risk
their lives and do everything in their power to fulfill Iyerre’s
commands, while these three simply had to ‘do enough’. Still,
this was indeed a good plan to lure the cultivators inside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
outside world. As predicted, Ji Ning, Titanos, Stonerule, and the
others were all feeling extremely anxious. They had already done
everything they could, save for sending in their
formation-incarnation, but they remained unable to destroy the
formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
should we do? If we continue like this, we stand no chance of victory
at all,” Autarch Ekong said anxiously. “Should we take the risk
of charging inside?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
cannot!” Autarch Skyfeeder immediately refused. “Right now, we
hold the upper hand. It is the Sithe who cannot afford to waste time.
They need to force a final battle as soon as possible. We, on the
other hand, shouldn’t take on unnecessary risk!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Actually,
we are drawing closer and closer to victory,” Autarch Titanos said
suddenly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning and the others were all startled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
is the greatest flaw which all powerful Sithe weapons share?”
Autarch Titanos asked. “Energy! This Grassland World has to be
using up an absolutely enormous amount of energy. You all saw how,
after we destroyed the first conduit formation, the power of the
entire Grassland World suddenly skyrocketed. Even the air itself is
glowing with blue light, and we can all sense how much power that
light holds within it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the others all nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Clearly,
the energies of the Grassland World are being depleted at an
incredible rate. In fact, it is literally leaking power!” Autarch
Titanos continued, “When we first started to cause damage and
attacked the conduit formation, the Grassland World didn’t have
this sort of crazy response. Why? Precisely because of how much
energy it would consume. They weren’t willing to pay such a heavy
price unless absolutely necessary!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
we can force the Grassland World to continue depleting its energies
at this rate, it’ll soon break apart on its own,” Autarch Titanos
said with a smile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Once
its energy source is gone, even the most powerful of weapons will
become nothing more than a pile of refuse.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
it continue using up its power source then.” All the other Autarchs
agreed with this idea.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Besides,
Ekong,” Autarch Titanos continued, “Skyfeeder, Darknorth, and the
others are unwilling to take the risk of going inside because they
can sense that something isn’t quite right. When we first started
to attack the world of grass, they initially sent out those three
Autarch-class void dwellers to fight back against us. After those
three fled, not a single Sithe has come out to stand in our way.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Do
you really think such a vast world of grass wouldn’t have someone
in control of it? Even ordinary temples have several Sithe Exalts and
powerful golems protecting them. Does this world of grass really just
have a few chains guarding it?” Autarch Titanos said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
I have the feeling that something is off,” Ning said. “There’s
no way such a powerful weapon would only be defended by a few
chains.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Titanos nodded. “That’s why I have the feeling that they are
intentionally holding back to lure us inside. Once our true bodies go
through the clouds, they’ll be ready to show their daggers. This
would instantly become the final battle of this war… but the final
battle has to be on a battlefield of our choosing, not this world of
grass!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Agreed.”
They would rather give up this opportunity than take on such enormous
risk. So long as they remained alive, they were still ‘winning’
and would have a chance to gain a final victory in the future.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the others were of the same mind on this, and so they quickly
calmed down. They continued to use the black serpent and the divine
sword to assault the conduit formation, forcing the Grassland World
to pay a heavy price in energy and keep the quintessence core
ignited.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sithe continued to wait from their hiding place deep beneath the
grass, waiting impatiently for the formation-incarnation to come
inside… but the Autarchs simply refused to do so!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
flowed on quickly. A full day went past in the blink of an eye.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
ignited quintessence core was consuming energy thousands of times
more quickly than it normally would. This single day had cost it the
equivalent of dozens of years of energy! This was an absolutely
shocking rate of energy consumption, which was why the three had been
so hesitant to ingnite the quintessence. This single day had caused
the quintessence core to shrink by one full size.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
A tall, barefoot man was striding through spacetime rifts,
frantically advancing through the void. “I’m almost there.”
Iyerre was both anxious and furious. His calculations indicated that
the ignited quintessence core could only last for around three days.
Normally, it would have been able to last for over a century! Now,
however, it had lost nearly 40% of its power. How could he not be
impatient?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damnit.
They still haven’t gone inside!” He had paid such a heavy price,
but with nothing to show for it! If the cultivator leaders had barged
into the Grassland World, he would’ve ordered his subordinates to
launch the final battle in order to keep them trapped there at all
costs. By the time Iyerre himself reached the Grassland World, he
would kill them all! Iyerre was absolutely certain of being able to
kill them when the battlefield was within the Grassland World itself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">And
yet… a full day had gone past. The cultivators had to know that
they weren’t able to break the formation apart, but they refused to
go inside!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash!
After yet another warp through spacetime, he finally arrived at the
scene of the battle. This entire region was covered by an enormous
formation, but Iyerre appeared directly within its borders. As he did
so, Ning and the others instantly sensed Iyerre’s appearance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is Iyerre!” Ning and the others were all shocked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
simply incredible. Our formation should’ve suppressed spacetime,
but he was able to tear through our suppression and warp through
spacetime. The suppression was useless!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
wonder our seal against the Sithelands was completely useless.”
Ning and the others were all stunned by Iyerre’s might. Omega
Autarchs truly did surpass their insights by far too much.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.”
Iyerre stepped forward, tearing through spacetime once more and
appearing in the grayish clouds which served as the outermost layer
of the Grassland World. He then easily passed through the clouds to
go inside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Moments
later, a wave of power swept across the entire Grassland World,
including Autarch Bolin’s avatar which was hiding within via his
‘false death’ state.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Neither
dead nor alive? Is that Autarch Bolin? So my foolish subordinates
weren’t able to kill you after all. It must have been you who
revealed the Grassland World’s location.” As Iyerre’s voice
rang out, he himself appeared on the first layer of clouds. He
immediately reached out towards a patch of empty space, forcing it to
suddenly reveal the avatar of Bolin which immediately began to flee.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
The blue light of the Grassland World covered Iyerre, illuminating
his body. Iyerre simply waved his hand, commanding the blue light to
shoot out. When Ning and the other Autarchs fought, they could
command the power of the Dao… and here in the Grassland World,
Iyerre could command the power of that miniature quintessence.
Although it couldn’t compare to the actual Quintessence of the
Chaosverse in power, it was still enough to dramatically strengthen
Iyerre.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Iyerre
swung out a palm which surpassed both spacetime and the cycle of life
and death. Bolin’s avatar had nowhere to run and nowhere to hide,
and it was instantly splattered into nothingness by that giant palm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
Bolin had been here in person, he might’ve been able to endure for
two or three strikes before falling. This avatar, however, was newly
made and very weak. In the Grassland World, it was unable to
withstand even a single blow from the empowered Iyerre.</P>
