Chapter 1 - The Four Palaces of the Aquatic Manor
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tall, wide, ancient
hall was the same as it had been for countless years. Many enormous
prayer mats were placed throughout the hall, and an old black ox had
appeared, smiling as he looked at the suddenly arrived Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The main hall.”
Ning looked at the great hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations.”
The old black bull walked over, filled with joy. “It’s only been
a few years, but you’ve already reached the Zifu level. It was
faster than I anticipated.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was still worrying
about the impending arrival of a large group of experts from
Snowdragon Mountain, and so he said without too much joy, “I was
simply lucky.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fact that you
made it through those three trials earlier wasn’t a matter of
luck.” The old black bull sighed. “You bound the control
talisman…and you are now able to go to the most important places
within the Aquatic Manor. With access to these places, you will now
have the capital to truly rise to sudden prominence. Ji Ning, I feel
as though I can already see into the future, with you as being one of
the supreme experts of the Grand Xia Dynasty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned. He
hadn’t imagined that this old black bull, the spirit of a magic
treasure, would be so good at flattery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not lying.”
The old black bull said. “Immortal Juhua’s decision to accept a
disciple caused countless people throughout the Grand Xia Dynasty to
go wild. If they knew that Immortal Juhua was merely the third master
of this Aquatic Manor, most likely, a true storm would have erupted
in the world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What exactly is so
special about this Aquatic Manor?” Ning hurriedly asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What he cared the most
about was if this Aquatic Manor would be able to increase his power
or not, and if he would be able to have a greater chance of success
in the upcoming battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Aquatic Manor
has many secrets.” The old black bull said. “Immortal Juhua and I
stayed here for a very long time. If my predictions are correct…this
manor should have been designed for training future generations of
Fiendgods.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Training future
generations of Fiendgods?” Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The old
black bull nodded his large head. “The first master of this Aquatic
Manor should have been an extremely powerful Fiendgod! Just look at
the prayer mats throughout the main hall, and you will
understand…originally, quite a few Fiendgods would have sat here,
waiting for his command and listening to him expound on the correct
way of training.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
enormous nearby prayer mats, as well as that solitary prayer mat
seated at the front of the hall. He nodded gently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first master’s
method for accepting disciples was through two corridors; one for
Xiantian-level Fiendgod Body Refiners, while the other was for
Zifu-level Fiendgod Body Refiners.” The old black bull said.
“Ordinary Fiendgod practitioners wouldn’t suffice. Only those
whose bodies had transformed and become like the bodies of Fiendgods
would qualify. Wouldn’t this be, essentially, true Fiendgods?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His own body had been
birthed from fire and water that had descended from the heavens. He
did indeed have the body of a Xiantian Fiendgod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition, clearly
the various halls of the Aquatic Manor are meant for cultivating
later Fiendgods.” The old black bull said. “Unfortunately, the
path of Fiendgods is simply too difficult. Although Immortal Juhua
originally started on the path of Fiendgod Body Refining as well,
slowly, that path became more and more difficult for him. He advanced
more rapidly as a Ki Refiner, but in the end, he failed his
tribulation and became a Loose Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood. For
example, although he himself focused almost all of his effort on
training as a Fiendgod Body Refiner, he had first established his
Zifu as a Ki Refiner!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ki Refining was simple.
Body Refining was hard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Perhaps in the future,
he would become an Earth Immortal as a Ki Refiner while he was only
at the Primordial Daoist level as a Fiendgod Body Refiner…or even
just a Wanxiang Adept! Perhaps he, too, would face the tribulation as
a Ki Refiner, and end up failing and becoming a Loose Immortal…it
was completely possible that he would end up tracing the path of
Immortal Juhua.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me give you a
warning.” The old black bull looked at Ning. “This is what
Immortal Juhua once said to his disciple, Rampart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please speak.”
Ning immediately said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Aquatic Manor
is meant for cultivating Fiendgods. Thus, do your best to walk the
path of the Fiendgods.” The old black bull said. “Even if you are
at the very verge of the Void stage and becoming an Earth Immortal,
Ji Ning, you should halt your training in Ki. No matter what, do not
go face the tribulation! Work hard as a Fiendgod Body Refiner and
undergo the tribulation as a Fiendgod first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to the
hypotheses of Immortal Juhua, the farther along you go on the path of
the Fiendgods, the greater assistance this Aquatic Manor will be for
you. Immortal Juhua sensed that this Aquatic Manor had some secrets
he still didn’t know! They should have been secrets passed down by
the first master…but unfortunately, Immortal Juhua was unable to
divine them.” The old black bull said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, senior,
for your warning. Ji Ning will remember it.” Ning said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first owner
possessed incredible, divine powers, and he far eclipsed Immortal
Juhua.” The old black bull said. “Wait until you go to the
Stellar Hall. Then you will understand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stellar Hall?”
Ning was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An illusion suddenly
began to form in empty space. It quickly solidified into a tall,
powerful bear. The bear’s entire body was covered with yellow fur,
and it was staring towards Ning…and as it did, Ning felt as though
it was a sort of eternal, ancient existence. This was the same
feeling he had when he visualized the painting of Maiden Nuwa in his
mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No matter how much time
passed, it would be eternally present! This was the feeling that the
giant bear gave Ning; only, the feeling was murkier, not as powerful
as the one which the Nuwa Painting gave him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder Brother.”
The old black bull hurriedly lowered his face and called out. Ning
could sense the bull’s mouth trembling, and the old black bull
hurriedly said to Ning, “This is the spirit of the aquatic manor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The spirit of the
manor?” Ning sensed how the head of this enormous bear before
him…seemed very similar to the giant illusion of a bear head which
transported him here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning greets you,
senior.” Ning said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
glanced at him. “Yet another who reached the Zifu level as a Ki
Refiner first. You train in the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine
Heavens], the number one Fiendgod Body Refining technique in the
world. You possess a strong Fiendgod lineage. Work hard as a Fiendgod
Body Refiner. Don’t waste your natural talent and potential.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning could
feel the invisible aura emanating forward from the giant yellow bear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That ancient, eternal
presence alone…made Ning feel as though this wasn’t something
which ordinary practitioners would be capable of. The fact that the
spirit of the manor was capable of teleporting people was, in an of
itself, incredible and mysterious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Juhua was an
expert during the latter stages of the Fiendgod Era.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And the spirit of the
manor? It had followed the very first master. How ancient was it? How
powerful was it? It was best to be humble when facing it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Follow me.” The
giant yellow bear walked in front.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry, follow.”
The old black bull urged, hurriedly following as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning followed from
behind as the giant yellow bear led the way, into a corridor on the
right side of the main hall that was three thousand meters tall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
said while walking, “After having bound the control talisman, you
can be considered a master-in-training. Aside from the main hall, you
can also enter this corridor, which had four major secondary halls.
These four major secondary halls are open to you…but of course,
right now, you are limited to them. If you want to enter more halls,
you’ll have to become a Primordial Daoist.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Becoming a Zifu
Disciple and binding the control talisman was only the first step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Becoming a Primordial
Daoist and binding the entire estate was just the second step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most likely, even the
second step would be just a simple binding, allowing one to carry it
with him at all times. Most likely, the Aquatic Manor still would not
be under complete control, as otherwise, Immortal Juhua wouldn’t
have said that he suspected there were more mysteries within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look.” The giant
yellow bear pointed into the distance. An ancient, azure bronze gate
was there, which was open.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hurriedly walked
over, looking through the bronze gate….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes were
round He saw an enormous hall past the gate, in the middle of which
floated one magic treasure after another, each of them emanating a
powerful, ancient aura. Ning saw a large warhammer which glittered
with tricolored light that made Ning’s heart pound frantically just
staring at it, as though it were about to explode.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were also four
formation flags of different colors. When he looked at it, he felt as
though he was being drawn into a boundless separate world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the Treasure
Hall, one of the four major secondary halls you can currently enter.”
The giant yellow bear said. “The Treasure Hall is the place where
Master stored his countless treasures, ranging from unique mortal
items to items from the time of Primordial Chaos, when Pangu split
the heavens and created the universe. Master set down a rule for all
of these treasures; as long as you can satisfy the requirements the
Master set down, you can acquire them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning held his breath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Items of Primordial
Chaos, from when Pangu split the heavens? What were they? But Ning
knew that Fiendgods were naturally birthed from the heavens, and that
after Pang split the heavens, there were many Fiendgods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, it seemed as
though this Aquatic Manor truly had been left behind by an extremely
ancient, powerful Fiendgod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do I need to do
to acquire these treasures? What are the requirements?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After you enter the
Treasure Hall and slowly look through it, you’ll see the rules
which Master left behind.” The giant yellow bear said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first master had
created the two corridors that had to be traversed for future
disciples to be accepted. The rules of the Treasure Hall were also
set by the first master…clearly, the first master had the greatest
influence on the Aquatic Manor, while Immortal Juhua was just a
passerby.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Continue walking.”
The giant yellow bear said while walking. “The next secondary
hall…is the Divine Abilities Hall that you are now able to enter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Divine Abilities
Hall?” Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Divine abilities?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had only acquired a
single divine ability, the [Windwing Evasion]. Ning knew exactly how
precious divine abilities were. They weren’t things which just
anyone could acquire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Here we are.”
After having walked momentarily, the giant yellow bear pointed to
another nearby giant bronze door. That ancient bronze door had a
single bronze palm above it, and the palm emanated boundless might,
carrying the power to seal the heavens and block out the sun.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the Divine
Abilities Hall.” The giant yellow bear said. “Only Fiendgods who
fulfill two requirements are allowed to enter. The first is that the
Fiendgod Body Refiner reaches the level of Blood-Drop Rebirth. The
second is that it must be done within ten years; at most, ten years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blood-Drop Rebirth?
That meant being at the Zifu-level as a Fiendgod Body Refiner. He
hadn’t reached that yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ten years?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was already more
than ten years old.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the past,
Immortal Juhua was more than ten years old, so he wasn’t permitted
to enter the Divine Abilities Hall.” The giant yellow bear said.
“If he had been able to enter it, Immortal Juhua probably would’ve
been able to walk a longer path and his power should have been even
greater. Perhaps…he wouldn’t have ended up becoming a Loose
Immortal.” The giant yellow bear was clearly rather sentimental
towards Immortal Juhua, who had controlled the estate for millions of
years, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
sighed as well. “My master always felt regret for the fact that he
wasn’t able to enter the Divine Abilities Hall. Every single one of
these four secondary halls are important. Master was able to enter
the other three, but he wasn’t able to enter this Divine Abilities
Hall, and when he passed through the challenge corridors, he was more
than ten years old.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt bitterness in
his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No matter how you
calculated it, he was more than ten years old! Could it be that he,
too, had lost the chance to enter the Divine Abilities Hall?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fortunately, you are
lucky. You are only five years old.” The giant yellow bear glanced
at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five years old?”
Ning stared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
understood what Ning was thinking. “Fiendgods are born at the
Xiantian level. You are indeed only five years old.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 2 - Treasures
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The age referred to age
as Fiendgods reckoned it; true Fiendgods were nurtured by the natural
world and born as Xiantian lifeforms. As for Ning, when he was eleven
years old, celestial fire and water had descended, nurturing his body
and transforming it into a Fiendgod’s body, just like a normal
Fiendgod who had just been birthed. And now he was sixteen…as
Fiendgods reckoned it, Ning was indeed only five.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To be able to
establish a Zifu within ten years will be proof of your potential.”
The giant yellow bear looked at the towering bronze gate, a
complicated look in his eyes. “Only then will you be able to enter
the Divine Abilities Hall…within the Divine Abilities Hall is a
test which Master left behind. If you pass, you will be able to
acquire an extremely powerful divine ability which Master left
behind.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember; you only
have a single chance to enter the Divine Abilities Hall.” The giant
yellow bear looked towards Ning. “Thus, the more powerful you are,
the greater your chance will be. It is best if you enter it at ten
years of age; otherwise, if you fail, you won’t be able to acquire
a divine ability. After all, it is a trial; it does hold some danger,
and if you aren’t careful, you’ll lose even your own life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning asked with
curiosity, “What divine abilities are held within the Divine
Abilities Hall?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
looked towards Ning, then said calmly, “After having passed the
trials, you’ll know. And if you don’t make it through? You won’t
be qualified to know.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come. Let’s go to
the next hall.” The giant yellow bear continued forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at the
single palm above the giant bronze door, radiating that
inexhaustible, majestic presence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Divine Abilities Hall?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His Fiendgod body had
yet to reach the Zifu level. There was no point thinking about it for
now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
was in front of them, in this ancient corridor, with the old black
bull by his side and Ning walking behind them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This secondary
hall.” The giant yellow bear looked towards a towering bronze door
that was shut. This bronze door had an axe and a spear carved onto
it, and a killing aura emanated from it. The bronze door itself had a
bloody red light glowing from it, causing Ning to unconsciously feel
fear in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the Wargod
Hall.” The giant yellow bear said. “This is the most dangerous
place in the entire Aquatic Manor, but a place filled with
opportunity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most dangerous?
Filled with opportunity?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was curious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Continue looking.”
The giant yellow bear didn’t waste words, immediately walking
forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From far away, the
distant sound of flowing water could faintly be heard. Ning looked
with curiosity towards the already opened wooden door. The wooden
door was open, and through it, flowing water could be seen, along
with some boulders as well as some lonely straw huts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the Stellar
Hall.” The giant yellow bear stood in front of the hall, staring
into the vast, boundless space within. “Everything within the
Stellar Hall was personally laid out by Master. When living within
the Stellar Hall, one can even sense the wondrous mysteries of the
Dao.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby old black
bull also said excitedly, “Ji Ning, Immortal Juhua had a lifespan
of millions of years, precisely because of this Stellar Hall. The
wondrous mysteries of the Dao fill every single part of this Stellar
Hall, and it even has multiple complete ‘Daos’…Immortal Juhua
had the Stellar Hall, which is why he was at such a high level of
understanding, allowing him to withstand so many tribulations and
living millions of years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Multiple complete
Daos?” Ning was rather puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve told you
everything already.” The giant yellow bear looked at Ning. “The
places you are now granted entrance into are the main hall, this
corridor, and these four major secondary halls. You are not permitted
entry into the other parts, nor would you be able to enter if you
wanted to. Act appropriately. I hope you’ll be able to live to
become a Primordial Daoist.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
disappeared into specks of light, then completely vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a sigh of
relief. When facing the giant yellow bear, he always felt that it
gave him tremendous pressure, as though he were facing an ancient,
powerful Fiendgod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s how the
spirit of the manor is.” The old black bull laughed. “Forget
about you; he didn’t even care much about Immortal Juhua. He’s
quite arrogant and solitary. Actually, after so many years have
passed, I felt that it was normal for him to be so solitary. After
all, even Immortal Juhua didn’t truly master this Aquatic Manor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning seemed to
understand, and he nodded slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then he hurriedly
asked, “Senior, what should I do right now in these four major
secondary halls? Please guide me, senior.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First, go to the
Treasure Hall.” The old black bull said. “Follow me. I’m quite
familiar with it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Ning felt
that the old black bull was much more amiable and genial than the
giant yellow bear, the spirit of the manor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Treasure Hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the old black
bull walked together into it, and as Ning did, he instantly felt as
though he entered a different world. In the air hung a vast
collection of magic treasures, some of which were so powerful that
their aura alone made Ning feel his heart shake. Most likely, even
the slightest of ripples from it would cause him to crushed and
ground to dust. The power of it was far beyond what he imagined.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Treasures…” The
old black bull sighed, his eyes shining. “All of them are true
treasures. Immortal Juhua drooled when looking at them as well, back
in the day. But there was nothing he could do; he couldn’t acquire
them. If he was able to pick and choose as he pleased from these
treasures, Immortal Juhua probably would’ve overcome the heavenly
tribulation and become a Celestial Immortal long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt his heart be
moved, as he stared at them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He saw that above him
was a blood-colored warspear. The warspear looked quite plain, but
just hanging there, it caused the surrounding space to crumble and
crack, although it then quickly recovered. Crumbling, recovering,
crumbling…this continued nonstop.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These were all left
by the first master.” The old black bull said hurriedly. “He left
them for the future masters. He wanted to cultivate and provide for
them, and so if you want to acquire these treasures, you’ll have to
fulfill his requirements. Otherwise, even if you end up like Immortal
Juhua, dying due to the Three Calamities and Nine Tribulations, you
still won’t be able to acquire a single treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was curious. “What
are the rules? What must I do to acquire these treasures?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look over there.”
The old black bull’s head nodded towards the side. Ning followed
the bull’s gaze to look, only to see a tight cluster of tiny words
on the distant wall. These words were all Fiendgod characters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hurriedly walked
over, reading them all at one go.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So that’s the
situation.” Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The treasures of the
Treasure Hall…were all obtainable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were two methods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first was to rise
in power as a Fiendgod practitioner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once one reached the
Zifu level as a Fiendgod practitioner, one would be able to acquire a
‘Mortal-rank magic treasure’, or a precious item of equivalent
value.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon reaching the
Wanxiang level as a Fiendgod practitioner, one would be able to
select a single ‘Earth-rank magic treasure’ or equivalent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon reaching the
Primordial level as a Fiendgod practitioner, one would be able to
select a single ‘Heaven-rank magic treasure’ or equivalent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon reaching the Void
level, one would be able to select an ‘Immortal-rank magic
treasure’…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After after
successfully passing the tribulation and becoming a Celestial
Immortal! One would be able to select a ‘Pure Yang magic treasure’
or equivalent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So there are
actually five ranks of magic treasures.” Ning murmured. “Zifu
Disciples are only able to activate Mortal-rank magic treasures,
while Wanxiang Adepts are able to use Earth-rank magic treasures.
Primordials are able to use Heaven-rank magic treasures…and above
that are Immortal-rank magic treasures and Pure Yang magic
treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had never even
heard of these things before. All he knew was that there was such a
thing as a ‘ranked’ magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are five ranks
of magic treasures.” The old black bull nearby said. “In
addition, ranked magic treasures are also divide into ‘top’,
‘high’, ‘average’, and ‘low’ grades. The Zifu Disciples
in that Swallow Mountain area of yours might use ranked magic
treasures, but the vast majority of them are low-grade or average
grade magic treasures. However, if you were able to choose at will
from the Treasure Hall…I trust you would naturally be able to
select the best of yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning listened
carefully. These were things he had no idea about.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The further you
advance in your training, the harder it will be for you to acquire
magic treasures.” The old black bull said. “At the Void level,
Earth Immortals will be able to activate Immortal-rank magic
treasures, but Immortal-rank magic treasures…can be considered
treasures amongst Immortals. How many Void level Earth Immortals will
truly be able to acquire treasures of that level? They are incredibly
rare. Thus, generally speaking, those Earth Immortals and Loose
Immortals will generally use Heaven-rank magic treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the past,
Immortal Juhua became bottlenecked at the Primordial Daoist level as
a Fiendgod practitioner. No matter what he did, he wasn’t able to
break through and reach the Void level. It was pointless for him to
break through to the Void level as a Ki Refiner.” The old black
bull shook his head. “Thus, he was never able to acquire an
Immortal-rank magic treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah.” Ning was
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When one rose in power,
one could acquire a treasure, but that was only as a Fiendgod. As for
Ki Refiners? No matter how far you advanced, you wouldn’t be
bestowed any treasures. Thus, one could imagine how much the first
master hoped that his future inheritors would focus on training as
Fiendgods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Afterwards, Immortal
Juhua failed in his tribulation and became a Loose Immortal. After
countless years, his power grew greater and greater, and then he
succeeded in passing through the seventh level of the Wargod Hall,
which was when he was bestowed an Immortal-rank magic treasure.”
The old black bull said. “Afterwards, Immortal Juhua collected a
large amount of materials, over the course of which he defeated the
Thousand Swords Immortal. After acquiring the hundreds of flying
swords from the Thousand Swords Immortal…he finally forged me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said, curious,
“Senior, what rank of a magic treasure are you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An Immortal-rank
magic treasure, of course.” The old black bull said arrogantly. “I
am an Immortal-rank magic treasure. I have already surpassed the
levels of Human, Earth, and Heaven; thus, I gained sentience.
Immortal Juhua relied on me to establish his awe-inspiring fame!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Fiendgod body
is only at the Xiantian lifeform level. To acquire magic treasures,
you’ll have to achieve victory in the Wargod Hall.” The old black
bull said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were two methods
to acquiring the treasures of the Treasure Hall. The first was to
rise in power as a Fiendgod. The second was to challenge the Wargod
Hall, which had ten stages in total.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one succeeded in
overcoming the first or second stage of the Wargod Hall, one was
allowed to choose a Mortal-rank magic treasure or another item of
equivalent value.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one succeeded in
overcoming the third or fourth stage of the Wargod Hall, one was
allowed to choose an Earth-rank magic treasure or another item of
equivalent value.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one succeeded in
overcoming the fifth or sixth stage of the Wargod Hall, one was
allowed to choose a Heaven-rank magic treasure or another item of
equivalent value.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one succeeded in
overcoming the seventh or eighth stage of the Wargod Hall, one was
allowed to choose an Immortal-rank magic treasure or another item of
equivalent value.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one succeeded in
overcoming the ninth or tenth stage of the Wargod Hall, one was
allowed to choose a Pure Yang magic treasure or another item of
equivalent value.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fiendgod
practitioners who had inherited the manor were each given two chances
to challenge the Wargod Hall at each level of power. For example,
Ning was now a Xiantian lifeform as a Fiendgod. He had two chances to
go challenge the Wargod Hall. Once his Fiendgod form reached the Zifu
level, he would gain two more chances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiantian, Zifu,
Wanxiang, Primordial, Void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Before becoming an
Immortal, he would only have ten chances! Each chance was
incomparably precious!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Challenging the
Wargod Hall is too hard.” The old black bull shook his head and
sighed. “But this is the second way in which one can acquire a
treasure of the Treasure Hall. Even though it is hard, you’ll have
to try.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is indeed hard.”
Ning nodded. Even Immortal Juhua had only overcome the seventh stage
of the Wargod Hall after having become a Loose Immortal and spent
countless years training.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby old black
bull said, “I watched you training in Serpentwing Lake with your
sword. I don’t want to discourage you, but…for you to challenge
the first level with your current level of power? You’d have less
than a ten percent chance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Less than ten
percent?” Ning didn’t dare believe it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Wargod Hall had ten
levels in total. The first two levels only allowed him to select a
Mortal-rank magic treasure. He had trained with the sword at
Brightheart Island…which was within the scope of the Aquatic Manor,
and so the old black bull knew exactly how strong he had become. But
he was now saying that if Ning went to the Wargod Hall, he would have
less than ten percent chance of victory?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Treasure Hall.
Divine Abilities Hall. Wargod Hall. Stellar Hall.” The old black
bull said. “The Treasure Hall is a place where, for now ,you won’t
be able to acquire a single treasure. You aren’t able to enter the
Divine Abilities Hall yet either. You’ll have to go to one of the
other two halls.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wargod Hall…perhaps
you can give it a try. If you succeed, you’ll be able to select a
magic treasure. It will definitely be far superior to the ranked
magic treasures you currently have. But of course, if you lose, that
means that you’ll have wasted a chance to challenge the Wargod
Hall.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Stellar Hall is
filled with countless paths of the Dao, and is an excellent place for
gaining insight into it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Which place shall
you go to?” The old black bull looked towards Ning.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, since you
said that I have less than a ten percent chance of passing through
the Wargod Hall’s challenge, why should I make the attempt?” Ji
Ning said. “In addition, Immortal Juhua gained the greatest benefit
from this Stellar Hall. I’m quite curious about it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he spoke, Ning
stepped into a room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the treasures of
the Treasure Hall? If he couldn’t touch them, what was the point?
Immortal Juhua himself had only acquired a single Immortal-rank magic
after having become a Loose Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Best to take things
one step at a time.” Ning knew his own limits.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He left the Treasure
Hall and headed out through a corridor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Treasure Hall was
at the frontmost part of the corridor, while the Stellar Hall was at
the rearmost.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
followed while speaking constantly. “The Stellar Hall contains
within it miraculous profundities, and by training within it, it is
much easier to gain insights into the Dao. If you aren’t carefully,
you’ll easily lose yourself in training…it seems as though in the
outside world, you were rather frantic. I imagine you must have
important business to attend to. Don’t let yourself become lost in
meditating on the Dao within the Stellar Hall and delay your
important affairs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah!” Ning was
startled, then hurriedly said with gratitude, “Thank you for the
reminder, senior.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had nearly caused
himself to miss the critical affairs coming up!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although meditating on
the Dao was important, if he lost one or two days meditating on the
Dao, by the time he woke up and left…it would all be too late.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter what.”
Ning instructed the old black bull. “As soon as the sky grows dark
in the outside world, if I’m still in the Stellar Hall meditating
on the Dao, then I would like to ask you to immediately disrupt my
meditation and awaken me, senior.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If the sky grows
dark in the outside world? That means only twelve hours are
remaining.” The old black bull said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, twelve hours!
If I begin to meditate on the Dao…at most allow me to meditate on
it for twelve hours.” Ning said hurriedly. “After twelve hours,
immediately awaken me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Based on Ning’s
calculations, generally speaking, Zifu Disciples who were flying on
magic treasures would be able to travel a hundred thousand kilometers
in a day. But of course, that was normal flight; if they didn’t
rest and didn’t sleep and also didn’t worry about using up their
elemental energy, one could fly nearly two hundred thousand
kilometers in a day. Swallow Mountain, in turn, was only a few tens
of thousands kilometers in size…a roundtrip to see the other
disciples of Snowdragon Mountain and return with them would take…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ji Ninefire had
said, most likely just a day or two!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning would only be able
to spend twelve hours meditating on the Dao. He absolutely couldn’t
afford to go over!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry at
all.” The old black bull raised his head, looking like a guard.
“Once twelve hours pass, I will immediately awaken you! We spirits
of magic treasure…will never forget tasks that are assigned.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, senior.”
Ning laughed, then headed to the main entrance of the Stellar Hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was different from
the other three halls, which all had large bronze doors. The gate to
the Stellar Hall was seemingly made out of wood, and it emanated an
ancient, natural aura. The old black bull, seeing Ning inspect the
towering wooden door, murmured to himself, “This is the Ageless
Bluefire Wood which only exists in the Nine Hells. It is a precious,
spiritual wood which is very useful in making Immortal-rank magic
treasures, but it was used to make a large gate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is it possible to
dismantle the gate?” Ning was curious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If it was, Immortal
Juhua would have done so long ago.” The old black bull said,
resigned. “This gate is part of the entire Aquatic Manor; it is
part of the entire magic treasure. There’s no way to move it at
all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stroked the wooden
gate. The wood was covered with a cold, abyssal light, but when
touching it, it felt warm and gave off a comfortable sensation. Ning
sighed emotionally…the Ageless Bluefire Wood which only the Nine
Hells possessed? Alright, then…these were things which he had never
even heard of before the old black bull had introduced it to him. He
had experienced too little.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This really is…”
Passing through the corridor and through the wooden gate, Ning felt
breathless. The sight in front of him completely stunned him. “This
really is utterly inconceivable. The works of a god. The works of a
god!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In front of him, in the
distance, was a large mountain. The mountain was filled with life,
with a large number of trees and other vegetation growing everywhere.
At the base of the mountain, the life suddenly disappeared; it was an
area were virtually not a single inch of grass would grow. Only very
occasionally, within a patch of strewn rocks, would one see a few
strands of grass. At the base of the mountain, there was a straw hut.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In front of the straw
hut, there was a creek. The creek flowed down from the mountain, and
it winded downwards in a curvy path, constantly flowing. It was only
in the area wherever the creek flowed that some wild grass could
occasionally be seen. The other places were virtually all covered
with wild, desolate stones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In midair, there was
one enormous, brilliant star after another. The starlight filled the
world, causing every place to seem rather illusory.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that this
is an entire world?” Ning couldn’t help but say.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is its own
dimension.” The old black bull followed him in and sighed, “This
is a dimension which the first master created within the Stellar
Hall! This dimension is connected with the gate of the Stellar Hall.
Thus, when we stepped through it, we entered the special space. I’ve
heard it said that some great powers of the ancient past were able to
create an entire dimension within a single grain of sand. The first
master most likely had this ability as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unfathomable! Although
when he was young, he had heard of some legends, such as ‘Houyi
Shooting the Son’ and other such legends, when had he ever seen
them in person? After all, those things were a long, long distance
away from him. As for creating a dimension? Generally speaking,
people created a dimension, then an estate within their own
dimension.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Aquatic Manor was
itself a separate dimension…but the secondary halls actually were
able to once again merge with another dimension. Although Ning didn’t
understand it too well, he understood that accomplishing something
like this was an incredible feat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I really wonder who
the first owner of this Aquatic Manor was.” Ning said to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, come, come.
The ‘treasure’ is within the straw hut.” The old black bull
urged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The straw hut?”
Ning strode forward by a few dozen paces, quickly arriving at the
straw hut. The straw hut was at the base of the mountain, a seemingly
very ordinary straw hat, and with stone furniture inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After entering the
straw room…Ning was stunned. He saw that on the table of the straw
room, there were multiple tomes, all of which were black. Ning
couldn’t recognize any of them, and so he opened one. On the
surface of the books, there were some beautiful Fiendgod characters:
[Stellar Scroll] [Stellar Scroll 2] [Stellar Scroll 3]….there were
forty three scrolls in total.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is…?” Ning
stared at these books.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
explained, “These are the manuals left behind by the first owner.
The name of it is the ‘Stellar Hall’ and there are a total of
forty three parts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning lifted up the
Stellar Scroll and flipped through it. The pages were black, while
the words were in golden Fiendgod strict. The contents were rather
puzzling as well…it felt like hastily scribbled notes! There wer
like casual recordings which described personal feelings! Ning
originally had taken them to be profound books and was rather
surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you want to
read!” The old black bull said hurriedly. “At a simple glance,
there are no mysteries and nothing mysterious to the contents. But if
you fully read everything…you will discover how extraordinary it
is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, startled, picked
up the [Stellar Scrolls].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go outside the room
to read. Sit on that stone bench over there.” The old black bull
said. “Read aloud!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But I don’t
recognize Fiendgod characters.” Ning asked. Although he could
recognize Fiendgod characters at first glance, and understood which
human words matched each Fiendgod word, the two were different
languages after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just use your own
race’s language to read. That is what Immortal Juhua did in the
past.” The old black bull said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning held
the tome in his hand and walked out of the straw hut. He seated
himself at the stone table, where the first master might have sat
countless years ago and where Immortal Juhua might have sat as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning flipped open the
book and began to read.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Today, Chang came to
pay his respects to me…” Ning began to read, puzzlement in his
heart regarding these casual personal recordings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single sound was
very ordinary, but once the words were read out, the sound of the
large number of words connected…in a manner that was like a song,
capable of moving a person’s heart, causing pain, amazement,
sorrow, and more. The sounds of these words were unfathomable; just
by reading them out, the sound of these words seemed to contain a
ringing, miraculous power…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly, they drew Ning
into a unique world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he became absorbed
with seeing this world, Ning forgot that he was holding the [Stellar
Scroll] in his hands. He stared at the countless stones of the
desolate region, at the creek filled with life energy, as though
seeing a pair of ‘Daos’. Daos filled with boundless profundities.
Even the small grass which was growing out carried another sort of
Dao within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stars in the sky
were brilliant. Each of them were incomparably bright, and they each
gave Ning a different feeling. Suddenly…Ning stared at one
particular star, one which caused Ning to feel familiar and
intoxicated by it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Longing, warmth…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning seemed to be once
more lying ont hat little boat of his, drifting atop Serpentwing
Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He also seemed to be in
his mother’s arms…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That longing, that
warmth…it filled his entire heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
stared wide-eyed as it watched. “Truly inconceivable. This this
this this…he actually completely read nearly the entire first
scroll before halting? This Ji Ning really is at quite a high level
of understanding. He was actually able to read so many characters.
Most likely, he’s become emeshed on an extremely deep layer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
understood this very well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This book was nothing
more than a sort of ‘guide’, guiding the consciousness of
practitioners on an extremely deep level to gain certain insights.
The more words one read, the deeper a level of insight gaining one
would reach! But of course…how much one would gain from it would
depend on how many experiences that person had built up normally in
life. Good preparation was the key to success; only by normally
accumulating experiences would one have sudden insights.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Which star is he
looking at?” The old black bull saw Ning raise his head to stare at
the sky. He couldn’t help but feel curious “According to what
Juhua said, every single star contains a different Dao.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A calm smile was on
Ning’s face, as though he were by the side of his mother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That smile contained an
inexhaustible charisma…when the old black bull saw Ning’s smile,
he seemed to feel even his own heart grow warm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a form of
longing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A mental warmth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword.” The old
black bull stared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning rose to his feet,
leaving the stone table. He pressed his forefinger and middle finger
together into the shape of a ‘sword’, then began to brandish them
about in training swordplay within the Stellar Hall. This was a type
of swordplay that contained inexhaustible, endless longing…Ning
didn’t release any rays of sword-light, nor did he use any
elemental energy; this was seemingly a very ordinary display of
swordplay.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But it made the old
black bull sense the boundless longing contained within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull was
able to sense the surrounding Serpentwing Lake area. He knew that
over the past few years, Ning had gained insights into many hints
regarding the True Meaning of the Dao, the majority of which belonged
to a longing-type sword intention.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It changed.” The
old black bull instantly saw how Ning’s swordplay had become purer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rustle…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the area around
Ning, who wasn’t using any elemental energy at all in executing
this swordplay with just his fingers, suddenly appeared drops of
rain. One drop of rain after another came to form, and they
constantly fell. The rain fell nonstop, landing atop the scattered
stones…and Ning, in the center of the rainstorm, was like the
favored son of the rain, which surrounded him and protected him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This this this…”
The old black bull stared. “Accumulated effort which results in
sudden rewards!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The accumulated hints
of insight into the True Meaning of the Dao which Ning had gained
over the past five years, at this moment…finally made a qualitative
breakthrough!
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_4___Rainwater_Sword_Doma"></A>
Chapter 4 - Rainwater Sword Domain
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The raindrops were
sprinkling downwards. Ji Ning, amidst the rain, was completely
absorbed in his swordplay. His sword-fingers alone were able to
execute a sword technique that activated the ‘Dao’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How comfortable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt as though, in
this moment, he himself had become a drop of rainwater! He was
swirling about, playing and jesting with the other droplets of rain,
and joining with them to form a single strand of it. That sort of
interconnected-ness and mutual affection…caused the countless drops
of rain to all join together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rustle…..” The
sprinkling rain surrounding Ning transformed into countless drops of
rain which transformed into a drizzling rain. The countless
crystalline strands of rain appeared all the more mesmerizing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single strand of
rain seemed to secretly be like a knife.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…” The
rain grew heavier and heavier, transforming into a tempest. The
tempest seemed incomparably ferocious, and Ning’s swordplay carried
a ferocious, unstoppable power as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
stared, stupefied. Rain drops, rain drizzle, tempest…and in the
end, the rainwater once more transformed into that sprinkling,
drizzling rain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One line of rain after
another…they seemed like incomparably precious, crystalline jade
sculptures that were carved into thin lines. They were also like the
hands of a mother, gently stroking down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, Ning came to a
halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…is Dao?”
Ning murmured to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations, Ji
Ning.” The old black bull’s mouth was hanging wide open, and he
was incomparably excited. “You have already truly immersed yourself
into the Dao, truly and complete. The feeling of becoming part of the
Dao itself is very marvelous, isn’t it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded gently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just now, that feeling
had indeed been incredible. He was like a pearl of water, a droplet
of rain! In that instant, he felt incomparably familiar to and close
with the rainwater. Ning understood…that he had developed his own
Dao. The Dao of Rainwater!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Over the past five
years, you have gained insights into many strands of the True Meaning
of the Dao. Your accumulated insights have allowed you to break
through to a new threshold, with the final result being that you have
gained a ‘Dao Domain’.” The old black bull sighed in praise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dao Domain?” Ning
looked puzzled. “What is that?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
said, astonished, “You don’t even know this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No idea.” Ning
said honestly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
sighed, shaking his head. “Your clan really is an ordinary one. You
don’t even have a basic understanding of the different levels of
insight. I’ll tell you, then. In training, one aspect is improving
on a technical level; be it sword, saber, spear, or even painting and
music and other artistic endeavors, technique matters. The first
level is the ‘foundation’! Which is to say, becoming familiar
with the basic techniques of an art. The second level is the
‘advanced’ level; it represents that you have all but perfected
your mastery of the techniques. The third level is ‘one with the
world’; this represents that you are already getting close to the
‘Dao’, and have begun to attune to heaven’s will.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning listened.
Naturally, he knew about these first three levels.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After ‘one with
the world’, the next step is in attuning with the intricacies of
the natural world, and slowly discovering one of the ‘Daos’. Once
you discover it! You will have gained a hint of the ‘True Meaning
of the Dao’. That is the fourth level; ‘True Meaning of the
Dao’.” The old black bull shook his head. “It is very hard to
gain insight into a ‘True Meaning of the Dao’. Even some Zifu
Disciples aren’t capable of doing it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning had been
meditating on the Dao by the side of the pool that year, he gained
his first insight into a ‘True Meaning of the Dao’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Afterwards, when you
continue to gain insight and continuously accumulate many more hints
of the ‘True Meaning of the Dao’, your insights into the Dao will
grow greater and greater. There will then come a day when the many
hints of the ‘True Meaning of the Dao’ will coalesce and then
transform qualitatively. Only then will you truly be able to become
one with the Dao itself, to the point where, with but a thought, you
can summon the power of the Dao in your surroundings, to form it into
your own Domain. This is the fifth level; ‘Dao Domain’. This is
the level you are currently at. Formidable, formidable.” The old
black bull sighed. “Only very few Wanxiang Adepts are capable of
reaching this level; generally speaking, only people at the
Primordial Daoist level are capable of reaching this level of insight
into the Dao.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh? I’m that
amazing?” Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your innate talents
are extremely high, especially your talents as pertain to the sword.
You are an absolute monster! With the assistance of the Stellar Hall,
at the young age of 16, you’ve actually reached this level!” The
old black bull said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He possessed the [Nuwa
Painting] and was incomparably hard-working. He also had an innately
high comprehension ability, and also the Aquatic Estate…there were
many variables which contributed to him being able to achieve what he
had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And above the Dao
Domain?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Above it…” The
old black bull looked at Ning. “Reaching the ‘Dao Domain’
level, after all, just means that you are able to completely immerse
yourself into the Dao. What you need to do is to gain greater
insights into this Dao of yours, with the end result being that one
day, you will have completely understood and mastered this entire Dao
Path! That is the sixth level; completely understanding an entire Dao
Path!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now began to
understand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed, just now, he
had completely immersed himself with the rainwater, but that was
nothing more than immersion; he was still far off from being able to
completely control the ‘Dao of Rainwater’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first level is
the ‘basic’ level. The second is ‘advanced’. The third is
‘one with the world’. The fourth is ‘True Meaning of the Dao’.
The fifth is ‘Dao Domain’. The sixth is a complete ‘Dao Path’!”
The old black bull said solemnly. “The level of comprehension and
enlightenment one possesses is very important. Only by having
sufficient comprehension will one’s power increase. Otherwise,
there is no way you’ll be able to withstand and control great
power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To become a
Celestial Immortal, you have to completely control a Dao Path!” The
old black bull looked at Ning. “For example, Immortal Juhua had
been a Loose Immortal for millions of years, and had completely
mastered nine full Dao Paths. But so what if he did? The increasingly
powerful Three Calamities, Nine Tribulations still caused him to fall
in the end. Anyone who becomes a Loose Immortal is guaranteed to
fall.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sighed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You train in the
sword, and have reached the level of ‘Dao Domain’. Generally
speaking, your Domain will be referred to as a ‘Sword Domain.’”
The old black bull reminded. “Just based on the fact that you have
a Sword Domain, countless major sects will swing open their doors for
you to join.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword Domain?”
Ning said softly. “This Dao is the Dao of Rainwater. Let my Sword
Domain therefore be known as the ‘Rainwater Sword Domain’, then.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at his
surroundings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rustle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rainwater appeared out
of nowhere, sprinkling downwards and swirling about him. Every single
line of rain also seemed like an incomparably sharp arrow, enough to
slice apart hard mountain stones or steel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me warn you.
Just now, when you immersed yourself into the Sword Domain, eight
hours went past in the outside world.” The old black bull said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eight hours?” Ning
was startled. “I really didn’t have any sense of time passing
when I was immersed in the Dao. Right, Elder. Now that I have my
Rainwater Sword Domain…if I were to challenge the first level of
the Wargod Hall, do I have a chance?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull was
stunned. “The first level of the Wargod Hall? Right, you can give
it a try!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if the old black
bull hadn’t said anything, Ning would have still gone and given it
a try, because a Fiendgod practitioner only had two chances at each
level of power to challenge the Wargod Hall. He had already reached
the peak of power as a Xiantian Fiendgod, and would most likely soon
break through to the Zifu level. If he didn’t use the two options
he had at the Xiantian level, they would go to waste once he reached
the Zifu level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go. I want
to see how formidable this Wargod Hall is.” Ning was extremely
eager and deeply desired to successfully make it through, so as to be
able to go to the Treasure Hall to select a treasure!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The treasures of the
Treasure Hall were all left behind by the first master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the Mortal-ranked
magic treasures were most likely extraordinary, and might be of great
benefit for the Ji clan’s battle against Snowdragon Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snowdragon
Mountain.” Ning murmured in his heart…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">___________________________
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was already dark,
and Zifu Disciple ‘Muse’ of the Swallow Mountain branch of
Snowdragon Mountain had flown without stopping at all for tens of
thousands of kilometers to arrive at this place. Like a ray of light,
he charged downwards to an estate below.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Below was a large,
towering mountain. The name of the mountain was Landwyrm Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Human practitioner,
immediately depart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Human practitioner,
you actually dare invade our Landwyrm Mountain? Are you looking to
die?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Muse descended
towards Landwyrm Mountain on his flying treasure, some of the
Diremonsters of Landwyrm Mountain began to curse angrily. Landwyrm
Mountain was a powerful force, and the top of the mountain was an
ancient Zifu-level monster who had trained for a thousand years,
‘Landwyrm’. Landwyrm was a Godbeast, and as a Zifu-level
Godbeast, one could imagine how powerful this old monster was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Naturally, he commanded
a large group of Diremonsters, and this was forbidden grounds for
humans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Zifu-level ancient
monster, and with the lineage of a Godbeast. These two things
guaranteed that many Zifu Disciples would be frightened of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Jadechild, your junior apprentice-brother Muse
requests a meeting.” Muse didn’t pay any attention to those
Diremonsters, flying straight to the top of Landwyrm Mountain before
speaking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grooooooowl.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous draconic
head suddenly emerged from a cave at the top of the mountain. That
azure draconic head had a single horn atop it, and its wheel-sized
eyes stared towards Muse. The incomparable aura alone the draconic
head emanated…caused Muse to feel nervous. He knew very well that
he wasn’t a match at all for this Landwyrm in front of him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Landwyrm before him
was a peak Zifu monster, with the lineage of a Godbeast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My respects, Daoist
friend Landwyrm.” Muse bowed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master hates to be
disturbed. Can it be that you do not know this?” The Landwyrm
growled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s something
major happening.” Muse said hurriedly. “I have major news to
report to senior apprentice-brother Jadechild, news which will be of
great benefit to him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jadechild…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Out of the many people
which the Swallow Mountain branch of Snowdragon Mountain were
inviting over, he was the most important person. As Dong Ziqi and
Muse saw it, as long as they were able to invite their fellow
apprentice, Jadechild, that was enough; he alone could easily
annihilate the Ji clan by himself. Actually, just by looking at this
spirit-beast, the Landwyrm, which Jadechild controlled, one could
imagine how powerful Jadechild was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that Zifu-level spirit-beasts were extremely rare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although many human
experts had some Diremonsters as spirit-beasts, that was because
there were a fairly high number of humans with the insights necessary
to break through to the Zifu level. But for a spirit-beast to break
through to the Zifu level was much rarer! Ancient Zifu-level monsters
generally weren’t willing to serve, and if they were willing to
serve, it was generally only experts. Even if they served a weakling,
a powerful expert would soon seize them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi. Muse. Ji
Ninefire. None of them had a Zifu-level spirit-beast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You wish to see me?”
A deep, powerful voice rang out, and a muscular man with long, loose
azure hair, a pair of tiger-like eyes, and black clothes moved out
from one side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My respects, senior
apprentice-brother.” Muse hurriedly bowed respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve seen you
before. You are Muse.” Jadechild looked at him. “Can it be that
you aren’t aware that I am in closed door training in an attempt to
make a breakthrough?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Muse felt his heart
tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew exactly how
terrifying this senior apprentice-brother Jadechild of his was.
Jadechild was a Fiendgod Body Refiner who had reached the peak of the
Zifu level! In addition, Jadechild had also learned the divine
ability, ‘Heavenly Transformation’. A peak Zifu-level Fiendgod
practitioner was already very frightening; being in possession of a
divine ability meant they could fight someone at a higher level than
themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi himself was
nervous in front of this fellow apprentice, Jadechild. He was the
most important person they were inviting on this venture.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Jadechild.” Muse said hurriedly. “I know that
you are in closed door training and don’t like to be disturbed.
However, not too far from here, at the nearby Swallow Mountain, we’ve
discovered a large-scale elemental ore mine, with very many high
quality elemental stones. The mine has a circumference of four
thousand kilometers and a depth of three hundred kilometers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What!” Jadechild,
who had been very calm up to now, suddenly had his eyes explode with
two rays of golden light. “Your words are true?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I’ve deceived
you, senior apprentice-brother Jadechild, you can go ahead and kill
me with one palm blow.”

Chapter 5 - A Wooden Stake
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine you
wouldn’t dare deceive me.” Jadechild nodded slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Muse said hurriedly,
“Although we have discovered this enormous elemental ore mine, this
elemental ore mine is within the territory of the Ji clan. The puny
Ji clan wasn’t worth fearing, and our Swallow Mountain branch
should have been able to easily exterminate it, but…” Muse
explained what had happened afterwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jadechild frowned as he
listened. “A bewildering formation?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Ji clan’s
Patriarch, Ji Ninefire, is skilled in formations and poisons.” Muse
said hurriedly. “This time, we have invited all our colleagues to
go deal with the Ji clan. The Ji clan’s strength isn’t worth
fearing. Only, in formations…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If they set a great
formation…” Jadechild frowned. “Since we are not skilled in
formations, they can easily delay for a long period of time. Once
enough time passes, the Grand Xia Dynasty’s Celestial Envoy will
most likely arrive! Of the formation experts close to the Swallow
Mountain region…there is a junior apprentice-brother named
‘Nongdao’. If we can invite that fellow apprentice, the
formations that a small clan like the Ji clan is capable of using
will easily be broken!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Muse nodded hurriedly.
“We have invited fellow apprentice Nongdao as well. Now that you,
senior apprentice-brother Jadechild, have spoken, I imagine Nongdao
will go as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry and go invite
junior apprentice-brother Nongdao.” Jadechild instructed. “I will
go to your Swallow Mountain region right now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, senior
apprentice-brother.” Muse was overjoyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. Go.” Jadechild
instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A green leaf-type magic
treasure suddenly appeared beneath Muse’s feet, and then he
transformed into a ray of light, disappearing into the horizon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jadechild stared into
the distance, silent for some time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Landwyrm.”
Jadechild turned and shouted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” An azure
scale covered, horned Landwyrm clambered out. This Landwyrm had four
claws, and was an imposing, majestic sight. Currently, his body was
rapidly shrinking, until he was only ten meters long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, follow me to
Swallow Mountain.” Jadechild said softly. “If we render major
merits this time, perhaps we can use the opportunity to ask the main
sect to assist me in making a breakthrough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jadechild was something
of a rogue practitioner. He had reached the Zifu level as a Ki
Refiner long ago, but the technique he had used to train in ki was a
fairly superficial one. This made it so that it was almost impossible
for him to break through to become a Wanxiang Adept as a Ki Refiner!
Afterwards, he slowly trained as a Fiendgod Refiner until he broke
through to the Zifu level as well…he could be considered a talented
figure, which is why he was accepted into Snowdragon Mountain!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unfortunately, he was
already a late-stage Ki Refiner. There was no way back for him, and
it was too late to change to a different technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, the long
amount of time he had spent in training resulted in him developing a
fierce, decisive temperament. After accomplishing a major deed, he
was viewed upon favorably by the main sect, and he was given a divine
ability, ‘Heavenly Transformation’. This caused his status to
rise once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nowadays…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He always stayed in
closed-door training, because he wanted his Fiendgod body to
breakthrough to the Wanxiang level! Only, each major increase in
level was too difficult. Although the main sect did indeed have
methods by which the chances of breakthroughs could increase, the
price was great; why would they be willing to help him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You will definitely
succeed, Master.” The Landwyrm crawled out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jadechild sat on the
Landwyrm’s back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clouds appeared beneath
the feet of the Landwyrm, and it immediately flew into the distant
horizons. All dragons were naturally capable of controlling water,
and although this one was only at the Zifu level…it was still able
to summon the clouds and fly on them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the ancient
Aquatic Manor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and the old
black bull were walking shoulder-to-shoulder out of the Stellar Hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is indeed much
faster to train and gain insights in the Stellar Hall.” Ning sighed
in praise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Stellar Hall is
effective in assisting one in comprehension.” The old black bull
said. “But in the end, it still depends on your normal accumulated
experiences. Only after you experience many things will you gain many
insights. Normally, you randomly accumulate many different
experiences…and you yourself won’t even notice it, but once you
enter the Stellar Hall and begin to train in gaining further
insights, you will improve greatly. But without those normal,
everyday experiences…if you stay all the time in the Stellar Hall,
it will be pointless.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the saying went,
read ten thousand books, then go on an actual journey of ten thousand
kilometers. Personal experiences and insights were what mattered
most.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re at the
Wargod Hall.” The old black bull stood in front of the Wargod Hall.
The bronze gate of the Wargod Hall had the carves of a waraxe and a
spear above it, and a martial aura emanated forth from it. In
addition, the entire bronze gate was covered with a faint layer of
red light, which carried within it an aura of slaughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning held his breath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” Ning
hurriedly asked. “In the past, what did Immortal Juhua experience
when he passed the first level of the Wargod Hall?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No point in asking.”
The old black bull shook its head. “The dangers of the first level
of the Wargod Hall are arranged on the fly. They can change at any
time. The spirit of the manor and I learned this long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Ning was
resigned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull said
hurriedly, “Be careful. Although the tests of the Wargod Hall are
meant to sharpen your skills and not to kill you, and although you
are a Fiendgod practitioner and have a low chance of dying inside,
the tests always have an element of danger! Don’t lose your life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry.”
Ning pushed aside the giant bronze gate and strode inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as his hands
touched the bronze gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoosh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blurry red light on
the surface of the bronze gate instantly sucked Ning inside. Ning
disappeared into thin air from in front of the bronze gate, and in
the instant in which he was drawn within, Ning’s eyes instantly
became round and filled with shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, I forgot to tell
you that entering the Wargod Hall is a matter of direct
teleportation.” The old black bull, seeing the stupefied look on
Ning’s face, stared back at him with his own ox-eyes, then began to
laugh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
they arrived at a vast, empty land. The ground was covered with
ground that seemed to be stained with blood. Up ahead, there was a
majestic tower, and the door to the tower glowed with a faint white
light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm?” Ning
immediately saw the giant yellow bear standing not too far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” Ning
hurriedly paid his respects.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
nodded slightly. His formerly uncaring expression seemed to have
softened significantly, and his attitude had become much nicer as
well. “For you to have reached the level of ‘Dao Domain’ at the
age of five is fairly rare, even amongst Fiendgods. Tell me, which
level of the Wargod Hall do you intend to challenge?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can choose?”
Ning was amazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course you can
choose! For example, when the Aquatic Manor’s owner is outside
adventuring, if he returns at the Primordial Daoist level, and he
only has two options to challenge the tower, he naturally won’t
choose the first level.” The giant yellow bear said. “You can, if
you choose, go directly to the highest level of the Wargod Hall,
level ten. But of course, even though the Wargod Hall’s tests
aren’t meant to kill the testers, even the slightest energy ripple
at that level will cause you to instantly disintegrate, leaving not
even your soul.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning rubbed his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fine, then.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Level ten?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even Immortal Juhua
only passed level seven after becoming a Loose Immortal! He couldn’t
even imagine how difficult the tenth level was. Ning only felt as
though the original, ancient Fiendgod who had created this Aquatic
Manor was simply too powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I choose the first
level.” Ning said honestly. Based on what the old black bull had
said, before he had mastered his Rainwater Sword Domain, his chances
of succeeding on the first level were less than 10%. One could
imagine how difficult the first level was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” The giant
yellow bear nodded. “At least you are doing things step-by-step.
This is you first challenge, and this test will be the easiest of
tests.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Easiest?” Ning was
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear’s
furry paws suddenly grabbed Ning by the arm. Whoosh! Instantly, Ning
and the giant yellow bear arrived at the majestic tower. The tower
gate glowed with blurry white light as Ning and the giant yellow bear
stepped inside with a single step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a blurry white
space that was three thousand meters high and with a circumference of
many thousands of meters. The only thing present was that floating
door behind them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the first
level of the Wargod Hall.” The giant yellow bear said. Ning
immediately looked carefully at his surroundings. The first level of
the Wargod Hall? Then where was the dangerous test?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look.” The giant
yellow bear stood there, pointing into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning followed the giant
yellow bear’s finger with his gaze. He saw that out of nowhere, a
black wooden stake had suddenly appeared. The wooden stake was as
thick as Ning’s legs, and was three meters tall. It just stood
there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A wooden stake?”
Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The test that I’ll
give you is significantly easier than the test which I originally
gave Immortal Juhua or Rampart.” The giant yellow bear said. “The
first test of the Wargod Hall is…in the time it takes for a single
incense stick to burn up, split that wooden stake apart!” The giant
yellow bear’s palm suddenly had an incense stick within it, only
roughly one foot long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shatter the wooden
stake before the incense stick burns up?” Ning looked at the wooden
stake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No wonder the spirit of
the manor said that this was the easiest test. It was even easier
than the one which Juhua and Rampart had to undergo! Indeed, it was
just a matter of splitting a wooden stake. There wasn’t any danger
at all. In addition, the wooden stake just stood there, not resisting
at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Begin.” The giant
yellow bear said. That incense stick appeared on the floor not too
far away, already lit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A single incense
stick…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t dare to
waste any time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, with a ‘swoosh’,
scurried before the wooden stake. Although it was only a wooden
stake, blindly striking it was just foolishness. It was better to
spend some time to first analyze it…and see where the wooden stake
would more easily break apart. Only by knowing one’s self and one’s
enemies would one have hope for victory. This wooden stake was
completely black, and it had circles of characters covering it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Would it be easier
to follow the pattern of the runes in striking it?” Ning said to
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haaargh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Darknorth swords
appeared in Ning’s hands, and the divine power in his Zifu
completely exploded forth. Whooooooooosh. Drizzling rain appeared in
the surrounding area. The drizzling rain merged into lines of rain
which swirled about the area, making it quite comfortable and cool.
This also clearly caused Ning’s control over the surrounding ‘Dao’
to become much more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rain Line!” Ning
used his most powerful attack at the very start!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s swords flashed
like lightning, disappearing into thin air as they completely merged
into the surrounding, billowing lines of rain. Ning’s sword light
transformed into one of the strands of rain, as thin as silk,
incomparably sharp, instantly chopping towards the wooden stake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” The only
thing which occurred was a white smudge appeared on the wooden stake.
As the rainwater fell down, the white smudge disappeared, as though
nothing had happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning himself, because
of the powerful counterforce, knocked backwards, and the palm of his
hands split open. He took three step backwards, but instantly the
wound to his palm was healed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just a white smudge.
This wooden stake is indeed incomparably tough. To break it in the
time it takes for an incense stick to burn is very hard.” Ning
instantly charged forward and gave it another blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It, too, was ‘Rain
Line’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword merged into
the lines of rain…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as it touched
the wooden stake, a powerful concussive sound once more rang out, but
this time, Ning chopped in accordance with the magical runes.
Although he was still knocked backwards by the collisive force, Ning
found to his surprised delight…that there was a hint of a very
small wound on the wooden stake. The wound was very small, almost
neglible, but it was still there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I imagine that by
using this sword strike with my Rainwater Sword Domain…the power is
comparable to the ninth level of the Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation. But this is all I can accomplish?” Ning was stunned.
“Without the Rainwater Sword Domain, I really wouldn’t be able to
do anything to it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew very well
that within the Rainwater Sword Domain, he was like a tiger who had
been given wings; the power of his sword technique had risen by
several levels.”

Chapter 6 - A Bewildering Selection of Magic Treasures
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant giant
yellow bear nodded slightly and mused to himself, “This Ji Ning’s
talent for swordplay is indeed high. That sword blow alone has
already just barely reached the Wanxiang Adept level. But if that’s
all he has, there is no way he will be able to overcome this first
trial. His blows needs to reach the power of a full-force blow from
an early Wanxiang Adept…only then will he be able to break the
wooden stake before a single incense stick burns down!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first level of the
Wargod Hall required that a person have the attack power of an early
Wanxiang Adept in order to be overcome!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was already the
easiest testing method which the spirit of the manor could select. A
true test would also test a person’s battle experience, mentality,
movement abilities, and many other aspects. After all, in a true
battle against a real enemy, would the enemy just stand there like a
block of wood, waiting for someone to split it apart?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even by using my
Rainwater Sword Domain, my Darknorth swords aren’t able to split
this wooden stake.” Ning immediately retracted his Darknorth
swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lesser Ten Thousand
Swords Formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning retreated by
thirty meters, and then out of nowhere, more than seven hundred
sword-type magic treasures suddenly appeared. All of the magic swords
glowed with a blurry white light, and powerful Zifu-level elemental
energy filled each magic sword…after circulating through, the power
condensed next to Ning, into the form of an incomparably fierce sword
light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sword light could
faintly be seen to have the form of a flying sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Originally, when I
fought against Dong Ziqi, I activated these swords with peak
Xiantian-level energy. Now that I use Zifu-level elemental energy to
activate them, the power of the Lesser Ten Thousand Swords Formation
is clearly much enhanced.” Ning could sense the sharpness of this
sword light. This sword light’s own power was most likely
comparable to the earlier, full-strength close-combat blow he
delivered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rainwater Sword
Domain!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A drizzling rain
suddenly appeared around him as the area within three hundred meters
sank into his Rainwater Sword Domain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Ning willed
it, and the sword light by his side instantly vanished, transforming
into a line of rain as well. This line of rain instantly traversed
the distance of thirty meters, slicing down in the direction of the
runes covering the wooden stake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A wound immediately
appeared atop the wooden stake, as the sword light chopped in nearly
to the depth of half a finger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Ning was
overjoyed, and another ray of sword light formed by his side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Swish! Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One ray of sword light
after another flew into and completely merged with Rainwater Sword
Domain, transforming into thin lines of rainwater. The rainwater
sliced directly downwards onto the distant wooden stakes, once more
leaving behind wounds.. It must be understood that the wooden stake
was harder to cut on the inside than on the outside…the elemental
energy within Ning’z Zifu was quickly being used up, as the wound
on the wooden stake grew greater and greater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some time later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“BANG!” A line of
rain sliced across the wooden illar, and the wooden stake snapped in
half. The upper half of the wooden stake fell, descending down to and
smashing against the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success.” Ning
rejoiced. He hurriedly turned his head to look at the incense stick
behind him. A majority of the incense stick was already gone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations on
succeeding.” The giant yellow bear walked across. “Do you wish to
challenge the second level of the Wargod Hall?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was swayed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second level?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It seemed as though
succeeding on the second level of the Wargod Hall only resulted in a
Mortal-ranked magic treasure. The benefit was the same as
successfully passing the first level. The difficulty level…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, how hard is
the second level, compared to the first level?” Ning asked. “How
is the danger level?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course it is much
more dangerous.” The giant yellow bear said directly. “You
overcame the simplest first level test. But from the second level
onwards…it won’t be that simple. It won’t be like just now,
where there was only a block of wood that wouldn’t fight back. In
addition, I won’t give you any advice at all. All you can do is
charge in! Fight! If you feel you are in danger of death, you can
immediately use the control talisman to teleport out. Once you
teleport out, it means you lost!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you willing to
use your second chance to challenge the second level of the Wargod
Hall?” The giant yellow bear looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My second chance?”
Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
said, “I recommend you to use it. You are already at the peak as a
Fiendgod Body Refiner. You might break through at any moment, and if
you do…the two chances you have as a Xiantian-level expert will be
gone. If you don’t use it, it will go to waste.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning pondered for a
moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then I will try it.”
Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go then.” The
giant yellow bear said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning disappeared from
this first level of the Wargod Hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But just ten seconds
later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” Ning once
more appeared at the first level, flying backwards and falling
against the the floor. The furs on his body were all torn apart, and
there were multiple bloody wounds on him, although some of them
healed by the time he landed on the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You lost.” The
giant yellow bear looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success in either
the first or the second level results in just a single Mortal-ranked
magic treasure.” Ning rose to his feet and said angrily. The furs
on his body automatically repaired themselves. “Why is the second
level so difficult?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as he had
entere, he had instantly been attacked by tens of strange beasts
which looked like black panthers. He was caught rather off-guard, and
only after he released his power did he realize that every single
black panther was comparable to Dong Ziqi! He used everything
available to him, but was only able to hold on for ten seconds before
being forced to give up. If he didn’t give up, he would have been
torn into pieces by that group of black panthers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Wargod Hall has
ten levels, each of which is increasingly difficult.” The giant
yellow bear growled. “This was decided by Master. There’s no
point to you complaining.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is there no
difference between passing through the second level and the first
level?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There is a
difference.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
said. “As you have passed the first level, I will give you a large
number of Mortal-ranked magic treasures and items of comparable value
for you to choose from! Some of them are top-grade Mortal-ranked
magic treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you succeed in
challenging the second level, you can choose from any of the
Mortal-ranked magic treasures or items of equivalent value which the
Treasure Hall holds. There are some very unusual, very unique items
there…although they are only Mortal-ranked, they are comparable to
some ordinary Earth-ranked magic treasures, or even more valuable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go, then. Go to the
Treasure Hall.” The giant yellow bear stretched out a furry paw,
grabbing Ning by the arm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two disappeared
into thin air…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Treasure Hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Treasure Hall was
an enormous hall, and high above in the air floated one magic
treasure and unique item after another. Surges of tremendous power
rippled forth…although these ripples were heart-shaking, they were
controlled by the restrictive spells of the first master, and didn’t
injure Ning at all as he stood down below, preparing to make his
selection.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are many magic
treasures and unique items.” The giant yellow bear looked down
towards Ning. Within the bear’s palms, a golden book suddenly
appeared. “This golden book has recorded within it magic treasures
of the Mortal-rank. You can choose from them. Choose.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning accepted the
golden book.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The book only had two
Fiendgod characters atop it: [Precious Treasures]. He opened the
book, and atop the pages were diagrams of precious treasures and
unique items, as well as descriptions of the items.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This really is…”
Ning was stupefied as he read.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Compared with the
magic treasures up above me, the treasures which the Zifu Disciples
of my Swallow Mountain region are just dogshit.” Ning had a feeling
of speechlessness. It was as though he was a farmer militia who
encountered a formal military. The equipment was on a completely
different level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The magic treasures
above him were, at very least, high-grade Mortal-rank! Most were
top-grade Mortal-rank!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Mortal-rank magic
treasures the first master was willing to keep naturally were all
fine items.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These Tri-Poison
Flags are too vicious. With them, a peak Zifu Disciple can fight head
on against a Wanxiang Adept. The power is most likely no weaker than
that of a completed form of the Myriad Wraiths Banner which Bei
Zishan was working on. In addition, the Myriad Wraiths Banner needs
countless people to be tortured to death, but these Tri-Poison Flags
don’t require you to commit such grave sins.” Ning sighed in
amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The evil Daos also had
their own incredible magic treasures. It wasn’t always necessary
for one to commit any sins, yet still allowed items of incredible
power to be made.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This one is
formidable as well. The Nine Yang Swords Formation?” Ning’s eyes
blazed as he looked at it. The most alluring part of it was that this
magic treasure was formed from nine flying swords, each of which was
a high-grade Mortal-rank flying sword!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Nine Yang Swords
Formation is the most suited for you.” The nearby giant yellow bear
said. “Choosing this magic treasure is equivalent to choosing nine
flying swords. Although they are only high-grade Mortal-rank flying
swords, they come from the same source. If you use these nine flying
swords as the a base core for your [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation], the power of it will increase threefold or fivefold!
These nine high-grade Mortal-rank flying swords alone are worth more
than several dozen of your ordinary Mortal-rank flying swords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt desirous as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an excellent
item.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yin Fire Bottle?”
Ning raised an eyebrow. “How vicious.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waterflame Mixed
Element Staff.” Ning felt his pulse race when looking at this one
as well. He controlled fire and water, and was also a Fiendgod Body
Refiner. The Waterflame Mixed Element Staff was very suited for
Fiendgods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Divine Starpoint
Needles? Thirty six needles in a set? My soul is powerful, making it
very suited for controlling large numbers of items.” Ning desired
these as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One magic item after
another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the ones that
weren’t suited for him made him feel desirous. These were all
top-grade indeed! Top-grade! He had killed Bei Zishan and Ju San and
acquired some magic treasures, but compared to these…there was no
way to compare! Ning would be willing to trade dozens of magic
treasures like those for a single one of these.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What Ning didn’t
understand was that these items were viewed by the first master as
‘top-grade’ or ‘high-grade’, but if they were to be ranked in
the modern era, all of them would be viewed as top-grade! Even those
nine flying swords of the Nine Yang Sword Formation…according to
modern standards, they would be viewed as nine top-grade flying
swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wonderful.” Ning
felt his heart itch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He really wanted to
grab a pile of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning began to
understand Immortal Juhua a bit better. The poor Immortal Juhua could
see all these powerful magic treasures, but couldn’t obtain them!
If he could pick one as he pleased, he probably would’ve been able
to survive his tribulation and become a Celestial Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the first
master wanted to help future generations, he didn’t show them any
favoritism. Even if the future generations died…his rules were
still unbreakable. You want magic treasures? Then follow the first
master’s rules.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An ice-sealed
Three-Eyed Firebug Larva? It can be used to raise an entire race of
Three-Eyed Firebugs. An ordinary adult Three-Eyed Firebug is
comparable to a Zifu Disciple? The only flaw is that it requires a
large amount of spirit materials as food, and it also takes a long
time to grow. However, it can also result in the breeding of
incredibly powerful Three-Eyed Firebugs.” Ning’s heart burned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A golem comparable
to an ordinary early Wanxiang Adept? An unkillable golem? The only
flaw is that it requires a large amount of elemental energy to be
used.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Magic treasures. Unique
items.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each of them drove Ning
crazy and moved him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be dazzled.”
The giant yellow bear warned. “The Nine Yang Swords Formation is
the most suitable for you. Nine excellent swords which come from the
same source…it will be very hard for you to find something like
them while adventuring outside. Your [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation] needs a core, and the stronger the swords of its core, the
better.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning flipped through
another page.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Formation techniques?
Ning’s eyelids shot up. Right now, the Ji clan was under tremendous
threat. The best method for dealing with a large group of Zifu
Disciples was using formations! It was formations which could create
miracles!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation. A large formation suitable for guarding a clan
or a sect. A large formation formed from five component formations…”
Ning was moved as soon as he read through this. He hurriedly read
through it carefully, and the joy on his face became even greater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is it, this is
it!” Ning was howling in his heart. “With this, my power will
greatly increase, and the power of the Patriarch and the others will
increase as well.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<BR>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_7___The_Ji_Clan_Gathers"></A>
Chapter 7 - The Ji Clan Gathers
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing this major
formation that was could be used to guard an entire clan or sect, Ji
Ning managed to suppress his excitement and continue reading, despite
the fact that he was mentally howling in excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Perhaps there would be
something even better!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning continued to
flip through this golden book, and one magic treasure after another
appeared, causing Ning’s heart to clench repeatedly! It was
really…really breathtaking. Unfortunately, he couldn’t acquire
them all! He only could choose a single item.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Soaring Serpent
Formation Loop of the Nine Heavens!]” Ning’s eyes lit up as he
carefully inspected the descriptions within. “This formation is
even more complicated than the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation, and
the power is actually even greater. Still, it seems it needs nine
users who are at least be at the Zifu Disciple level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Ning closed
the golden book. The item which was most suitable for the current Ji
clan was naturally a formation technique! There were several that
were comparable to the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation, and two that
were even better than it. But from the current situation, the most
suitable, realistic choie was still the Netherwyrm Heavenlock
Formation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation was formed from five component formations, each
of which a single Zifu Disciple could control. However, if five Zifu
Disciples joined forces…the power of the Netherwyrm Heavenlock
Formation would reach the maximum level!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Ji clan,
including Ning’s father, it had six Zifu Disciples! But his father
would have to use a forbidden technique to release enough power.
Strictly speaking, the Ji clan only had five Zifu Disciples. Given
this…the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation was the best choice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have you chosen?”
The giant yellow bear said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have.” Ning
nodded. “The Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
stared at Ning in astonishment. “Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation?
Did you make a mistake? That is a grand formation suitable for
protecting a clan; once you set it down, you cannot move. Even if you
choose to fight…you still have to set the formation up in advance!
In the future, you will definitely go adventuring outside. If you
suddenly encounter any danger, you won’t have time to set up a
formation, and what’s more, the power of this grand formation when
a single person is controlling is very ordinary. You need five people
working together to reach a high level of power! I urge you to
reconsider. You will have very, very few chances to select an item
from the Treasure Hall. Once you make the choice, there’s no way to
change it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I choose it.” Ning
didn’t hesitate at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” The giant
yellow bear said nothing further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
pointed at a spot in the air far above them, and in the tightly
clustered mass of treasures and artifacts, a ray of light flew out
from an unassuming dark corner that couldn’t even be seen with the
naked eye. It was like a meteor, quickly passing through all
obstructions and landing on the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at it. He
saw four black scales that surrounded a central black pearl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a dragon
pearl.” The giant yellow bear waved his hand, and the black pearl
immediately levitated into the air. The black pearl was covered with
a large amount of runes, and the faint image of a dragon’s shadow
could be seen swimming within it. The complicated runes atop it
seemed to be exceedingly beautiful, completely different from the
crude scrawlings atop ordinary Mortal-rank magic treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation has five parts to it. The core is the dragon
pearl! And then, there is the dragon’s head, the dragon’s body,
the dragon’s claw, and the dragon’s tail. Four secondary parts!”
The giant yellow bear waved his hand again, and those four scales
flew over as well. “They are formed from the scales on the dragon’s
body, which were forged into four formation disks. One dragon pearl,
four formation disks. This forms the complete, five-part Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation. As for the mysteries within, after you bind it
and carefully analyze it, you’ll understand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He stretched his hand
out, accepting the dragon pearl and four formation disks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve already
entered the Wargod Hall, Treasure Hall, and Stellar Hall. Only the
Divine Abilities Hall remains.” The giant yellow bear said. “Work
hard to make your breakthrough. At the latest, make your breakthrough
at age ten. By then, you can challenge the Divine Abilities Hall.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then now…?” The
giant yellow bear looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m heading out.”
Ning didn’t hesitate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
nodded slightly. Whoosh! The bear’s head dramatically increased and
became illusory, swallowing Ning within it. Ning disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing Lake.
Beneath a courtyard within Brightheart Island. There was a lantern
hanging nearby, casting a faint light on the surrounding area. It was
already late at night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why hasn’t the
young master returned?” Autumn Leaf held a flask of wine, standing
behind Ji Yichuan. Yichuan sat down, and behind him was lying a big
white dog, the Godbeast, ‘Whitewater Hound’. Autumn Leaf’s eyes
had a hint of worry within them as well, because Yichuan had been
waiting very long already. “The young master said that others were
not permitted to disturb him, and that his room was to be completely
sealed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was nothing
Autumn Leaf could do. She knew Ning’s temper; if he said he was not
to be disturbed, others absolutely would not dare disturb him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only choice was to
wait.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be
impatient. There is enough time.” Yichuan held a cup of wine and
spoke softly. He was very calm, because the coming battle would be
the most glorious moment of his life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…” The
ground vibrated faintly from far away, and instantly, Autumn Leaf
revealed a look of delight. “The young master should be leaving his
closed quarters.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, a creaaaak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From afar, a door to a
room opened, and a youth clast in beast furs stepped out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan stood up,
frowning slightly as he looked at Ning. He had watched Ning grow up,
and so he could sense any changes Ning went through. He noticed that
the current Ning…seemed to be less ‘sharp’ than before, but in
possession of a hint of the calmness of the water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You were training?”
Yichuan asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slightly.
“I had a breakthrough!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A look of delight and
satisfaction appeared in Yichuan’s eyes. This was his final battle,
and he believed that he would die in it! To be able to, before his
death, see his son increase in power yet again…naturally, he was
incomparably delighted. For his son to be such a monstrous talent…he
could already see the sight of his son’s name being spread
throughout the vast world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Yichuan
just said a single word.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White is going
as well?” Ning looked towards the nearby Whitewater Hound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
nodded towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan glanced a side
at the nearby Whitewater Hound. “Your Uncle White and I are
lifelong brothers. I am prepared to die in this battle; even if I
survive, I will be left a cripple. Before this, I released your Uncle
White and Uncle Black, giving them their freedom…your Uncle Black
has already returned to his mountain forests, but your Uncle White
has chosen to accompany me. Even if he dies, he wishes to die by my
side. I am unable to force him to leave. I simply cannot. For me,
Yichuan, to have a brother like this…even in death, I will feel
proud.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart
trembled. He saw the tears brimming in his father’s eyes, and the
steely, unrelenting look of eternal companionship in his Uncle
White’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good. Let’s go
together.” Ning walked over, embracing the Whitewater Hound, much
like he had always done when he was young and would go out to train
archery. “Uncle White, let’s go together.” The Whitewater Hound
looked back at Ning, and deep love could be seen in his eyes. He had
watched Ning grow up from an infant into an adult. This was the only
son of his lifelong friend, Ji Yichuan. Naturally, he viewed Ning as
a younger family member.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A boat appeared out of
nowhere. Hovering there in midair, it quickly expanded until it
reached a size of more than thirty meters. Ning, Yichuan, and the
Whitewater Hound boarded it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
willed it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The boat quickly began
to fly through the skies, rapidly advancing through the dark night
towards the north.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Back at that desolate
mountain forest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ninefire, Granny
Shadow, the old servant Ah Xing, Ji Truekeep. These four had already
arrived, and had already set up a bewildering formation nearby. Ning
had spent quite a bit of time meditating in the Stellar Hall. The
others had taken care of their matters, then returned. Given the
speed a Zifu Disciple could move at, they had naturally already taken
care of everything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why did you bring
your spirit-beast as well?” Granny Shadow said in a hoarse voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Truekeep stroked the
head of a black eagle. “I didn’t want it to come, but it
insisted. It followed me since it was a chick. All these years, it
has never left me. This time, it refused to leave no matter
what…forget it. We’ve known each other all our lives. The
relationship between the two of us is closer and more familiar than
even the relationship between myself and my wife and children.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire and the others
just looked at him, then nodded gently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a spirit-beast to
willingly accompany a person in braving danger; this was rare indeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yichuan hasn’t
returned yet?” Truekeep stroked the eagle while raising his head to
look. The bewildering formation hadn’t been activated yet;
naturally, his vision was not impacted. Even in the darkness, the
faint light of the moon was more than enough to allow Zifu Disciples
to see to a great distance with the naked eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t be
impatient.” Ninefire said. “We still have quite a bit of time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’d be best if
that kid Ji Ning doesn’t come.” Granny Shadow sighed, speaking in
her hoarse voice. “He insists on coming. He is the true hope of our
Ji clan. Given his latent talent and potential, it shouldn’t be
hard for him to become a Wanxiang Adept, but his temper is too
stubborn.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire laughed, then
said consolingly, “Don’t worry. He has the Traceless Talisman.
When true danger comes, even if he doesn’t leave, we will force him
to.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. We will force
him.” Granny Shadow nodded. “If he doesn’t leave at the
critical moment, I’ll commit suicide right in front of him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough. He knows
what is important.” Ninefire’s eyes lit up. “They are coming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them raised
their heads to look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From afar, in the air,
they saw a ray of light fly over. Only when it began to slow as it
descended could they see clearly what it was; it was a boat. This
boat swiftly descended from the skies, and then, roughly thirty
meters away from the ground, vanished. Ning, Yichuan, and the
Whitewater Hound all landed on the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You brought your
Whitewater Hound as well?” Truekeep laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan glanced over in
surprise as well. “Your Snow Eagle came as well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two glanced at each
other, then both laughed. They both understood why.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. We are all
here.” Ninefire said. “We should prepare to deal with Snowdragon
Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Everyone’s
faces grew a hint more solemn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire spoke out.
“Earlier, I made a special trip to Swallow Mountain City, to pay a
visit to General Dong, who is in charge of the forces stationed
here!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How did it go?”
All of them asked with anticipation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hint of fury was in
Ninefire’s eyes. “Everyone knows General Dong. He is one of the
members of that large, far away clan; the Dong clan! That’s the
reason why he was able to become the commanding general of the Grand
Xia Dynasty’s forces here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. They knew
these things long ago; becoming a general in the Grand Xia Dynasty’s
military…wasn’t something which someone in a small clan like the
Ji clan could hope for. After all, that was, without question, a
wonderful assignment. Once you put on the ‘tiger garb’ of serving
the Grand Xia Dynasty, who would dare offend you?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t want to
offend this General Dong.” Ninefire said. “Unfortunately, when I
wanted to make the report, I was told that General Dong was in closed
door meditation and unable to receive visitors. I went to see the
Deputy General, but I was told the Deputy General had left Swallow
Mountain City and wasn’t here at present.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all grew frantic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Definitely a
delaying tactic. They didn’t want to meet with us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snowdragon Mountain
must have done something.” Ning was frantic as well. The point of
them setting the formation was to delay until the Grand Xia Dynasty’s
Celestial Envoy arrived. But if there was no report filed…how could
the Celestial Envoy come?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire said, “I
couldn’t be bothered with anything else. This matter involves the
fate of our Ji clan. Thus, I no longer cared about whether or not I
was offending General Dong. Thus, I began to shout, sending my voice
echoing throughout the entire Swallow Mountain City…I said that my
Ji clan was willing to offer to the Grand Xia Dynasty an enormous
elemental ore mine! My voice naturally flooded the entire Swallow
Mountain City, and everyone within it, along with all of the
soldiers, all heard my voice. General Dong thus no longer dared to
delay, and so he hurriedly came to see me, his face as black as
thunderclouds, and then angrily shooed me away.”

Chapter 8 - A Wonderful Treasure!
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well-offended.” Ji
Yichuan’s eyes flashed with cold light. “This matter involves the
survival of the Ji clan. How can we be bothered by whether or not we
are offending a garrison general?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ji Ning,
Ji Truekeep, Granny Shadow, and Ah Xing all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Garrison generals
wielded great power. The six hegemons of the Swallow Mountain region
all needed to pay a large amount of tax each year to the Grand Xia
Dynasty. They delivered it directly to Swallow Mountain City! Aside
from the authority to collect taxes, the garrison general was also
responsible for oversight; he was responsible on behalf of the Grand
Xia Dynasty for managing this region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Power over both
oversight and tax collection…if they were really to squabble, these
things would cause the Ji clan to suffer in the future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But that was just
suffering; compared to the possible perishment of the entire clan, it
didn’t matter!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As long as we sign
an agreement with the Grand Xia Dynasty, we would have their
protection. He, a garrison general, wouldn’t be able to do anything
to us.” Ji Ninefire said. “Since everyone is here, I will let you
know that I have already chosen the location for our battle with
Snowdragon Mountain. Let’s head out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where will we battle
with Snowdragon Mountain?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oxhorn Mountain,
located close to the City of Ten Thousand Swords.” Ninefire said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oxhorn Mountain?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was naturally
extremely familiar with the geographical areas around the Ji clan.
Upon hearing what Ninefire said, he immediately understood where they
would be. Oxhorn Mountain was roughly eight hundred kilometers away
from the City of Ten Thousand Swords. It was a large, desolate
mountain. Because the peak of the mountain was split in twain, like
the horns of an ox, it was referred to as ‘Oxhorn Mountain’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve also sent
envoys.” Ninefire said. “They are flying on winged beasts towards
Snowdragon City to idirectly inform them that our Ji clan has set a
grand formation at the base of Oxhorn Mountain. Given the speed at
which my envoys travel at, I imagine that in roughly ten hours, they
will arrive at Snowdragon Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ten hours?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It would probably be
tomorrow at noon, then! It made sense. The winged beasts the envoys
flew on were ordinary, trained animals; it was only natural that they
would not be able to compare with Xiantian-level flying monsters, or
to Zifu Disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will collect this
bewildering formation, and then we will immediately head out.”
Ninefire, afraid of being suddenly attacked, had set up the formation
here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoosh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous gourd
appeared. Ji Ning and the other five, along with the two
spirit-beasts, stood or sat atop the gourd. The gouard flew through
the skies at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Oxhorn Mountain was
roughly three hundred or so kilometers away. They arrived within
moments.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right there.”
Ninefire pointed at the split peak of Oxhorn Mountain below them.
“Land there onto Oxhorn Mountain. We can see everything from there,
and given that the surrounding area is completely desolate…there’s
nothing that can block our line of sight. As long as those Snowdragon
Mountain disciples come, we will immediately see them from far away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Yichuan, and the
others all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They landed from the
skies, then put the gourd away. Ninefire and the others thus landed
atop the mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have already
prepared six formations. They represent my hundreds of years of
painstaking research in analyzing formations.” Ninefire pointed at
the surrounding area. “I’ll only need as much time as it takes to
boil a kettle of tea before I set these formations down. Even if
experts from Snowdragon Mountain who specialize in formations come to
break through them, they will probably need to spend quite some time
to break through six of them. During that period of time, we can also
borrow the power of the formation to launch sneak attacks and
ambushes, one after another, disrupting them from breaking through
the formations! Our goal is to make them waste as much time as
possible. Based on my calculations, the Celestial Envoy of the Grand
Xia Dynasty will arrive in three days. If we can hold for three days,
then once the Celestial Envoy arrives, we will have won!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Once the
Celestial Envoy arrives, they will no longer dare to act.” Granny
Shadow nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if we die, we
have to delay them from breaking through our formation.” Truekeep
nodded solemnly as well. “Our power, compared to that of a large
group of Zifu Disciples of Snowdragon Mountain…if we fight them
head on, there’s no way for us to compete. We have to rely on the
formations! The more time it takes for them to break through our
formations, the greater our chances for victory. Ideally, we should
get rid of the formation experts which Snowdragon Mountain has
invited over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire shook his
head. “They will definitely focus on protecting their formation
experts; they might even prepare specifically for us launching our
most powerful attacks against the. It isn’t too likely that we will
be able to kill the formation experts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan nodded as well.
“Let’s do our best to delay!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six grand formations!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The disruption of each
formation represented an increase in the level of danger the Ji clan
would face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch.” Ning
said solemnly. “I have a grand formation as well. We can be
considered to have seven formations in total.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” They all
looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have a grand
formation?” Ninefire was extremely surprised. “Was it Bei
Zishan’s? Bei Zishan came from Snowdragon Mountain, and he should
have had some formations available to him.” Although this was what
he said, in his heart, Ninefire didn’t feel too hopeful, because as
he saw it, Bei Zishan was an amateur, while he, Ninefire, had chosen
these six formations based on the most exquisite formations available
to him and based on the treasures the Ji clan held.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” Ning shook
his head. “I once had a special stroke of fortune, and the most
valuable item I acquired from it was this grand formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A special stroke of
fortune?” They were all stunned. Yichuan stared at Ning. Yichuan’s
first reaction was to think back to how Ning disappeared in
Serpentwing Lake. That time, he and his wife had been worried for
many days.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan said, “Ji
Ning has indeed had a special stroke of fortune, which he narrowly
survived. However, I didn’t know he had acquired a powerful magic
treasure from it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
“Patriarch, look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
and instantly, a black light appeared above them, covered with
incomparably intricate, wondrous magical runes. It was the dragon
pearl and the four black scales. They caused the surrounding space to
fill up with a black fog. Just by looking at them, especially
considering the majestic presence of the faint draconic shadow within
the dragon pearl, Ninefire and the others felt incomparably
delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dragon pearl?”
Ninefire called out in surprise. “There is a dragon soul within?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look at these runes.
In my entire life, I’ve never seen runes as beautiful as the ones
atop this treasure.” Granny Shadow was scrutinizing the scales.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What complicated
runes.” Ninefire was stunned as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said, “Patriarch,
once you bind it, you will understand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can I bind it? A
treasure like this…our Ji clan has existed for thousands of years
without having a treasure like this.” Ninefire shook his head.
Although the Ji clan had its important, clan-protecting treasures,
those were generally one-use Dao-seals and the like. How could it
have an incomparably precious treasure like this, which could be used
repeatedly? “This treasure isn’t something which the likes of our
clan can use. Normally speaking, we’d be afraid others would come
to steal it. However, now that our Ji clan is facing annihilation, I
don’t have to be worried, I suppose. Still, Ji Ning, it’s best if
you are the one to bind this magic treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch, didn’t
you say that once things grew dangerous, I would have to immediately
leave?” Ning said helplessly. “If I leave…am I supposed to take
the formation with me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh…” Ninefire
hesitated slightly, then gritted his teeth. “Fine. I will bind it.
For now, I’ll use it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given that the
annihilation of his clan was at hand, Ninefire wouldn’t hesitate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, he could tell,
just from the quality of the worksmanship, the runes, and the
materials used that this magic treasure was extremely precious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoosh.” Ninefire
stretched out his right hand, and a flood of elemental energy flowed
into the dragon pearl and the four draconic scales. This treasure
didn’t have any remnants of ki within it, and so it naturally was
easily bound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A wonderful
treasure. A wonderful treasure!” As Ninefire bound it, he
immediately began to understand the secrets of the treasure, and his
eyes turned completely round. “This is too, too…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he knew that
it would be an excellent treasure, Ninefire was still stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder brother?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Granny Shadow, Yichuan,
and the others all looked at the Patriarch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a truly fine
treasure!!!” Ninefire stared, round-eyed. He said excitedly, “My
Ji clan has hope now. It has hope now! We have a chance! A real
chance!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What sort of
treasure is it? Hurry up and tell us! I’m impatient to hear it!”
Granny Shadow said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire said, with
incomparable excitement, “This grand formation has five parts. I
can control them all by myself, but I need four Zifu Disciples
assisting me! The four Zifu Disciples will be assigned to different
locations. One Zifu Disciple will become the core of the ‘Dragonhead
Formation’, one will be the core of the ‘Dragonbody Formation’,
one will be the core of the ‘Dragontail Formation’, while one
will be the core of the ‘Dragonclaw Formation’! Naturally, I will
stand guard at the center and control the dragon pearl.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When the time comes,
for the five Zifu Disciples who set up the formation, the most
important thing is that, like with Dao-Soldiers, they will be able to
share and borrow each other’s elemental energy! Even if one suffers
an attack, it will be spread across to everyone in the entire
formation and first be weakened by the formation itself, then
dividing up amongst the five users.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hearing this, Truekeep,
Granny Shadow, and the others were all excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Being able to combine
their elemental energy and defensive strength was already worth them
being excited over; it meant all of them had gained in strength.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But this is just the
first benefit.” Ninefire said excitedly. “There are other
intricacies within. I’m unable to fully investigate them right now,
but the dragon soul alone…when the time comes, we won’t even have
to attack ourselves. We can use the dragon soul to launch attacks.
This is much like Dong Xiqi’s Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon
Formation. Only, this formation of ours is far more exquisite than
that one!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry, hurry. I’m
going to immediately set it up. I need to focus on it and become
familiar with the intricacies within.” Ninefire was incomparably
excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good, good, good.”
All of them nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded as well. He
knew very well that this sort of formation required a very high level
of comprehension regarding formations by the user. Only a high level
of comprehension could result in effective control of the formation.
Ninefire, in terms of talent, might not be superior to Ning, but he
had been studying formations for centuries, and so in terms of his
ability to control formations, he was on a similar level as Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Ning, what is
the name of this formation?” Ninefire couldn’t help but ask.
“I’ve never seen such an intricate, exquisite formation. This
formation is more powerful than all six of my other formations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation.” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation.” Ninefire murmured this, then transformed
into a ray of light as he began to fly about, setting up the
formation. The Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation had to be set up in
advance. The dragon pearl could be carried at all times, but the four
dragon scales had to be set down in advance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed by the
minute and by the second. It was now dark at night. The Ji clan set
up their formations, here at Oxhorn Mountain, training in them and
becoming more familiar with the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation. This
caused them all to dance for joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So that’s how it
is. How incredible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can allow the
Netherwyrm to attack; the rest of us don’t have to interfere. We
can also…transform into the ‘claws’ or the ‘tail’ of the
Netherwyrm and actively attack. When we attack personally, the
Netherwyrm will be able to unleash even greater power.” Truekeep
was incomparably excited. He had never seen such an incredible
formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition, in the
Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation, the heavens and the earth are
‘locked’, making everything seem illusory! This is the most
miraculous bewildering formation I have ever seen. If we want to
attack, we can; if we want to retreat, we can hide behind the
illusions, making it so that Snowdragon Mountain wouldn’t be able
to find us.” Ninefire laughed loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was excited as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although this was what
he had expected, during their tests, he, a mere early Zifu Disciple,
was able to use the combined elemental energy of the entire grand
formation…and the Patriarch and the others were peak Zifu
Disciples! When accessing all of the elemental energy of the
formation, Ning had more elemental energy than any peak Zifu
Disciple. For him to use so much ki in setting up his [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation] meant that the power would be even
greater!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, then.
Snowdragon Mountain.” Ning was filled with confidence.

Chapter 9 - Snowdragon Mountain Assembles
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Noon. The Golden Crow
[the Sun] hung high in the sky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While Ji Ninefire, Ji
Ning, and the others were setting up and familiarizing themselves
with this grand formation, Snowdragon City of the Swallow Mountain
area had already summoned quite a few Zifu Disciples of Snowdragon
Mountain. In the air above Snowdragon Mountain, there was a giant
carpet, upon which was placed a number of chairs, fruit platters,
wine, and more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the cultivators
were seated in the lotus position, clinking glasses and exchanging
toasts. They were quite at ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Dong Ziqi really has invited quite a few people
this time. He invited all of our fellow apprentices in the areas
surrounding Swallow Mountain.” A bearded elder held a beastskull
cup of wine in his hands, chatting with a silver-haired cultivator
who sat next to him. “It’s only been a short while, but more than
ten Zifu Disciples have already arrived.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The more Zifu
Disciples arrive, the better it will be for us when we use the
combination techniques off Snowdragon Mountain!” The silver-haired
man laughed. “With so many people, no matter how many tricks that
puny little Ji clan have, when we join forces against them…we will
sweep them effortlessly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can we possibly
need this many Zifu Disciples to deal with a puny little Ji clan?”
The long-bearded elder shook his head. He came just for the purpose
of earning some merits; after they captured the elemental ore mine,
the main sect would undoubtedly reward those who had played a part in
it. Participants like them would be awarded merits, based on the size
of their contributions. Unfortunately, with so many cultivators
present, each person would have slightly less merits to earn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While they were
discussing this…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi, as the host,
was naturally walking around with a glass of wine in hand, chatting
with everyone. Amongst his fellow apprentices, he was considered
quite famous and formidable, and could be considered an exceptional
character. Everyone would give him face. Still, Dong Ziqi spent most
of his time with Jadechild.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jadechild’s face was
glowing with golden light. Seated there in the lotus position, he had
his own unique, domineering aura. The nearby Landwyrm shrank to a
size of just a few dozen meters and lay there, gorging itself on
meat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next to Dong Ziqi were
three fairly strong fellow disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now that senior
apprentice-brother Jadechild is here, no matter what tricks the Ji
clan uses, it will be useless. Actually, all we have to do is collect
some military merits.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The last time I saw
you, senior apprentice-brother, was more than thirty years ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them chatted,
beginning to flatter and praise each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all, this person
in front of them, Jadechild, in terms of power, was strong enough to
fight head on with an ordinary Wanxiang Adept! By relying on his
divine ability, he was able to kill Zifu Disciples as easily as
chickens. In addition, they had all heard of how Jadechild had
secluded himself in the hopes of making a breakthrough. If he didn’t
make a breakthrough, that was one thing, but if he did, then he would
become a Fiendgod practitioner at the Wanxiang Adept.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By then, Jadechild’s
status would skyrocket, and he would become a major figure of the
main sect. Naturally, they had to befriend him early on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm?” Dong Ziqi
suddenly turned to look into the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From afar, a fur-clad
man could be seen, riding on a winged beast. The winged beast was an
ordinary one, not a Xiantian-level Diremonster. The fur-clad man
called out, “Cultivators of Snowdragon Mountain, I have come to
deliver a message on the orders of my Patriarch. The Patriarch of our
Ji clan, as well as the other Zifu Disciples, have set down a grand
formation at Oxhorn Mountain, eight hundred kilometers outside of the
City of Ten Thousand Swords. We are waiting for you, Snowdragon
Mountain, to break it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After speaking, the
fur-clad man flew away atop that winged beast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arrogant little
fellow. Watch me deal with him.” A Zifu Disciple with triangular
pupils immediately said in a cold voice, preparing to act.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stay your hand.” A
calm voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Zifu Disciple
turned to look. The speaker was senior apprentice-brother Jadechild,
who was seated in the position of honor. He immediately no longer
dared to attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are all people
who have embarked on the path of Immortal practitioners, while he, a
messenger, is merely a mortal. If you lower yourself to kill him,
wouldn’t you be tarnishing the reputation of our Snowdragon
Mountain?” Jadechild said calmly. “Their puny little Ji clan
dares to brazenly set up a grand formation and ask us to go break it?
Then our Snowdragon Mountain will display our overwhelming power and
smash them all to death in an awe-inspiring display.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother is correct.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother’s words are reasonable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our power far
exceeds the Ji clan’s. For us to act openly and above-the-board is
the correct path.” All of the Zifu Disciples hurriedly said a few
words of praise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jadechild continued,
“However, for the Ji clan to directly notify us means that they
definitely have some tricks up their sleeves. These clans have been
rooted here for thousands of years…they might have some powerful
techniques available to them. Fellow apprentices, don’t be
careless. Be careful and vigilant…if we are vigilant, then given
our power, eradicating the Ji clan will not be an issue at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” All of
them nodded, as though having been lectured. Actually, who amongst
them didn’t know this already? Only, since Jadechild was speaking,
they had no choice to obediently listen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another four hours or
so passed, and another series of Zifu Disciples arrived, three more
in total. These three new Zifu Disciples who had rushed here, upon
seeing so many fellow apprentices present, and upon seeing senior
apprentice-brother Jadechild in particular, naturally also accepted
Jadechild as their leader. Although quite a few Zifu Disciples went
forward to say a few words to Jadechild, Jadechild just gave a few
casual replies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrm?” Jadechild’s
eyes lit up as he looked towards the distant skies. He even put down
the beastskull goblet in his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the distant skies, a
white Fairy Crane was descending. There were two Zifu Disciples
seated atop it. One was Muse, who had gone out to deliver the
invitations to the other apprentices of Snowdragon Mountain; as for
the other, this man was dressed in ordinary fur clothes. This
practitioner had unbound hair, and his eyes gleamed like the stars.
Just looking at him made people unconsciously feel calmer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Zidao has arrived.” Dong Ziqi hurriedly rose.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come. Let’s go
greet junior apprentice-brother Zidao.” Jadechild rose to his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jadechild rose to
welcome Zidao, naturally causing the surrounding Zifu Disciples to
all rise as well. They also behaved in a very warm, welcoming manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an
awe-inspiring figure known throughout the Swallow Mountain region.
Jadechild himself was merely a rogue practitioner who eventually
joined Snowdragon Mountain! As for Zidao, he had been trained at
Snowdragon Mountain as a child, and was a member of the extremely
powerful ‘Nong’ lineage of Snowdragon Mountain! Amongst the
younger members of Snowdragon Member, he was quite famous for his
prowess in formations, and the Ki Refining technique he trained in
was an exquisite one as well. In the future, he would have a chance
at becoming a Wanxiang Adept.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Logically speaking, it
should have been quite hard to invite such a figure to attend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t expect
that Dong Ziqi would be able to invite even Nong Zidao to come.”
The Zifu Disciples were all quite surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Zidao.” Jadechild laughed as he went forward to
welcome him. “I thought it would be quite some time, junior
apprentice-brother, before you arrived. I didn’t imagine you’d
arrive so soon.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Jadechild.” The celestial goose landed on the
carpet, and Nong Zidao descended. “After hearing that you were
inviting me and giving me a chance of earning some merits, senior
apprentice-brother Jadechild, of course I wouldn’t dare be slow. I
had Crane leading the way, and so I moved much more quickly than our
other fellow apprentices.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them
chatted, paying no attention to anyone else, but the other Zifu
Disciples felt that this was only proper.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Ziqi.” Nong Zidao looked at the nearby Dong
Ziqi. “This time, you’ve accomplished a great deed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With you present,
senior apprentice-brother Zidao, I now feel much more confident.”
Dong Ziqi said hurriedly. “Prior to this, senior apprentice-brother
Jadechild and I were both concerned about those formations…although
the Ji clan is a puny little clan, they have a history of thousands
of years. For the sake of the survival of their clan, the formations
they are setting down will definitely be extraordinary. Before this,
I was worried, but with your arrival, senior apprentice-brother
Zidao, everything will be simple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With senior
apprentice-brother Zidao here, the puny Ji clan’s formations will
quickly be broken.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quickly and easily.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Zifu Disciples all
began to laugh and sigh in praise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao nodded
gently. The main sect actually cared quite deeply about his expertise
in formations, but he was still, after all, a mere Zifu Disciple, not
yet a Wanxiang Adept…and thus, his status wasn’t able to rise too
much. As for Jadechild, however, by relying on his divine ability, he
was able to fight with the strength of a Wanxiang Adept. Given that
Jadechild wasn’t too old, and was capable of making a breakthrough,
of course Zidao wanted to make friends with Jadechild. This mission
was absolutely a simple one, but with great potential rewards. Of
course he had to come.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Zidao, with you being here, we have a total of
nineteen Zifu Disciples.” Jadechild glanced at the surrounding
people. “If we include my Landwyrm and that Fairy Crane of yours,
we actually can be said to have twenty one Zifu Disciples.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jadechild then gave
another glance at Nong Zidao. Their gazes intersected, and they made
the decision simultaneously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have an absolute
advantage in power, and for the formation-breaking, we have junior
apprentice-brother Zidao.” Jadechild said. “Since this is the
case, there is no need for us to delay any further. Let us head out
for Oxhorn Mountain now! As for the fellow apprentices who will
arrive later, junior apprentice-brother Ziqi, you arrange for someone
to welcome them, then tell them that we have already gone to Oxhorn
Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Dong
Ziqi hurriedly responded. Since Jadechild and Zidao had made their
decisions, most likely the latecomers wouldn’t dare say much.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine, let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With so many
colleagues present, we have enough power to annihilate the Ji clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We even have senior
apprentice-brothers Jadechild and Zidao. Everything is set.” The
Zifu Disciples all spoke out in praise and approval. The more Zifu
Disciples came, the more people would divide the merits earned. If
they headed out now, and immediately destroyed the Ji clan, then they
would earn the majority of the merits, with the latecomers at most
getting a few scraps.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi directly
reached out to his clansmen within Snowdragon City: “Wait here
within the city. Once our colleagues arrive, just say…that senior
apprentice-brothers Jadechild and Zidao have led the rest of us to
Oxhorn Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Patriarch.”
The Xiantian lifeforms within the city began to make their
preparations for welcoming the latercomer Zifu Disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Dong
Ziqi laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The carpet immediately
flew into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This group of Zifu
Disciples remained seated on it, continuing to nurse their drinks.
They were quite at ease. To them, this trip to Oxhorn Mountain was
nothing more than an excursion tour, incomparably relaxed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Oxhorn Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sun had already
begun to set, having reached the western mountains. The sunlight
bathed the world in its glow, causing the desolate wilderness and
Oxhorn Mountain to be covered with a layer of red gauze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ji clan’s experts
had already finished familiarizing themselves with the formation and
were now resting. Their eyes were all filled with confidence and
anticipation. If before this, they were prepared to fight to the
death, or perhaps even had mentally prepared to die…then they now
could be said to have confidence in their ability to give Snowdragon
Mountain a fight. Ninefire said, “Unless a few dozen of their Zifu
Disciples perish, they can forget about breaking this formation.”
His words were filled with an eagerness for the coming battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This powerful
formation…it would definitely ensure that a large group of Zifu
Disciples of Snowdragon Mountain would perish within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This bottle of
liquefied elemental essence.” Ning was holding the jade bottle
while speaking to his clansmen. “Prior to this, when training, I
only used thirty percent. Quite a bit of it remains. In this battle
against Snowdragon Mountain, our Ji clan cannot be the slightest bit
careless. This bottle of liquefied elemental essence will be of great
use. Patriarch, please accept it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as Ning was
speaking, Truekeep suddenly shouted, “Look, look north!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrm?” All of them
turned to look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Standing at the tip of
Oxhorn Mountain, they were able to see that in the distant skies, an
enormous carpet was flying over. Atop the carpet was tables and
chairs, as well as one Zifu Disciple after another, either seated in
the lotus position or reclining while drinking wine, seeming quite
relaxed. One of them stood at the very front of the carpet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From the looks of it,
it was Dong Ziqi!
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_10___Contact"></A>
Chapter 10 - Contact
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi stood there
atop the carpet, staring into the distance. The distant Oxhorn
Mountain looked the same as always, extremely peaceful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Apprentice-brothers
Jadechild and Zidao.” Dong Ziqi hurriedly called out. “Oxhorn
Mountain is up ahead, but at first glance, I don’t see anything.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immediately, a group of
Zifu Disciples arose, with Jadechild and Zidao leading the way. They
stood at the edges of the carpet, staring into the distance. Nong
Zidao began to laugh. “Just a vision-bewildering formation.
Although you can’t tell from the outside, once you investigate
clearly what’s going on, you’ll know.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant carpet
descended, quickly landing on a desolate patch of land not too far
from Oxhorn Mountain. This group of Zifu Disciples all walked off,
raising their heads as they looked at the distant Oxhorn Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snowdragon Mountain
members, our Ji clan has been here waiting for quite some time.” A
heroic, forceful voice emanated forth from the distant Oxhorn
Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So they really are
atop the mountain.” Dong Ziqi’s eyes narrowed, and he said, “This
is the voice of Patriarch Ninefire of the Ji clan. This old fellow is
very crafty, and he is skilled in formations and poisons.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jadechild just said
calmly, “Nothing more than an old man. Killing him is like killing
a chicken.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s quite
impressive for someone to be this bold though.” Nong Zidao laughed
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A grand formation
has been set down here at Oxhorn Mountain. There’s no way of
knowing what dangers and traps are inside.” A silver-haired Zifu
Disciple said, worried. “What are we to do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The practitioner with
the triangular pupils snorted coldly. “What can we do? To break the
formation, we first have to test it and see what intricacies it
holds.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One Zifu Disciple after
another began to discuss what they should do to test it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao laughed
gently. “This bewildering formation is quite ordinary. Just from
reviewing the elemental energy ripples surrounding Oxhorn Mountain, I
already know the secrets behind the vision-bewildering formation in
front of us. Crane, go break this formation.” Nong Zidao, through
his spiritual connection, informed the Crane of the secrets of
breaking this formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fairy Crane
transformed into a blur, then solidified into a white-robed maiden.
The white-robed maiden seemed like an eighteen year old girl,
youthful and adorable. “Master, please wait momentarily. I will go
break the formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed maiden
immediately transformed into a ray of light, flying away towards the
base of Oxhorn Mountain. She didn’t enter the formation at all,
instead wielding a long black whip in her hands. Striking out with
the whip…it suddenly extended, penetrating into the formation, and
then wrapping up the formation flag with incomparable accuracy. And
then, with a tug, she pulled it out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The spirit-beast of
senior apprentice-brother Zidao really is extraordinary.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well broken.” They
all congratulated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From their side, all
they saw was a long whip enter the formation, with that part of the
whip disappearing. By the time the whip returned, it returned wrapped
around a formation flag! With one of the formation flags pulled
out…instantly, the bewildering formation was broken, and the entire
Oxhorn Mountain seemed to change slightly, revealing several figures
at the peak of the mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ji clan.” Muse
immediately saw the six of them, with that youth amongst them. “That
genius of the Ji clan, Ji Ning, is here as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Activate!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Far away at the peak of
Oxhorn Mountain, Ninefire suddenly let out a loud shout, and
instantly, a large amount of fog arose, surrounding the entire Oxhorn
Mountain. There was black fog everywhere…and for a time, nothing
could be seen within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The
white-robed maiden flew back like a streak of light. “I just barely
missed. As soon as I pulled away one formation flag, yet another
formation was set down…there’s no way for me to pull away the
other formation flags.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s enough for
you to be able to pull one out. That bewildering formation has
already been broken.” Nong Zidao laughed calmly. “It seems this
Ji clan has prepared quite a few formations! Unfortunately…it seems
as though none of them are particularly high-class formations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Jadechild
said, “How can the Ji clan possibly compare with you, junior
apprentice-brother Zidao, when it comes to meticulously analyzing
formations? If they were capable of setting up a formation that even
you, junior apprentice-brother Zidao, felt was high class, then that
would be quite baffling. The situation before us is quite normal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How should we break
this next formation, junior apprentice-brother Zidao?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s hard to see
anything within this fog formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Zifu Disciples all
looked at Nong Zidao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao shook his
head as well. “The previous vision-bewildering formation was easy
to break. The one in front of us, however, is a bit harder. In
addition, I imagine that the Ji clan has set up layers of formations,
formations within formations! How can we break this fog formation
just by looking at it from the outside? Most likely, only someone at
the Primordial Daoist level would be able to see through the
illusions of this formation at a glance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then we…?”
Jadechild looked at Nong Zidao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Investigate the
illusions!” Nong Zidao said. “As I see it, our group of nineteen
Zifu Disciples should divide into two squads. We’ll first send one
group of twelve Zifu Disciples to enter the formation…these twelve
fellow apprentices are not to be separated while carrying out their
mission, as otherwise, they will be separated and killed. Twelve Zifu
Disciples….the Ji clan won’t have the strength to fight back,
even if they want to.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao looked at
Dong Ziqi. “Junior apprentice-brother Ziqi, this time, it was your
Swallow Mountain branch which invited everyone to come here, and so
you should lead eleven of our colleagues in entering.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Dong Ziqi
immediately assented.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao immediately
began to name names, until finally, twelve Zifu Disciples had been
named, with Dong Ziqi being one of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My twelve fellow
apprentices, please head out first.” Nong Zidao waved his hand, and
three jade talismans flew out towards Dong Ziqi and two others.
“These three jade talismans were forged by me personally. As long
as you stay close to me, I will be able to sense them. Fellow
apprentices, please enter the formation first. Senior
apprentice-brother Jadechild and I will follow afterwards…and then,
we shall separately test this formation. I will be able to sense
everyone’s locations, and so meeting again will be simple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Zidao is meticulous indeed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nobody had any
objections.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because they were all
very confident! As disciples of the main sect, they were all skilled
in combination attacks! Every six fellow disciples would be able to
form one formation. Nine, ten, or twelve disciples were also able to
set up formations…if the thousands of powerful Zifu Disciples of
the main sect were to join together in one combination formation,
they would even be able to give a Primordial Daoist a good fight!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, the
prerequisite was that they all had to understand the intricacies of
the combination formations. The larger scale a formation, the greater
the level of complexity. For thousands of Zifu Disciples to form into
one combination formation would require many moons of training and
coordination.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Oxhorn Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Black fog billowed
everywhere, and Ji Ning and the others flew to the edges of the black
fog, staring towards the outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone had a heavy
feeling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just now, that
Zifu-level Celestial Crane didn’t even enter the formation; all it
had done was use a whip from outside, and it was able to effortlessly
capture that formation flag. Clearly, it had seen through the
illusions of the formation. For it to be able to do so without even
entering the formation…this caused every member of the Ji clan to
have a heavy feeling in their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The bewildering
formation I set down outside the perimeter was the weakest one.”
Ninefire said. “First, we will make the enemies believe us to be
weak, so as to make them lower their guard.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Twelve of their Zifu
Disciples have broken off and are moving towards us. It appears they
are going to enter.” Truekeep suddenly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are breaking
into two groups?” Ninefire nodded slightly. “I expect that the
second group is the more powerful one; judging from the conversation
they had earlier, it seems as though those two Zifu Disciples are in
charge. However, those two are in the second group and haven’t
entered yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let us prepare the
Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation.” Granny Shadow said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire waved his
hand, and two plain, unadorned emblems appeared. The only thing on
them was the character for ‘Xia’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The official writs?”
Ning stared in astonishment at these two emblems. “Two official
writs?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Previously, when we
killed the He siblings, we acquired an official writ. This unbound
writ belonged to them.” Ninefire looked at Ning. His eyes filled
with hope, he said, “The other official writ belongs to my Ji clan.
It is the official writ of the City of Ten Thousand Swords. Ji Ning,
for now, we will entrust you with these two writs!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire handed them
directly to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are facing
countless dangers right now. If I am lucky enough to survive, then
you can give the official writ for the City of Ten Thousand Swords
back to me. If I die, then keep it.” Ninefire said. “No matter
what, we absolutely cannot permit Snowdragon Mountain to acquire this
official writ. If the situation becomes untenable, immediately use
the Traceless Talisman to depart. The official writ will thus go with
you as well…and so, even if they break our formation, they will not
be able to find the official writ at all. By then, you will represent
the Ji clan in signing an agreement with the Grand Xia Dynasty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded gently,
then accepted the two official writs. When he filled them with his
elemental energy, he was able to easily bind them both.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time, he
could vaguely sense two places ‘calling’ to him. It was the call
of those two cities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire, Granny
Shadow, and the others all laughed. Now that they had already
arranged everything, they would be able to battle without any other
concerns.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Truekeep.”
Ninefire said. “You shall be the core for the ‘Dragonhead
Formation’ of the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation. I will fill you
with the power of the formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Truekeep
immediately nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Shadow.”
Ninefire, for once, called out his little sister by her full name.
“You shall be the core of the Dragonbody Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Granny
Shadow’s eyes were filled with anticipation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Liu Xing.”
Ninefire called out the full name of the old servant, Ah Xing, as
well. “You shall be the core of the Dragonclaw Formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old servant nodded
gently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Ninefire
looked towards Ji Ning. “You are the strongest person amongst us.
Your elemental energy is somewhat weak, but once you join with the
formation…our elemental energy will combine with yours! Your
strength will thus rise the most out of all of us! Given this, your
power will vastly surpass the power of the rest of us. The Dragontail
Formation of the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation is the most
mysterious and most nimble part; it can support everyone else. You
will thus serve as the core for this formation, and you will also be
our killing blade.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once the Netherwyrm
Heavenlock formation was set down, of the five formations, the
Dragonhead Formation, the Dragonclaw Formation, the Dragonbody
Formation, and the Dragon Pearl Formation would not be very nimble.
The Dragontail Formation, however, was the nimblest formation, and
could easily sweep across to many areas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will stand guard
at the core, controlling the formation to support you all.”
Ninefire looked at the nearby Yichuan. “Yichuan will be my backup.
Once I die, Yichuan will replace me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone knew…that
Yichuan would only be able to unleash sufficient energy from his Zifu
after using a forbidden technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone!”
Ninefire looked at them all. “Everything we do, we do for the Ji
clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For the Ji clan.”
Granny Shadow, the old servant Ah Xing, Truekeep, Yichuan, and Ning
all nodded solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go, then. Prepare
each of your formations.” Ninefire gave the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immediately, Truekeep,
Granny Shadow, Ah Xing, and Ning moved at high speed in four
different directions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi and the other
eleven Zifu Disciples of Snowdragon Mountain were carefully entering
the black fog shrouded Oxhorn Mountain. As the person who had invited
them here, Dong Ziqi naturally set up his Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon
Formation to protect them! The enormous Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon
Formation swirled around the eleven Zifu Disciples, providing an
outer layer of protection.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This also guaranteed
that the twelve Zifu Disciples wouldn’t be easily separated from
each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A black fog
bewildering formation?” The twelve people who entered the black fog
region quickly grew cautious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, beware the
ambushes of the Ji clan.” Dong Ziqi called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the black fog, the
aura of the region had become heavy and weighty. All of them grew
cautious and guarded, for fear that a sudden, terrifying attack might
emerge from the black fog. As Immortal practitioners…they all
understood that even if they looked down upon their enemies, in a
true life and death battle, they couldn’t underestimate any enemy
Immortal practitioners.

Chapter 11 - The Netherwyrm in the Dark Fog
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thick black fog
surrounding Dong Ziqi’s group made it so that they couldn’t see
too far away at all. If the black fog was to disappear, they would
discover, to their amazement…that a completely black, enormous
dragon that was more than ten kilometers long was currently coiled
around the entire Oxhorn Mountain. At the same time, the head of the
Netherwyrm was staring directly at them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unfortunately, they
weren’t able to see it. This was the reason why Ji Ninefire had set
up this black fog bewildering formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come. Come.” Ji
Truekeep stared at them from far away. Twelve distant, faint figures
could be seen far away in the black fog. These were created through
Ninefire’s control over the fog; they were used to tell Truekeep
and the others where everyone’s approximate locations were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Truekeep himself was
within the enormous black draconic head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After being transformed
by the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation, the elemental energy of the
five had given birth to a powerful draconic energy. At the center of
the Dragonhead Formation, Truekeep was naturally able to borrow this
power, and he could feel his own strength ready to explode.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Truekeep, wait a bit
longer. Don’t be impatient.” A voice rang out by his ear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Truekeep nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the major
formations, including the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation, was
controlled by the Patriarch. Only the Patriarch could effortless
speak mentally to them; the others, including Ji Ning, weren’t able
to see too far through their eyes. They all needed the Patriarch to
assist in guiding them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire was halfway up
the mountain, within the body of the enormous Netherwyrm. He could
see everything within the grand formation clearly, and the black fog
served as his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are all quite
cautious.” Ninefire stared at them. “There are twelve Zifu
Disciples, and they all belong to the same sect. They definitely have
combination formation techniques…if we were to ambush them now, the
chances of success probably wouldn’t be that great. In a short
while, they will discover that this black fog formation isn’t an
exceptionally clever one. And once they slightly lower their
guard…the power of the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation will
definitely make them suffer bitterly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire was
sufficiently patient. He was able to wait, wait for the best
opportunity. Only then would he reveal his teeth and fangs…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi and the rest
of the twelve Zifu Disciples were indeed very vigilant when they
entered the formation, all of them staying within the Eight Trigrams
Blood Dragon Formation. At the same time, they kept the elemental
energy in their bodies activated, prepared to launch a combination
attack at any time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s nothing
particularly special about this black fog bewildering formation. I’ve
already discovered some of its secrets!” One of them, a
black-haired elder, spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I found a few hints
as well. However, senior apprentice-brother Zha is more formidable
than me when it comes to formations. I imagine that in an even
shorter period of time, he would be able to defeat this formation.”
A silver-haired cultivator said with a laugh. As Immortal
practitioners, especially ones at the Zifu Disciple level…given
that they were trapped at the Zifu Disciple level, the most
fundamental level, and were unable to make a breakthrough, they
naturally would spend their time researching other methods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Formations? Poisons?
Golem arts? They would research anything that was useful to them in
enhancing their power. Generally speaking, these old fellows who had
been alive for three or four centuries would be specialized in
several areas.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These branch sect Zifu
Disciples who had left the main sect had almost no hope of breaking
through. Most of them thus spent some degree of time on formations,
and some of them were even more formidable in formations than Ji
Ninefire was! Only…although setting one was easy, breaking one was
difficult! They naturally weren’t confident in their ability to
defeat the formations that Ji Ninefire had laid down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, there were
still some formations which they could defeat; only, it wouldn’t be
as simple as it was for Nong Zidao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I only need as much
time as is needed to boil a kettle of tea to break this formation.”
The black-haired elder smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then we’ll have to
trouble you, senior apprentice-brother Zha.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We will first break
this bewildering formation. There is no need to rely on senior
apprentice-brother Zidao to deal with these small formations. We are
enough.” These Zifu Disciples clearly felt quite relaxed now. When
first entering the black fog bewildering formation, the short line of
sight made them grow wary, but upon understanding how simple this
formation was to break, they clearly were starting to feel more
confident.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-haired elder
nodded. “I will analyze this formation. Everyone, please stay on
your guard.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave it to us.
Senior apprentice-brother Zha, focus on breaking this formation.”
Dong Ziqi and the others said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right up ahead.”
The black-haired elder’s eyes lit up. He was completely confident.
“I’ve already seen through this formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent.” All of
them grew excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi continued to
maintain his Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation, and the group of
Zifu Disciples advanced at high speed. The fog up ahead seemed to be
a bit thinner, and Dong Ziqi’s group saw, not too far away, a flag
planted into the ground. The flag was grey, and covered with many
black diagrams.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The formation flag!”
They revealed looks of delight on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Truekeep, just wait
there quietly.” Ninefire sent mentally. “In a short period of
time, those Zifu Disciples of Snowdragon Mountain will arrive at your
position. When I give the order, kill them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve been waiting
for this the entire time.” Truekeep’s eyes were flashing with
cold light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent. Just
listen to my orders.” Ninefire was eager as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Dong Ziqi’s group
of twelve Zifu Disciples saw the distant flag, they failed to notice
that within a hundred meters of them…an enormous draconic head was
staring directly at them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The formation flag!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The twelve Zifu
Disciples were all wildly overjoyed, and the black-haired elder
couldn’t help but reveal a hint of smugness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at that moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Attack!” Truekeep,
who had been hiding there for quite some time, finally heard the
Patriarch’s voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as the group of
Zifu Disciples saw the formation flag and were feeling overjoyed, an
enormous draconic head suddenly emerged from the nearby dense black
fog. The draconic head was incomparably large; in the black fog, they
were only able to see several draconic whiskers and scales. The
Netherwyrm’s head opened its maw, chomping down towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful.” Dong
Ziqi, being in control of the Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation,
was the first to notice it, and he hurriedly called out in surprise
and fright.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was too late.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It came too fast!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distance at which
one could see within the black fog was simply too short. The
Netherwyrm was ten kilometers long. How enormous must the head thus
be? As the draconic head charged towards them…it moved at a speed
that was probably more than ten times faster than that of the Zifu
Disciples. The draconic head, with a rumble, blasted into and broke
through the Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation. With a crunch,
rumble, boom, and terrifying roar…the Netherwyrm’s head came
howling towards the enemies!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In that howling
instant…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Truekeep was right in
the center of the head. As the Netherwyrm’s head bit down, Truekeep
seemed to have gone berserk as the nine sharp awls hovering around
his body were filled by the draconic energy generated by the
formation. Those sharp awls moved at an astonishing speed, attacking
at three of the Zifu Disciples were were closest to and caught
offguard by the Netherwyrm’s frontal attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Supported by the
formation, Truekeep’s current level of power was even more powerful
than that of most peak Zifu Disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang! Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Simply too fast. Two of
the Zifu Disciples had giant holes blasted through their chests and
their corpses fell into the Netherwyrm’s devouring mouth. As for
the other Zifu Disciple who had been attacked, he kicked backwards,
his body flashing like azure light and instantly moving tens of
meters away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A single sudden ambush
had killed two Zifu Disciples. The primary reason was that the
Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation itself was simply too powerful. In
addition, all five of its formations had a Zifu Disciple standing
guard at the center, making it so that this Netherwyrm seemed to have
sentience, making it all the more incomparably, astonishingly
powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“While they are ill,
go for the kill!” Truekeep then moved towards and attacked two
other Zifu Disciples who had somewhat pulled away from their
comrades.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sharp awls howled!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black draconic head
was like a nightmare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble the
formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble the
formation.” As the howls rang out, Dong Ziqi and the others had
already begun to prepare their formation. These Zifu Disciples were
no fools; they knew that they couldn’t move too far away from their
comrades. This was because once they moved too far away from each
other within this bewildering formation…they would be separately
defeated by the Ji clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the problem wasn’t
that they moved too far away; it was that the strike of the draconic
head had knocked some of them flying!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of the
Netherwyrm’s attack was simply too great!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formation, link.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formation, link.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white light suddenly
sprang up, instantly circulating around the bodies of each of the
Zifu Disciples. Soon, eight enormous trigrams made of white light had
appeared out of nowhere, with the eight Zifu Disciples separated in
each part. Actually, this technique of Snowdragon Mountain’s only
required six Zifu Disciples to be completely linked up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is senior
apprentice-brother Zha?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is senior
apprentice-brother Fang?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi and the rest
of the eight, after setting up the formation, discovered to their
amazement that although they had previously numbered twelve Zifu
Disciples, only eight now remained. The other four could not be
found.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Zha.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all called out
loudly, and their voices echoed within the formation. If the other
four were still alive, they would be able to reply verbally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dead. The four of
them are all dead.” Dong Ziqi gritted his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too terrifying. Too
powerful.” The silver-haired cultivator had a look of disbelief on
his face. “Prior to this, I vaguely saw some draconic scales. It
was the head of an incomparably large dragon. How could the Ji clan
have access to something so powerful? Could that have been a true
dragon?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no way it
could have been a true dragon. If it was a true dragon, we would have
discovered it long ago! In addition, how could a true dragon be so
enormous? It must be a formation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But how could the
dragon produced by a formation be so powerful?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This group of Zifu
Disciples were still in a state of shock. That earlier attack had
simply been too powerful. Although they had all been overjoyed upon
seeing the flag and had relaxed slightly, they were still within the
Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation, after all. In their hearts,
they also remained vigilant. Who would have imagined that this sudden
ambush would have blasted through them, forcing them all to retreat
and knocking some of them flying!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This ambush had killed
four of them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can no longer see
the formation flag either.” Dong Ziqi swept the surrounding area
with his gaze. He was now unable to see the formation flag. “When
we were struck by that enormous black dragon, we were all knocked
backwards and driven farther away from the formation flag.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The illusion isn’t
that important. That enormous black dragon is the true disaster.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We must have senior
apprentice-brothers Jadechild or Nong Zidao come.” The
silver-haired expert flipped his hand and retrieved a jade seal. This
was the seal Nong Zidao had given him. He clenched it. Crunch! The
jade seal disintegrated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the outside.
Jadechild and Nong Zidao, along with the other five Zifu Disciples,
were waiting. They were in no rush to enter the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What sort of
techniques could this sort of small clan have?” Jadechild laughed.
“Our twelve Zifu Disciples of Snowdragon Mountain have entered, and
they have access to a combination formation technique…that is more
than enough to utterly sweep and dominate the enemies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. The
formations of a small clan like this can’t possibly be very
powerful. Our fellow apprentices also have studied formations. They,
too, are capable of breaking formations.” Nong Zidao felt relaxed
as well. As he saw it, the combined power of those twelve fellow
apprentices….should indeed be more than enough to easily dominate
this sort of small clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao’s face
changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What happened?”
Jadechild immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The jade talisman I
gave him.” Nong Zidao said in a soft voice. “One of them was just
crushed. It seems they encountered some sort of danger. Otherwise,
they wouldn’t ask us to save them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This puny little Ji
clan was able to force them to beg us to save them?” Jadechild
couldn’t believe it. Prior to this, Nong Zidao had given them a
jade talisman…primarily because this was a habit of the disciples
of the sect. None of them actually thought it would be used.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, let’s enter
the formation.” Nong Zidao said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other five nearby
Zifu Disciples had heard their conversation. They, too, were
surprised. The twelve comrades who had entered had actually been
forced to shatter a jade talisman? Still, upon seeing Jadechild and
Nong Zidao by their side, they felt completely confident.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You wait here. If
any comrades of our Snowdragon Mountain comes here, tell them that we
have already entered the formation.” Nong Zidao waved his hand,
then produced a wooden golem. The wooden golem had a green light
within its eyes, and it just listened, then nodded obediently. “Yes,
master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Nong
Zidao said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immediately, Jadechild,
under Nong Zidao’s guidance, led the group of seven Zifu Disciples
and two Zifu-level spirit-beasts into the black fog that surrounded
Oxhorn Mountain.

Chapter 12 - The Secret Killer Weapon - Ji Ning
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous scales
atop the draconic tail were all incomparably clear. Ji Ning sat
within the draconic tail, surrounded by those enormous scales.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrm?” Ning
suddenly heard the sound of explosions and angered shouts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble the
formation!” “Formation, linked!” Cries of surprise and terror
rang out from afar. Ning’s ears twitched, and he laughed. “IT has
begun.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Per their original
strategy, Ning was in the strongest position of all, out of the
various experts of the Ji clan! He would only be unleashed at the
critical moment…there was no need for him to engage yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoosh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A figure flew over. It
was Ji Yichuan, dressed in a white fur robe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father.” Ning
rose.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take it!” Yichuan
produced six flying swords out of nowhere, which hovered there above
his palm. “These were acquired by your Uncle Truekep after
executing four Zifu Disciples. One of them was a Zifu Disciple who
controlled multiple flying swords; we acquired five from him alone.
Thus, the four of them had a total of six flying swords.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t hesitate,
immediately accepting them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perfect timing.”
Ning was incomparably excited. Prior to this, everyone had already
traded for some magic treasures. Some of them were useless to him,
but were very important to others! At such a crucial, life-and-death
juncture, nobody would be shy; everyone acted quite forthrightly. For
example, Ning gave the venomous bugs he had acquired from Bei Zishan
to Ji Ninefire, while Ninefire, upon learning that Ning desperately
needed ranked flying swords, had managed to scrape together five of
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bei Zishan had left
behind two; combined with those five, Ning had seven. That wasn’t
even enough for a single formation base of the [Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation]! But now that he had six more…he had enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These six flying
swords are all ranked magic treasures.” Yichuan said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded. “With these six ranked flying swords, my power is going to
rise significantly. Later, I’ll have to have a nice little ‘battle’
against these Zifu Disciples of Snowdragon Mountain!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan had a rare look
of delight on his face as well. “This has truly been wonderful. And
it is all thanks to the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation you brought
out! In a single ambush, we killed four enemy Zifu Disciples. Without
the aid of this formation, we would probably lose someone on every
attack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation had been acquired by Ning from the Aquatic
Estate. Naturally, it was quite powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Make your
preparations. Once you are needed, the Patriarch will immediately
notify you mentally.” Yichuan instructed, then transformed into a
ray of light and left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately filled
his elemental energy into the flying swords, seizing every moment of
time and hurriedly binding them. Although it was true that, as the
spirit of the Aquatic Estate had said, it would be best if the flying
swords which served as the core of the [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation] all came from the same source, the current Ning,
unfortunately, had no right to be choosy. It was already quite good
for him to even be able to have enough ranked flying swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black fog hung
everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao, Jadechild,
and the others were advancing carefully through the black fog. The
Fairy Crane and the Landwyrm were all in human form now, accompanying
Nong Zidao and Jadechild.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This black fog
bewildering formation isn’t even worth discussing.” Nong Zidao
finally spoke. “I’ve already completely seen through its
mysteries. I can sense the direction in which Dong Ziqi’s group
lies as well. Now, act according to my instructions…and we will
soon reunite with them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We will listen to
you, senior apprentice-brother Zidao.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Zidao is as formidable as ever.” The other Zifu
Disciples previously had ugly looks on their faces, but now they
finally looked pleased.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prior to this, upon
entering the formation, they had immediately shouted, and the distant
voices of Dong Ziqi and the rest of the eight Zifu Disciples had
naturally responded to them…and through the discussion, Jadechild
and Nong Zidao learned that four of their comrades had actually died!
This caused Jadechild and Nong Zidao to become incomparably enraged
and cautious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao said in a
clear voice, “Junior apprentice-brother Ziqi, we are coming over
right now. We will soon arrive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Boom!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill that old
bastard of the Ji clan!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A series of angry roars
rang out from afar, causing Jadechild and Nong Zidao to be startled.
But then, the warcries and sounds of battle came to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jadechild shouted with
a frown. “Dong Ziqi, are you alright?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are fine.” The
voice came from far away. “The eight of us stayed in formation the
entire time, not relaxing at all. Just now, an enormous draconic claw
attacked us…it was even more powerful than the first attack. We
were at a slight disadvantage, but by joining forces, the eight of us
were able to defend well enough that none of us perished.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. We will
immediately come over.” Jadechild said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s hurry over.”
Jadechild looked towards Nong Zidao by his side. “Prior to this, it
was the dragon’s head. This time, it was the dragon’s claw. This
puny little Ji clan actually has access to such a technique…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao said
solemnly, “Most likely, in the past few thousand years, the Ji clan
must have acquired this formation through a stroke of great fortune.
It seems to be quite powerful. Let’s quickly reunite with them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The surrounding black
fog suddenly grew denser, and a bone-piercing, insidious cold seemed
to fill it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go forward. Stop.
Turn left…stop.” Nong Zidao guided them easily, but then his face
suddenly changed. “Eh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” They
all looked towards him, awaiting his directions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It changed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao had an ugly
look on his face. “There are multiple layers of formations,
formations within formations. I’ve become baffled by an even more
powerful formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that even
you can’t break it?” Jadechild looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It will be very
difficult.” Nong Zidao looked at the surrounding area. Waving his
hand lightly, he could sense that insidious, bone-piercing chill
within the fog.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How long will you
need to break it?” Jadechild asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t know!”
Nong Zidao shook his head. “If I’m fast, an hour. If it takes a
long time, one or two days.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of the
surrounding Zifu Disciples all changed. Jadechild said, shocked,
“That long?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat in the lotus
position within the enormous tail of the Netherwyrm. Around him, more
than seven hundred sword-type magic treasures were floating about,
nine of which were particularly dazzling to behold. The white light
covering those nine was much stronger. The hazy white light
continuously thrummed through the swords, quickly coalescing into a
sword light in front of Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. With these
nine ranked flying swords as a formation base, they can now serve as
the core for the other seven hundred-plus flying swords of my [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation]. The power clearly has grown
dramatically.” Ning revealed a look of delight. “Only, the ranked
flying swords put a lot of pressure on my soul as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unranked flying swords
made up the majority of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The difference between
using them and using ranked flying swords in the [Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation]…was quite significant and apparent. The
difficulty in controlling them rose dramatically, but so too did the
power!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve only added
nine ranked flying swords. After gaining insight into my Sword
Domain, my soul has grown much stronger. I’m still able to use the
ninth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation].” Ning had
the feeling that if he were to add a few dozen ranked flying swords
or a few hundred ranked flying swords…the total number of swords he
was able to control would drop sharply!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning!” A
powerful voice echoed forth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch.” A look
of delight appeared on Ning’s face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are in trouble
now.” Ninefire’s voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What sort of
trouble?” Ning was worried as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second group of
Zifu Disciples of Snowdragon Dragon have just entered the formation.
Amongst them there is one person in particular, Nong Zidao, who even
I have heard of! Nong Zidao is extremely skilled in formations. He is
able to easily defeat the black fog bewildering formation, and so I
was forced to use the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation to trap and
bewilder him.” Ninefire transmitted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation…it had the secondary effect of being a
bewildering formation. It was far more exquisite than the Ji clan’s
own bewildering formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They also have
someone known as Jadechild. I haven’t heard of him, but his power
is extremely great.” Ninefire sent mentally. “In our Ji clan,
your power is the greatest, while the second strongest is our old
servant, Ah Xing. Just now, when Ah Xing ambushed Dong Ziqi’s group
of eight, Dong Ziqi’s group was able to maintain their formation,
and Ah Xing wasn’t able to do anything to them. However, I’ve
discovered that Jadechild and Nong Zidao haven’t joined together in
a formation. I ordered Ah Xing to attack as I thought we had an
opportunity…but who would have imagined that despite riding on the
claws of the Netherwyrm, Ah Xing was blocked off by Jadechild alone!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blocked by him
alone?” Ning was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He is extremely
powerful. Ah Xing launched a sneak attack, then immediately
retreated.” Ninefire said. “Right now, there are a total of two
groups in the formation. The second group is clearly far more
powerful than the first one. Thus, we need to immediately eradicate
the first group; otherwise, if they combine, we won’t be able to do
anything against them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are the most
powerful person in our group. Immediately go out and attack Dong
Ziqi’s group. I will direct you. Prepare to listen to my commands.”
Ninefire said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time, the
black fog in front of Ning began to part, revealing a corridor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wonderful. I’ve
grown impatient long ago!” Ning sprang to his feet, then shot
forward at high speed through the corridor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi and the rest
of the eight advanced carefully, always maintaining their formation.
That white glow surrounded the eight trigrams which covered them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow apprentices,
be careful. This is the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation!” Nong
Zidao’s frantic voice rang out from far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation?” Dong Ziqi and the others looked at each
other, all of them seeming puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Nong Zidao
said in a loud, frantic voice, “We just suffered an attack from a
draconic claw as well. Your senior apprentice-brother, Jadechild,
forced it to retreat. I could immediately recognize this as being the
Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation. This Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation
is an ancient, powerful formation! There is a complicated version of
the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation, and a simplified version of
it…according to legend, the Marquis of Stillwater has access to a
Heaven-rank Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation. This formation which the
Ji clan is using must be a simplified Mortal-rank formation. But even
a Mortal-rank formation…is astonishingly powerful. We are in true
danger this time. We have to conserve our power; otherwise, we will
be in danger of dying.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your senior
apprentice-brothers, Jadechild and myself, will focus on breaking the
formation. We won’t be able to divide our attention and take care
of you for now. Take care of yourselves, the eight of you.” Nong
Zidao’s voice echoed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi and the rest
of the eight looked at each other, their faces unsightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For this formation to
force Nong Zidao and Jadechild to completely focus their efforts on
breaking it…one could imagine how terrifying it was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve never even
heard of this ‘Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation’. Only someone
like senior apprentice-brother Nong Zidao, who has studied many
formation manuals in the main sect, would know of it. How could the
Ji clan have acquired such a powerful formation?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The look on Dong Ziqi’s
face was very ugly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We will do our
best.” Dong Ziqi looked at his seven comrades. “This is a
life-and-death battle. Either the Ji clan dies or we die! Everyone,
if you have any life-protecting measures, use them. Don’t save
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their attitudes had all
changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At first, all of them
were simply toying around. The sudden deaths of four comrades had
shocked them, but they trusted that once Jadechild and Nong Zidao
joined them…all the danger would dissipate like smoke, like the
clouds. But now, Nong Zidao had said that this game had just turned
deadly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I knew that I’d
risk my life, I wouldn’t have entered Swallow Mountain.” They all
felt misery in their hearts, but with death staring at them, all of
them prepared to fight to the death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three hundred meters or
so away from them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous draconic
tail was coiling there. Ning was in the center of the draconic tail,
and the seven hundred flying swords were all hovering around him,
prepared to begin the slaughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, attack!”
Patriarch Ninefire’s voice rang out within his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A fierce light flashed
through Ji Ning’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swooosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the entire,
enormous Netherwyrm whipped its tail out, and its tail struck forward
towards those eight nervous, guarded Zifu Disciples.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 13 - Terrified By the Slaughter
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black fog swirled
about like mist. The eight Zifu Disciples of Snowdragon Mountain were
constantly staying in their formation and moving about within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation…even senior apprentice-brother Zidao is unable
to break it. What else can we do? Let’s just run around wildly.
Senior apprentice-brother Jadechild and Zidao are within this
formation as well. Perhaps we might run into them.” The eight Zifu
Disciples clung to this hope as they advanced.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all clenched their
various Dao-seals in their hands, prepared to do battle at any
moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rustle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A gentle sprinkling of
rain suddenly began to fall. The rain fell like fine, silken threads
that were incomparably soft. Dong Ziqi and the rest of the eight,
upon suddenly encountering the rain, were greatly shocked. “Rumble…”
A layer of white light appeared on their bodies, which directly
blocked those ordinary drops of rain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s simply rain.
Don’t make a fuss over nothing.” The hawk-nosed cultivator said
coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why is there
rainwater within this formation?” Dong Ziqi frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps it is
currently raining outside. This bewildering formation only has the
power to bewilder; it isn’t able to block out the rainwater from
the outside world.” A silver-haired cultivator spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi and the
others all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were cultivators.
They could clearly sense that this rain was falling naturally; it
wasn’t poisonous liquid generated by the formation! For the moment,
they didn’t think of the possibility of it being a Dao Domain;
generally speaking, someone who had reached the Dao Domain realm
could, with a thought, convert the surrounding area into their own
Domain. Different Daos would naturally result in different Domains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some could, with a
thought, transform the surrounding area into boundless flames. Others
could transform the surrounding area into a field of lightning. As
for Ning, what he generated was the descent of rainfall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s be careful
nonetheless. Don’t let this rainwater soak us.” A gray-robed
elder said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother An’s words are reasonable. We are trapped in the
Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation; we should be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These Zifu Disciples
would rather do too much than to be careless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous black
draconic tail swept towards them as fast as lightning. In the midst
of the draconic tail, there was a fur-clad Ji Ning, who stood there
silently. The area around him was filled with more than seven hundred
flying swords, nine of which were ranked. The nine ranked flying
swords served as the nucleus, and the converted energy of the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation] was incomparably shocking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Rainwater Sword
Domain had already been set up!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An elemental energy
that was greater than any peak Zifu Disciple’s, activated through
the ninth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]…although
only nine of these seven hundred-plus flying swords were ranked, this
was still the ninth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]!
Sometimes, quantity was a form of quality!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Ning’s
eyes flashed with a killing light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword light in
front of him suddenly pierced through the skies, instantly
transforming into a line of rainwater. At this moment, Ning was using
all his might. The ninth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation], supported by the formation and the Rainwater Sword
Domain…all of these things made it so that the power of this sword
of Ning’s was at an incredibly high level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s keep
moving.” Dong Ziqi and the others were continuing to advance while
blocking off the descending rain. Just as they were walking forward
calmly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The face of
the hawk-nosed black-robed cultivator changed. In that instant, he
vaguely felt a tremendous danger descending. This was something that
he gained only after becoming an Immortal practitioner; he could
sense when a dire threat was descending. Unfortunately, this danger
sense always came quite late; it would only appear when the threat
had already drawn very close. Despite that, it had still saved his
life a few times.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fogswirl Umbrella!”
An umbrella suddenly appeared around the hawk-nosed black-robed
cultivator. The umbrella spread open, completely protecting the
hawk-nosed man’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A seemingly ordinary
line of rainwater gently swirled and flew over, lashing out towards
the triangle-pupiled cultivator.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The triangle-pupiled
cultivator was staring in astonishment at his comrade, who had
suddenly used his protective magic treasure. A sense of danger
suddenly descended.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” As a
line of rain drew close to him, the triangle-pupiled cultivator
suddenly felt a sharp ripple come towards him. He hurriedly waved the
longsword in his hand, wanting to block, but it was too late…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That line of rainwater
had come too close!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And his sword
techniques were too ordinary. How marvelous were Ning’s sword
techniques? With a gentle twist, the rainwater moved past the
longsword, then scraped past his head!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…” The
formerly hazy white light of the Eight Trigrams Formation suddenly
grew blindingly bright.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are under
attack!” Dong Ziqi and the others were all shocked. After suffering
an attack, the formation would naturally explode with power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The head of the
triangle-pupiled cultivator, his eyes still filled with shock, went
flying into the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the eight Zifu
Disciples had died!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Dong Ziqi
and the others were all terrified and shocked. One of their comrades
had been killed while they had been maintaining the formation. How
sharp did the enemy’s attack have to be?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble the
formation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble the
formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The remaining Zifu
Disciples called out in terror. With one of the eight dead, the
earlier formation had already disappeared. For one of them to have
been killed after setting up the formation…if they didn’t set it
up again, wouldn’t they all be dead for sure?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” That line
of rainwater, after killing the triangle-pupiled cultivator, had used
up most of its power, but the other seven cultivators currently
weren’t being protected by the grand formation. Naturally, the line
of rainwater flew forward agilely. It swirled past…cutting apart
the protection of a set of magic armor, sending yet another head
flying, this one of the silver-haired cultivator. Only then did the
line of rainwater vanish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…” The
white light appeared once more as the six surviving Zifu Disciples
reformed the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous draconic
tail came sweeping over again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six Zifu Disciples,
upon seeing the draconic tail, seemed utterly enraged and berserk.
Green vines, bolts of lightning, blasts of flame, phoenixes…they
threw everything forward towards the draconic tail that was sweeping
towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They really have
gone berserk.” Ning was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going.” The
black wings behind Ning trembled, then sent him flying in a solitary
arc, far into the distance. Only the lightning bolt and the fiery
phoenix were able to strike him. The strikes from the lightning bolt
and the fiery phoenix allowed Dong Ziqi and the others to see Ning’s
true appearance…Dong Ziqi was shocked and amazed. He immediately
recognized that this was the genius of the Ji clan, ‘Ji Ning’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…the powerful
attacks sent even Ning hurtling backwards, disappearing into the
distant black fog.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi and the rest
of the six Zifu Disciples felt dread in their heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble the
formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go all out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous Eight
Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation suddenly appeared around Dong Ziqi,
and the eight blood dragons began to swim about.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That hawk-nosed
cultivator, standing outside the formation, hurriedly threw out three
flags. The formation flags fluttered, then quickly formed into an
enormous hazy aura of light. This white aura of light seemed like a
pyramid that enclosed the six.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many vines suddenly
emerged, wildly sprouting about in the surrounding areas. These vines
criss-crossed each other, completely filling the surrounding area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Children, go.” A
dense cluster of venomous pests began to fly about in the surrounding
area, filling the skies and blocking out the sun, completely filling
the nearby region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The gray-robed elder
produced an enormous banner that fluttered with a bloody light. One
enormous after another phantom flew out from the banner; some were
four-legged beasts, while others were flying creatures. Nine enormous
phantoms emerged into the surrounding area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These six Zifu
Disciples were all sweating. They brought out all of their best
techniques, completely and tightly sealing off the surrounding area…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They looked at each
other, their eyes filled with amazement and dread.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We won’t be able
to leave. We have to wait here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can’t keep
walking.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll guard here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These techniques of
theirs were virtually all used for defending a particular location.
The long, growing vines, the grand formation, and the other
techniques weren’t able to be maintained while moving!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is that person?
Who attacked us just now? By his appearance, he should be young.”
The gray-robed elder clutched at his bloody banner as he looked at
Dong Ziqi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Who was that?
How could he be so powerful? Before this, we suffered the attacks
from the dragon’s claw and the dragon’s head…this should have
been the dragon’s tail. Why is it so powerful?” The hawk-nosed
cultivator looked at Dong Ziqi as well. The other cultivators also
stared at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These people felt
hatred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was supposed to be
an easy, relaxed journey. Who would have imagined that they had
actually bitten down on such a terrifying, tough bone? First of all,
they had even never heard of this ‘Netherwyrm Heavenlock
Formation’; only Nong Zidao had. The Netherwyrm Heavenlock
Formation was one thing; after all, the power of a formation depended
on its users. They felt no fear towards those other two who had
relied on the power of the formation to attack them. But that young,
slender youth that had just appeared was truly terrifying. Even while
maintaining their formation, he had still killed two of them…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi said
hurriedly, “The Ji clan has in total six fairly powerful figures.
They are Ji Ninefire, Granny Shadow, an old servant, Ji Yichuan, Ji
Truekeep, and Ji Ning! Ji Ning is the genius of the Ji clan…when he
was eleven or twelve years old, he killed junior apprentice-brother
Bei Zishan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He killed Bei Zishan
when he was twelve?” These people all revealed looks of amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This year, he should
be sixteen.” Dong Ziqi said. “Just now, the person who launched
that attack was Ji Ning! However, prior to this, Ji Ning and I
exchanged blows; he wasn’t able to do anything to my Eight Trigrams
Blood Dragon Formation. His strength is only slightly superior to Ji
Ninefire and the others, which is why I didn’t hold him in any
regard. I didn’t imagine that with the support of the Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation, his strength would reach such a terrifying
level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If he is only one
level higher than Ji Ninefire in strength, how could he explode with
such power?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A monster who was
able to kill junior apprentice-brother Bei Zishan at the age of
eleven or twelve…how can we use common reasoning to explain him?
Most likely, this Ji Ning made some sort of a breakthrough.” The
gray-robed said in a hoarse voice. “This sort of monster…he was
able to kill two of our comrades, even when we were in formation.
Now, all we can do is stay here and wait.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was knocked flying
backwards a great distance, and he smashed into a region of loose
rocks and grass.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good heavens.”
Ning crawled painfully to his feet. The wounds on his body rapidly
healed, leaving behind not even a scar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those Zifu Disciples
seemed to have gone berserk. They applied all of those extremely
powerful Dao-seals and threw them at me! That fiery phoenix in
particular…it even chased after me, and it was also very powerful.
It blew a large hole into my chest. I wonder what sort of a Dao-seal
that was?” Ning cracked a smile, feeling very confident. “Still,
I killed two of them. For me to be able to kill two out of eight of
them…only six are left! I’ll keep killing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning!” A voice
suddenly rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch.” Ning
was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Well done, my good
fellow! Ji Ning, hahaha, you truly are formidable. You killed two of
them at one go. Now only six are remaining. However, don’t be too
impatient. Wait for me to finish talking, then attack.” Ninefire
sent hurriedly. “Dong Ziqi and the others are terrified by the way
you killed them, and so they have set up layers of techniques and are
staying on guard. Let me describe these techniques to you. After
listening, you can make your decision.”

Chapter 14 - Crushed
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ninefire sent, “We
are already familiar with Dong Ziqi and Muse, out of those six. Those
two have already set up the Eight Trigrams Blood Dragon Formation and
those growing green vines! The hawk-nosed cultivator used a formation
to protect the surrounding area! The black-clothed female cultivator
released a large amount of venomous bugs. The gray-robed cultivator
is holding a large banner which has released a large amount of
monster wraiths.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eight Trigrams Blood
Dragon Formation? Green vines? Formation? Venomous pests? Banner?
That’s only five; the sixth cultivator?” Ji Ning asked softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The sixth cultivator
hasn’t done anything for now.” Ninefire sent. “I’ve told you
everything now. You should consider how you will attack. Remember,
don’t let yourself fall into any danger.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
Patriarch.” Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, Ning began to
ponder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prior to this, although
he killed two Zifu Disciples in his surprise attack, he hadn’t
acquired any magic treasures, because as soon as he had charged over,
he had been blasted backwards. The items of those two Zifu Disciples
were still in the hands of Dong Ziqi’s group.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five types of
techniques?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph!” Ning’s
eyes had a cold light flash through them. “No matter how they
struggle, they will die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Jadechild, senior apprentice-brother Zidao.” A
voice suddenly called out. “We just suffered the attack from the
dragon’s tail of the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation! The genius of
the Ji clan, Ji Ning, is in command of the dragon’s tail. The power
of it is tremendous. He killed two of our fellow apprentices! All we
can do for now is stay on guard. Senior apprentice-brothers Jadechild
and Zidao, remember, beware the rain…beware the rain!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The six of you need
to be careful as well. Delay as long as you can.” A voice rang out
from the other side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hearing the distant
shouts, Ning frowned slightly. “I have to eliminate those six as
soon as possible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao was very
formidable!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was even able to
recognize at one glance that this was the Netherwyrm Heavenlock
Formation. Although Ning was very confident in the Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation, he still worried that if they were permitted to
slowly analyze it, they might truly be able to break through the
Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation! If the Netherwyrm Heavenlock
Formation was destroyed, then the Ji clan’s members would, one by
one, have their formations broken, and Snowdragon Mountain would
easily annihilate the Ji clan’s side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.” Ning,
riding on that enormous draconic tail, once more charged towards
those six.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Venomous pests were
flying around the outer perimeter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hazy pyramid of light
stood on guard, and atop it was coiled a large number of green vines.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The pyramid of light
had eight blood dragons swimming about within it. It also had various
enormous phantasmal birds and beasts moving about, each one of them
filled with murderous auras.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we just defend,
no matter how powerful they are, they will find it hard to break
through.” The black-clothed female cultivator said in her cold
voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Dong Ziqi
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These defensive
measures were different in nature; they each compensated for the
weaknesses of the others. They could be described as an impenetrable
wall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even though he is a
Fiendgod Body Refiner, and even though his swordplay might be
formidable, he can forget about entering.” The gray-robed elder
clutched that large banner and spoke in an icy voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rustle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thin, sparse droplets
of rain began to fall. The rain was as fine as silk, gentle and
breezing. Drizzling rain and fog…these two were beautiful things,
but the rain that fell in the midst of this black fog made the faces
of Dong Ziqi, Muse, the gray-robed elder, the black-robed woman, the
hawk-nosed man, and the skinny man change. They grew nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s coming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The rain came.”
Dong Ziqi’s group of six held their breaths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prior to this, when the
rainwater fell, two of their comrades were silently ambushed and
slaughtered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chopchopchopchop…”
The large number of venomous pests that had been swirling around the
outside were suddenly chopped apart by the rainwater, one after
another. The silk-like rain…every single strand of rain was as
sharp as a knife. Countless lines of rain flew about, wildly chopping
apart these pests. Rainwater was everywhere. Although there were many
venomous pests, because they were outside the perimeter, many of them
were instantly slaughtered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single line of
rain contained a hint of the power of the Dao!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Waterflame Lotus; this
technique was developed based on control over natural fire and water,
which Ning gained through his comprehension of the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These lines of rain
were also formed from natural water. Given Ning’s comprehension of
the Dao, their killing power approached that of the Waterflame Lotus
now! To use them to break through the formation and kill these Zifu
Disciples wasn’t practical, but to kill the venomous pests was
simplicity itself. The venomous pests swarmed about in dense
clusters; naturally, each of them were individually weak. When Ning
had battled against Bei Zishan in the past, he was able to
effortlessly crush and kill many venomous pests with his Waterflame
Lotus. Ning’s insights into the Dao were now far greater than they
had been in the past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rustle…” The
rain continued to fall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chirpchirpchirp…”
The flourishing swarm of venomous pests let out agonized cries, but
then they were annihilated. The outer perimeter, which had been
guarded by those dense clusters of venomous pests, had now become
very clear. All of the venomous pests had been annihilated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed female
cultivator’s face was ashen. She said frantically, “Why didn’t
you let my bugs return?” Prior to this, when her bugs suffered the
initial attacks, she had immediately wanted to control her bugs to
make them fly back and hide within the pyramid of white light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The pyramid
formation has been set up. How can we possibly disperse it for the
sake of your venomous pests?” The hawk-nosed cultivator shouted.
“The rainwater has already descended. Ji Ning can appear at any
moment! How can I disperse the pyramid? And even if I did disperse
it, only a small portion of your venomous bugs would be saved. Since
that was the case, it was best not to disperse it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed female
gritted her teeth in rage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-sister Lu, don’t be angry. It is true that the pyramid
cannot be dispersed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The power of this
rain is too formidable. Every single line of rain actually has the
power to attack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that this
is some sort of rainwater technique? Generally speaking, water-based
techniques are used for defense. This sort of rain which descends
from the heavens…rain which is completely formed from nature…how
can it be used in a technique?!” They were stunned at the power of
the rainwater. Those venomous pests were able to bite through a Zifu
Disciple’s protective armor, after all. Although they were
individually weak, to kill them wasn’t that easy either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be a Dao
Domain?” The gray-robed elder suddenly said slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dao Domain?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rainwater Domain?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other cultivators
all called out in shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can that be
possible? Impossible. Ji Ning is only sixteen! He’s merely a Zifu
Disciple. How can he have developed a Dao Domain? Many Wanxiang
Adepts are unable to do this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These Zifu Disciples
didn’t dare believe it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right at this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black fog in the
distance began to grow sparse. An enormous draconic tail slowly began
to move, and right in the middle of it was a fur-clad youth. The
fur-clad youth was surrounded by more than seven hundred flying
swords. Smiling slightly, he walked forward, step by step, towards
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is Ji Ning.”
Dong Ziqi and the rest of the six stared at the fur-clad youth. At
the same time, they felt astonished that Ji Ning dared come walk over
openly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Ziqi shouted, “Ji
Ning, ambushing us is one thing, but you come openly…you are
seeking death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning slowly strolled
forward. Suddenly, beneath his feet, a lotus flower appeared. A
beautiful, enormous Waterflame Lotus suddenly bloomed, making Ning
appear to be the seed within the lotus…the Waterflame Lotus petals
swiveled around him, and around the petals were the seven
hundred-plus flying swords. Beyond even them was the enormous shadow
of a draconic tail. And beyond the tail…was the boundless
rainwater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this moment, Ning
seemed to have become the center of the universe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even Dong Ziqi and the
others felt as though their souls had been stirred.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Muse, stop him.” Dong Ziqi shouted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave it to me.”
Muse’s normally cold face was filled with a murderous aura.
Instantly, many of the thick, sturdy vines began to wildly coil about
and fly towards Ning. These vines weren’t the vines that Ning had
encountered when he had fought against Muse the first time. Those
vines had been suddenly grown, but the vines that Muse was now using
against him had been growing for quite some time; they had already
reached an astonishing degree of toughness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rustle…” The
enormous Waterflame Lotus swiveled about him. After gaining insight
into the Dao Domain level, the power of Ning’s Waterflame Lotus had
risen yet again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Swish! Swish! Swish! Countless lines of rain seemed to chop down like
countless blades, wildly chopping at the vines. Countless thin vines
were shattered and minced into peaces, leaving behind only the thick
main vines, which had many wounds atop them. But upon touching the
Waterflame Lotus, they were instantly ground apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rustle…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One lotus flower after
another bloomed, with Ning at the center. The lotus flowers
continuously bloomed freely, and even the leaves of the lotus flowers
continuously expanded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The swiveling, crushing
power continued unabated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those vines weren’t
able to draw close to Ning at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break.” Ning
looked at the white pyramid of light, then spoke in a soft voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roar…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A faint draconic roar
rang out. The enormous draconic tail suddenly swept forward, smashing
viciously against the white pyramid of light. The draconic scales on
the draconic tail were all clearly visible, and the power of the tail
was astonishing. With an exploding sound, it smashed against the
white pyramid of light, crushing it and shattering it. As soon as it
did, the rainwater instantly fell down upon and uprooted the three
formation flags.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had already
effortlessly broken through the third layer of the five layers of
defenses they had set up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go. Devour his
soul.” The gray-robed elder waved the banner in his hands. This
banner wasn’t like Bei Zishan’s, which had been created through
refining countless mortal souls into dread wraiths. He used the souls
of powerful monstrous beasts, and so comparatively speaking, the
amount of sin he had accumulated was much smaller. The power of this
banner, although inferior to a dread Myriad Wraiths Banner, was still
much more powerful than Bei Zishan’s half-complete banner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These monster wraiths
emitted soundless shrieks as they charged towards Ning, completely
ignoring the rainwater and the blocking Waterflame Lotus flowers,
instantly invading Ning’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to
smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within his
consciousness, an image of Lady Nuwa emitted boundless light. When
the light touched those monster wraiths, smiling looks of relief
appeared on the faces of the formerly incomparably savage wraiths.
They all bowed towards Ning and towards the divine image of Lady
Nuwa, expressing their gratitude, and then disappeared, returning to
the cycle of reincarnation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” The
gray-robed elder watched as the colors of his banner began to grow
dim and dull. His face instantly changed. “The monster wraiths were
all killed?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The others, including
Dong Ziqi, had been eagerly looking at the gray-robed elder. Hearing
this, though, their hearts turned cold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning strolled forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Waterflame Lotus
continued to swivel…the rainwater continued to fall…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can die now.”
In front of Ning, a sword light suddenly formed. When it flew out, it
merged into the rainwater and vanished. And then, yet another sword
light appeared. Ning was releasing one blast of sword light after
another, without stopping.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How powerful was Ning’s
sword light now? A single sword light was enough to pierce through
the eight blood dragons and annihilate them all. As for the others,
such as the gray-robed elder and the hawk-nosed man, they all began
to howl savagely. They saw that their death had come. They all took
our their Dao-seals or unleashed their magic treasures, preparing to
go all out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang…” “Boom…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rainwater that
swirled around them seemed like an crushing wall of copper or a
rampart of steel. The Waterflame Lotuses continued to expand in
layers as it attacked them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had used
everything available to him, and he completely crushed these six Zifu
Disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!”
Accompanying a miserable, unwilling screech, Muse’s head was the
first to go flying. Ning had, at one go, unleashed nine blasts of the
[Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] sword light, transforming them all
into rainwater and merging them into the boundless rain of the
surrounding region. He began to easily kill them, one by one.
</P>

Chapter 15 - Spare No One
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Muse!” Dong Ziqi and the others, upon seeing
Muse’s head go flying, all turned cold. Prior to this, two of their
group of eight Zifu Disciples had been killed despite being in
formation by Ji Ning. And now, their six-man formation…Ning had
shattered their layered protections, and for him to kill them now was
indeed quite easy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go all out against
him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hawk-nosed man, the
gray-robed elder, the black-robed female cultivator…they all seemed
to have gone mad. It wasn’t that they didn’t want to flee;
trapped within the grand formation of the Ji clan, where could they
flee to? Only by staying here did they have a chance to live.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you struggle,
you’ll just die tired.” Ning walked forward, and the formerly
savage, wildly coiling thick vines seemed to rapidly transform into
nothingness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Swish! Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rain dropped down
like lines of silk. Within the rain, there were strands of [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation] sword light that had transformed into
incomparably sharp ‘rain’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahhh!” Although
her body had been protected by that golden light, the black-robed
woman’s eyes suddenly widened as a sword light chopped straight
through her neck, sending her beautiful head flying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yet another one had
died!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go die.” The
Dao-seal in the hands of the gray-robed elder suddenly transformed
into an enormous fiery phoenix which once more spread its wings and
flew towards Ning. But a curtain of water formed from the rainwater
around Ning blocked the advance of the fiery phoenix. Bang!!! An
violent explosion blasted apart the watery curtain, and even Ning’s
Waterflame Lotus trembled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning himself, however,
continued to walk forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Ning stared
at the gray-robed elder, whose face changed. He swung the banner in
his hands backwards, because yet another strand of rain was striking
towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A different strand of
rain whipped past the gray-robed elder’s forehead, piercing
straight through his head. His eyes were filled with a look of
terror, shock, and rage…and then, he collapsed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I simultaneously
attacked you with two strands of sword light. Did you think you
wouldn’t die?” With a thought, Ning then controlled the strands
of sword light to strike towards the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-sister Lu, senior apprentice-brother An, junior
apprentice-brother Muse.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-sister Lu!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The remaining three,
the hawk-nosed disciple, Dong Ziqi, and the skinny man, all had ashen
looks on their faces. The six of them had lost three of their number
in a flash! The power of those rain lines formed from sword light was
simply too great, especially with the support of the formation and
the Sword Domain. These were attacks of the Wanxiang Adept level. For
them to face these attacks by themselves was impossible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning! You will
definitely die!” Dong Ziqi had gone berserk. He stared at Ji Ning.
“You killed the disciples of Snowdragon Mountain. Snowdragon
Mountain will not let things end here!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You will definitely
die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snowdragon Mountain
has many more disciples. We will definitely eradicate your Ji clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three of them had
all gone berserk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hawk-nosed man and
Dong Ziqi were simultaneously sliced at by three lines of rain formed
from sword light. If they had only been struck by a single flash of
sword light, they would have been able to resist, but three lines of
rain formed from sword light swirled about them. How could they
resist? Their foreheads were pierced through, and their eyes became
filled with terror, anger, and disbelief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, Dong Ziqi, am the
number one expert of Swallow Mountain. I, I actually died in the
hands of Ji Ning. I’m unwilling to accept this. I’m unwilling to
accept this!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Detestable,
detestable! If I had known, I wouldn’t have come here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them had
both been heroic figures of their eras. Actually, if it hadn’t been
for the support of the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation, given that
Ning only had early-stage Zifu-level energy, either of the two would
have been able to battle with Ning for quite a long period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But with the support of
the great formation, they died in a single exchange.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snick.” The
remaining person, the skinny man, had his neck severed as well, but
then flesh grew out of his neck as it instantly healed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Fiendgod Body
Refiner?” Ning lifted an eyebrow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, can you
spare my life?” The skinny man took a step back and looked at Ning.
Although he was a middle-stage Fiendgod Body Refiner, he no longer
felt any confidence. The difference in power between them was too
great…with the support of the formation and the Rainwater Sword
Domain, Ning absolutely had the power of a Wanxiang Adept. He could
crush him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed softly.
“Given how far this has gone, you tell me. Will I spare you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black wings on
Ning’s back trembled, and he suddenly shot towards the skinny man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning!” The
skinny man howled with rage as he gripped a long black staff in his
hands. “Ji Ning, our Snowdragon Mountain will definitely annihilate
your Ji clan and kill you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three flashes of sword
light slashed across his body. Although the skinny man’s body was
durable, he was still quadsected by the sword flashes of the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation]. As for Ning, who charged towards him…the
Waterflame Lotus swiveled around him, grinding down that skinny man,
making it so that the man’s corpse was instantly ground into
mincemeat. Although the mincemeat struggled to solidify into a whole,
they were only able to resist the Waterflame Lotus for a few breaths
before completely dissipating.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The surrounding area
was now completely silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rain still fell in
a drizzle, and the Waterflame Lotus continued to slowly swivel back
and forth. Ning, standing in the middle of the lotus, swept the
surrounding area with his gaze. Dong Ziqi and the others lay fallen
on the ground, none of them breathing, all of them dead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dead.” Ning said
softly. “This group of Zifu Disciples has been completely
exterminated. Only the other group of Zifu Disciples remain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two badges of Zifu
Disciples from Snowdragon Mountain had entered the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first batch of
twelve Zifu Disciples had been completely annihilated!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It wasn’t that they
were weak; it was that Ning was too powerful!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although, for the Ji
clan, even though they had the help of the Netherwyrm Heavenlock
Formation, for them to kill these twelve was still quite hard. Prior
to this, when Ji Truekeep and the old servant Ah Xing had tested
their attacks, they found that aside from being able to kill those
four people in the first ambush, they were no longer able to achieve
much success after Dong Ziqi’s group of eight had set down their
formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ji Ning, he was
able to use the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation to make up for his
own weakness in elemental energy. He also had the [Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation] and his Rainwater Sword Domain, which allowed his
power to reach the Wanxiang Adept level. And this was what had
allowed him to crush them and slaughter them all…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Halfway up the
mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ninefire, in control
of the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation, revealed a look of shock an
amazement on his face. He was so excited, his entire body was
trembling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch?” The
nearby Ji Yichuan looked at Ninefire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Victory. Ji Ning
won.” Ninefire was incomparably agitated. “Dong Ziqi’s group
has been completely killed by Ji Ning. The first group of twelve Zifu
Disciples of Snowdragon Mountain has been completely annihilated.
None are left.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan, hearing this,
felt his heart tremble as well. “The first group is completely
dead?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ninefire
nodded repeatedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were both excited
as well as in a state of disbelief…they were merely the Ji clan,
after all, just a clan of the Swallow Mountain region! What they
faced was an enormous organization Snowdragon Mountain. The enemy’s
group of Zifu Disciples who had hastened over here would have utterly
terrified any ordinary clan. Even Ninefire had only wanted to delay
until an Celestial Envoy of the Grand Xia Dynasty arrived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They hadn’t thought
that they would actually be able to kill twelve Zifu Disciples in a
row, without a single member of the Ji clan dying!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now, only one
remains.” Ninefire said. “Jadechild and Nong Zidao’s group of
Zifu Disciples.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once we kill them,
our victory is assured.” Yichuan said hurriedly. “Nong Zidao in
particular. If we kill Nong Zidao…I refuse to believe that
Snowdragon Mountain would be able to find a second expert in
formations in a short period of time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The second group
holds Jadechild, Nong Zidao, and others. As long as Nong Zidao dies,
our Ji clan will have won for certain.” Ninefire nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snowdragon Mountain
might have other Zifu Disciples who would hasten over…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But experts in
formations were rare. Nong Zidao had only come to give face to
Jadechild. In the region nearby Swallow Mountain, aside from Nong
Zidao, Snowdragon Mountain had no other experts who were particularly
skilled in formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation. An abyssal aura wafted about.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao was frowning
as he was analyzing the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation. He seemed to
have completely absorbed himself in calculating the positions of the
Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other Zifu
Disciples all stared around them, on high alert.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jadechild stood by Nong
Zidao’s side, with the aura of a general who would block anything
and everything which came.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Muse, stop him!” A series of shouts rang out
from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go all out against
him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Juniog
apprentice-sister Lu, senior apprentice-brother An, junior
apprentice-brother Muse!” Fierce, grief-stricken shouts rang out
from afar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you will
definitely die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, our
Snowdragon Mountain will definitely annihilate your Ji clan and kill
you!” A berserk, desolate curse rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, utter
silence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no longer any
sound that could be heard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao had already
opened his eyes, and a look of utter solemnity was in Jadechild’s
gaze. The other nearby Zifu Disciples all had extremely ugly looks on
their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Dong.” Jadechild called out in a loud voice
which echoed within the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No voice replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not a single voice!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dead.” Nong Zidao
said hoarsely. “All dead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We, we…senior
apprentice-brother Zidao. Senior apprentice-brother Jadechild…”
The red-haired cultivator stuttered. The other cultivators all looked
towards Jadechild and Nong Zidao. Prior to this, there had been
twelve Zifu Disciples in that group, but all of them had been killed.
How could they not worry? How could they not feel uneasy?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jadechild growled,
“Obey my orders. Junior apprentice-brother Zidao, continue
analyzing the formation. Fairy Crane, Landwyrm, continue to protect
junior apprentice-brother Zidao. Myself and the rest of the six, we
will set up the formation and protect junior apprentice-brother
Zidao.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the
formation lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All you need to
worry about is defense.” Jadechild’s eyes were glowing with a
golden light as he swept the surrounding area with his gaze. “If
that Ji Ning truly does come, let me handle him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll entrust
everything to you, senior apprentice-brother Jadechild.” Nong Zidao
said. At the same time, he set up eight formation flags within an
area of ten meters. A black tower of light instantly sprang up,
layering protections around him. The only people within the black
tower of light was Nong Zidao, the Landwyrm, and the Fairy Crane.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry.”
Jadechild’s eyes were calm, but his baleful aura surged to the
heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As someone who had
become a peak Zifu-level Fiendgod Body Refiner long ago, and one who
trained in a divine ability and thus was able to fight at the
Wanxiang Adept level, how could he fear Ji Ning?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Golden Crow hung
high in the sky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the governor’s
mansion, inside an enormous city.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the two elders
of the Dong clan, Dong Fanyu, was seated there. Next to him there was
a youth, who laughed and said, “Senior Dong, please wait
momentarily. The Patriarch will arrive shortly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No rush, no rush.”
Dong Fanyu laughed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Four members of
Snowdragon Mountain’s Swallow Mountain branch had gone out to
invite people; the two elders of the Dong clan, Muse, and Ju
Nianxiong. Of the four, Muse had gone to invite Jadechild and Nong
Zidao, which he felt was enough, and so he had returned earlier.
Based on their original plans, each of them needed to invite roughly
ten or so Zifu Disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two elders of the
Dong clan and Ju Nianxiong had invited many, but some of the Zifu
Disciples they wished to invite had already gone to Snowdragon
Mountain. Thus, they continued to go out and invite more; only after
each of them had successfully invited ten over would it be enough.
They had no idea as to what was happening in Swallow Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Fanyu.” A deep voice rang out. A silver-robed,
middle-aged man walked out. “Last time I saw you, senior
apprentice-brother, you were back at Swallow Mountain. In the blink
of an eye, more than a hundred years have gone by. Earlier, senior
apprentice-brother, you told my subordinates that there is something
important you wish to discuss with me. What is it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A wonderful affair!”
Dong Fanyu’s face was all smiles.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
<BR>

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_16___Wanxiang_Adept"></A>
Chapter 16 - Wanxiang Adept
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A wonderful affair?”
The silver-robed man had a puzzled look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Fanyu said, his
face all smiles, “I’m not going to hide this from you, junior
apprentice-brother Wu. This time, we’ve come to deliver you a
chance to render some major merits. At my Swallow Mountain region,
we’ve just discovered an enormous elemental ore mine. This
elemental ore mine has a circumference of four thousand or so
kilometers…” Dong Fanyu spent quite a period of time praising the
elemental ore mine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elemental ore mine?”
A clear, cold voice rang out, and a young man dressed in a long,
beautiful black robe emerged from a side door of the hall. This young
man had long, narrow eyes and a tall nose. He looked like a viper,
and his gaze alone made Dong Fanyu tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Fanyu hurriedly
rose to his feet, then asked in a low voice, “Junior
apprentice-brother Wu, this is…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The silver-haired man
had already risen to his feet early on, bowing towards the young man
with incomparable respect. “Master!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master?” Dong
Fanyu was very shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is my master,
Adept Xu.” The silver-robed man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Fanyu, upon
hearing his junior apprentice-brother Wu address this person as
‘master’, immediately knew who this young man was. Immortal
practitioners…couldn’t be judged from their outward appearances.
The more powerful a person was, the more often they tended to look
young. If you were to run into a young Immortal practitioner who
looked like a child, one would have to be very careful!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Fanyu was a
disciple of Snowdragon Mountain, after all; he knew that his junior
apprentice-brother Wu was a student of a core disciple of the main
sect, ‘Xu Li’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were both students
of the main sect, but the difference in their status was very
different.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snowdragon Mountain
would divide up students based on their innate talent and potential.
Some people who had the potential to break through to become Wanxiang
Adepts or even had the chance to become Primal Daoists. Naturally,
they would be heavily investd in. Xu Li was a core disciple, and had
in fact reached the Wanxiang level more than sixty years ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dong Fanyu pays his
respects to Adept Xu.” Dong Fanyu immediately bowed and saluted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You were speaking of
an elemental ore mine?” Adept Xu said calmly. “Your Swallow
Mountain branch actually discovered an elemental ore mine…so why
have you come to invite my disciple?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Fanyu said
hurriedly, “I don’t dare to hide anything from you, Adept…”
He described what had happened in detail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu nodded
lightly, a hint of a smile at the corner of his lips. “So that’s
how it is. I didn’t expect that on this leisure trip of mine, I
would encounter this sort of wonderful affair. Wu Qi, accompany your
master on a trip to Swallow Mountain and take over the elemental ore
mine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Fanyu said,
delighted and surprised, “Adept, if you go, then this matter will
be settled!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But although he was
delighted on the outside, he was cursing inwardly. Discovering the
elemental ore mine was a great accomplishment, but if the Swallow
Mountain branch was actually able to take it over, that would be an
even greater one! But for a Wanxiang Adept to now intervene…Wanxiang
Adepts were extremely important members of Snowdragon Mountain. After
all, the highest ranking Primal Daoists rarely involved themselves in
worldly matters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, for Adept Xu to
intervene and take over the elemental ore mine meant that when the
main Snowdragon Mountain sect divided up accomplishments, the
percentage that Adept Xu would receive would be very high.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a Wanxiang Adept to
intervene…it meant that every single Zifu Disciple would lose a
majority of their potential rewards!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could a puny Ji
clan necessitate a Wanxiang Adept to intervene.” Dong Fanyu felt
misery in his heart, but on the surface, he looked incomparably
excited. He didn’t dare say a single word of complaint.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu gave this old
fellow surnamed Dong a sidelong glance. He couldn’t care less about
him. “Come. Let’s go to Swallow Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sailboat suddenly
appeared beneath his feet. Adept Xu, Wu Qi, and Dong Fanyu all
boarded the ship. Wu Qi then sent a message to the Zifu Disciples of
his own clan: “I’m making a trip to Swallow Mountain. I will
return in a few days.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. A white sail
fluttered atop the sailboat, and then it transformed into a streak of
light, piercing through the skies at an astonishing speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So fast.” Dong
Fanyu was in a state of shock. This was the first time he had flown
on a flying magic treasure controlled by a Wanxiang Adept.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll only need
two hours to reach Swallow Mountain.” Adept Xu said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sailboat left
behind just a speck of light in the horizon, then completely
disappeared. As for Dong Fanyu…he didn’t go invite any other Zifu
Disciples. After all, since a Wanxiang Adept was taking part, why
bother go asking any Zifu Disciples to come?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……………….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within an ancient city.
Within a hall that was in a rather remote location. There were five
jade strips glittering with azure light. The jade strips were all the
size of a palm and very slender, seemingly quite exquisite.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were two servants
seated within the hall. They were chatting amongst each other, bored.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” “Bang!”
Two of the jade strips suddenly shattered, one after the other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two servants were
both startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What was that? Was
that a mouse?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How odd.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They looked around with
mystified looks on their faces. And then, one of them saw that two of
the jade strips in front of them had completely shattered. He was so
terrified that his face changed. “Life…life…” The other
servant, seeing the look on his face, couldn’t help but mumble,
“Why are you so scared? This is the governor’s estate. How could
there be any dange-…life…life…” He, too, stared in terror at
the shattered jade strips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The life tablets!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The life tablets are
shattered!” The two servants stared at each other, their eyes
filled with shock and terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, quick, report
this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them charged
out wildly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a major event!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just moments later!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoosh!” A ray of
light surged into the skies, and standing above the ray of light was
an old man with triangular pupils. His eyes were filled with savagery
as well. “Two Zifu Disciples died? What exactly is going on in
Swallow Mountain?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The life tablets,
the life tablets are shattered!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Life tablets!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the instant that Ji
Ning killed those eight Zifu Disciples, in the commandery cities
around the Swallow Mountain area, one clan after another discovered
that life tablets of their Zifu Disciples had just shattered. If the
life tablet was shattered, that meant the Zifu Disciple was
definitely dead! Naturally, these clans were shocked and enraged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the other Zifu
Disciples even began to fly at high speed towards Swallow Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Swallow
Mountain. Oxhorn Mountain, located eight hundred kilometers outside
of the City of Ten Thousand Swords. The entire area was covered with
black fog.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning stood there,
and around him was a group of Zifu Disciple corpses, including Dong
Ziqi’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrm?” Ning
frowned. He could sense a savage, fierce aura constantly pouring into
the Darknorth swords in his hands. Earlier, he had relied on the
[Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] to kill, but to be safe, Ning had
also kept the Darknorth swords in his hands. However, that ferocious
aura coming from the corpses actually was drawn into the Darknorth
swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Darknorth swords
are weapons that have undergone the Fiendgod Bloodforging rites! They
are able to absorb baleful auras, murderous auras, necromantic
auras…but you have to personally kill someone.” Ning understood
this. The boundless earth was filled with baleful auras in many
places; for example, when Bei Zishan had tortured countless people to
death, that place became filled with a tremendous amount of baleful
auras and murderous auras. But because those countless people hadn’t
been killed by Ning, Ning hadn’t been able to absorb those baleful
auras.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning had personally
killed all eight of these Zifu Disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Darknorth swords
were able to actively draw from them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How strange. Why is
it that they can only absorb the baleful auras created by those I
personally killed, and not other baleful auras?” Ning shook his
head inwardly. He thought back to the Fiendgod Rites of Bloodforging,
and to that ancient, powerful aura which descended that was
unfathomably more exalted than even the ‘Dao’. “It makes sense.
If it can grow just by absorbing any type of baleful aura, then it
would be far too easy for Bloodforged weapons to grow in power.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? In my body…?”
Ning lowered his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Surges of savage auras
were constantly entering his body; or, to be more precise, Ning’s
Zifu within his body was drawing it all in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Zifu, that
region which was filled with violet energy in the shape of a lake.
That lake was formed from elemental energy, and above that lake of
elemental energy there were various magical treasures, such as a
flying boat, flying swords, and other items that temporarily didn’t
need to be used. Amongst them was one of the Darknorth swords, which
hovered there…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given that he was
holding two of the Darknorth swords in his hands, there was one of
them that was still stored within his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Before establishing the
Zifu, there was no way for a person to store magic treasures within
the body! But upon doing so, ranked magic treasures and the
Bloodforged weapons could be stored into his body. As for those
unranked magic treasures, there was no way they could be drawn in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Crackle…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three Darknorth
swords. Two were outside, one was within his Zifu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They shared the baleful
auras, wildly devouring them. As they did so, on the surface of the
Darknorth swords there appeared a common character, from the Fiendgod
language…‘Kill’. The Darknorth swords themselves were evolving;
after they had undergone the Rites of Bloodforging, this was the
densest collection of baleful auras which the Darknorth swords had
ever devoured.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all, the baleful
aura generated from killing a Zifu Disciple was far denser than the
aura generated from killing ten thousand ordinary mortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All done.” Moments
later, the three Darknorth swords all emerged to hover in front of
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The glow of the
Darknorth swords seemed to be even deeper.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He used his divine will
to control those three Darknorth swords to slice through the air.
Swishswishswish…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning even stretched out
his palm to allow the Darknorth swords to slice against it. Three
wounds appeared, then rapidly closed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They did indeed grow
much sharper.” Ning revealed a look of surprise and delight. “It
seems that to nurture these powerful Bloodforged weapons, there
really is a need for much slaughter.” Ning, by nature, disliked
wanton killing, but if someone was to violate and offend him and give
his Ji clan no chance for survival, Ning wouldn’t show a hint of
pity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch.” Ning
said. “How should I attack the other group of Zifu Disciples?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
Patriarch Ninefire sent back. “The other group has a total of seven
Zifu Disciples and two Zifu spirit-beasts. The most powerful of them
are Nong Zidao and Jadechild. Nong Zidao is a formations expert; he
isn’t frightening in open battle. The other Zifu Disciples, even
combined, are unable to do anything to you. The biggest problem for
you will be that Jadechild.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Jadechild?” Ning
nodded lightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Jadechild should be
an Fiendgod Body Refiner. I am always watching him. From their
conversations, I can tell…that they are very confident in
Jadechild. They know that twelve Zifu Disciples have died, yet still
have full trust in Jadechild! I also heard those Zifu Disciples
mention the phrase ‘divine ability’. If my guess is correct,
Jadechild should be a peak Zifu Disciple who has learned a divine
ability.” Ninefire sent. “A peak Zifu Ki Refiner who has a divine
ability…his power will absolutely be at the Wanxiang Adept level.
You must be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wanxiang Adept level?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By relying on an
elemental energy that was more powerful than the peak Zifu level, the
Rainwater Sword Domain, and the [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation]…Ning, too, could be said to have the combat ability of a
Wanxiang Adept!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enemy was a
Fiendgod Body Refiner and had a divine ability?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you can’t kill
Jadechild, do your best to kill Nong Zidao.” Ninefire sent. “Nong
Zidao is their one and only formations expert. As long as Nong Zidao
dies, there is no way they will be able to defeat our Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation. We will still be able to hold on until the
Grand Xia Dynasty’s Celestial Envoy arrives.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.” Ning
nodded. “I understand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning waved his hand,
and a large number of storage-type magic treasures, flying swords,
wings, banners, and other magic treasures appeared. These were all
magic treasures that had been left behind by these eight Zifu
Disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll first
retrieve all the ranked flying swords these people carry. After I
bind all of them, perhaps my [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] will
gain further in power. And then, at full strength, I will go battle
that Jadechild.” Ning’s eyes were filled with a killing intent.

Chapter 17 - Ji Ning Battles Jadechild (part 1)
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sailboat was sailing
through the endless horizons of the sky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu Li, Dong
Fanyu, and Wu Qi were seated in the sailboat. Dong Fanyu suddenly
pointed in surprise towards the distance. “That’s junior
apprentice-brother Lu.” From afar, a ray of light was advancing at
high speed, but clearly it was far slower than them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He seems to be
headed towards Swallow Mountain as well?” Wu Qi was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Apprentice-nephew
Lu?” Adept Xu Li revealed a rare smile on his face. Instantly, that
flying sailboat drew closer to the ray of light. A few breaths later,
it had moved next to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ray of light had a
middle-aged man standing atop it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The middle-aged man had
a hint of urgency in his eyes. Upon seeing the sailboat block his
way, he was forced to slow down. But upon seeing Adept Xu Li standing
atop the sailboat, he immediately bowed with respect. “Lu Huang
greets uncle-master Xu. I didn’t imagine I’d run into you here,
Uncle-Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon seeing Dong Fanyu
by Adept Xu’s side, Lu Huang’s eyes instantly turned red, and he
roared angrily, “You old bastard, Dong Fanyu!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s this about,
apprentice-nephew Lu?” Adept Xu asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother Lu, previously, I went to visit you and we chatted
happily. Why do you curse at me upon seeing me now? I came to deliver
to the Lu clan a chance to obtain a great merit.” Dong Fanyu felt
completely puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Huang was enraged.
Pointing at Dong Fanyu, he said furiously, “Uncle-Master Xu, this
Dong Fanyu previously came to my place to tell me about the elemental
ore mine. Thus, our Copperwater branch sent two Zifu Disciples, one
from my Lu clan and one from the An clan. But just a short time ago,
the life tablets of both the member of the Lu clan and the nearby An
clan were both suddenly shattered. My own little sister died. Dong
Fanyu claims that this is a chance to render great merits, and claims
that the puny Ji clan isn’t worth worrying about. But in reality?
Two of the Zifu Disciples of our Copperwater branch are dead! I’m
heading straight for Snowdragon City to investigate this clearly and
get some answers!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What, all dead?”
Dong Fanyu was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
Adept Xu frowned as well, and the nearby Wu Qi was growing angry as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If this matter grew
nettlesome, it would no longer be a chance to render a merit; it
would be a calamity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Fanyu said
frantically, “I didn’t lie. It really is just the Ji clan. There
are no other enemies. In addition, our Swallow Mountain branch
invited quite a few Zifu Disciple comrades of our organization. How
can…how can…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But it is a fact
that the two Zifu Disciples which our Copperwater branch sent both
died!” Lu Huang roared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, Dong Fanyu, swear
that if I lied to you, junior apprentice-brother Lu, then let my soul
be shattered and never return to the cycle of reincarnation.” Dong
Fanyu said frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only after hearing this
oath did Lu Huang’s face become less ugly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal practitioners
wouldn’t easily swear oaths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Lu Huang
let out a cold snort.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems Dong Fanyu
didn’t lie.” Adept Xu said calmly. “That means something
happened at Swallow Mountain. Apprentice-nephew Lu, follow me there.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu no longer
seemed as casual as before; instead, he was a bit cautious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sailboat
immediately pierced through the skies, advancing towards Swallow
Mountain at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Oxhorn Mountain. Within
the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was seated in
the lotus position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Flying swords were
hovering around him. When he had previously killed those eight Zifu
Disciples, he had searched their storage magic treasures…and had
found fifteen flying swords. The most pleasant surprise for Ning was
that hawk-nosed cultivator; the hawk-nosed cultivator’s storage
treasure actually held a total of nine flying swords…and it seemed
as though those nine flying swords came from the same source. They
all carried a frigid, icy aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon finding this, Ning
was immediately overjoyed. “Good, good, good. They come from the
same source. The formation base they can create will be much
stronger. This hawk-nosed man…was the hardest to kill of the eight.
I didn’t expect he would have so much treasure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning didn’t
know the hawk-nosed cultivator’s name, he knew that when he had
first launched the assassination attempt against them, the hawk-nosed
man seemed to have sensed the oncoming danger and had suddenly used a
giant umbrella to protect himself. Ning had planned to make him the
first target, but was forced to instead switch to a different one.
Afterwards, when they fought head on with their most powerful
attacks, Ning had to release three sword lights to kill him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prior to this, I had
thirteen ranked flying swords. Now I acquired fifteen more ranked
flying swords, and have a total of twenty eight…that’s enough to
create three formation bases.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning naturally
immediately began to bind these flying swords, wasting no time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Without question, his
[Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] would now have those nine frigid
flying swords that came from the same origin as the core.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Ning opened
his eyes. “Done.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fifteen new flying
swords had all been bound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me test them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning willed it…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seven hundred-plus
flying swords appeared in the air, with twenty seven of them being
ranked that formed three formation bases! The nine frigid flying
swords formed the core, controlling and guiding the entire [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s face
changed; his head hurt as though it were about to split apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To divide one’s mind
sufficiently in order to control so many flying swords and to set up
the ninth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] simply
required too much out of the soul, especially with ranked flying
swords involved…to control a single ranked flying sword was more
difficult than controlling ten unranked flying swords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no way I
can activate the ninth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation]?” Ning’s first attempt resulted in failure. He was
unable to activate it fully. “I simply added eighteen more ranked
flying swords, but I’m unable to use the ninth level of the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation]?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s not right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to test
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying swords
around him began to move about, changing their locations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yin and Yang
transform, endlessly engendering each other!” Ning suddenly thought
of the critical barrier needed to break through the seventh stage of
the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. The book discussed
‘Yin and Yang transforming, endlessly engendering each other’.
Now, while analyzing this formation…he suddenly began to understand
this principal. If he were to focus on gaining insights at this
moment, in perhaps just an hour or just a few days, he would break
through to the seventh stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the
Nine Heavens]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning didn’t
choose to meditate, because even if he rose in strength as a Fiendgod
Body Refiner, it wouldn’t increase his power much!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because he was
borrowing the power of the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation…his
elemental energy was a good deal stronger than even a peak Zifu
Adept’s. He also borrowed from his Sword Domain and the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation], which was why he was capable of such
power. Even if he rose in power as a Fiendgod Refiner, it wouldn’t
help him much in battle. Moreover, he didn’t have the time at all
to leisurely meditate on these matters right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yin and Yang
transform, endlessly engendering each other.” Ning stared at those
twenty seven flying swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine frigid flying
swords served as the core.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other flying swords
in the formation bases swirled around these nine frigid flying
swords. They slowly swirled about them, and even began to slowly
intersect with them. The power of the formation began to activate,
and two formation bases slowly merged into one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yin and Yang
mutually transform…” Ning’s eyes lit up. “One serves as the
core. Two serve to supplement. The others serve as everything else.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven hundred-plus
flying swords hovered around Ji Ning. A faint, incomparably powerful
ripple suddenly formed. In front of Ning, an incomparably fierce,
sharp sword light had taken shape. This sword light was now
completely in the shape of a flying sword; it was nothing more than a
flying sword that flashed with light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahhhh!” Ning felt
his head hurt, as though he were being stabbed. Still, his face had
an excited smile appear on it. “Hahaha, success, success.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he had gained
insight into the mysteries of how Yin and Yang transform and
endlessly engender each other, making it possible for him to use the
now much stronger ninth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation]…Ning was still at his absolute limit. Clearly, his soul
felt tremendous pressure right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Best to use the
eighth level.” Ning quickly removed eighty one ordinary flying
swords, but continued to maintain the hovering formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword light.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning once more formed a
ray of sword light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was sword light
formed from the eighth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation]. The sword light still appeared like a flying sword,
except the sword was not as clear as before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I feel as though the
power is still a bit greater than it was when I used the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation] to kill Dong Ziqi’s group.” Ning
revealed a hint of joy on his face. When he had killed Dong Ziqi’s
group, his [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] had nine ranked flying
swords, but he now had twenty seven…back then, he was using the
ninth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], but he was
currently now using the eighth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The current eighth
level was even more powerful than the former ninth level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, the reason
why the improvement was this noticeable was primarily because…the
core was now those ranked frigid flying swords that came from the
same location.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swoosh!” Ning
collected the flying swords, then hurried at high speed towards the
Patriarch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He quickly arrived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Ji
Ninefire and Ji Yichuan both looked at the suddenly arrived Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch, these are
the magic treasures, Dao-seals, medicine pills, and other items that
belonged to those Zifu Disciples I killed.” Ning said. “I’ve
kept these things, but the others are useless to me. I’ll give them
to you, Patriarch…some of these spirit pills are able to replenish
elemental energy. They are very useful to us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire nodded. Not
hesitating, he accepted the bracelet that Ning handed over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go deal with
Jadechild now.” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful.” The
nearby Yichuan warned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry,
Father.” Ning cracked a smile, then turned and, under the guidance
of Ninefire, moved through the parted black fog and hurried towards
Jadechild.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation was filled with that abyssal aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why hasn’t he come
yet?” Jadechild stood there like a Fiendgod, his aura rising to the
heavens, his long azure hair unbound, and surges of divine power
thrumming through him. He was currently in the formation of the
enemy, after all; he had to keep his divine power flowing, so as to
be able to release his most powerful combat abilities at any moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Jadechild, Ji Ning is only sixteen years old.
Prior to this, when he killed our other fellow apprentices, he must
have used some tricks. But you, senior apprentice-brother, are a
Fiendgod Refiner and have a divine ability. Those tricks will be
useless against you. He’s probably afraid.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He is almost
certainly afraid and hiding.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those Zifu Disciples
all agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jadechild just stood
there, his gaze sweeping into the darkness ahead of him. He couldn’t
help but wonder as well…was Ning truly afraid? If he wasn’t,
given that he knew that Nong Zidao was currently analyzing how to
break the formation, why had so much time passed after Ji Ning
killing Dong Ziqi’s group of Zifu Disciples? Why hadn’t he come?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had no idea that
Ning was currently binding flying swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. The more we
delay, the more confidence junior apprentice-brother Zidao will have.
Once we break this Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation! Without the
formation, you will all die.” Jadechild said with great confidence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rustle…faint lines of
drizzling rain suddenly appeared out of nowhere. The rain was icy
cold, and it fell down like foggy mist, spreading outwards. It was,
however, blocked by the six mation formation and rendered unable to
advance at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rainwater!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is rainwater!”
The other Zifu Disciples revealed looks of shock on their faces.
Prior to this, Dong Ziqi had told the others that this
rainwater…signified danger and perhaps death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rainwater!” A
golden light flashed in Jadechild’s eyes. He let out an angry
growl, and then his body emanated a dazzling golden as the entire
body began to increase in size. Rumble…he transformed into a nearly
two-story tall giant. The Zifu Disciples next to him were only as
tall as his kneecap. His breaths created tempests that caused the
surrounding space to crackle and explode. His footsteps caused the
entire world to seem to tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Divine ability -
Heavenly Transformation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The pupils of the eyes
of this giant shot out golden light, and the giant roared loudly, “Ji
Ning, come out and do battle!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This deep voice caused
his voice to echo, even within his own chest.
</P>

Chapter 18 - Ji Ning Battles Jadechild (part 2)
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The drizzling rain
drifted down gently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jadechild’s entire
body was covered with a layer of golden light. He looked like a gold
armored Fiend, and his eyes were filled with solidified golden light.
His very breath caused the surrounding area to tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crackle! Crackle!
Crackle!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The formerly soft,
gentle rain suddenly became as sharp as knives. The countless
raindrops wildly chopped towards the giant Jadechild, but the hazy
golden light covering the giant Jadechild’s body effortless
deflected them. He swept his gaze towards the surrounding areas.
Suddenly, a ripple caught Jadechild by surprise. Without hesitating
at all, he sent a fist smashing over!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A wheel-sized golden
fist smashed against one particular line of rain. This line of rain
was the transformed sword flash of the [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His fist was covered
with a black glove, but it was also covered by that hazy golden light
right now. Only if one looked closely would one see that beneath the
golden light, there was a glove.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His most powerful magic
treasure was that glove!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“BANG!” An
explosive sound. The giant Jadechild couldn’t help but be knocked a
step back by that attack, and his backwards step caused the ground to
tremble violently and fracture repeatedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What an impressive
Ji Ning.” The giant Jadechild narrowed his eyes. That line of rain
had actually contained such astonishing power. It was definitely at
the Wanxiang Adept level. No wonder that earlier group of Zifu
Disciples had all been killed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He was actually able
to make senior apprentice-brother Jadechild take a step back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hearts of the other
Zifu Disciples instantly grew taut. They understood that the
difference between Ji Ning and their senior apprentice-brother
Jadechild probably wasn’t that great.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are Jadechild?”
A clear, cold voice rang out. From within the black fog, an enormous
draconic tail began to move, and in the center of it was a fur clad
youth. The fur clad youth was wielding a sword in each hand, and
around him, a lotus flower was blooming and swiveling. Surrounded by
the Waterflame Lotus, he walked over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning!” The
giant Jadechild stared at this youth. He could sense an incomparably
deep, profound mystery from that blooming lotus flower. He vaguely
understood that in terms of the ‘Dao’, the youth in front of him
probably had an even deeper understanding than he did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A monster!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was only sixteen
years of age, but had actually reached such a deep level of
understanding when it came to the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wielding the Darknorth
swords in his hands, Ning strode forward. But upon seeing Jadechild,
Ning was greatly shocked. A golden light covered that massive,
cliff-like, two-story high body. That invisible, powerful Fiendgod
aura made even Ning feel pressure. Ning was probably only as high as
the enemy’s kneecaps.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the Heavenly
Transformation?” Ning mused to himself. He had heard of this divine
ability long ago, as this was known to be the most famous of the
divine abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Divine abilities were
very precious and very rare.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
only supreme clans, sects, and cults had access to them. However, the
majority of them used this ability, ‘Heavenly Transformation’!
Even in the Raindragon Guards, this divine ability was extremely
famous. As the most widespread divine ability, if one wanted to learn
it, naturally, the difficulty level would be a bit lower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But this didn’t mean
that the Heavenly Transformation divine ability was weak! The
prerequisites for this divine ability was low, but when trained to a
very high level, it was comparable to some truly formidable divine
abilities! When the Fiendgods of the primordial eras battled, they
loved to use the Heavenly Transformation ability. With a single
movement, one could increase to three hundred meters, three thousand
meters, or even thirty thousand meters in height.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those towering,
cliff-like Fiendgod bodies could even pick up a mountain range that
was thousands of kilometers long as easily as picking up a strand of
straw. For them, overturning a sea or flipping over a river was just
like taking a bath!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From this, one could
see how powerful this divine ability was…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course, those
were simply ancient myths, like the myth of Houyi shooting down the
suns. It was far too distant from them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
Suddenly, a gentle voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, who was about to
do battle with the giant Jadechild, was suddenly startled. Ning
looked over to the origin of that voice. Within that tower of black
light, there was an old man with simple clothes and unbound hair.
That man was smiling as he looked at Ning. “Your talent and
potential is truly astonishing. But what is even more precious is
that you were able to reach this level despite being in an ordinary,
regional clan. You are certainly a rarely seen piece of unpolished
jade. Your value far outstrips the value of this elemental ore mine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant Jadechild was
startled, as were the other Zifu Disciples as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you are willing,
then I am willing to swear an oath that I will guarantee your
entrance into our Snowdragon Mountain sect.” Nong Zidao said with a
smile. “Given your talent, you will definitely become one of the
most important and most core disciples, the ‘heir-disciples’.
Upon entering our school, your status will be no lower than that of a
Wanxiang Adept. Our Snowdragon Mountain will definitely expend
tremendous effort in training you, making you become a true, supreme
expert. In the future, even becoming a Primal Daoist…is possible!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jadechild was startled,
but then he too said in a low voice. “Ji Ning, since junior
apprentice-brother Zidao is willing to swear an oath, then you don’t
need to worry about this. If you join our Snowdragon Mountain, we
naturally won’t hold any grudges about what happened before this.
But if you refuse…then don’t blame me for being ruthless!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were trying to
pull him into Snowdragon Mountain?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I killed so many of
your fellow apprentices, but you’ll let me enter your school?”
Ning said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If they died, they
died.” Nong Zidao shook his head. “You are different from them.
Our Snowdragon Mountain has plenty of those average, ordinary Zifu
Disciples! But your talent and your current level of comprehension…I
truly have never seen anyone like you in all my life. As long as I
make the introductions, the Primal Daoists of our Snowdragon Mountain
sect will definitely accept you as a disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, too, had heard
his parents say that given his talents, it would be utter simplicity
for him to take roof under any of the major powers. Even the spirit
of the underwater estate had clearly shown a markedly better attitude
towards him after he had comprehended his Rainwater Sword Domain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To gain insight into
the Rainwater Sword Domain at age sixteen…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sort of talent was
indeed monstrous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The results of this
grudge between your Ji clan and my Snowdragon Mountain have been the
deaths of Snowdragon Mountain disciples only. Within this formation,
not a single member of your Ji clan has perished. I imagine that you
have no reason to feel hatred towards my Snowdragon Mountain.” Nong
Zidao then said, “Since we have no hatred for each other, while you
yourself come from a regional clan and have a completely clean
history, and are so monstrously talented, why wouldn’t the main
sect use all of its efforts to cultivate you? In a few hundred years,
it’s even possible that you will become the Sect Leader of our
Snowdragon Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant Jadechild
also spoke out. “If you join our Snowdragon Mountain, then what
happened before will be of little consequence. But if you do not join
Snowdragon Mountain…given how many of our fellow apprentices your
Ji clan has killed, for the sake of our face, Snowdragon Mountain
will definitely annihilate your Ji clan. Consider this carefully.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Consider this well.”
Nong Zidao said as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two options.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One to join them; that
would make them all one family. As for the dead? That would have
simply been a case where a heir-disciple of extremely exalted status
killed a few outer disciples. A small matter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other option was to
refuse. To have killed so many disciples was an affront to Snowdragon
Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” Ning
laughed. How could he join Snowdragon Mountain? Just now, Nong Zidao
had said that there was no enmity between their sides, and that
Ning’s history was clean, that he was monstrously talented, and
that Snowdragon Mountain would focus on training him…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But loyalty would be
the number one thing a sect would consider in cultivating its
disciples.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Before accepting him as
an heir-disciple, Snowdragon Mountain would definitely do a thorough,
close investigation of his history. By then, the events which
happened to Ji Yichuan and Yuchi Snow would probably be revealed!
Snowdragon Mountain had caused the deaths of Ning’s mother and
uncle…given what a huge enmity lay between them, Snowdragon
Mountain would never dare to train Ning, no matter how talented he
was. Instead, it would want to destroy him as soon as possible, to
prevent him from becoming a problem in the future!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cut the crap.”
Ning barked. “Don’t even think of trying to dissuade me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you…”
Nong Zidao, within that black tower, shook his head. “One step
wrong leads to countless steps wrong. If you join Snowdragon Mountain
now…it isn’t too late yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t waste any
more words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just on the basis of
the ‘loyalty’ issue alone…Ning would be finished once they ran
a background investigation on him. It was best to follow his previous
plans; annihilate all of these fellows immediately, and delay until
the Grand Xia Dynasty’s Celestial Envoy arrived! Once the Celestial
Envoy arrived, they would have the protection of the Grand Xia
Dynasty…even if Snowdragon Mountain was a hundred times as bold,
they would never dare to do anything. They would have to swallow it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As long as he had
enough time…Snowdragon Mountain? He would eventually rip them
apart!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then die!” The
giant Jadechild smiled savagely as he stomped hard against the
ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The earth trembled, and
countless shattered rocks and sand flew about. Within the flying sand
and rocks, there could faintly be seen countless granules of sand
that flashed with golden light. These golden specks of sand wildly
swirled about like a giant whirlpool which surrounded the giant
Jadechild, with a portion of the golden sand wildly charging towards
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the magic
treasure which the giant Jadechild often used…the ‘Stellar
Sands’!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thud! Thud! Thud!”
The giant Jadechild stomped on the ground, leaving behind a giant
golden blur as he charged towards Ning with crushing force.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rainwater
surrounding Ning formed itself into a resilient curtain of water. The
translucent water curtain was constantly swirling…when the golden
sand struck wildly against it, they were all forcibly stopped by the
watery curtain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” A
wheel-sized golden fist smashed through the watery curtain. In the
fact of that punch, even the blooming Waterflame Lotus seemed
incomparably weak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What astonishing
speed.” Ning’s face changed slightly as the black wings behind
him suddenly trembled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Divine ability -
Windwing Evasion!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden fist smashed
through the Waterflame Lotus and pierced past Ning’s frame, but
there was no hint of delight on the giant Jadechild’s face. This
was because it was just an ‘afterimage’ that his fist had punched
through. Ning’s speed was simply too fast, and he was too agile; he
had instantly dodged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no use.
You won’t be able to escape.” The giant Jadechild took a step
forward, causing the earth to crack. He himself once more transformed
into a golden light as he charged towards Ning, and his fist easily
tore apart the watery curtain and the Waterflame Lotus.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too fast.” Ning
was forced to dodge again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having used the
Windwing Evasion three times in a row, Ning finally managed to pull
away from him. Ning discovered that…in terms of straight line
movements, this giant Jadechild was actually even faster than he was!
After having executed the Heavenly Transformation and increased in
size, Jadechild’s speed and strength rose to an astonishing level.
Ning didn’t dare face him head on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because, when
he had used the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] earlier, the enemy
had used his fist to block it, and had only been forced a single step
back. From this, one could tell how powerful that fist was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, Ning had
the Windwing Evasion, and so had a bit of an advantage in terms of
agility. He was also more nimble to begin with, given his smaller
size, while the giant Jadechild was so large that his turning ability
was naturally inferior.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Lesser Thousand
Swords Formation].” Seven hundred flying swords suddenly appeared
round Ji Ning, but amongst them, only six hundred or so glowed with
white light. Ning had only activated the eighty level of the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sword flash
materialized in front of his chest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While using the
Windwing Evasion to dodge, Ning simultaneously released six rays of
sword light. The six rays of sword light merged into rainwater, then
disappeared, transforming into lines of rain…silently, soundless,
the six went sweeping towards the direction of the giant Jadechild.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_19___Ji_Ning_Battles_Jad"></A>
Chapter 19 - Ji Ning Battles Jadechild (part 3)
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Crackle…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The countless golden
grains of the Stellar Sands were swirling around the giant Jadechild.
When the six rays of sword light that had transformed into lines of
rain wished to pass through them, the Stellar Sands would naturally
be knocked flying away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant Jadechild
roared loudly, “Ambushing me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His fist suddenly
unclenched and expanded into his giant, fan-shaped palm. Whooooosh.
He swiped out towards the surrounding area, as fast as a blur. His
two giant palms instantly formed a protective barrier around himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang! Bang! Bang!”
Consecutive explosive sounds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six rays of sword
light had all been stopped!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a fast palm
technique.” The distant Ning, seeing this, was astonished.
“Although his body increased in size after using his divine
ability, resulting in him becoming a bit less agile, his palms are
still astonishing fast!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, accept
death!” The giant Jadechild’s body transformed into a golden blur
as he charged straight towards Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” The black
wings behind Ning’s body trembled, and at the same time, a sword
light formed in front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as the sword
light flew out, it was smashed apart by the giant Jadechild.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” The giant
Jadechild was like a fiendish god, his face savage. His twin fists
swung out towards Ning like a pair of meteors!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Back! Back! Back!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning used his Windwing
Evasion at full strength. Because the giant Jadechild was much
faster, Ning had to rely on his agility to dodge. He wasn’t able to
pull away at all; it was like dancing atop a steel wire!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one walked too long
by the sides of a river, eventually, one’s shoes would grow wet!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoosh!” The giant
Jadechild was clearly to the right, but suddenly his fist suddenly
appeared and smashed straight towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! The rainwater was
knocked flying!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! The blooming
Waterflame Lotus was completely crushed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wielded two swords
in his hands, and they transformed into two streaks of flowing water.
The light of his swords was soft and gentle as they struck forward to
welcome the oncoming, attacking golden fist. “Bang!” A giant
collision. Jadechild felt as though his fists had smashed into
something that was incomparably slick and soft, that couldn’t be
affected by his power. He had the feeling that his punch had missed,
or that it had been pulled astray.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang.” Ning
himself was knocked flying back tens of meters, and a wound had
appeared at the joints of his palms, although it then quickly healed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a fellow.”
Ning was shocked by the power of that punch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had power that
surpassed that of a peak Zifu Ki Refiner, and also the Rainwater
Sword Domain. The Darknorth swords also surpassed ordinary
Mortal-rank magic treasures. In terms of close combat, although he
was a bit weaker than when using the sword light of the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation], he was probably still close to the
Wanxiang Adept level. And yet, when they clashed head on, even when
he focused on defense, he was knocked flying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually didn’t
die!” The distant, giant Jadechild stared, astonished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the giant
Jadechild had struck Ning, the nearby Zifu Disciples, including Nong
Zidao, were all extremely excited. But upon seeing that Ning was
simply knocked flying without being damaged at all, all of them were
incomparably disappointed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could it end up
this way?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Jadechild used the Heavenly Transformation divine
ability. How powerful much his punches be? How could this person not
have been smashed to death?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Zifu
Disciples felt a chill in their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Jadechild, we will help you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We will help.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These frantic Zifu
Disciples all unleashed their own techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning was sent flying
dozens of meters back by Jadechild, a fierce look flashed through his
eyes. All of the seven hundred-plus flying swords around him lit up.
This was the first time during Ning’s battle with Jadechild that he
had used the ninth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His head instantly felt
a splitting, piercing pain!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!” The sword
light that had appeared in front of Ning, shaped like a true sword,
transformed into a line of rain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!” “Go!”
“Go!” “Go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, relying on their
earlier exchange of blows, pulled farther away, then launched five
attacks of the ninth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation].
And then, he immediately came to a halt. Just launching five attacks
of the ninth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] had made
his soul almost unable to take it any longer. Naturally, he halted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” Ning’s
eyes were filled with eagerness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was his most
powerful, supreme attack. It had to succeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Useless.” The
giant Jadechild was surrounded by those countless flying specks of
Stellar Sand. Ordinary raindrops were completely unable to break
through them. When the first sword light under Ning’s control
pierced through the Stellar Sands, the giant Jadechild glanced at the
line of rain, then smashed over with a giant palm atop that rain
line.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant Jadechild
shook violently. Boomboomboom…he took three hurried steps back,
causing the surrounding ground to tremble violently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other four rays of
sword light attacked from up ahead and from behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can he be so
strong?” The giant Jadechild felt as though his arm was turning
numb from pain. However, given the astonishing regenerative speed of
his Fiendgod body, he wasn’t afraid. He hurriedly exerted his
strength to block the other sword light rays.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each time he blocked
them, he took several steps back. This impacted his agility. He
wasn’t careful, and so two lines of ray still chopped past his
fists, slicing directly towards his chest. Crackle…the rain line
chopped down against the giant Jadechild’s body like a knife.
However, his body, covered with that hazy golden light, was
incomparably tough. By the time the sword light chopped through his
protective armor and began to chop against his body, it found it
quite difficult to advance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crackle…it just
barely managed to leave a large wound on Jadechild’s body, then
vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other flash of
sword light also simply left a wound before disappearing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What!” Ning
stared, wide-eyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He understood now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While activating the
‘Heavenly Transformation’ divine ability, Jadechild’s body had
increased tremendously in size. And thus, the level of difficulty for
chopping Jadechild’s body in half had risen as well. This was
because Jadechild’s body was simply too thick, and every single
strand of flesh and muscle had also risen in strength and endurance.
The ninth level of his [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] had only
been able to leave a wound on Jadechild’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You injured me?”
Jadechild bellowed as he charged over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Jadechild, we’ll help you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, prepare for
death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other distant,
spectating Zifu Disciples all unleashed their various magic treasures
and techniques as they flew towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Retreat.” Ji Ning
hurriedly activated his wings and retreated at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The surrounding
rainwater began to swivel, spinning into layers of protective
curtains that blocked these magic treasures. The magic treasures of
these Zifu Disciples…weren’t able to penetrate these layers of
protection at all. From this, one could see how terrifying Ning’s
‘Rainwater Sword Domain’ was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Jadechild, he
smashed straight through the protective curtains of rain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Retreat.” Ning had
completely changed his strategy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While controlling the
rainwater to form one layer after another of resilient water to block
and slow down his opponent, Ning also generated Waterflame Lotuses
around Jadechild! The Waterflame Lotuses around Ning…served as a
form of protection. But once the Waterflame Lotuses appeared around
Jadechild, they served as a form of binding.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break.” Jadechild
forcibly smashed apart the Waterflame Lotus, then through one watery
curtain after another, seeking to chase after Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning used almost all of
his concentration on controlling the rainwater and the Waterflame
Lotuses. Once he focused his energy on controlling them, it was only
natural that the Waterflame Lotuses could constantly bloom and spread
out, blocking his foe. Those watery curtains continuously formed as
well, one lafter another…faced with so many layers of bindings, the
giant Jadechild’s speed naturally dropped dramatically. He wasn’t
able to catch Ning at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dao Domain.” The
distant Nong Zidao, secreted within the black tower of light,
narrowed his eyes. “It really is a Dao Domain. That rainwater
forming into one protective wall after another is actually this
powerful…Dao Domain. Only sixteen years ago, and yet he has gained
insight into a Dao Domain. What a monster!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prior to this, he
wasn’t yet certain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But once Ning focused
all his power on unleashing the might of his Dao Domain, using
countless amounts of rainwater to block, Nong Zidao and Jadechild,
these two experts with tremendous amounts of experience, knew for
certain that this was a Dao Domain. If this wasn’t a Dao Domain,
how could it be so powerful?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Waterflame Lotuses
just bloomed, one after the other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the Rainwater Sword
Domain was everywhere. Every single curtain of rainwater was somewhat
weaker than a Waterflame Lotus, but there was too much rain. This was
quality born from quantity; Jadechild’s speed naturally dropped.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you have any
ability, fight me head on.” Jadechild roared savagely. “What sort
of ability is this, to rely on this sort of technique?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To be able to lock
you down is a form of ability as well.” Ning laughed coldly. “And
in addition, by locking you down, I’ve ensured your death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jadechild’s face
changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Indeed…” Ning
saw the look on Jadechild’s face. A thought came to his mind; he
had guessed correctly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, when they
had fought head on, Jadechild’s strength had been simply too
overbearing. Even by going all out and using the ninth level of the
[Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], Ning had only been able to make
him take three steps back. Even when he had landed a blow on
Jadechild’s body, the sword light had only been able to leave
behind an injury on that two-story-tall figure, then vanished. But
the heavens were always fair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heavenly
Transformation divine ability allowed one to gain in strength and
speed. Even one’s endurance would rise dramatically, and one’s
size would increase as well…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With so many
advantages, could it be that it had no disadvantages?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The disadvantage was…it
used up an enormous amount of divine power! To maintain the Heavenly
Transformation state used up an astonishing amount of divine power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had trained in the
divine ability, ‘Windwing Evasion’. Windwing Evasion was
different from the Heavenly Transformation technique. The Windwing
Evasion…focused on technique! But the Heavenly Transformation
divine ability…was a sort of divine ability that relied on one’s
ability to control one’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Windwing Evasion
was a divine ability technique meant for flying about and evading.
Those paintings of the giant Roc contained an incomparably deep and
exquisite profoundness to them, while also a technique for using
divine power! When Ning had been battling Bei Zishan, he had used up
his divine power to activate the Windwing Evasion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When one used divine
power to activate a divine ability, the divine power could increase
tenfold or a hundredfold in power, naturally making the divine
ability powerful as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning’s ‘divine
power’ in his Fiendgod body was only at the peak Xiantian level,
while his elemental energy surpassed that of a peak Zifu-level Ki
Refiner. By using his elemental energy to control the wing-type magic
treasures in accordance to the intricacies of the Windwing Evasion,
naturally he was still quite fast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Maintaining the
Heavenly Transformation will use up astonishing amounts of divine
power. I want to see how much you have.” Ning mused to himself. “As
for myself, the amount of energy I’m using up is negligible. Both
the Rainwater Sword Domain and the Waterflame Lotus relies on
activating the power of the heavens in order to take form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant Jadechild
bellowed. “All you are capable of is using these despicable
methods.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just focused
whole-heartedly on controlling the Rainwater Sword Domain and the
Waterflame Lotuses, frantically trying to entangle his foe. The giant
Jadechild, as Ning had predicted, was using up an extremely
astonishing amount of divine power while using his divine ability.
The giant Jadechild didn’t dare to return to his normal state
either, as if he did, Ning’s sword light would probably instantly
chop apart and slaughter him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughly an hour later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the last hour
of Jadechild’s life. During this hour, he came to a halt, no longer
going to smash against the Waterflame Lotus or the curtains of rain.
By not attacking, he was able to lower his expenditure of divine
power. However…when he stopped moving, Ning would begin to control
his sword light to attack. After Ning’s sword light left a wound on
his body, he would have to use a large amount of divine power to
heal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not battling wasn’t
an option. Battling also wasn’t an option.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jadechild’s divine
power was finally used up, and reluctantly, his body returned to the
size of a normal person’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crackle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A line of rain slashed
past, and Jadechild’s head went flying, then landed on the ground.
Given how his divine power had been completely used up, there was no
way he could heal his wounds any longer. Naturally, he lost his life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Jadechild died.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Jadechild!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other Zifu
Disciples were all incomparably terrified, but within the Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation, they were completely unable to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s all over.”
Within the black tower of light, Nong Zido stretched his hand out to
stroke the Fairy Crane by his side. A hint of pain and pity was in
his eyes. “Crane, I’m sorry. This trip to Swallow Mountain was in
error. I’m unable to save you. Let us end our master-servant
relationship now. I hope that the Ji clan will spare your life!”
Within his other hand, a Dao-seal suddenly appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a spatial
vibration appeared, then Nong Zidao’s body disappeared from within
the tower of black light, leaving behind only the other five Zifu
Disciples, the Landwyrm, and the Fairy Crane.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fairy Crane let out
a griefstricken bird call as tears began to flow from its eyes.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nong Zidao
disappeared?” Ji Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other five Zifu
Disciples were utterly terrified as well. Ning, with the assistance
of the grand formation, was absolutely at the Wanxiang Adept level of
power. The five of them weren’t even enough to join into a
formation of their own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, please
spare our lives.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I offer to you all
of the magic treasures that I am carrying. My clan will also offer up
magic treasures in exchange for my life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five of them were
all begging, without any hint of a martial spirit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning swept the five of
them with his gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” A voice
suddenly rang out by his ears. “We’ve destroyed these two groups
of Zifu Disciples, but two more days will pass before the Grand Xia
Dynasty arrives…within these two days, more disciples of Snowdragon
Mountain might arrive. There is no way for us to watch over and guard
these people. Kill them all. As for those two Zifu-level
Diremonsters, if you are able to make them submit, do so. If not,
kill them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Patriarch’s words
were reasonable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you, accept
death.” Ning looked at them and spoke calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In front of his body,
that flashing sword light suddenly transformed into a line of
rainwater and flew towards them. It was immediately followed by yet
another flash of sword light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were all only at
the eighth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, Snowdragon
Mountain will definitely avenge us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you will
die a miserable death!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These five seemed to
have gone berserk. All of them wanted to go all out, but given that
they weren’t able to join in a formation, even though they threw
out some powerful Dao-seals…upon encountering that curtain of
water, they immediately exploded, unable to touch Ning at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a few moments,
all five of them perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you two
spirit-beasts submit?” Ning swept his gaze towards the still-living
Landwyrm and Fairy Crane.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Landwyrm and the
Fairy Crane looked at each other, and then the Landwyrm transformed
into a large, azure-armored man, while the Fairy Crane transformed
into a white-robed maiden. The azure-armored man and the white-robed
maiden all immediately fell to their knees. “We are willing to
submit!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Zifu-level
Diremonsters were incomparably arrogant and hard to tame, when they
were faced with only two options, to perish or to submit…they would
generally submit, especially when the opponent’s power completely
surpassed their own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Follow me.” Ning’s
gaze flashed, and the falling rain disappeared. Immediately
afterwards, a surge of blazing fire swept out, rendering the corpses
of the five Zifu Disciples into ash, leaving behind only their magic
treasures, which Ning easily collected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The Landwyrm
and the Celestial Crane all followed after Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, they passed
through the layers of black fog and arrived in front of Ji Ninefire.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning was
surprised. In front of him, aside from the Patriarch and his father,
Ji Truekeep, Granny Shadow, and Ah Xing had all arrived as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I asked them to
come.” Ninefire laughed. “Both groups of Zifu Disciples are dead.
For now, we have no opponents, so I had them all come over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.
Formidable.” Truekeep’s eyes were shining.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formidable,
formidable.” Old servantAh Xing’s face was filled with delight as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Granny Shadow laughed
and nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were very
happy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because, in
just two or three short days worth of time, Snowdragon Mountain would
only be able to invite some Zifu Disciples from nearby regions to
come over…and as for the main Snowdragon Mountain Sect, it was
simply too far away. There was no way they would be able to make it
over in two or three short days. Having killed eighteen Zifu
Disciples and tamed two spirit-beasts, the threat level had dropped
dramatically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unfortunately, we
allowed Nong Zidao to flee.” Patriarch Ninefire shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch, how did
he escape? Why did he suddenly disappear?” Ning asked hurriedly.
Granny Shadow and the others all looked towards the Patriarch as
well. They had just gathered together, and so they hadn’t had a
chance to ask about these things in detail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire shook his
head. “I don’t know either. He simply disappeared. There’s no
trace of him in the entire formation. However, if we ask his
spirit-beast, I imagine it will know.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eyes of Ning and
the others lit up. Right. Ask the spirit-beast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fairy Crane.”
Ninefire looked at the white-robed maiden. “How did Nong Zidao
escape?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed woman
said respectfully, “My former owner was skilled in formations. He
was valued by his master, and so was given a ‘Lesser Teleportation
Dao-Seal’. This Dao-seal, upon being used, will instantly allow one
to teleport to any location within ten thousand kilometers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Lesser
Teleportation Dao-Seal?” Ning and the others looked at each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quietly memorized
this name. It seemed as though this Lesser Teleportation Dao-Seal was
the same thing as his so-called ‘Traceless Talisman’. The
Traceless Talisman had been acquired in a fortuitous encounter by an
ancestor of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture, who had used up two,
leaving only one behind. Because it allowed one to teleport within
ten thousand kilometers without a trace, it had been named the
‘Traceless Talisman’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch, what
should we do with these two spirit-beasts?” Ning looked at
Ninefire. The other five all looked at each other as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, are you
willing to accept them?” Ninefire asked Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at the
Landwyrm and the Fairy Crane. Zifu-level spirit-beasts were very
precious. Ordinary Zifu Disciples wouldn’t be able to acquire them,
but in truth…Ning didn’t care about these two Zifu spirit-beasts.
If Ning took some time to focus on his insights, in anywhere from a
few hours to a few days, he would break through to the seventh level,
as a Fiendgod Body Refiner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In but a few years, he
would reach the ninth level as an Fiendgod Body Refiner of the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]! By then, Zifu-level
spirit-beasts would truly be useless to him; in fact, they would slow
him down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have no need.”
Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since that’s the
case…” Ninefire nodded. “Then I will temporarily accept them.
After we overcome this tribulation, I will then divide them up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s what we’ll
do, then.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Truekeep, Granny
Shadow, Yichuan, and the others all nodded without any debate. It was
too early to discuss who the spirit-beasts would go to. Nobody knew
which of them would survive this tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are the magic
treasures left behind by that Jadechild.” Ning waved his hand, and
a large amount of magic treasures immediately appeared on the ground.
“Everyone, take a look and see which are useful. If you find any
flying swords…various elders, please help me prepare them for
binding. I need to find a place to train; just now, in battle, I
gained some slight insights.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. Leave it to
us.” Ninefire and the others didn’t hesitate at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning’s
body flickered as he immediately departed at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Landwyrm and the
Fairy Crane, in the form of the azure-armored warrior and the
white-robed maiden, were both rather disappointed. In truth, they
desired to become Ning’s spirit-beasts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First of all, they bore
no hatred for Ning, as the Landwyrm had, for example, been forcibly
subdued by Jadechild in the past. Although the Fairy Crane did have a
close relationship with Nong Zidao, since Zidao had given her up and
fled for his life, it could be said that the karmic binds between
them had come to an end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Secondly, Ning was only
sixteen years old. A monster like this would have unlimited
potential; if they followed a master like him, their own future would
be bright as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unfortunately, Ning
wasn’t willing to accept them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was seated in the
lotus position within the mountainous forests, surrounded by dark
energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yin and Yang
transform, endlessly engendering each other.” Ning murmured to
himself, then closed his eyes and began to meditate on it. Prior to
this, when he had analyzing the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation],
he had come to a realization…that all of the great Daos of the
world were, in truth, similar. Formations, swordplay, magic, divine
abilities…they all contained the ‘Dao’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao was the same.
Only, the paths of the Dao were different.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood this
principle…and so naturally, it now became much easier for him to
break through, from the sixth to the seventh stage of the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yin and Yang
transform!” Ning, his eyes closed, began to activate the divine
power in his body…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In midair, a thousand
kilometers away from Snowdragon City, space suddenly rippled, and a
figure appeared out of nowhere. It was a fur-clad Nong Zidao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao’s eyes
were filled with grief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you encounter a
formation, be cautious. Be cautious.” Nong Zidao let out a soft
sigh. “This is the most simple of principles, but we disciples of
Snowdragon Mountain had all forgotten about it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you encounter a
formation, be cautious. This was something all Immortal practitioners
knew.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because
formations were intricate and marvelous. No one could know what was
within a formation, and upon entering it, one wouldn’t even be able
to flee! For example, the Wanxiang Adept, Adept Mu Xiao, knew that
Bei Zishan was hidden within the formation, but because Bei Zishan
had set up a formation, Adept Mu Xiao had chosen to instead wait
patiently outside, rather than enter the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But these disciples of
Snowdragon Mountain had truly held their foes in too little regard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they knew that
upon encountering a formation, they should be cautious, they hadn’t
held the Ji clan in any regard at all. The Ji clan was nothing more
than a local clan, and they had an understanding of the Ji clan’s
power. They didn’t believe that the Ji clan would be capable of any
powerful formations at all. In addition, they had Jadechild as well
as a formations expert, Nong Zidao. They also had nearly twenty
comrades…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their power was simply
too great.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They believed that they
would completely dominate and crush a puny clan like the Ji clan.
Because of their over-confidence, they had underestimated their foes,
and so had become trapped in the formation, with no way to escape!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Jadechild. Even with
the assistance of the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation, Ning was only
on par with Jadechild in power; Jadechild had only died after all of
his divine power had been exhausted, rendering him unable to use his
divine ability. If they had fought outside the formation, upon seeing
that the situation was turning grim, he could’ve fled. But within
the formation, there was no place to run!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you encounter a
formation, be cautious. But if we didn’t enter…should we have
simply allowed the Ji clan to delay? Watch as the Celestial Envoy of
the Grand Xia Dynasty came?” Nong Zidao shook his head and sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formations…Ji
Ning…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation, and a monster who gained insight into a Dao
Domain at age sixteen. For me to encounter both these things in such
a puny little local clan? My defeat was not an injust one!” A
flying ship appeared beneath Nong Zidao’s feet, which immediately
tore through the skies, flying at high speed towards Snowdragon City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter what, I
have to go warn my other comrades, who are probably heading this way
as well.” Nong Zidao mused.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the first group of
Zifu Disciples, the sole survivor was Nong Zidao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he didn’t go warn
the newcomers, in the future, when the main sect investigated this
matter, he, Nong Zidao, would be censured.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A distant city appeared
within his field of vision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Nong Zidao,
atop the ship, saw that there were people in the air above the
distant city.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That person flew over,
as fast as a ray of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dong Fanyu?” Nong
Zidao immediately recognized this old man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Zidao.” Dong Fanyu, upon seeing Nong Zidao,
immediately asked impatiently, “I heard that you, senior
apprentice-brother Zidao, along with senior apprentice-brother
Jadechild and a group of others all went to Oxhorn Mountain. Why have
you come here, senior apprentice-brother Zidao? Also…the
life-tablets of quite a few people who headed to Oxhorn Mountain have
shattered. Even the life-tablet of my own Dong clan’s Patriarch,
Dong Ziqi, has shattered. What happened at Oxhorn Mountain?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao shook his
head. “I feel ashamed. Aside from myself, every single one of our
fellow disciples who went to Oxhorn Mountain perished.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! All
perished?!” Dong Fanyu was shocked. “So many fellow disciples
all, all…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aside from me, all
of them died.” Nong Zidao sighed. “I’ve come to warn you that
Oxhorn Mountain is incredibly perilous. No matter what, do not enter.
I don’t want any other fellow disciples to suffer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Fanyu said
frantically, “Can’t be entered? But just now, Wanxiang Adept,
Adept Xu Li, personally led a group of Zifu Disicples to head towards
Oxhorn Mountain.”

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept Xu Li?” Nong
Zidao was shocked. As a valued, intensively trained disciple of
Snowdragon Mountain, Nong Zidao naturally was quite familiar with
Adept Xu. He knew that Adept Xu wasn’t too skilled in the Dao of
formations. Actually, the vast majority of Immortal practitioners
with great potential were unskilled in formations; they would focus
their efforts on training, on gaining insights into the Dao, on magic
treasures, and on magic spells.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How long ago did the
Adept head there?” Nong Zidao hurriedly asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just a while ago, in
less than the amount of time needed to brew tea. Adept Xu left just
before you arrived, senior apprentice-brother Zidao.” Dong Fanyu
said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao, shocked,
immediately instructed: “Remember, if there are any other Zifu
Disciples who arrive here, they can go to Oxhorn Mountain, but you
must warn them…they are definitely not permitted to casually enter
the grand formation of Oxhorn Mountain. That is the place where
senior apprentice-brother Jadechild perished.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will definitely
inform the other fellow disciples.” Dong Fanyu immediately said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Nong Zidao
had no time to speak any further; he immediately boarded his flying
ship and flew through the skies, heading once more to Oxhorn
Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Oxhorn Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ninefire and the
others paid attention to the region outside the grand formation while
simultaneously binding the magic treasures. From their viewpoint on
up high, they were able to see through the thin mist to the distant,
desolate wilderness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of the Zifu
Disciples from the earlier group, aside from Nong Zidao, have
perished. Our Ji clan even ended up acquiring two additional
Zifu-level spirit-beasts.” Ji Truekeep was currently working on
binding a flying sword, then said with a satisfied look on his face,
“The Swallow Mountain branch of Snowdragon Mountain only had a few
Zifu Disciples to begin with. With so many dead, I imagine there
won’t be any other formidable figures who will come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ninefire
nodded with a satisfied smile as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Ji clan now has
hope.” Granny Shadow sighed in her hoarse voice as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From a logical
standpoint, their expectations were correct.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Envoy of
the Grand Xia Dynasty would be able to arrive in two days. The
Swallow Mountain branch of Snowdragon Mountain simply wouldn’t be
able to invite some more distant branches to assist in time. In
addition, at most, forty or fifty Zifu Disciples could be invited
over from the surrounding areas, and amongst them, the most powerful
and famous were Jadechild and Nong Zidao! One had perished, while the
other had fled; who else would dare to enter?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only choice was to
report back to the main sect, but the main sect was too far away.
Most likely, the Ji clan would receive protection from the Grand Xia
Dynasty well before the main sect had even received word of this
matter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are fortunate to
have Ji Ning.” Ninefire sighed as he glanced at the nearby Ji
Yichuan. “Yichuan. You have a good son.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan couldn’t help
but smile as well. With a son like Ning, how could he not be proud?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once this
tribulation is over,” Granny Shadow said hoarsely, “Ji Ning will
definitely leave our Ji clan and go out to adventure. Give his
monstrous talents…I imagine that he should be able to take refuge
within one of the great powers. By then, why would we need to fear
Snowdragon Mountain?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning’s future
is unlimited!” Ji Truekeep sighed emotionally as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were all the
elites of the Ji clan, but compared to Ning…they felt a vast gap
between them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone is coming.”
Ninefire suddenly shouted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a great
commotion. All of them turned to stare through the sparse black fog,
only to see a boat sail through the skies towards their direction,
with quite a few Immortal practitioners gathered together atop it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I haven’t seen any
of them. Don’t recognize them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I recognize one of
them. That short old fellow is an Immortal practitioner of the Huan
clan. The two of us have met once, but I don’t know his name.”
Ninefire and the others could see a total of eight Zifu Disciples
atop the boat, but they didn’t know the names of any of them. Only
Ninefire was able to recognize a single one of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Truekeep immediately
asked, “What should we do? Should we go call for Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning is currently
training within the formation.” Ninefire shook his head. “In
addition, only eight have come. No need to be impatient.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying boat
descended towards the ground, the vanished. The eight figures atop
the boat disembarked. Not too far away, they saw a wood golem
standing atop the ground. The eyes of the wood golem flashed with a
green light as it looked towards them with curiosity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A golem.” Lu Huang
said hurriedly. “Master-uncle, I will go take a look.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Huang immediately
moved forward a few steps, but before he said anything, the wood
golem spoke out: “Are you disciples of Snowdragon Mountain?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Lu Huang
nodded as he spoke, while Adept Xu and the others walked over as
well. The wood golem said, quite obediently, “Per the orders of my
master, Nong Zidao, I am here awaiting the arrival of disciples of
Snowdragon Mountain. I am here to let you all know that my master,
Nong Zidao, along with Jadechild, eighteen other Zifu Disciples, and
two Zifu-level spirit-beasts have all entered the grand formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you have any
other information?” Adept Xu Li asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know nothing
else.” The wood golem shook its head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Has anyone emerged?”
Adept Xu Li frowned as he spoke. “Did you feel the ground shake?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wood golem said,
“Nobody has emerged. Prior to this, I felt the ground shake
multiple times, but now, I don’t feel the ground shaking
whatsoever.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of Adept Xu
Li and the rest of the eight all changed. Some formations were able
to completely block out sound, but it was extremely hard to block out
the vibrations created from a battle, which would pass through the
earth and the mud to the outside world. It was unheard of, at least,
for Mortal-ranked formations to be able to block out ground
vibrations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The first few ground
vibrations indicate that they battled multiple times. But for there
to be no further vibrations at all…and given that based on the
information we received, the life-tablets of many Zifu Disciples,
including Dong Ziqi, are shattered…” Adept Xu Li said in a soft
voice, “The most likely possibility is that all of them are dead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept, what should
we do?” The others all looked towards Adept Xu Li.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the seven, some had
run into Adept Xu Li on the road, while others had been waiting at
Snowdragon City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prior to this, nineteen
Zifu Disciples and two Zifu-level spirit-beasts had silently,
soundlessly disappeared within this formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can’t enter it
casually.” Adept Xu Li said in a soft voice. “Nong Zidao is
extremely skilled in formations. Even I am inferior to him. As for
Jadechild, he has a divine ability and thus astonishingly great
combat power, as well as tremendously strong lifeforce as a Fiendgod
Body Refiner…the two of them joined forces to enter, and yet there
is no word of them. No matter what, we cannot enter the formation
casually.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other seven all
nodded in agreement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me try to
forcibly break the formation first and see if I can destroy it.”
Adept Xu Li glanced at the distant Oxhorn Mountain. He waved his
hand, and a large seal appeared within his palm. This large seal flew
out from his palm, then rapidly increased in size, quickly becoming
an enormous seal that was more than three hundred meters long. It
hung there, high above Oxhorn Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Descend!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu Li pointed
into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the
surrounding world seemed to change colors. The brilliant sunlight
seemed to instantly disappear as the surrounding world turned
pitch-black. Within the pitch-black skies, there were even many
flashing stars, and amongst the stars there was an enormous,
brilliant moon. Within the moon, a giant palm formed from moonlight
emerged, which clasped that giant, three hundred meter seal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, it smashed
that seal downwards to the ground!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It smashed directly
atop the black fog surrounding the base of Oxhorn Mountain. The
surrounding earth trembled violently, and then the giant moonlight
hand lifted up again, raising the enormous seal once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ninefire and the
others saw the world itself change through the Manifestation, the
looks on their faces changed as well. The brilliant light of the sun
had been transformed into a constellation of stars in the night sky.
They all called out in shock, “A Wanxiang Adept!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could a Wanxiang
Adept be here? The Swallow Mountain branch of Snowdragon Mountain is
nothing more than a branch. These branches only have Zifu Disciples.
How could a Wanxiang Adept have come? Wanxiang Adepts are the core of
Snowdragon Mountain. How could they have appeared here?” Truekeep
stared, wide-eyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every member of the Ji
clan was completely shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They didn’t dare
believe it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, everyone, go
to your locations in your sub-formations.” Ninefire hurriedly
ordered. “If that Wanxiang Adept thinks he can destroy our
formation from outside just by using a giant seal, he is dreaming. At
such a great distance…even a Wanxiang Adept is only able to at most
unleash a tenth of his full power. Against power at this level, if we
join forces and rely on the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation, we can
definitely fight back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Should we call for
Ji Ning?” Granny Shadow asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need. Landwyrm,
follow my orders and head towards the north.” Ninefire gave the
order. “For now, you will temporarily serve as the center for the
Dragontail Formation of our Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The
azure-armored warrior replied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Monsters initially
trained in monstrous power, but upon establishing their Zifu, the
body in their energy would also become the elemental energy of the
Zifu. This Landwyrm was at the peak Zifu-level…his elemental energy
was even more powerful than Ji Ning’s!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Descend!” From far
away, Adept Xu Li pointed yet again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant moonlight
hand, clutching that great seal, once more smashed downwards towards
Oxhorn Mountain. But this time, a draconic roar suddenly rang out,
and an enormous black draconic tail swept out. The draconic tail was
tremendous in size as well, and as it emerged from the black fog, it
clashed directly against the downwards smashing seal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant seal smashed
against the giant draconic tail. The draconic tail trembled slightly,
but was able to hold on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A black draconic
tail?” Adept Xu Li frowned. “And it’s actually able to block my
Manifestation…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were limits to
the distance at which an Immortal practitioner could use magic
treasures to attack. The farther away they attacked from, the lower
the power would be. Wanxiang Adepts could rely on their ‘Myriad
Manifestations’ to launch long-distance attacks, but naturally, the
power would be much lower than if they attacked in close-quarters
combat. For example, when Adept Mu Xiao had wanted to prevent Bei
Zishan from escaping, he had been able to, from an extremely great
distance, generate his Manifestation to capture the bug-body of Bei
Zishan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What formation is
this?” Adept Xu Li frowned. “A few mere Zifu Disciples, by
relying on this formation, are able to block my Manifestation. This
formation…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Despite his knowledge,
even he wasn’t able to recognize this formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven nearby Zifu
Disciples had looks of confusion and nervousness on their faces. That
draconic tail that had emerged from the fog…what formation was
this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire and the
others, by relying on the Netherwyrm created by the formation, had
resisted the smashing blow of the giant seal. Still, they felt that
doing so was quite an onerous task.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder how Ji
Ning’s training is progressing. He might be at a critical moment.”
Ninefire, frantic, wanted to summon Ning, but he was also worried
that he would disrupt Ning’s meditations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the formation.
Dark energy was flowing everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sat there in the
lotus position, completely absorbed in the intricate mysteries of Yin
and Yang transforming. He continuously experimented, gaining a
greater and greater comprehension, having reached a level of
completely losing himself in his training. He didn’t even notice
the tremors caused earlier by the giant seal smashing against the
ground. As for Ninefire and the others, the giant Netherwyrm they
were controlling was in the area surrounding Ning, protecting him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yin cannot be
without Yang.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yang cannot be
without Yin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even the most
powerful of dragons has regrets. After every peak, there is a
valley…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only when Yin and
Yang transform into each other can they endlessly engender each other
in a cycle.” Ning suddenly understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Divine Sun Tattoo
and the Divine Moon Tattoo on his back suddenly lit up. He could
sense, from an unfathomably distance, separated by untold numbers of
planes, those two giant stars. The Lunar Star and the Solar Star.
They each immediately sent down surges of Lunar Truewater and Solar
Truefire, which pierced through countless planes and countless voids,
descending directly upon Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…”
“Rumble…” The surrounding area instantly became transformed
into a world of fire and water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Enormous petals of fire
and water transformed into the bud of a flower, completely covering
Ning within. With the Lunar Truewater and Solar Truefire as the core,
a tremendous amount of fire and water appeared, forming a gigantic
flower that completely surrounded Ning, who was now like the stamen
within the flower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the distant Adept
Xu Li and his group of Zifu Disciples could see, from far away, an
enormous flower emerge from within the dark fog, as the tips of the
petals just barely stretched out above the black fog.
</P>

Chapter 22 - Earth-Rank Magic Treasure
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is that?” The
seven Zifu Disciples of Snowdragon Mountain stared in amazement at
the tips of the flower petals, which stretched out just beyond the
distant black fog. Just from the tips of the petals alone, they could
imagine how enormous the entire flower was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is the Ji clan
doing?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept Xu, the Ji
clan…” The Zifu Disciples all looked at Adept Xu Li, who frowned
and replied, “It should be an enormous flower, with the petals
either a fiery red color or a watery blue color. It should be formed
from fire and water.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They weren’t able to
reach much of a conclusion from this distance, just by staring at the
tips of the flower emerging from the black fog.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me try
something.” Adept Xu pointed into the distance. “Descend!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That giant moonlight
hand once more emerged from the brilliant moon that hung in the
pitch-black sky. It seized the huge, three hundred meter long seal
and smashed downwards towards the petal. Immediately, a dragon’s
body emerged from the black fog, receiving the blow from the great
seal. With a boom…the black draconic form trembled, but managed to
withstand the blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph. They are
hiding in a formation. In close quarters, I would be able to crumble
that draconic body with a single seal-blow.” Adept Xu shook his
head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ninefire was
extremely nervous. He sent mentally, “Ji Ning is currently at the
most critical moment of his training. That Wanxiang Adept wants to
attack by using his Manifestations. No matter what, we must stop
him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ji Truekeep,
Granny Shadow, and the others, they all understood that Ning was the
future hope for their Ji clan. How could they permit anyone to
disturb Ning’s training?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He formed a flower
of fire and water…what is Ji Ning doing?” Although Ninefire could
sense that flower, he was still puzzled. This was because Ning
already had the Waterflame Lotus technique. Was Ning currently
gaining insights into the Dao? Or was he training in his techniques?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous flower of
fire and water, more than three hundred meters tall, completely
enveloped Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The core of it was
formed from Lunar Truewater and Solar Truefire, which activated and
summoned a large amount of solar power and lunar power, flooding
Ning’s body with it. Under the guidance of Ning’s divine tattoos,
it caused Ning’s divine body to naturally, slowly evolve. Every
single tendon, muscle, bone…even every single cell of every organ
was wildly devouring this power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Crimsonbright Diagram
of the Nine Heavens]. Generally speaking, in order to advance by a
stage, one slowly accumulated power, and then broke through. For
example, from the fourth to the fifth stage, or from the fifth to the
sixth stage, one had to slowly train and accumulate strength.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But from the sixth
stage to the seventh stage was a giant leap between different realms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The divine body would
change on a qualitative level, and so the amount of energy that was
needed was incomparably astonishing. In fact, the amount needed was
even more astonishingly tremendous than the amount which Ning had
acquired over the course of nearly five years, as he advanced from
the fourth stage to the sixth stage. This was the most
difficult-to-train Fiendgod Body Refining technique. Ning had even
developed his own ‘Rainwater Sword Domain’ by now, and yet only
today did he break through to the seventh stage!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most difficult
technique!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The most profound,
mysterious technique!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But upon breakthrough
through and advancing past this stage, one would receive assistance
from the Solar Star and the Lunar Star, the two exalted, supreme
stars. They would send down their Solar Truefire and Lunar Truewater
to draw in enormous amounts of power, so as to allow the divine body
to rapidly increase in strength.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whooosh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous flower of
water and fire became translucent, slowly opening and revealing the
nude form of a youth, whose body was incomparably jewel-like and
completely untarnished. It was Ning! A layer of fur clothing quickly
appeared on Ning’s body, formed from his armor-type magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A hint of a smile was
on Ning’s face. He had finally passed into the seventh stage of the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]. He could sense the
surging divine power within his body, and the tremendous, endless
lifeforce it contained. His body could be reborn from a single drop
of blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Finally, I can truly
use divine abilities.” Ning revealed a look of joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Fiendgod Body Refiner
had to reach the Zifu level in order to unleash divine abilities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Windwing Evasion
technique was more a matter of skill and technique, and so it could
be used with just elemental ki energy. Still, divine abilities were
‘divine’ abilities, and so only when using divine power to fuel
them would they truly be divine, and truly unleash their full power.
Previously, Ning was only at the peak Xiantian level as a Fiendgod
Body Refiner, while his elemental ki energy was beyond the peak
Zifu-level within the formation. The difference was too great…which
was why he had used his elemental ki to perform the Windwing Evasion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, however, although
he had just reached the seventh stage, he had done so by using the
number one Fiendgod Body Refining technique. Ning was no weaker than
a normal late-stage Zifu Disciple Fiendgod Body Refiner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Compared to
Jadechild,” Ning mused, “My current divine body is perhaps just a
level weaker than his was.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He had the divine
ability, ‘Heavenly Transformation’, while I have the divine
ability, ‘Windwing Evasion.’”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I also have my
Rainwater Sword Domain, the Darknorth swords…if we were to fight
again, I would still be able to kill him, even if we were to fight
head-on.” Ning was very confident in himself. The Windwing Evasion
was a very different type of divine ability, compared to the Heavenly
Transformation. Each had their own advantages; Heavenly
Transformation was superlative in terms of power and speed, but
lacking a bit in agility.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Windwing
Evasion, it focused on both speed and agility!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” A voice
rang out by his ears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch?” Ning
revealed a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry over.”
Ninefire sent frantically. A corridor appeared in the black fog in
front of Ning, and Ning transformed into a ray of light as he hurried
through it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Ninefire,
Yichuan, and the Fairy Crane in the form of that white-robed maiden
were all standing there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch.” When
Ning emerged from the corridor within the black fog, he had a feeling
that something was wrong. He saw that the Patriarch and his father
didn’t look the slightest bit excited; instead, they had very
somber looks on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” Ning
asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire said in a low
voice, “I originally thought that after you killed that group of
Zifu Disciples and Jadechild, that we would be able to survive this
tribulation. But I didn’t expect…that Snowdragon Mountain would
send yet another group of Zifu Disciples over, with a Wanxiang Adept
amongst them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wanxiang Adept?”
Ning was shocked. “How could there be a Wanxiang Adept? How could
the Swallow Mountain branch of Snowdragon Mountain have managed to
invite a Wanxiang Adept to come in such a short period of time?
Aren’t we extremely far away from the main sect of Snowdragon
Mountain?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t know.”
Ninefire shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan said solemnly
as well, “No matter what, this Wanxiang Adept has already arrived.
His power is quite terrifying. Earlier, he used his Manifestation to
attack with a giant seal. By relying on the Netherwyrm Heavenlock
Formation, we were just barely able to withstand it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face grew
solemn as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A Manifestation? One
which the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation was just barely able to
resist?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That Wanxiang Adept
should be named Xu Li.” The nearby white-robed maiden suddenly
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning,
Ninefire, and Yichuan all looked towards the Fairy Crane.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed maiden
said, “I followed Nong Zidao for many years, and once encountered
this Xu Li. Adept Xu Li is a formidable figure in Snowdragon
Mountain; he’s not someone who Jadechild could be compared to.
Jadechild’s status in Snowdragon Mountain was quite ordinary, and
even by using his divine ability, he was only on the same level as an
early Wanxiang Adept.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept Xu Li became a
Wanxiang Adept more than sixty years ago.” The white-robed maiden
said. “He is a Ki Refiner, and the technique he trains in is
definitely one of the best techniques available to Snowdragon
Mountain. Although his training speed is slow, his elemental ki is
extremely pure. After sixty years, he must at least be at the middle
stage for Wanxiang Adepts.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition, as a
Wanxiang Adept of Snowdragon Mountain, he definitely has an
Earth-ranked magic treasure! There is a qualitative difference
between Mortal-ranked magic treasures and Earth-ranked magic
treasures…the difference in power is tremendous as well. In
addition, his comprehension of the Dao is definitely far above that
of Jadechild’s as well. Although Jadechild had a divine ability,
there was no way for him to use an Earth-ranked magic treasure. This
is a fundamental difference between him and Adept Xu. If Adept Xu
wished to kill Jadechild, it would be simplicity itself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After speaking, the
white-robed maiden no longer spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire and Yichuan
exchanged glances. Earlier, when they were in a state of panic, the
white-robed maiden hadn’t said a word. Once Ning appeared, however,
the white-robed maiden had provided some information regarding Adept
Xu. Clearly, this white-robed maiden felt rather subservient towards
Ning, rather than towards the Ji clan as a whole.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At least at the
middle-stage Wanxiang Adept level? An Earth-ranked magic treasure?
Insights into the Dao?” Ning pondered. He wasn’t a foolish child
who understood nothing. After having seen so many magic treasures in
the aquatic estate, Ning knew very well that the difference in power
between magic treasures at different levels was tremendous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a fundamental
difference in power between an Earth-ranked magic treasure and a
Mortal-ranked magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the maiden had said,
if Adept Xu wanted to kill Jadechild, it would be simple!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
Ninefire’s face was red with worry. He said frantically, “We have
never before fought against a Wanxiang Adept; we’ve only heard
legends of battling them. Wanxiang Adepts definitely vastly outstrip
Zifu Disciples in power. Wanxiang Adepts are able to kill Zifu
Disciples as easily as we kill Xiantian lifeforms. Earth-ranked magic
treasures…we’ve only heard of them, but have never experienced
their power first-hand. You absolutely must not be careless. You hold
the official writ to our City of Ten Thousand Swords, and also have
the Traceless Talisman. Remember. If the situation begins to turn
grim, immediately flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Flee?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As long as you
escape, the Ji clan will definitely rise again, and to even greater
heights.” Ninefire instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had a restless
feeling. He could vaguely sense danger looming. His soul was so
powerful that generally speaking, when encountering danger, he would
feel a vague, warning sense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wanxiang Adept?”
Ning didn’t have any experience fighting one either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember. You are
not to risk yourself.” Ninefire looked at Ning, and Yichuan looked
at his son with worry as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand.”
Ning nodded gently. “This Wanxiang Adept…I will definitely be
very careful. If anything goes wrong, I will immediately flee.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ninefire
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Immortal
practitioners of Snowdragon Mountain stared towards the distant
Oxhorn Mountain, shrouded in black fog. The tips of the flower petals
had disappeared by now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept Xu, what
should we do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are we just to wait
and watch here?” The Zifu Disciples all looked towards Adept Xu,
waiting for his orders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu stared into
the distance, a cold look in his eyes. He said a single, cold word.
“Wait!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both Jadechild and Nong
Zidao had failed. Although there was a huge difference in power
between him and them, he still had to be cautious. He knew very well
that this formation was extremely strange. Even though he was very
powerful, he couldn’t enter recklessly. At worst…they could just
give up this elemental ore mine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master-uncle Xu,
master-uncle Xu.” A distant ray of light shot towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xu Li lifted his head
to take a look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a fur-clad
man, riding atop that streak of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Apprentice-nephew
Zidao.” A look of surprised delight appeared on Xu Li’s face. He
hurriedly went forward to greet him. Out of all the people who had
entered the formation, Nong Zidao was the one which Xu Li cared about
the most. Nong Zidao was also an expert in formations, and had
experience with this one. He was precisely what Xu Li needed the most
right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master-uncle Xu.”
Nong Zidao said hurriedly. “I was afraid that you had already
entered the formation. Fortunately, you didn’t.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” Xu Li
frowned as he looked at Nong Zidao. “Is this formation truly so
terrifying?”
</P>

Chapter 23 - Sealing
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao said
hurriedly, “This grand formation is known as the Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation. This is a legendary formation. Although the Ji
clan only has the simplified, Mortal-rank version of the formation,
this is definitely one of the most supreme formations at the
Mortal-rank. The power of this technique cannot be underestimated; it
is no lower than some Earth-rank formations. If, master-uncle Xu, you
were to enter it, you would be trapped within. Fortunately, you
didn’t enter…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is that amazing?”
Adept Xu was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A supreme Mortal-rank
formation that was no weaker than some Earth-rank formations? Adept
Xu knew very well that the value of such a formation was probably no
lower than that magic treasure of his, the giant seal he was holding.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Zidao, then what should we do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just watch as the Ji
clan continues to delay?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Zifu Disciples all
began to ask questions, worried. Nong Zidao said, “If I hadn’t
already entered, I wouldn’t know either. However, since I’ve
already spent quite some time within the Netherwyrm Heavenlock
Formation, I’ve spent a good amount of time analyzing it, and have
gained certain insights. Right…let’s not be impatient. Let me
first break the black fog formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao immediately
walked forward, with Adept Xu right behind him. Adept Xu viewed Nong
Zidao as being the most useful of this group of Zifu Disciples. He
was a formations expert…naturally, he had to ensure Nong Zidao’s
safety.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The black fog
bewildering formation is an ordinary formation.” Nong Zidao
laughed. “Prior to this, when I entered it, I was about to break
it, but just as I was going to break it, I was trapped by the
Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao looked
carefully at the black fog surrounding the entire Oxhorn Mountain.
“If my predictions are correct, one of the formation flags should
be three hundred meters in that direction.” As he spoke, a flywhisk
appeared in his hands. He swept it out, and its three thousand white
strands immediately shot out, swirling towards the distance at high
speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a formation
flag was uprooted, and the black fog that had been covering the
entire Oxhorn Mountain dissipated. Sunlight shone down upon Oxhorn
Mountain, revealing an enormous black dragon that was currently
coiled around it. The enormous body of the black dragon emanated a
faint, dark, netherworldly aura, but the area the aura reached out to
was far smaller than the area previously covered by the black fog
bewildering formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop Oxhorn Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Ninefire, and the
others all had solemn looks on their faces. As soon as they saw Nong
Zidao appear, they knew that the situation had just turned grim! They
hadn’t expected that Nong Zidao, who had clearly fled, would appear
once more. Nong Zidao had entered the formation and had a great deal
of experience with it. And now, he easily defeated their black fog
bewildering formation from outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why has Nong Zidao
returned?” Ninefire’s eyes were filled with resentment and
disbelief. “Without Nong Zidao present, even though this Adept Xu
is powerful, as soon as he entered the Netherwyrm Heavenlock
Formation, he would be trapped within and unable to depart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nong Zidao!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could things
have ended up this way!” The members of the Ji clan were all
frantic and grief-stricken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt hatred in his
heart as well. Nong Zidao’s arrival was akin to making Adept Xu a
tiger with wings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao and Adept Xu
stared at the Netherwyrm, coiling about atop the distant Oxhorn
Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That enormous black
dragon is the ‘Netherwyrm’ formed by the Netherwyrm Heavenlock
Formation.” Nong Zidao said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Netherwyrm.” Adept
Xu stared at the giant black dragon coiling about Oxhorn Mountain,
then nodded slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao continued,
“The Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation also has a secondary,
bewildering effect. The ‘nether fog’ that emanates from it is
also a type of bewildering formation. To break the entire Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation…it is too difficult. Even I don’t know how
long it would take for me to break it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu frowned. “Even
you are unable to break it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, simply
breaking the nether fog is much simpler. I’m able to do that.”
Nong Zidao laughed. “Master-uncle, don’t be impatient. The
Netherwyrm and the nether fog are two separate parts. The Netherwyrm
is used to attack, while the nether fog is used to trap enemies.
Although I’m unable to break the entire Netherwyrm Heavenlock
Formation, if you give me a bit of time and assist me, master-uncle,
I am able to make the nether fog dissipate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu said in
surprised delight, “Make the nether fog disappear? Without the
protection of the bewildering formation, if the Ji clan is to rely on
the Netherwyrm to fight head on against me, they will definitely
perish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How could Adept Xu fear
a few Zifu Disciples? The reason he didn’t dare enter earlier was
because he wasn’t confident in being able to deal with the
formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation has, in total, five component formations. The
bewildering formation also has five components.” Nong Zidao said.
“Previously, we entered the Dragonclaw Formation. I have already
gained insight into some of the profound intricacies of the
Dragonclaw Formation. However, Jadechild wasn’t strong enough…but
with your power, master-uncle…as long as you use your Earth-ranked
magic treasure, that giant seal, you will be able to disrupt the
elemental pulse within the ground and dissipate the nether fog.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, excellent.”
Adept Xu was overjoyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he was an
amateur, he still understood the principle of how formations relied
on activating the power of the heavens and the earth…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If a formations expert
had seen through the intricacies of the inner workings of a
formation, then just by applying a few techniques to a few areas, the
functioning of the entire formation could be disrupted! Nong Zidao
wasn’t able to destroy the Netherwyrm, but he was able to disrupt
the nether fog.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master-uncle.”
Nong Zidao laughed. “After I break through the nether fog, the Ji
clan will be forced to face us head-on. The Ji clan is very weak; I’m
afraid that they will immediately flee! Our ultimate goal is to gain
the official writ for the City of Ten Thousand Swords, which they
carry. If they are to escape, it will be very troublesome. And so, it
is best if we first set down a grand sealing formation around Oxhorn
Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu, hearing this,
nodded. “Your thoughts are meticulous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swoosh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu immediately
transformed into a ray of light, flying about while setting up a
grand formation around the entire base of Oxhorn Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A barrier of light,
appearing like the ripples of clear water, suddenly sprang into
being. The enormous barrier of light covered the entire Oxhorn
Mountain, like a giant dome over it! Not just the air; even the
ground was sealed off by the barrier of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire world had
been sealed off!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a grand
sealing formation…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Ninefire, and the
others atop Oxhorn Mountain, upon seeing the giant barrier of light
appear out of nowhere, completely separating Oxhorn Mountain away
from the outside world, all had exceedingly ugly looks on their
faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A grand sealing
formation.” Ninefire said hoarsely. “In addition, Adept Xu
personally established it. To break through this grand sealing
formation….most likely, only someone with power equivalent to Adept
Xu is capable of it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Granny
Shadow had a hint of despair in her eyes as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We won’t be able
to leave.” Truekeep said softly. “With our power, there is no way
for us to break the sealing formation. There’s nowhere to run…so,
let’s fight. Let’s have a fight with this Wanxiang Adept!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan nodded as well.
“Originally, I had thought that we had survived this tribulation.
But a Wanxiang Adept has come! Our Ji clan should feel proud; we have
forced a Wanxiang Adept to come deal with us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, remember,
if you have a bad feeling when fighting with Adept Xu, you must
immediately leave.” Ninefire looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are the future
hope of our Ji clan. Remember this.” Granny Shadow looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Truekeep and Ah Xing
also looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His father, Yichuan,
gave him instructions as well. “Don’t do anything foolish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could feel the
despair his elders felt. When the grand sealing formation had
appeared, it represented the fact that there was nowhere for the Ji
clan to retreat to. Only he, who had the Traceless Talisman, was able
to escape. There was no way for the others to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xu Li!” Ning
looked downwards, staring through the nether fog towards the distant
Adept Xu and Nong Zidao, his gaze filled with a killing intent. “A
Wanxiang Adept? I want to see exactly how powerful a Wanxiang Adept
is.” Ning’s heart was now filled with a desire to kill this
Wanxiang Adept, who posed a great threat to the Ji clan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kill! Kill! Kill!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the base of Oxhorn
Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu, Nong Zidao,
and the others were all within the grand sealing barrier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There is another
thing I must warn you of, master-uncle.” Nong Zidao said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Adept Xu
looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao continued,
“The Ji clan only has a few Zifu Disciples, most of whom are not
worthy of concern. There is only one person we must be careful of! He
is the monstrous genius of the Ji clan, ‘Ji Ning’, who is only
sixteen years old.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sixteen? We have to
be careful of him?” Adept Xu was shocked, and the other Zifu
Disciples were incomparably surprised as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Nong Zidao
said solemnly. “He is power is quite terrifying. Earlier, nineteen
of us Zifu Disciples entered, along with two Zifu-level
spirit-beasts…actually, by relying on our own formation, we were
able to fight against that Netherwyrm. The Ji clan wasn’t able to
harm us at all, but in the end, Ji Ning attacked. He was simply too
strong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of our fellow
disciples, including senior apprentice-brother Jadechild, died in Ji
Ning’s hands.” Nong Zidao said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He is only sixteen!
He killed Jadechild?” Adept Xu stared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no monster
like this in the entirety of Snowdragon Mountain!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other Zifu
Disciples were all dazed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How could such a
monstrous talent have appeared in a local clan like this Ji clan?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ll know once
you see him.” Nong Zidao said heavily. “Ji Ning dual-trains as a
Ki Refiner and as a Fiendgod Body Refiner. In addition, he is
exceedingly skilled in swordplay, to the point of even having
comprehended a ‘Dao Domain’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dao Domain!” Adept
Xu’s heart clenched, hard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He, a mighty Wanxiang
Adept, had yet to reach the ‘Dao Domain’ level in his insights
regarding the Dao. The other Zifu Disciples were completely
stupefied. Dao Domain? This was a concept that was too distant for
them. Sixteen? A sixteen year old who gained a Dao Domain? This…was
this real?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His Dao Domain is a
Rainwater Domain.” Nong Zidao said. “Once the rain begins to
fall, you must be careful. It represents that Ji Ning is about to
attack at any moment.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Adept Xu
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He felt that as a
Wanxiang Adept with an Earth-ranked magic treasure and a high level
of insight into the Dao…that he would absolutely be able to
overcome this genius. However, the enemy did have a Dao Domain. This
made it so that that he would definitely pay careful attention to
this foe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Also. Prior to this,
I had to rely on a Lesser Teleportation Dao-seal in order to flee.”
Nong Zidao said. “This Ji Ning of the Ji clan makes me uneasy. If
he begins to battle with you, master-uncle…if they use some
techniques against me, it will be very dangerous. Thus, master-uncle,
I would like to borrow a Lesser Teleportation Dao-seal from you, so
as to preserve my own life. Only then would I feel confident in
entering the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation once more and calmly
investigate the nether fog, as well as how to disrupt the flow of
elemental ki.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu hesitated for
a moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lesser Teleportation
Dao-seal?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sort of Dao-seal
was a life-saving item and exceedingly precious. Although he was a
Wanxiang Adept, the main sect had only bestowed upon him a single
such Dao-seal. Afterwards, by trading some of his own treasures, he
acquired two more. Each Lesser Teleportation Dao-seal was exceedingly
precious. But of course, if one encountered a particularly dangerous
foe or a unique location, the Lesser Teleportation Dao-seal would be
of no use either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, for battles at
the normal Wanxiang Adept level, this Dao-seal was generally enough
for one to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine. I will loan
you one.” Adept Xu nodded. He understood that if he didn’t loan
it to Nong Zidao, then Zidao, who had just avoided calamity, wouldn’t
be willing to enter again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After accepting the
Lesser Teleportation Dao-seal, Nong Zidao instantly felt more
confident, and he said with assuredness, “Master-uncle, please
don’t worry. Ji Ning battled against Jadechild for quite some time,
and was only able to kill Jadechild after exhausting his divine
power. Master-uncle, when you go in person, you will definitely
annihilate the entire Ji clan and acquire the official writ.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent.” Adept
Xu nodded and laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, let us enter
together.” Adept Xu swept the other Zifu Disciples with his gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other seven Zifu
Disciples glanced at each other, afraid to refuse. They all followed
Adept Xu and Nong Zidao towards that distant, enormous Netherwyrm,
and the nether fog it emanated. Soon, all of them entered the region
of nether fog.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as Adept Xu,
Nong Zidao, and the rest of the nine entered the Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation, Adept Xu barked, “Flood Dragon Formation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as his words
rang out, above the heads of Nong Zidao, Wu Qi, Lu Huang, and the
other Zifu Disciples appeared the mirage of a Flood Dragon. The eight
Flood Dragon mirages flew rapidly towards Adept Xu. Above him
appeared an enormous Flood Dragon Phantom, which hovered there,
waiting to join together with the other eight Flood Dragons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As they joined
together, instantly, a Flood Dragon with visible, snow-white scales
appeared, circling around the nine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snowdragon Mountain was
most famous for the ‘Soaring Snowdragon Formation’. This was a
grand formation that protected the entire sect. It could be led by a
Primal Daoist, who would a group of Wanxiang Adepts and thousands of
Zifu Disciples to form a massive formation that would transform into
a white divine dragon, with the power to annihilate the heavens. The
power was great enough to give Immortals a good fight!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aside from this supreme
‘Soaring Snowdragon Formation’, it also had various simplified
versions of the formation, all of which would be referred to as
‘Flood Dragon Formations’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the simplified
versions could only be referred to as creating a ‘Flood Dragon’;
only the supreme formation of the sect was referred to as creating a
‘Snowdragon’. Adept Xu and the rest of the nine were currently
using one of the simplified Flood Dragon Formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The snowy white Flood
Dragon swirled about them, emanating a powerful presence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu and the rest
of the nine constantly advanced.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Halt.” Nong Zidao
ordered, while pointing to the front. “Master-uncle, please act.
Make your grand seal transform to a length of thirty meters, and
smash down at that mountain over there, lowering it by thirty
meters.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu nodded. The
grand seal flew out from his hand, which transformed to a large size,
roughly thirty meters or so. Below the grand seal was a dense earthen
yellow aura. He pointed downwards, and the grand seal, with a
rumbling sound, crushed downwards, completely crumbling the trees and
rocks beneath as he carved out a thirty meter deep crater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In this location,
smash out another thirty meter deep crater.” Nong Zidao continued
to walk forward while giving guidance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang ! Bang! As
the grand seal smashed down time and time again, one giant crater
after another appeared, forming a strange diagram.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than a hundred
deep craters were created.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success.” Nong
Zidao revealed a smile. Part of the elemental ki that had been
flowing through the earth had begun to change directions. Instantly,
the nether fog around them began to rapidly dissipate, as the
surrounding area once more became clear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Zidao is truly formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The various Zifu
Disciples were all overjoyed. Everything around them was very clear
now. Part of the entire Oxhorn Mountain was now revealed, and the
trees and forests there could be clearly seen with the naked eye.
Even the distant, gigantic black claws of the dragon could be seen.
Immediately afterwards, the body of the coiling dragon atop Oxhorn
Mountain suddenly began to move, and the location of the dragon claw
changed as the claw moved to hide in a different part of the nether
fog.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao laughed.
“The nether fog of the Dragonclaw Formation has been dissipated.
Now, only the Dragonpearl Formation, the Dragonhead Formation, the
Dragontail Formation, and the Dragonbody Formation still emanate that
nether fog.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Which sub-formation
shall we enter next?” Adept Xu already had a smile on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The reason why I was
able to break the formation so quickly was because I already pondered
on this formation for quite some time, previously.” Nong Zidao
said. “As for the other four sub-formations…I imagine I will need
a bit more time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu said, worried,
“How much longer?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao let out a
confident laugh. “Now that I have some experience from breaking the
Dragonclaw Formation, the other four will be fast. I will need at
most an hour for each of the others.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent.” Adept
Xu was instantly overjoyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At most an hour?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The remaining four
formations, all combined, would only need four hours or so! As long
as the nether fog was destroyed, there would be no place for the Ji
clan to hide. They would have to fight head on…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ji clan is
doomed!” Adept Xu’s eyes were filled with anticipation. If they
truly were to acquire this elemental ore mine, he would have rendered
the most merits, and would naturally be granted great rewards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu gave the
order. The nine of them, surrounded by the protective snowy white
Flood Dragon, entered the Dragonbody Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The nether fog
around the Dragonclaw Formation was broken!” Every member of the Ji
clan was filled with dread.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was the nether fog
that allowed them to hold an advantage, in that they could fight when
they wanted to, and flee when they wanted to! As for the enemy, they
could only passively be attacked, and wouldn’t have any place to
flee!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We can’t let this
continue.” Ji Ning, watching this, grew anxious. He understood the
Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation quite well, and also had a good grasp
of formations in general. He hurriedly said, “The power of the
Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation is extremely great, and it also has
an auxiliary nether fog effect. To break the entire Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation is very hard, but it is comparatively easier to
break through the bewildering nether fog formation. Nong Zidao…since
he was able to break the Dragonclaw Formation’s fog, he will be
able to break the others quite quickly as well, because they are all
linked and similar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The controller of the
formation, Ji Ninefire, nodded as well. “Right. We can’t just
watch as they destroy the nether fog. We have to stop them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We have to stop
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Frantic looks were on
the faces of Granny Shadow and the others as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you’ll
have to be the one to go.” Ninefire looked towards Ji Ning. “You
are our only hope for stopping them. If even you are unable to stop
them…then, the rest of us will have no choice but to try and delay,
to try and hold on as long as possible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slightly.
“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This tribulation…it
came in waves! After killing Jadechild, they had thought that they
had won for sure, but then Adept Xu had arrived. This caused the Ji
clan to once more face a terrifying danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This battle…I must
win.” Ning’s heart billowed with a boundless desire for battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had to win!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was the only one who
could stop Snowdragon Mountain!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If even he were to
fail, then he would be forced to flee, while his Patriarch, his
father, and the others would remain trapped here by the grand sealing
formation. They would only be able to rely on using their lives to
battle for as long as possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xu Li, I will make
sure you die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you will
die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had only one
thought - to kill his enemies. For the sake of survival. For the sake
of the Ji clan. For the sake of his family. For the sake of not
having to leave, grief-stricken, by himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had to kill the
enemy!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful.” Yichuan
looked at his son.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stopping them is
important, but staying alive is more important.” Granny Shadow
instructed in her hoarse voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them looked at
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded gently.
Before him, a corridor in the black fog appeared. He dashed through
it, moving like a blur at high speed towards the enemy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood next to an
old, gnarled, crooked tree. The area around him was filled with a
dense cluster of more than seven hundred flying swords, forty five of
which were Mortal-ranked flying swords. After killing Jadechild’s
group of Zifu Disciples, Ning’s collection of Mortal-ranked flying
swords had increased to forty six, enough to create five formation
bases.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…” The
flying swords around him all began to emit a blurry aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned, sweat
beginning to form on his forehead. He was struggling to control them,
and the flying swords around him constantly rose and fell.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No. I still can’t
do it.” Ning shook his head. “Last time, when I fought Jadechild,
I had twenty seven Mortal-ranked flying swords…I was only able to
just barely use the ninth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation]. But now, I have forty five Mortal-ranked flying swords…no
matter what I try, I’m unable to execute the ninth level of the
[Lesser Thousand Swords Formation].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Level eight, then!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gave it a try.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying swords
around him all rose into the air, flashing with a white light, but it
was still quite difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise!” Ning
gritted his teeth. His head hurt to the point of splitting, but he
was just able to manifest a flying sword, glowing with white light,
in front of himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disperse.” With a
thought, Ning collected the flying swords hovering about him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning pondered to
himself, “I am, at most, able to execute the eighth level of the
[Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], and it is quite difficult. I
imagine that executing three sword flashes using the eighth level of
the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]…that is my limit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he was only
able to activate the eighth level, in terms of power, the strength of
his attack was 30%-40% greater than in the past, when he had used the
ninth level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] to kill
Jadechild.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch, where are
they?” Ning said. “I am prepared.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right ahead of you.
I will guide you.” Ninefire sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wielded a pair of
the Darknorth swords in his hands, his eyes filled with a killing
intent. He rapidly advanced forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The snowy white Flood
Dragon roved about, its draconic scales glistening with snowy white
light. It was shockingly, breathtakingly beautiful. As for Adept Xu,
Nong Zidao, and the others, they were protected and surrounded by the
snowy white Flood Dragon. Nong Zidao was focused on analyzing the
formation; he had to understand the intricate secrets of the nether
fog generated by the Dragonbody Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rustle…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the nether fog,
a drizzling rain suddenly appeared out of nowhere. The drizzling rain
drifted downwards, cool and comfortable. This was an enjoyable,
pleasurable drizzle, but the faces of the nine Immortal practitioners
of Snowdragon Mountain all changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rainwater!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rainwater! Ji Ning’s
rainwater!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rainwater Sword
Domain. Ji Ning has unleashed his Rainwater Sword Domain. He is about
to attack.” The Zifu Disciples were all extremely nervous. Even
Nong Zidao temporarily paused his musings, a hint of concern on his
face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The descent of the
rainwater was like a call from the Deathgod. The last time it came,
Dong Ziqi, Jadechild, and the other Zifu Disciples had all perished.
And now, the rain had come again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rainwater Sword
Domain?” Adept Xu, dressed in a beautiful black robe, swept the
surrounding area with his gaze, his pupils contracting to slits, like
that of a venomous viper. He was the calmest of the group, but he was
still extremely cautious and wary. After all, he was still some
distance away from being able to comprehend a Dao Domain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” A cold
snort rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the nether fog,
one dazzling star after another began to appear. Amongst the dazzling
stars was a brilliant moon. The watery glow of the moon shone down
upon Adept Xu and the other Zifu Disciples, covering the entire
region of the snowy white Flood Dragon. The moonlight completely,
forcibly blocked off the rainwater.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you lurk
and sneak about. This really makes one look down on you.” Adept Xu
stood there in the moonlight, the snowy white Flood Dragon swirling
around him as he spoke in a cold voice. “If you want to fight, then
come and fight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As you desire!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A thunderous shout,
like a spring thunderbolt, exploded forth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From far away, a bolt
of light suddenly shot out from within the nether fog. A giant, fiery
winged Roc suddenly surged forth, surrounded by a Waterflame Lotus.
In but an instant, the fiery Roc appeared before Adept Xu, moving so
quickly as to astonish even him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble…” The
draconic tail of the snowy white Flood Dragon Phantom slapped towards
the giant fiery Roc.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the giant fiery Roc
was simply too fast; the tail slap of the Flood Dragon actually
missed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is…” Adept
Xu could instantly tell that this was no Roc; it was a youth! This
youth’s entire body emanated a fiery light, like that of a
Fiendgod’s, while on his back was a set of wings that fluttered
agilely. The wing-type magic treasure was also covered with a fiery
light, allowing him to move so quickly as to cause fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Divine ability -
Windwing Evasion!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once a Fiendgod Body
Refiner learned a divine ability, he would be able to fight enemies
of a higher power level. Although Ning was only at the seventh stage
of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens], he already had
the combat ability of an ordinary late-stage Fiendgod Body Refiner.
Now that he was also using the exquisitely agile divine ability,
‘Windwing Evasion’, his speed had instantly risen by several
levels, to the point of being even faster than Adept Xu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?” Adept
Xu’s face finally changed as he stared at this fur-clad youth, who
wielded two swords, was bathed by the Crimsonbright divine power, and
who was so fast as to astonish even him. “He is Ji Ning? Supposedly
on par with Jadechild? What sort of joke is this? Jadechild was
nowhere near this strong!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A fierce shout!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword light flashed!
</P>

Chapter 25 - 72 Flying Swords
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu stretched out
his hand, and the giant seal suddenly expanded, sweeping towards Ji
Ning like a gigantic rampart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, bathed in fiery
light, fluttered the wings on his back, sending himself arcing out in
a line, dodging the grand seal and continuing to charge towards Adept
Xu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Adept Xu
controlled the giant seal, sending the giant seal, glowing with that
earthen yellow light, to curve and turn towards Ning once more! The
grand seal struck at Ning repeatedly; it was, after all, an
Earth-ranked magic treasure, and so it moved in a straight line at
tremendous speeds. Only, in terms of agility, it was significantly
inferior to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crackle!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s swords
flashed, transforming into lines of rainwater that ‘scraped’ by
the edges of the grand seal. The grand seal spun out of control to
one side, while Ning once more swept out in an arc, charging straight
towards Adept Xu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s too fast. His
speed is too fast, and he’s too nimble.” Adept Xu was completely
stunned. Just now, in that short period of time, his Earth-ranked
magic treasure had clashed against Ning several times, but even his
Earth-ranked magic treasure had been thrown off by Ning’s movement
techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu let out a loud
shout, and a black rope appeared in his hands. The black rope was
covered with a layer of black energy, and as Adept Xu waved his
hands, the black rope quickly expanded until it was the size of a
giant python that was more than three hundred meters long, then swept
entanglingly towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Earth-ranked magic
treasure, ‘Earth Garrison Seal’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Earth-ranked magic
treasure, ‘Black Serpent Cord’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These were the two
mighty Earth-ranked magic treasures which Adept Xu relied on as he
roamed the world. One was hard, while the other was soft; the two
paired together perfectly. Generally speaking, upon encountering
those weaker than him, he would use the ‘Earth Garrison Seal’ to
viciously smash them to death! Unexpectedly, he hadn’t been able to
smash Ning at all, and was forced to bring out the second of his two
killing techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A cord?” Ning
stared at the giant black cord, over three hundred meters in length,
and his face changed slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is troublesome.
This giant seal moves in straight lines and isn’t able to do
anything to me, but that cord is perfectly suited for locking
opponents.” Many thoughts flashed through Ning’s mind. “I
definitely cannot permit myself to be constricted by that cord. Once
it captures me, I will lose for sure.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this battle, Ning
had immediately used the Windwing Evasion at full power from the very
start. He wanted to rely on his far superior speed and agility to
kill his foe!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu stood there,
unmoving; all he had done was unleash two powerful Earth-ranked magic
treasures, and Ning already felt shaken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Water Rampart!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waterflame Lotus!”
Ning, with a thought, instantly summoned one swirling curtain of
water after another in the area around him. These curtains of water,
as thin as the wing of a cicada, were all incomparably sharp. They
directly chopped apart the moonlight barrier, forming multiple layers
of watery curtains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time, in
the air around him, one Waterflame Lotus after another appeared and
stabilized. A total of nine lotuses appeared, locked into various
locations in the rainwater that perfectly entangled and blocked the
rope.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph, with simple
techniques like this, you wish to block my magic treasure?” Adept
Xu let out a cold laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Black Serpent Cord
began to wildly wave about and dance. Bangbangbang! One curtain of
water was forcibly shattered after the other. Whapwhapwhap! The
Waterflame Lotuses were also crushed to bits. How could these water
curtains and Waterflame Lotuses possibly block the power of an
Earth-ranked magic treasure, when unleashed by a Wanxiang Adept?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning didn’t need
to actually block them; what he needed to do was to slow down the
speed of the cord, just a bit. Given his ‘Windwing Evasion’
divine ability, his speed would then naturally result in him moving
beyond the cord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swish!” “Swish!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rainwater filled the
skies. Curtains of water swirled around him. Lotus petals of fire and
water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Black Serpent Cord
and the Earth Garrison Seal all strove to slay Ning…but Ning arced
out in jagged lines, flashing about like a crooked bolt of lightning,
charging straight towards Adept Xu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to see how
many Earth-ranked magic treasures you have.” Ning swiped out with
the Darknorth swords in his hands, chopping straight towards Adept
Xu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao and the
others, watching from the side, were completely stupefied. They
didn’t even dare to breathe. They had no idea at all that this
monstrous genius of the Ji clan would actually be able to fight head
on against Adept Xu! Adept Xu had already activated two Earth-ranked
magic treasures, but still hadn’t been able to do anything to Ji
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clearly…he clearly
was just at Jadechild’s level.” Nong Zidao couldn’t believe
what he was seeing. “How could Ji Ning’s speed have suddenly
risen by so much? Even two mighty Earth-ranked magic treasures, under
the influence of his Rainwater Sword Domain and his Waterflame
Lotuses, are unable to touch him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His speed was simply
too fast!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If he had moved this
fast in his earlier battle against Jadechild, Jadechild probably
would have lost in their first exchange of blows.” Nong Zidao’s
eyes were filled with disbelief. “Can it be that he just made some
sort of a breakthrough?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Monster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What a monster!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept Xu will
definitely win.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Definitely win.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lu Huang and the other
Zifu Adepts all prayed quietly. Once Adept Xu lost, Adept Xu could
leave through his Lesser Teleportation Dao-seal, but they wouldn’t
be able to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning will
definitely win.” On the other side, Ji Ninefire and the others were
praying as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning and Adept Xu
are fighting to a standstill.” Ninefire, as the controller of the
Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation, was able to watch this battle. As he
did, he spoke with the nearby Yichuan. “Adept Xu is using two
Earth-ranked magic treasures; his power is indeed exceedingly great.
However, Ji Ning’s speed is astonishing; he’s simply
inconceivably fast.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ninefire spoke,
Yichuan, by his side, was holding his breath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the critical
battle!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing that even two
Earth-ranked magic treasures hadn’t been enough to stop Ning, Adept
Xu suddenly let out an explosive shout: “Formation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the air around him,
seventy two flying swords suddenly appeared out of nowhere. Every
single flying sword glowed with black light, and the seventy two
flying swords formed into a circle around Adept Xu, providing him
with layers of protections.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning, just
about to display his swordplay and kill Adept Xu, stared in
astonishment at the flying swords which had suddenly appeared in
front of him. These flying swords all transformed into rays of
flowing black light, stabbing straight towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clang!” “Clang!”
“Clang!” Ning wielded a Darknorth sword in each hand, and in the
blink of an eye, he used them to block nine attacks from flying
swords. He was knocked flying backwards by the force of the
collision, and from behind, the Black Serpent Cord and the Earth
Garrison Seal came flying towards him once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wings on Ning’s
back trembled violently, and he immediately arced away, dodging the
attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The layers of
Waterflame Lotuses and curtains of rainwater around him continued to
hinder everything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could it be like
this!” Ning’s face changed. He stared at the distant Adept Xu,
securely protected by those seventy two flying swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seventy two flying
swords, each of which strikes with power no weaker than a full-force
attack from one of my Darknorth swords.” Just now, Ning had
attacked with full force. Although his swordplay was intricate, Adept
Xu’s flying swords were still filled with middle-stage
Wanxiang-level power, and in terms of technique, they were only
slightly inferior.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single flying
sword was indeed no less than a full-force blow from Ning’s
Darknorth swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Adept Xu
began to laugh. “Ji Ning, I’ve already discovered your weakness.
For me to use these two Earth-ranked treasures against you is using
my weakness against your strength!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although your speed
is astonishing, you are still a Zifu Disciple. There’s no need for
me to use Earth-ranked magic treasures; these Mortal-ranked flying
swords are already enough to deal with you.” Adept Xu laughed. “In
addition, to deal with your fast speed, I should use large amounts of
magic treasures to attack you in unison.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“With many magic
treasures at hand, I will just so happen to perfectly counter your
speed.” Adept Xu laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When fighting against
different foes, naturally one had to use different measures. Adept Xu
normally battled against other Wanxiang Adepts…and against them,
the power of these flyings words would be considered too low. They
would generally only be able to achieve victory through the use of
Earth-ranked magic treasures. But against Ji Ning, these
Mortal-ranked flying swords were enough to deal with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Return.” Adept Xu
laughed softly, and the giant seal and black cord that had been
chasing after Ning returned to him, swirling about him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Adept Xu
pointed towards the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, thirty-six
flying swords pierced through the skies, attacking Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although those blossoms
of Waterflame Lotuses and layers of watery curtains strove to block
the flying swords, the Mortal-ranked flying swords of Adept Xu were
no weaker than the full-force blows of Jadechild. Naturally, these
flying swords were able to peirce straight through, and although they
slowed down a bit, they were simply too numerous. They surrounded
Ning from every direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was as though
thirty-six people were simultaneously attacking Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Against you, the
path to victory is through sheer numbers.” Adept Xu was extremely
confident.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, seeing the
thirty-six flying swords attack, had a dramatically changed look on
his face. He hurriedly used his Windwing Evasion, urgently attempting
to pull away from them. At the same time, six hundred-plus flying
swords appeared out of nowhere in the area around Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!” Ning had a
savage look on his face, pouring almost all of his concentration into
his sword-formation. For the moment, the surrounding layers of watery
curtains and blossoms of Waterflame Lotuses all vanished. He had
completely focused his concentrating on executing the eighth level of
the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], and there was nothing left
for him to spare on controlling the Waterflame Lotuses and the watery
curtains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A ray of sword light
suddenly transformed into a drop of rain, instantly howling and
charging towards Adept Xu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clang.” The
distant Adept Xu, with but a thought, controlled the thirty-six
flying swords in pursuit of Ning to block that line of rainwater…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three of the flying
swords managed to intercept the line of rainwater, and the three
flying swords were all blasted away, with that line of rainwater
continuing to charge towards Adept Xu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The distant
Adept Xu revealed a smile. “It seems the power is quite
formidable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Nine of the
thirty-six flying swords protecting him instantly flew out.
Clangclangclang! Repeated collision sounds…and the line of
rainwater finally vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu stared at the
distant Ning and laughed softly. “The power of this sword-formation
technique of yours is indeed quite significant. However…it still
isn’t at the power of my Earth-ranked magic treasures. Even if I
just control these Mortal-ranked flying swords to block, I only need
six flying swords in order to completely block the sword light
generated by your sword-formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are dead.”
Adept Xu let out a confident laugh. “Die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thirty-six flying
swords that had been by his side all flew out as well, joining
together with the thirty-six flying swords that were attacking Ning
already.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eight-By-Nine Sword
Formation! Kill!” A hint of a fierce light flashed through Adept
Xu’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seventy two flying
swords transformed into an enormous circular arc. Like an orderly
army in a formation, all of the tips of the swords pointed towards Ji
Ning.

Chapter 26 - A Disastrous Defeat
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The curtains of water
continued to rise up, and the Waterflame Lotuses continued to bloom.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seventy two flying
swords, in the shape of a giant circular arc, pierced through the
multiple curtains of water, pierced through the Waterflame Lotuses,
and stabbed towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clang!” “Clang!”
“Clang!” “Clang!” “Clang!” “Clang!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One sound rang out
after another. Ji Ning, the Darknorth swords in his hands, hurriedly
executed his swordplay, a curtain of water formed from sword light.
Ning allowed those flying swords to attack as they pleased, focusing
on defense and relying on his two swords to block those seventy two
flying swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A flying sword slashed
past Ning’s thigh, sending blood flying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chop!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A flying sword pierced
past Ning’s flank.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, quick, return,
return.” The controller of the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation,
Patriarch Ji Ninefire, sent frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” Ning was
unwilling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick. Your life is
more important than ours. Stop fighting. Quick, return.” Ninefire’s
voice was filled with urgency and pain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gritted his teeth,
ignoring the Patriarch. He had to go all out and do his best,
because…he truly didn’t want to fail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He didn’t want to
fail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He didn’t want to see
them die!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He didn’t want to!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu watched from
afar, the look on his face having changed. “He lives up to his
reputation as someone who has gained insight into a Dao Domain. His
swordplay truly is formidable. When defending, his defense can be
described as airtight. Even though I’m occasionally able to wound
him, it’s under his control.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all, the pressure
of being attacked by seventy two flying swords was simply too great.
Even Ning had to occasionally use his body parts or the magic wings
on his back to block those flying swords…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Ning was
struggling to block those seventy two flying swords, but suddenly, a
fierce light flashed through his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of the six hundred-plus
flying swords hovering behind him, five hundred-plus suddenly lit up.
A sword light began to form in front of Ning, emanating a fierce,
sharp aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swish!” The sword
light suddenly pierced through the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the seventh
level of the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation]. Despite maintaining
the Waterflame Lotuses, the curtains of water, and executing his
swordplay…Ning was simultaneously able to divide his mind enough to
control the [Lesser Thousand Swords Formation], but only the seventh
level of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill, kill, kill!”
Ning was in a berserk state. One sword flash after another appeared
emerged, transforming into lines of rain and striking out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him!” Ning’s
eyes were filled with both hope and terror. Terror from the deepest
recesses of his heart; terror of being defeated! When the seventy two
flying swords had attacked him, causing him to be unable to move
closer to Adept Xu, Ning understood…that he would probably lose
this time. His greatest advantage in battling Adept Xu was in his
movements and agility!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now, he couldn’t
even draw near his opponent. How could he win?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Was he about to lose?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If even he were
defeated, then the Ji clan would be unable to stop the enemies. They
would have to spend their lives to battle and stop them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By then, his father, Ji
Yichuan, along with Patriarch Ninefire, Granny Shadow…they would
all give up their lives.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die, die, die!”
Ning’s eyes were filled with a killing urge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had to go all out!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Go all out, one last
time!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One flash of sword
light after another transformed into lines of rain, striking towards
Adept Xu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu just stood
there, laughing coldly. “He really is relentless.” In the area
around him, that black cord quickly looped around him multiple times.
With the thick cord wrapped about him…the majority of the space was
blocked off, and when the lines of rain struck at him, the black cord
simply trembled slightly, then shattered the lines of rain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! The
cords simply trembled and moved very slightly as they dispersed each
attacking line of rain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of this
Earth-ranked magic treasure, ‘Black Serpent Cord’, was simply too
great. It was able to easily disperse the blows of the [Lesser
Thousand Swords Formation].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The remaining, final
drop of rain struck out in a solitary arc, actually striking towards
Nong Zidao, protected by multiple people.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I kill Nong
Zidao, I still win!” Ning’s eyes were filled with savagery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Roaaaaar!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That snowy white Flood
Dragon gently descended over the bodies of Adept Xu, Nong Zidao, Lu
Huang, and the rest of the nine Immortal practitioners. In but an
instant…Adept Xu, Nong Zidao, and the others all entered the ‘body’
of the snowy white Flood Dragon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was much like how
Ning and the others were within the body of the Netherwyrm; Adept Xu
and the others were also able to enter the body of their Flood
Dragon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” The line of
rainwater wildly pierced towards the snowy white Flood Dragon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The draconic scales of
the snowy white Flood Dragon trembled, but the line of rainwater was
completely shattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Defeat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha.” Nong
Zidao, within the body of the snowy white Flood Dragon, began to
laugh. “This Flood Dragon Formation was jointly set up by
master-uncle, myself, and seven others. Even if you had
master-uncle’s level of power, it would still be hard for you to
break through it. And your strength is far inferior to
master-uncle’s.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Flood Dragon simply
coiled there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were within
the body of the Flood Dragon, with Adept Xu standing at the Flood
Dragon’s head, staring at the distant Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Snowdragon
Mountain’s famous ‘Soaring Snowdragon Formation’ is legendary
in countless lands.” Adept Xu’s eyes were filled with arrogance.
“Although this Flood Dragon Formation is merely a simplified
version of the ‘Soaring Snowdragon Formation’, once it has been
established with the nine of us within it…even I, using all my
power, wouldn’t be able to do anything to this formation, much less
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Nong Zidao
and Adept Xu spoke smugly. Although Ning was listening, in his heart,
he was musing to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be…can it
be that I truly have been forced to take the last step?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a ripple of
power surged close to him. Ning was in control of his Rainwater Sword
Domain, and so although he couldn’t see anything visibly, he could
sense a strange, needle-shaped item pierce towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” Ning
immediately came to his senses. The magic wings behind his back
trembled, and he immediately sought to use the Windwing Evasion to
pull away from it. Although the Darknorth swords remained in his
hands…they were currently being used to block the seventy two
attacking flying swords. If he were to relax against them, the
seventy two flying swords would chop his body into mincemeat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning was frantically
dodging, the sharp needle, as though consciously controlled, pierced
straight through Ning’s flank.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The elemental ki
exploded!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s incomparably
tough Fiendgod body still had a giant hole blasted through it, even
larger than the size of his head. The left part of his waist was
completely shattered, leaving behind only a few scraps of muscle and
flesh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grow.” While using
the Windwing Evasion to hurriedly pull away, Ning also controlled his
divine power to instantly cause new flesh and blood to grow out at
high speed. The giant hole in his side was rapidly healing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, come back.”
Ninefire howled furiously. “Ji Ning, if you don’t come back, all
of us will die with our eyes open and filled with resentment!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was frantic.
Patriarch Ninefire was now truly frantic. He had asked Ning to come
back earlier, but Ning insisted on struggling. If this continued…Ning
would very likely perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gritted his teeth
in agony.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He would leave!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swoosh.” His wings
fluttered, and he instantly charged into the nearby nether fog. The
nether fog was filled with darkness, and Adept Xu and the others only
watched him enter, not daring to follow in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning! You’ve
already been struck by my Divine Blackblood Needle!” Adept Xu
called out in a high voice. “I can already sense your location.
Once you draw near me, forget about leaving with your life!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Halfway up Oxhorn
Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One figure after
another was making haste towards this location, moving like streaks
of light. Ji Truekeep, Granny Shadow, and the others were all
gathering here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning arrived as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Ninefire
looked at the youth. It was this youth who had risked his life, time
and time again. He let out a long sigh. “Ji Ning, our Ji clan has
let you down.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch.” Ning’s
eyes were red.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve done enough
things. Done well enough.” Ninefire gently patted Ning on the
shoulders. “In a slightly larger clan, a slightly more powerful
clan…how could a supreme genius like yourself be forced to risk
your life repeatedly like this? It is our Ji clan which has let you
down. You killed Jadechild and that group of Zifu Disciples; you have
done enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we truly are not
able to endure this, then it will simply be the will of the heavens,
that our Ji clan is not to survive this tribulation.” Ninefire said
softly. “There is no need to feel anger. No need to feel grief. All
clans will have a time to flourish, and a time to fall. What we can
do is to fight with all our power. That is enough. For the heavens to
allow a genius like you to arrive within our Ji clan is already an
incomparable kindness.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire looked at
Ning. “I know that with you alive, our Ji clan will definitely
flourish. It definitely will!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gritted his teeth.
His heart was shaking!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Given how the
situation has progressed…” Ninefire swept his gaze towards the
nearby Granny Shadow, Ah Xing, Truekeep, and Yichuan, along with the
Landwyrm and the Fairy Crane. “Everyone, you should all know that
the situation is very grim. There is also a giant sealing formation
outside; there is nowhere for us to run.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This time, our only
choice is to fight to the death!” Ninefire was very calm, but his
gaze was blazing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fight to the death!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan, Truekeep, and
the others all had the same resolve in their eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of them would
cower!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of them were
afraid!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If they were afraid,
they wouldn’t have come here, to Oxhorn Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Obey my commands.”
NInefire said. “All of us must fight with full force, making it so
that Nong Zidao is unable to completely concentrate on breaking the
formation. We need to delay as much as we can. Thus, Landwyrm, you
will be the first to go and delay them. Once you die, the Fairy Crane
will go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Landwyrm and the
Fairy Crane, the two Zifu-level spirit-beasts, were in the form of
the azure-armored man and the white-robed maiden. They glanced at
each other, their eyes filled with bitterness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you can
only blame your poor luck. Fight at full power.” Ninefire said. “If
you die in battle for the sake of our Ji clan, you can still enter
the cycle of reincarnation. If you resist, then I will shatter your
souls!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We will obey.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-armored
warrior and the white-robed maiden both lowered their heads.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once the soul-bond was
set, they absolutely had to obey the orders of their owner.
Otherwise, their owner could easily destroy their souls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After the Fairy
Crane dies, Yichuan, you will go next.” Ninefire looked at Yichuan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Yichuan
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was only able to
fight at the Zifu Disciple level for an hour. He was of the least use
to the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation; naturally, he would be the
first member of the Ji clan to charge forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once Yichuan dies,
Liu Xing, you go.” Ninefire looked towards the old servant, Ah
Xing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ah Xing nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once Liu Xing dies,
Ji Shadow, you go.” Ninefire looked at his little sister.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Granny Shadow nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After Granny Shadow
dies, Truekeep, you go.” NInefire looked towards Truekeep. “I
will immediately follow!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not a single voice was
raised in dissent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, watching this,
felt great pain in his heart. He hurriedly said, “Patriarch, I am
the strongest, and I’m able to delay them as well. If I ambush them
repeatedly…I can make it so that Nong Zidao is distracted and
unable to focus on breaking the formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Didn’t you hear
what Adept Xu just said?” Ninefire barked. “You were hit by his
Divine Blackblood Needle. He can sense your location. Once you draw
near him, he will definitely prepare a heavy counter-attack for you.
It doesn’t matter if we die, but if you die, you would have let
down the entire Ji clan, not just yourself, understood?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gritted his teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Granny
Shadow said hoarsely. “If you dare to come again, I will
immediately commit suicide in front of you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Granny Shadow…”
Ning’s heart trembled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Yichuan
looked at his son, then gave him his instructions. “Don’t make
our deaths meaningless.”

Chapter 27 - Ji Ning’s Departure
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning nodded gently.
“I won’t go fight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Ji Ninefire
swept them with his gaze. “Everyone, return to your positions.
Landwyrm, for now, you will assume Ji Ning’s position in the center
of the Dragontail Formation. We will control the Netherwyrm and
attack!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Landwyrm, Granny
Shadow, Ah Xing, and Truekeep all immediately left to their own
positions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nether fog
billowed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sinuous, coiling,
snowy white Flood Dragon lay there, with Adept Xu and the others
within the dragon’s body, clearly quite cautious. Quite obviously,
Ning’s earlier prowess had caused Adept Xu to privately feel
surprised. Still, the other Zifu Disciples were quite relaxed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although Ji Ning is
a monster, he’s still just a Zifu Disciple. He’s no match for the
Adept.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Compared to
master-uncle, Ji Ning is far weaker.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Ji clan is
doomed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Zifu
Disciples chatted amongst each other in quite a relaxed manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Nong Zidao, his
eyes were closed as he focused on analyzing the formation. Suddenly,
amidst the distant, dense nether fog, a massive thunderclap could be
heard!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoosh!” An
enormous draconic tail, covered with black draconic scales, came
sweeping towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sweeping attack
landed on the coiled body of the snowy white Flood Dragon, causing
the entire dragon to be knocked backwards by the blow. Adept Xu, Nong
Zidao, and the others, however, naturally remained within the
dragon’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ambushed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yet another ambush.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even Ji Ning lost.
The Ji clan dares to ambush us again?” All of them were enraged.
Given how even the Flood Dragon had been knocked flying, Nong Zidao,
who had been focused on analyzing the formation, naturally was
startled awake as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu stood there at
the draconic head of the snowy white Flood Dragon. He shouted loudly,
“You are asking for death!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The grand seal in his
hands suddenly flew into the air, rapidly expanding to a size of
three hundred meters, smashing directly against that impudent,
enormous draconic tail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Boom…” An
enormous, explosive sound. Draconic scales blew apart, and the
draconic tail itself was torn apart, with the dispersed energy
quickly vanishing into the nether fog.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master-uncle.”
Nong Zidao frowned as he stared towards the distant nether fog. “Even
Ji Ning was no match for you, master-uncle. The Ji clan has already
run out of options. Thus, all they are trying to do now is to waste
time and impede me from breaking their formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu nodded.
“Zidao, just focus on analyzing how to break the formation. Just
now, I was caught offguard. Now that I am prepared, I definitely
won’t let the Ji clan’s ambushes affect you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu waved his
hand, and a black cord rapidly expanded to a length of hundreds of
meters. It swirled around the snowy white Flood Dragon, while the
grand seal returned to Adept Xu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As long as that
Netherwyrm dares to appear, I will instantly shatter it.” Adept Xu
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just moments later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A blur suddenly
appeared. It was the draconic tail, once more striking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Boom…” The black
cord suddenly lashed out. The whipping strike from an Earth-ranked
magic treasure that a Wanxiang Adept was personally directing was
enough to cause the draconic tail to instantly crumble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao, within the
snowy white Flood Dragon, finally let out a relieved sigh. He closed
his eyes, once more focusing on analyzing the formation. The simple
sounds and ruckuses of the outside battles didn’t have much of an
impact on him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Halfway up the
mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire, Ning,
Yichuan, the Fairy Crane, and the Whitewater Hound were all present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just relying on the
Netherwyrm won’t do.” Ninefire shook his head. “Adept Xu, by
himself, is enough to cause the Netherwyrm to disperse. There’s no
way to impact Nong Zidao. We still have to rely on everyone going all
out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Netherwyrm was just
an energy construct, after all. As for monsters and humans, they were
living creatures; they could use certain tricks, such as releasing
Dao-seals, etc…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Landwyrm!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire sent mentally.
“Go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Landwyrm, in the
shape of that azure-armored man, glanced at the corridor that had
appeared in the nether fog before him. A hint of bitterness was in
his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas, alas…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he thought back to
what he had experienced in his life, his heart was filled with grief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon becoming tamed as
a spirit-beast, one’s only hope was to encounter a kind owner.
Otherwise, life would be miserable. For example, after Jadechild
died, he had been forced to submit yet again, and now he was being
forced to go to his death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But even though he was
being sent to his death, he didn’t dare to resist at all. This was
because, if he died here, he would still go to the Netherworld
Kingdom. Given the power of his soul, as a Zifu-level Diremonster, he
would definitely be a powerful ghost that would find it easy to join
the army of ghosts. But if he were to resist…his soul would be
destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How hateful!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-armored man
immediately transformed into his true form, an enormous, clawed
Landwyrm. The enormous body of the Landwyrm moved across the
mountain, rapidly passing through the corridor within the nether fog
and moving towards Adept Xu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Landwyrm could
vaguely see, through the corridor, the faint contours of a snowy
white Flood Dragon, as well as the figures within the Flood Dragon’s
body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swoosh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Landwyrm suddenly
flew forwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He instantly charged
forward. Nong Zidao was within the snowy white Flood Dragon,
analyzing the formation. The other Zifu Disciples were staring at the
surrounding areas, while Adept Xu was riding atop his magic treasure,
prepared to attack at any moment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Landwyrm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Landwyrm?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Zifu Disciples all
immediately recognized it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Roaaaaaar!” The
Landwyrm charged forward, but before Adept Xu even had a chance to
attack with his magic treasure, it raised its head, letting out a
grieving, furious howl which shook the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And immediately
afterwards, a terrifyingly powerful energy blast exploded forth from
the body of the Landwyrm, causing Adept Xu’s face to change.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Careful!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a peak Zifu-level
Godbeast, its Zifu lake was far vaster than the Zifu lake of a human
Zifu-level practitioner. The amount of elemental ki it contained was
also boundless and deep. In terms of amount of elemental ki, this
Godbeast’s Zifu lake was not inferior to an early Wanxiang Adept’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the elemental ki
that it had accumulated over so many years suddenly exploded, causing
an incomparably powerful blast to instantly ripped out, tearing the
Landwyrm’s body to pieces and wildly shooting in every direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Block.” Adept Xu
hurriedly controlled that grand seal to serve like a rampart,
blocking in front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The terrifying
explosion blasted out in every direction, blowing aside that
Earth-ranked magic treasure, ‘Earth Garrison Seal’. But after it
sent the seal flying, the remaining amount that struck against the
‘body’ of the snowy white Flood Dragon was greatly reduced,
causing the snowy white dragon to roll over a few times, but be
completely undamaged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
Nong Zidao opened his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Self-explosion.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was a Landwyrm
which blew itself up.” The Zifu Disciples said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao said,
astonished, “Landwyrm? That was senior apprentice-brother
Jadechild’s Landwyrm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu’s eyes
narrowed as he stared at the enormous crater in the ground. HE said
in a low voice, “This Landwyrm was a Godbeast amongst monsters. The
amount of elemental ki in its Zifu lake was incomparably vast. This
self-detonation…truly was astonishingly powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Halfway up the
mountain. Ninefire looked at the Fairy Crane, currently in the form
of a white-robed maiden. “The Landwyrm is dead. Fairy Crane, your
turn.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fairy Crane didn’t
hesitate at all, immediately departing towards the tunnel through the
nether fog that had appeared in front of her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But just a few moments
after she had left…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A rumbling explosion
which they seemed to be able to feel.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That fast?”
Yichuan frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She didn’t go to
Adept Xu.” Ninefire growled. “That Fairy Crane…she was formerly
the mount for Nong Zidao. Most likely, she had a deep relationship
with Nong Zidao. I forced her to go blow herself up, and so she blew
herself up midway, not disturbing Nong Zidao in the slightest.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head
gently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon accepting an
owner…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the spirit-beast’s
heart, it would naturally feel very obedient to it’s owner. For the
Fairy Crane to act in such a way was a testament to how deep the
affection she bore for Nong Zidao was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nong Zidao.”
Ninefire bellowed loudly. “Your former spirit-beast mount, the
Fairy Crane. I ordered her to go attack you, but she actually blew
herself up midway, before she had even reached out. It seems as
though the relationship between you and the spirit-beast was quite
close.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice transmitted
far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu and the others
all fell silent. They looked towards Nong Zidao, who opened his eyes,
staring into the distance with a pained look. “Crane…child…Crane…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, when he
chose to flee, he had only a single Lesser Teleportation Dao-seal,
and so he hadn’t taken his Fairy Crane.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had released her
from his bond, in the hopes that the Fairy Crane would be able to
continue to live…but now, his Crane had actually blown herself up
in the distance, for the sake of not disturbing him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Crane…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Crane.” Nong Zidao
wanted to forget about her, but images from the past welled up,
causing his mind to be unable to calm down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Apprentice-nephew
Zidao.” Adept Xu barked. “This is a psychological ploy of the Ji
clan. You cannot be affected by it. Hurry up and focus on breaking
the formation; that’s what matters.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao nodded.
“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he understood
this principle, how could he so easily discard and forget about the
hundreds of years of friendship between him and the Fairy Crane? How
could he truly calm down? The impact the Fairy Crane’s
self-detonation had on him was far greater than the impact which Ji
Ning had when he had attacked earlier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Halfway up Oxhorn
Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was incomparably
nervous. He stared at his father. Based on the Patriarch’s original
plan, after the Landwyrm and the Fairy Crane perished, it would be
his father who would go!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The amount of time
needed to brew a pot of tea has passed.” Ninefire suddenly said.
“The Fairy Crane’s self-detonation had a major impact on Nong
Zidao. But now that some time has passed, I imagine that Nong Zidao
has calmed down. Yichuan…your turn now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You need to come up
with a way to disturb Nong Zidao and prevent him from concentrating
on analyzing of the formation.” Ninefire said. “The Landwyrm and
the Fairy Crane were only recently tamed, after all; they weren’t
fully loyal to our Ji clan. Thus, both of them were used to
self-detonate, the simplest, fastest method to disturb the enemy.
There was a limit to how long those two were able to delay. In the
end, we mainly have to rely on our own people, of the Ji clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know.” Yichuan
nodded. “Leave it to me. But before this. Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan looked at his
son.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised his head,
looking at his father.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can leave now.”
Yichuan looked at his son, then said, “You are useless here. If you
wait too long, more variables might come into place. Leave, now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I should leave now?”
Ning stared, wide-eyed. His father was about to go risk his life in
battle. He was supposed to leave now?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Yichuan
barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, looking at his
father’s facial expressions, understood. His father, in his heart,
had always been a proud, arrogant person. Even as he went to welcome
death, he wouldn’t want to let his son see it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” The
nearby Ninefire understood Yichuan’s intent as well. He immediately
said, “Go, hurry and go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Whitewater
Hound walked over as well, raising its head and looking towards Ji
Ning, eyes filled with longing and love.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White.” Ning
moved forward to embrace the Whitewater Hound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This time…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The others, including
Uncle White, were unable to leave. This was because there was a grand
sealing formation outside! Only Ning would be able to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father. Uncle
White.” Ning held Uncle White, looking at his father, his eyes
filled with rare tears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!!!” Yichuan
barked furiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was in agony.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He didn’t want to go!
He truly didn’t want to go!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He wanted to stay, to
battle to the death by their sides!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It takes courage to
fight to the death.” Ninefire looked towards Ning. “But to choose
to leave on one’s own requires even greater courage! Ji Ning…don’t
disappoint us!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
gently raised its head to look at Ning as well, also urging Ning to
leave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at his
father, looked at the Whitewater Hound, looked at his Patriarch…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go!” Ning
said hoarsely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He turned and walked
out through a corridor that had appeared through the nether fog.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In his heart, he was
howling to himself that he truly didn’t want to leave. That he
wanted to stay here with his father, with his Uncle White, and fight
with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But his rationale mind
told him that he had to go. Otherwise, the Patriarch and the others
would all die with their eyes open, filled with resentment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The light of the
sealing formation was everywhere, and it rippled like water, locking
the entire region in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning utilized his
[Lesser Thousand Swords Formation] and his Darknorth swords, but
wasn’t able to damage the sealing formation at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why. Why.” Ning
was howling in agony in his heart. If he was able to break this grand
sealing formation, he would be able to lead his father, the
Patriarch, and the Whitewater Hound in a retreat! But there was some
distance between the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation and this sealing
formation; Ning was without the assistance of the Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation, and so the power of his [Lesser Thousand Swords
Formation] immediately decreased to a lower level. He wouldn’t even
be able to fight against Jadechild right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the Darknorth
swords were somewhat more powerful, they were still far from being
able to break through this grand sealing formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xu Li! Nong Zidao!
Snowdragon Mountain!” Ning turned to look at the coiling
Netherwyrm, hidden within the vast, endless nether fog. “I, Ji
Ning, swear that in my lifetime, I will eradicate you all!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Traceless Talisman
appeared in Ji Ning’s hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The space around him
rippled, and Ji Ning disappeared, having gone far away.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Adept Xu Li,
standing within the draconic head of the snowy white Flood Dragon,
frowned. The grand sealing formation was under his control, and thus,
he could clearly sense…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Someone is attacking
my grand sealing formation from within? It seems as though someone
from the Ji clan wishes to flee. Unfortunately, without the
assistance of the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation, even Ji Ning, the
most powerful of them, wouldn’t be able to break through the
formation!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They need to just
obediently wait for death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu’s cold,
insidious gaze held a hint of a killing intent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he had used
his Earth-ranked magic treasure, ‘Divine Blackblood Needle’, to
wound Ning, in reality, he wasn’t able to sense Ning’s location
at all. Previously, when he had loudly said that he could sense
Ning’s location, he was completely bluffing! After all, he wouldn’t
feel much pressure if other members of the Ji clan came and attacked,
but an ambush from Ning put him under great pressure. He trusted that
the Ji clan definitely treasured Ning, and so intentionally put on an
act, shouting loudly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And the effect was
excellent. The elders of the Ji clan, no matter what, refused to let
Ning go risk himself again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing Lake.
Within the icy waters of the lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rustle…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within the waters
of the lake, space rippled and Ning appeared out of nowhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is…?” Ning
looked at the boundless lakewater above him. He could sense the
presence of the aquatic estate. “This is Serpentwing Lake?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Previously, he had
completely relied on a general sense and feeling to activate the
Traceless Talisman to teleport him towards the general direction of
Serpentwing Lake. Serpentwing Lake was a hundred kilometers in
circumference, and so Ning’s teleportation had resulted him being
thrown deep into the waters of the lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The aquatic estate.
Inwards!” Ning willed it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As long as he could
sense the presence of the aquatic manor, he would be able to enter
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous phantom of
a grizzly’s head appeared in the lakewaters around him, swallowing
Ning within its maw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the ancient
aquatic estate. The enormous prayer mats lay scattered in the main
hall. Everything was just as Ning had left it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning appeared
out of nowhere within the main hall. He immediately saw the old black
bull and giant yellow bear in the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can sense that you
have already broken through, as a Fiendgod Body Refiner, to the
‘Blood Drop Rebirth’ level. Have you come to enter the Divine
Abilities Hall?” The giant yellow bear looked at Ning, a hint of
doubt suddenly appearing within its eyes. “Ji Ning, I can sense
that your heart is filled with boundless rage, panic, and a murderous
intent. What did you encounter, exactly?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart was
still filled with concern for his father, Uncle White, the Patriarch,
and the others on Oxhorn Mountain, who were at the brink of death.
Upon hearing the words from the giant yellow bear, a light suddenly
flashed in his mind!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The spirit of the
aquatic estate!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull was
the spirit of an Immortal-ranked magic treasure, while the giant
yellow bear was even more unfathomable; it didn’t even pay much
attention to Immortal Juhua. In addition, the giant yellow bear
seemed to carry with it an aura of eternity, very similar to the
eternal, unextinguishable aura that the image of Lady Nuwa which Ning
visualized had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This aquatic estate,
even without his active control, could allow him to go through
spatial teleportation? This sort of ability…was simply
inconceivable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” Ning gave
a brief explanation. “My Ji clan is currently facing a great
tribulation. We face a powerful foe, roughly at the early Wanxiang
Adept level of power, who has at least three Earth-ranked magic
treasures! By relying on my Windwing Evasion, I was able to fight
against him, but in the end, I was still defeated by him and forced
to flee…senior, dare I ask, can you suggest any method by which I
can defeat this Wanxiang Adept, and save my family?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
glanced at Ning. “Although you have the Windwing Evasion ability,
that’s simply a very crude divine ability which has undergone a
simplification process. It only allows your speed and agility to
increase! Your actual power, however, is not increased…and so, your
flaw is quite evident. If a Wanxiang Adept were to use a large number
of magic treasures to attack you and limit your agility, you would
definitely be defeated.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “Senior,
your words are correct. But what should I do to defeat him? If I go
to the Divine Abilities Hall and acquire a divine ability, would I be
able to defeat that Wanxiang Adept?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Divine Abilities
Hall has many divine abilities.” The giant yellow bear said. “If
you are able to learn a high-class divine ability, it would be
simplicity itself for you to kill even a middle-stage Wanxiang
Adept.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A look of unconcealable
excitement appeared on Ning’s face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The panic and pain in
his heart immediately became transformed into hope!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had to acquire a
divine ability!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, he would go
save his father, Uncle White, the Patriarch, and the others!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have reached the
Blood Drop Rebirth level as a Fiendgod Body Refiner. I can acquire a
Mortal-ranked magic treasure from the Treasure Hall.” Ning
hurriedly said. “Senior, please let me choose. I will make a quick
selection. I’ll choose a powerful magic treasure, so that I can go
attempt the Divine Abilities Hall.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The more powerful he
was, the greater his chances would be in challenging the Divine
Abilities Hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need.” The
giant yellow bear shook its head. “The Divine Abilities Hall is a
test for Fiendgods of later generations. It forbids one from using
elemental ki and any magic treasures! You have to use your power as a
Fiendgod…and even your weapons will be provided to you by the
Divine Abilities Hall.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m forbidden from
using elemental ki and magic treasures?” Ning hesitated slightly,
but then he understood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a test. A test
of his abilities as a Fiendgod Body Refiner. It made sense that all
Ki Refiner things were forbidden.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are only five
years old.” The giant yellow bear looked at Ning. “You can wait
until you are ten. By then, your power will be far greater. I imagine
that if you go to the Divine Abilities Hall at that point, you will
acquire even more powerful divine abilities. This Divine Abilities
Hall is a place you will only be able to enter once. Are you sure you
are going to enter now?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
“I am going to enter the Divine Abilities Hall immediately.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Perhaps, in five years,
he would receive an even more powerful divine ability when he
challenged the Divine Abilities Hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But his father, Uncle
White, and the others wouldn’t be able to wait.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His father, by now, had
most likely begun to execute a forbidden technique to delay
Snowdragon Mountain. This was very possibly his father’s final hour
of life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I can return to
Oxhorn Mountain within an hour, perhaps I will be able to save
Father.” Ning was filled with hope.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was fighting for
every moment right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since you’ve
decided, then come.” The giant yellow bear strode directly towards
a nearby corridor, with Ning hurriedly following from behind. The
nearby old black bull mumbled, “What a waste. If you waited five
more years, you would definitely acquire an even more powerful divine
ability from the Divine Abilities Hall.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bronze door to the
Divine Abilities Hall was shut. The surface of the door was covered
with the carving of a single giant hand. The hand seemed to be
omnipotent, as though it blocked out the skies and covered the earth,
filled with boundless power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
only needed to take three steps to travel from the gate of the main
hall to the gate of the Divine Abilities Hall. Upon arriving, as
though it knew that Ning was currently very nervous, it turned to
look at Ning, who was hurrying over like a flash of light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Follow me in.” The
giant yellow bear said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bronze door opened.
The insides of the hall were bathed with boundless amounts of gray
light. When the gray light fell upon the giant yellow bear and Ning’s
bodies, they disappeared without a trace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble.” The door
to the hall once more swung shut.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old black bull
remained outside the hall. The old black bull raised its head,
staring at the gate, then sighed. “Given Ji Ning’s talents, he is
even more of a monster than Immortal Juhua. In addition, he entered
this aquatic estate at a very young age…his situation is much
better than Immortal Juhua’s was. In the past, when Immortal Juhua
entered the aquatic estate, he was far older than simply ten years.
There was no way he could enter the Divine Abilities Hall at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If Immortal Juhua
had the chance to challenge the Divine Abilities Hall and acquire a
powerful divine ability, he probably wouldn’t have ended up
becoming a Loose Immortal.” The old black bull sighed. “I wonder
what sort of divine ability this Ji Ning will acquire.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not even the old black
bull knew which divine abilities this Divine Abilities Hall
contained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The blurry, gray area
seemed to be an empty void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the giant
yellow bear appeared out of nowhere within this location. Ning looked
around himself, but could see nothing at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This can be said to
be the most important part of the entire estate.” The giant yellow
bear looked at Niing, then sighed. “I know that your family members
are currently in mortal danger, but you only have a single chance to
challenge this Divine Abilities Hall. I advise you, wait five more
years. Five more years later, when you are more powerful, come and
challenge this hall.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve made my
decision!” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even the deaths of
your family members aren’t as important as this opportunity.” The
giant yellow bear said. “You still don’t understand what the
divine abilities within this Divine Abilities Hall represent! This
Divine Abilities Hall has seven mighty divine abilities; if you are
able to acquire the most powerful of them, then in the future, you
will even have the potential to dominate the Three Realms. By then,
you can even locate your reincarnated family members. Even granting
them their memories of their former lives won’t be too hard.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
looked at Ning, then said frantically, “Your talent is the best I
have seen out of the successors to this estate, ever since Master
created it. Don’t squander your talent. I can tell you this…the
number one divine ability within the seven divine abilities of the
Divine Abilities Hall was personally left here by Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The other six divine
abilities were left behind by Master’s six mighty disciples.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you were to
acquire Master’s divine ability…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the future, you
have a chance of escaping the Three Realms and becoming a Celestial
Immortal, and perhaps even of dominating the Three Realms.” The
giant yellow bear said frantically. “In the future, it wouldn’t
even be difficult for you to erect an enormous dynasty like the Grand
Xia Dynasty, which would exist for untold years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, hearing this, was
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At first, the giant
yellow bear hadn’t paid him much attention, but ever since he had
gained insight into the Rainwater Sword Domain, the giant yellow
bear’s attitude towards him had markedly changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And now, the giant
yellow bear clearly didn’t even want to let him waste this chance
to challenge the Divine Abilities Hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder what the
first master’s background was?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Countless years ago,
after Pangu established the universe, but before the Three Realms of
the Heaven, Netherworld, and the Mortal Realms were established, and
before the three thousand great worlds, and countless minor worlds
were created…” The giant yellow bear looked at Ning. “…as far
back as then, the first master had already left behind this estate,
for the sake of ensuring that his divine abilities would be passed
down. Although Master had six mighty disciples, none of them lived up
to Master’s requirements, and thus they did not acquire that mighty
divine ability.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After leaving down
this estate, Master departed. To whence, I know not.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After his departure,
countless years passed. The War of the Primordial Fiendgods. The
birth of the three thousand major worlds and the trillions of minor
worlds…” The giant yellow bear looked towards Ning. “It was
only due to luck and fate that this estate ended up in this world,
one of the major worlds.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
said solemnly, “I can tell you this. Given your power, you would at
most be able to acquire the third divine ability. As for Master’s
divine ability, the chances of you acquiring it are less than one in
ten thousand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had guessed long ago
that the first owner of the aquatic estate had an extraordinary
history to him; he even had left quite a few ‘Pure Yang’ magic
treasures in the Treasure Hall, which were above Immortal-ranked
magic treasures in power. From this alone, one could tell how
powerful the first master had been…but now, it seemed, this person
was most likely an incredibly powerful figure of the Three Realms.
The giant yellow bear’s words were correct. There was only one
chance to challenge the Divine Abilities Hall…and only a single
chance to acquire such a powerful divine ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
said, “If you miss this opportunity…you will most likely have to
wait until you become a Celestial Immortal before you will have the
chance to encounter such a powerful figure and gain another
opportunity.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hesitated
slightly, then asked, “Senior, dare I ask, what sort of divine
ability do I need to acquire in order to kill a middle-stage Wanxiang
Adept?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Any of the top three
will suffice.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
said, “If you are able to acquire the most powerful divine ability
which Master left behind, then given how you already have the power
of an ordinary late-stage Zifu Disciple Fiendgod, you can use that
powerful divine ability to annihilate a middle-stage Wanxiang Adept
with a single technique. However, you don’t even have a
one-in-ten-thousand chance to acquire that divine ability, at your
current level of power. Are you still going to make the attempt? This
is your one and only chance to challenge the hall.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will.” Ning
didn’t hesitate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Perhaps, after five
years, he would be able to acquire that powerful divine ability,
resulting in his future accomplishments being so great that he would
be able to dominate the Three Realms, and even find his reincarnated
parents and restore their previous memories to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even after his
reincarnated parents received their memories back, would ‘they’
still truly be ‘themselves’?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once they were gone,
they would be truly gone!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if I’m not
able to acquire that powerful divine ability, I, Ji Ning, can still
dominate the Three Realms in the future. I am still planning on
meeting with Judge Cui once more.” Ning’s eyes were filled with
boundless determination. “What’s more…who says I won’t be
able to acquire that powerful divine ability? The chance might be
less than one in ten thousand, but that’s still better than zero!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas! Once you miss
this chance, it will be forever gone!” The giant yellow bear shook
its head, then disappeared into the void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was left there by
himself, with the empty, gray void.
</P>

Chapter 29 - Strongman
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This gray, blurry space
had nothing within it, but as Ji Ning stepped on and walked through
the gray, misty space, it was as though he was stepping on solid
ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is the test of
the Divine Abilities Hall?” Ning swept his gaze across the area.
Suddenly, with a ‘whoosh’ sound, an enormous, pitch-black tablet
landed on the ground before him, covered with a dense cluster of more
than a hundred Fiendgod characters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Use your strength as
a Fiendgod! Choose freely from the weapons next to you. Go forth and
battle! Divine abilities are consummate skills meant for slaughter.
The more strongmen you kill, the more powerful a divine ability you
will require. If you kill too few, you might not even receive the
seventh divine ability. The seven great divine abilities…they are
right there. Kill as wildly as you can. In the instant when you
collapse and your body is smashed, the test of the Divine Abilities
Hall will conclude.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He looked at the
Fiendgod characters carved atop the giant tablet. Not too far away
from the pitch-black tablet, an enormous table suddenly appeared,
covered with a large number of weapons. There were hundreds of
swords, hundreds of sabers, hundreds of spears, staffs…countless
weapons lay densely clustered atop the table.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So I really can
choose as I please.” Ning was surprised by the number of weapons
that had appeared. He didn’t dare hesitate at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! He
hurriedly picked up two longswords that were comparable to his
Darknorth swords.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning
hesitated slightly. “Just using swordplay and the Rainwater Sword
Domain won’t use up too much of my concentration.” Instantly, a
large number of small, thin longswords flew up from the table. In
total, nine flying swords flew out. The giant yellow bear had only
said that for this trial, the participant was not permitted to use
any Ki Refiner techniques. As for his divine will…this was the
divine will that he had gained through possessing an incredibly
powerful soul. Naturally, it couldn’t be considered a Ki Refiner
technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I use my divine
will to control these nine swords, although the power will be a bit
weak, it will still serve in supporting me.” Ning mused to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This battle…he had to
exert all of his strength within it, so as to acquire a more powerful
divine ability. If he only received the sixth or seventh divine
ability, even with it, he still probably would find it difficult to
kill Adept Xu. The worst part of it was, neither the giant yellow
bear nor the pitch-black tablet had informed him as to how many he
had to kill to acquire the third divine ability or first divine
ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immediately after Ning
selected his swords, the gray mist in the void around him rapidly
began to condense, forming one human-shaped figure after another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is!” Ning’s
heart clenched. These human-shaped figures were all extremely
muscular. They each had three savage eyes in their heads, and their
entire bodies were virtually completely naked. The only thing they
wore was something akin to a loincloth at their waists. All of their
bodies bunched with muscles, and they held various weapons in their
hands, such as axes, staffs, and warhammers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their breaths rang out
like thunder, and their steps caused the earth to shake. Their bodies
were filled with a sky-shaking, savage aura. And in an instant, the
area around Ning became completely filled with hundreds of these
human-shaped freaks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are the
‘strongmen’ which the tablet spoke of?” Ning was startled. He
had seen many books, and according to some of the legends recorded in
the books, some of the great powers had ‘strongmen’ under their
command. The so-called ‘strongmen’ were used to work as coolies
to do physical labor. There were many different kinds of them, such
as gateguard strongmen, cauldron-bearing strongmen, mountain-guarding
strongmen, or even mountain-bearing strongmen and seastriding
strongmen…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had different
missions, different names, and naturally different levels of power as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Strongmen, according to
the legends, generally weren’t living creatures. They were servants
with simple intelligences that were created by some of the great
powers. But of course, there were some powerful experts who would
serve some of the great powers, and willingly take on the title of
‘strongman’; this occurred as well. However, ordinary and
extremely numerous strongmen such as these weren’t actual living
creatures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” “Kill!”
The hundreds of savage, weapon-bearing strongmen rushed forward like
the wind, charging towards Ning while running across the foggy
‘ground’. They roared the Fiendgod word for ‘kill’, and their
savage triple eyes were locked on Ning. They moved so quickly that in
the blink of an eye, they arrived next to Ning, who was three hundred
meters away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” Rainwater
slowly began to fall, encompassing an area of hundreds of square
meters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rainwater instantly
became as sharp as knives. Instantly, it was as though thousands of
knives fell down and chopped towards those strongmen. The rainwater,
carrying the profoundness of the Dao within them, contained
astonishing power. The strongmen all let out savage howls, but were
chopped into pieces, and then transformed into fog which once more
dissipated into the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From far away, many
strongmen continued to materialize, in even greater numbers than
before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” Ning didn’t
hesitate at all. Controlling his rainwater, he began to attack those
strongmen. The Rainwater Sword Domain was a Dao Domain, and was based
off the insights he had gained into the Dao. As for the rainwater, it
was formed from the energy of the world itself. These, too, could not
be considered Ki Refiner techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s face
changed slightly. “The strongmen are growing more powerful and
becoming faster. Their bodies are growing sturdy as well. Even their
axe and hammer techniques are increasing in power.” It was clearly
becoming a bit harder for him to kill them through his Rainwater
Sword Domain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This region of dreary
gray space was producing strongmen nonstop. Ning, by relying on his
Rainwater Sword Domain, was able to massacre them on a large scale,
and so he was able to kill them quite quickly. In just the amount of
time needed for five breaths, Ning was able to execute more than ten
rounds of thousands of strongmen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Slashslashslash…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rainwater continued
to chop down, leaving scars on the muscular bodies of the strongmen,
but were unable to kill them now. “It’s no longer enough to rely
on the Rainwater Sword Domain.” A fierce light flashed through
Ning’s eyes. First, he condensed the nearby rainwater into
swiveling petals of Waterflame Lotuses, and using this enormous
petals of fire and water, he began to wildly crush and grind down the
strongmen. The strongmen relied on their weapons to block and to
dodge, but in the end, some still perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Nine sword flashed pierced through the skies. These were the nine
swords which Ning controlled through his divine will. Under Ning’s
control, they all unleashed Ning’s most powerful sword attack…Rain
Line! The reason why Ning had previously selected just nine swords
was because he wanted to unleash his most powerful sword attacks.
Ning’s divine will wasn’t able to control too many of them in
doing so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cutcutcut…” It
was like chopping vegetables. The divine will controlled the swords
at merely the early Zifu Adept stage of power, but under the power of
the Rainwater Sword Domain…the strength of the blows was absolutely
astonishing. Sword light flew everywhere, and many warriors were
chopped into two halves and dissipated into mist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By relying on his
Rainwater Sword Domain, Waterflame Lotuses, and swords controlled by
divine will…Ning was able to slaughter the strongmen at an
astonishing speed. The amount of time Ning had spent after using the
Traceless Talisman to teleport to Serpentwing Lake, then entering the
underwater estate was actually quite low. The only place he spent a
little extra time was in conversation with the giant yellow bear, but
that was far from even being as much time as it took to boil a kettle
of tea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning was engaging in
a wild battle against the strongmen in the Divine Abilities Hall…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Oxhorn Mountain.
Halfway up the mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yichuan. You must be
careful in this mission.” Ji Ninefire looked at Ji Yichuan. “Delay
as much as you can. There are only five of us left, but we need to
try to delay for nearly two days. Although you are ill, delay them as
long as you can.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand.”
Yichuan nodded. He looked at the Whitewater Hound by his side, who
used its head to gently nudge Yichuan, clearly unwilling to part from
him. “Little White.” Yichuan gently stroked the Whitewater
Hound’s head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan’s parents had
died long ago. In his heart, the three who held the most paramount
positions were his wife, his son, and his lifelong brother, ‘Little
White’. The amount of time Little White had been by his side far
surpassed the amount of time his wife and his son had been by his
side. Only Little White had always accompanied him. They had
adventured together…and even though death was in front of them,
neither would retreat in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going now.”
Yichuan lowered his head and gently kissed the Whitewater Hound on
the forehead. The Whitewater Hound’s eyes became moist. As for
Yichuan, he turned his head and charged into a corridor that had just
opened within the nether fog. The Whitewater Hound escorted Yichuan
into the fog…he truly wished to accompany Yichuan, but as soon as
Yichuan used his forbidden techniques, his power would immediately
rise. In addition, with the support of the Netherwyrm Heavenlock
Formation, his power would become truly astonishing. As for the
Whitewater Hound, as he was merely a peak Xiantian spirit-beast, he
would be nothing more than a burden.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew very well that
he would only be a burden. That it would be dangerous. He still
wanted to go…because he knew that his most beloved, important elder
brother, ‘Ji Yichuan’, was probably going to die. How could he
not go?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whitewater Hound.”
Ninefire spoke out. The Whitewater Hound turned to look at Patriarch
Ninefire. “My Ji clan has only five members remaining here; we will
only just be able to maintain the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation.”
Ninefire said. “After Yichuan dies, only four will remain, and the
Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation will no longer be at peak power. I
have here a portion of ‘liquefied elemental essence’ that you can
use to try and make a breakthrough. If you are able to break through
to become a Zifu-level Diremonster, after Yichuan dies, you can take
his place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because none of them
would be able to escape from the grand sealing formation…even if
they died, they had to make their deaths more spectacular.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Woof.” The
Whitewater Hound nodded gently, then opened his mouth and accepted
the jade flask. Originally, Ning had used up a third of the liquefied
elemental essence, breaking through to the Zifu Disciple and
establishing his Zifu as an early-stage Disciple! Ning didn’t waste
the remaining amount of liquefied elemental essence, leaving it
behind for the Patriarch.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound’s
eyes were filled with hope. He wanted to breakthrough and help his
master once again. Help his elder brother. The person he was closest
to in the entire world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The underwater estate.
Outside the Divine Abilities Hall. The old black bull and the giant
yellow bear were present. “Alas!” The giant yellow bear sighed.
“Big Brother, what is it?” The old black bull said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is as I
expected.” The giant yellow bear sighed. “I have waited here for
countless years. This Ji Ning is the only person I have encountered
who truly has a chance at acquiring the divine ability which Master
left behind. His soul is so powerful that he is capable of using his
divine will, and his understanding of the Dao is quite deep as well,
at the Dao Domain realm. By relying on his Rainwater Sword Domain and
using divine will…he has been slaughtering and massacring countless
strongmen. But now that the strongmen are growing more and more
powerful, he is finding it more and more difficult. Even though he
himself is also using two swords to battle, he still finds it quite
difficult.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If he were to wait
five more years…his [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]
would probably reach the eighth or ninth stage. Given how quickly he
gains insight into the Dao, in five years, he will have made
astonishing improvements in this regard as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His divine body will
be stronger, and his insights into the Dao greater. By then, he
absolutely would be capable of acquiring the divine ability which
Master left behind. What a pity, what a pity.” The giant yellow
bear sighed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then he…?” The
old black bull said, worried. “His killing speed is quite fast. In
the time it takes to brew tea, he killed tens of thousands of
strongmen. But I can tell from his strength that it would be hard for
him to obtain even the third divine ability.” The giant yellow bear
shook his head. “As for the first divine ability, that’s
unfathomably far away. What a pity, what a pity. If he waited five
more years…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes…but he wasn’t
willing to wait five more years.” The old black bull sighed as
well.

Chapter 30 - Whitewater Hound Transforms
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One strongman after
another continued to condense from within the gray, misty void. These
strongmen were all incomparably savage and fearless. Wielding their
warhammers, spears, axes, and other weapons, they charged forth,
bellowing that ancient Fiengod word for ‘kill’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rain fell down like
sheets of curtains. One layer of watery walls swirled through these
strongmen. The ‘rainwater’ of the Rainwater Sword Domain was no
longer capable of killing these strongmen. All Ji Ning could do with
it was to use the rainwater to slow them down as much as possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Slash!” “Chop!”
“Pierce!” Nine sword flashes danced in the skies. Some strongmen
died after their heads were pierced through. Others died through
bisection. Still others died through decapitation…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die, all of you.”
Ning wielded two swords in his hands, executing his divine ability,
‘Windwing Evasion’, while on his back, a pair of wings created
from the Crimsonbright divine power had manifested. This was the true
face of the Windwing Evasion! Originally, the Yuchi clan had wanted
to hide the fact that their clan had a divine ability, and so they
had ordered their descendants to always use wing-type magic treasures
when executing the technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How could a true divine
ability require the supporting help of a magic treasure?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swoosh!” Ning
moved as fast a ghost, curving through the masses in a solitary line,
and wherever he passed, the two swords in his hands accompanied him,
transforming into two arcing sword flashes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash! Two rows of
strongmen were instantly chopped into two pieces. They died, and then
dissipated into mist once more. “Kill.” Ning swept out with his
swords, and wherever he struck, strongmen fell and perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Difficult. Starting
to grow difficult.” A hint of worry had appeared on Ji Ning’s
face. “The Rainwater Sword Domain and the Waterflame Lotuses are
now unable to kill them. I have to rely on the nine swords that I am
controlling through my divine will, and every single sword is only
able to kill one of them at once.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the very beginning,
those nine swords controlled through divine sense were able to sweep
through many strongmen at once. But now, clearly, every single sword
had to focus on a single strongman. Only the two swords he personally
wielded were capable of killing a row of enemies at once!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Strongmen continued to
die, but the gray, misty void continued to constantly generated even
more strongmen. The newly born strongmen had even more savage auras,
and wielded even greater might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chop! Chop! Chop! The
nine flying swords left behind wounds on the bellowing strongmen, but
they continued to charge towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s finally come
to this. This moment has finally come. These newly born strongmen can
no longer be killed by the swords controlled through divine will
alone.” Ning gritted his teeth, transforming himself into a streak
of light repeatedly, and his the swords in his hands howled out,
chopping through swathes of strongmen. Only the sharp swords he
personally wielded were able to kill these strongmen now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all, the power of
the swords he controlled through divine will was merely at the early
Zifu stage. But Ning’s physical strength as a Fiendgod refiner was
at the late Zifu level…he was two levels higher than he should have
been at, thanks to the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens],
and so it was only natural that the two sharp swords he personally
wielded would be more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.” Ning
continued to kill with all his strength…and the giant yellow bear,
outside of the Divine Abilities Hall, could see exactly what was
going on within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are his last
death-struggles.” The giant yellow bear sighed. “Ji Ning is about
to admit defeat.” “Admit defeat?” The old black bull asked.
“Will he be able to receive the third divine ability?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
shook his head. “He’s still a bit off. His current Rainwater
Sword Domain and his divine will are now completely useless. He can
only rely on the two swords in his hands to kill. His sword technique
is exceptional, especially given the fact that his dual swords are
able to reinforce each other…and thus, he will be able to hold on
for a bit longer. However, it will be quite difficult and hard to say
if he will successfully acquire the third divine ability.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alas.” The old
black bull was resigned as well. “Soon. He will come out soon.”
The giant yellow bear shook his head. “What a pity. He truly did
have a chance at acquiring Master’s divine ability.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Oxhorn Mountain.
Halfway up the mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ninefire could sense
everything which was going on within the grand formation. He was
currently focused on two things; the first was Ji Yichuan’s sneak
attacks on the forces of Snowdragon Mountain, and the other was the
Whitewater Hound’s breakthrough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yichuan truly is
wise.” Ninefire’s eyes held amusement within them, but there was
a hint of grief hidden within the laughter. “His natural talent is
far greater than Truekeep’s. In the past, when he went to roam the
Darknorth Seas, he was already at the middle Zifu stage. If he hadn’t
suffered that disaster on the way back, he probably would be close to
the peak Zifu stage by now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If it hadn’t been for
a monster like Ji Ning appearing, Yichuan would have definitely been
acknowledged as the number one genius of the Ji clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This battle will be
the final battle of Yichuan’s life.” Ninefire watched, watched
Yichuan’s final, most glorious moment. But suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A powerful, mysterious
aura appeared nearby him, but soon, that aura then dissipated. “The
Whitewater Hound!” A look of surprised joy appeared in Ninefire’s
eyes. “He made a breakthrough? He made it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
was a Godbeast that was legendary for its intelligence. Yichuan had
mentioned before to Ninefire that this brother of his, the Whitewater
Hound, was an extremely high level of comprehension, and had
surpassed the Zifu level in that regard long ago. Only, as a
Godbeast, the amount of energy that he needed to accumulate to break
through was significant. Thus, Ninefire had given the jade bottle to
the Whitewater Hound on a gamble. Who would’ve thought that he’d
truly succeed?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Coming.” Ninefire
turned his head to look. A white-robed man walked over. This man had
a head of long, snowy white hair that fell to his waist. His face was
strikingly similar to Yichuan’s, but his eyes held a hint of
kindness within them…if Yichuan was described as a glacier that had
been existing for ten thousand years, then this man was like the
spring wind that brought a sense of warmth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whitewater Hound?”
Ninefire looked at the white-robed man, calling out in surprise.
Naturally, he knew that this man in front of him was the human
transformation of the Godbeast ‘Whitewater Hound’. Only, he was
surprised at the Whitewater Hound’s appearance. It must be
understood that one’s appearance stemmed from one’s heart; the
appearance which some Diremonsters took on after transforming wasn’t
based purely on their own choice. Their appearance after transforming
wasn’t up to their control.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everything was
determined by their heart! Some monsters, in human form, would appear
cold and sinister. Some would appear tyrannous and overbearing.
Others would look ugly and crooked, while still others would be
devilish and enchanting…everything was determined by their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His appearance is
striking similar to Yichuan’s; those who didn’t know him might
take him to be Yichuan’s sibling. From this, one can tell how
important Yichuan is to him.” Ninefire murmured to himself. “In
addition, there isn’t a hint of the foul, evil aura which usually
emanates from foreheads of monsters. The opposite; he gives off a
calm aura…he makes others feel as though they were facing the moist
spring wind. It seems the Dao-heart of this Whitewater Hound is
extraordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This type of Godbeast,
the Whitewater Hound, was legendary for its wisdom, and was very
kind-hearted. According to legend, they had a hint of the bloodline
of the primordial Fiendgod, ‘Whitemarsh’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Godbeasts generally had
their own unique innate divine abilities. For example, the Azure
Skysnake was capable of the Void Blink technique. As for the
Whitewater Hound…although it didn’t have any special innate
abilities, its innate characteristics was its wisdom and kindness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch.” The
Whitewater Hound looked at Ninefire. “Whitewater Hound.” Ninefire
said. “Everyone says that Whitewater Hounds are incomparably wise.
Our Ji clan currently faces a great disaster; do you have anything
you can do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although this type of
Godbeast, Whitewater Hounds, were extremely common, very few were
able to break through to the Zifu level. This was the first which
Ninefire had ever seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Upon being locked
within this grand sealing formation, what could I possibly do?” The
Whitewater Hound gently shook his head. “The only choice is to
fight!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire then asked,
“What are you skilled in?” “I like to analyze formations.”
The Whitewater Hound said softly. “Elder Brother Yichuan, in the
past, helped me collect some books on formations. Elder Sister Snow
also gifted me with some books on formations. I normally focus on
analyzing formations, and have gained significant insights into
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire was a bit
disappointed. Formation? The Ji clan had established the Netherwyrm
Heavenlock Formation; even if the Whitewater Hound was skilled in
formations, what use would it be?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I also have some
unranked formation flags which I used in the past when developing
formations.” The Whitewater Hound said. “By using these formation
flags and setting them up around Snowdragon Mountain’s forces, I
should be able to make the local elemental pulses and ley lines more
complicated, making it harder for Nong Zidao to analyze and break
through them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What!” Ninefire
was shocked. “You…you are able to…” Ninefire was completely
stunned. An amateur might not understand what the Whitewater Hound’s
words meant, but Ninefire was a formations expert as well. It must be
understood that different formations had different ways of activating
the energy of the world; there were different levels and methods. For
example, although the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation and the
bewildering black fog illusion formation were able to link together,
when it came to time spent analyzing, the black bewildering fog
formation wasn’t able to do anything to Nong Zidao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two formations had
different mechanisms for using the power of the world. Naturally,
they wouldn’t be able to impact each other. To impact each
other…that meant one formation had to be able to guide the natural
energy of the world in a way which was very similar to the nether
fog’s, to the point of becoming one. The difficulty of doing this
was no less than breaking the nether fog formation itself!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You?” Ninefire
stared at the Whitewater Hound, stunned, then said with absolute
excitement, “If you are able to do this, that will make the nether
fog even more difficult to break. Perhaps we’ll be able to delay
for two days.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound’s
gaze turned distant. “Given the speed by which Nong Zidao defeated
the nether energy surrounding the Dragonclaw Formation…even with my
influence, we will be lucky if we are able to delay by two days.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have some
additional formation flags here. Would you need them?” Ninefire
hurriedly said. “I’m only using them to affect the local
elemental energy ley lines, not to engage in battle. These unranked
formation flags are sufficient.” The Whitewater Hound said. “In
addition, I’ve spent a long period of time practicing with these
unranked formation flags. I am very familiar with them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine. Hurry and go.”
Ninefire said excitedly. The Whitewater Hound, in the shape of a man,
walked towards a corridor that had appeared within the nether fog,
and then his body turned into a mist which reformed into the
Godbeast, Whitewater Hound. Generally speaking, monsters were more
accustomed to their own, original form.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Formidable,
formidable.” Excitement was in Ninefire’s eyes. “Everyone says
that Whitewater Hounds are Godbeasts legendary for their fame. Who
would have imagined that they could reach such heights in analyzing
formations as well…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little White!”
Yichuan was holding a Dao-seal in his hand, but he stared,
astonished, as a snowy white hound appeared by his side. This snowy
white hound quickly transformed into a white-robed, white-haired man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You broke through?”
Yichuan was both surprised and delighted. He stared at the man who
appeared so similar to him, and yet who had a softer, gentler aura.
Yichuan felt a sense of closeness from deep in his heart…because
this was his brother, his lifelong friend.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
looked at Yichuan, a hint of moisture in his eyes. “This will be
the last battle that I shall undergo with you, Elder Brother. In this
battle, we shall fight side by side.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Yichuan
slung his arm around the Whitewater Hound’s shoulders, unable to
keep the tears from coming out of his eyes as well. “Let’s fight,
shoulder to shoulder.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
laughed. To battle to the death alongside his elder brother, one last
time…it was enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the underwater
estate’s Divine Abilities Hall. Within that gray, blurry void.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blood spray outwards.
In this place, only Ji Ning would shed blood; these strongmen, upon
being killed, would transform into mist. “Argh.” Ning clenched
his two swords, continuing to fight with all his strength. They
blocked a warhammer blow from a strongman, and then struck forward,
piercing through the fat strongman’s skull. The hammer-wielding,
battle-armored fat strongman dispersed into mist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill! Kill!”
Ning’s eyes were filled with flame, the flame of stubbornness. But
strongmen began to cluster tightly around him, each of them no weaker
than Dong Ziqi in power. Ning was now only able to kill one strongman
at a time, and as they continuously charged forward, clustering
attacks against him, Ning was about to be crushed beneath their tide…
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 31 - Opening the Celestial Eye, Manifesting the Divine Sense
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blood splattered
everywhere. Waterflame Lotuses continued to swivel in the area around
Ji Ning, and Ning himself continued to stand firm and kill. “I have
to acquire one of the top three divine abilities.” Ning remembered
what the spirit of the estate had said; he would at most be able to
acquire the third divine ability. No matter how powerful that giant
yellow bear, the spirit of the manor, was, he would only be able to
give a vague prediction. He didn’t dare say for certain if Ning
would acquire the third divine ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What did this mean?
Even if Ning went all out, it was hard to say if he would acquire it.
If that was the case, then of course Ning would have to go all out!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.” Ning’s
mind was filled with the clear images of the old, cunning Ji
Ninefire; of Granny Shadow, who had threatened suicide to force him
away; of Ah Xing, the devoted old servant of Granny Shadow; of the
heroic, steadfast Truekeep; and of course, of his glacial-face,
warm-hearted father, Ji Yichuan. And Uncle White, who had doted on
him ever since he was young…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want you to all
live! Father, Uncle White, Patriarch. You all must live.” Ning
stared at the strongmen charging towards him, and in his mind, there
was only a single word - kill! Kill! Kill all who barred his way!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had those he wished
to protect! Those he valued! Nobody could take them away!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nine swords
controlled by divine will assisted Ning, helping him block nearby
attacks. Those nine swords supported him, but the flood of strongmen
continued to roar furiously as they threw themselves towards the
encircled Ning. Ning’s struggling efforts grew weaker and weaker,
but his gaze was filled with ever-greater berserk fury and steadfast
resolve.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew what he needed
to do. He knew his own heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within his soul, there
was a colossal explosion, a sound akin to Pangu splitting open the
heavens and establishing the universe. Ning’s divine will, which
had originally been those nine flying swords…could now sense with
incomparable clarity the location of every single strongman around
him. He could even clearly sense every single bit of skin, flesh, and
hair on their bodies. That distant, pitch-black tablet nearby. Those
giant tables, filled with large amounts of weapons. It was all within
his range of sense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was as though…Ning
had gained an additional eye, an eye which could clearly see
everything around him, letting nothing escape!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Divine sense!”
Ning instantly understood. His divine will had already evolved to a
new, higher level. Zifu Disciples were generally all capable of
dividing their minds, and Wanxiang Adepts were mostly capable of
manifesting their divine will to control material items. Only Primal
Daoists were capable of opening the Celestial Eye and manifest their
divine sense. Everything within the range of one’s divine sense
would be revealed, as though seen clearly with the naked eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was extremely hard
to progress in the soul, but in the path of Immortals, the soul was
incomparably important. Only a sufficiently powerful soul would be
able to command ever-greater amounts of elemental energy. If an
ordinary mortal was in possession of the elemental energy of an
Immortal, there was only one possible outcome; he wouldn’t be able
to tame the elemental energy, which would wildly burst forth and
shatter his bones and his flesh, slaying him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Advancing in the soul
was something which could be done through visualization techniques,
through gaining comprehension into the Dao, through strengthening the
body to support the soul, or through training one’s will.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Training the
will…another phrase for it might be training one’s Dao-heart!
Ning had already reached the ‘divine will’ level when he was
eleven. In the past five years, Ning had made astonishing amounts of
progress with regards to comprehending the Dao, eventually reaching
the Dao Domain level. Clearly, this had all been very beneficial to
his soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His body had just
reached the Blood-Drop Rebirth level as a Fiendgod refiner, allowing
him to once more strengthen the body to support the soul. And, in the
past five years, he had visualized the [Nuwa Painting] every single
day, allowing him to rise in power ceaselessly. And today…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had first battled
at Oxhorn Mountain, then witnessed his clansmen decide to fight to
the death, and had even chosen to flee alone, then undergo the Divine
Abilities Hall’s trial in the hopes of acquiring one of the top
three divine abilities. Everything he had experienced today…it had
all tested and forged his will. In utter despair, his will had grown
only stronger. And his Dao-heart had become even more perfectly pure
and durable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Dao-heart and the
will…to the soul, they were like the commanders of an army! The
same soldiers, if led by strict military discipline, would only rise
in battle-strength considerably. But if the military leadership was
poor, they would be much less effective.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The same was true for
the Dao-heart and the will. A soul, when determined, would allow the
Immortal practitioner to unleash great power. Even if one’s base of
elemental ki energy was extremely deep, one would still need to use
will in order to forcibly summon and activate that power. When one’s
will was weak, however, the excessively formidable amount of
elemental energy would be rendered unusable, and perhaps even some
simple bewitching illusions would cause one to perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, to Immortal
practitioners, training one’s Dao-heart was extremely important.
The more perfect and pure one’s Dao-heart was, the farther one
would be able to travel on the Immortal path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Five years of
comprehending the Dao. Five years of visualization. My increase in
power as a Fiendgod refiner. All of these things established a firm,
solid base for me. Today, my Dao-heart has been further tempered,
allowing me to break through at one blow, to open my Celestial Eye
and establish my divine sense.” A vertical-pupiled eye suddenly
appeared in the middle of Ning’s forehead. This vertical-pupiled
eye was the corridor to the ‘soul’ in Ning’s consciousness; it
was as though Ning’s soul was staring towards the outside world
through this eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Celestial
Eye’s range of vision, Ning could instantly tell how these
strongmen had been condensed from the fog and energy. “Close.”
The eye in the middle of Ning’s forehead closed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon the Celestial Eye
opening, even some of the high level transformations which various
monsters and devils were capable of unleashing would be easily seen
through. In addition, the divine sense covered an extremely wide
region, and could see everything within it with perfect clarity. Even
in the middle of a bewildering formation, the divine sense could
sense everything clearly, preventing it from bewitching Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ordinary formations,
especially bewildering formations, were generally of limited use
against Immortal practitioners who were capable of using divine
sense. But of course, there were some powerful formations capable of
bewildering even the divine sense, but the vast majority of Wanxiang
Adepts didn’t have access to those sorts of grand formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoosh!” The nine
swords, controlled by divine will, suddenly increased in power
tremendously. Nine rays of sword light howled as they flashed through
the air, chopping one row after another of strongmen into two pieces.
All of their heads went flying, their bodies shattering and
dissolving into the mist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill, kill kill.”
A look of delight appeared on Ning’s face. “All of you, come over
here.” Ning stared towards the table in front of him, which was
covered with many weapons. One sword after another rose into the air,
and a dense cluster of nearly a hundred flying swords flew towards
him, all of them transforming into flowing, liquid streams of sword
light. With each blow, they slaughtered a heap of strongmen, and many
strongmen constantly collapsed, dispersing into mist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nearly a hundred
swords, transformed into nearly a hundred rays of sword light, danced
around Ning. As for Ning himself, he stood there, not needing to
fight personally any longer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My divine will is
now too powerful.” Ning was completely stunned and overjoyed. His
divine will had undergone a qualitative change, and its range had
been expanded to as far as he could see with the naked eye. As for
the power of his divine will to control material objects, it had
risen by a terrifying amount! Previously, when his divine will had
controlled those swords, it had done so with the power of an
early-stage Zifu-level Fiendgod. But now, the evolved divine will
contained the power of a peak-stage Zifu-level Fiendgod!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of his divine
will was now even greater than Ning’s own physical power as a
Fiendgod! Such a terrifying strength…when amplified by the
Rainwater Sword Domain, even when just using some simple sword
techniques rather than the ‘Rain Line’ technique, each blow swept
through a crowd of enemies. In addition, the controlled swords didn’t
need to worry about defense, and thus were able to display sword
techniques in an even fiercer, more vicious manner. Their power would
naturally be tremendous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Groups after groups of
strongmen collapsed. Under the dominating, sweeping prowess of those
hundred swords, the strongmen died at an astonishing rate. “My
divine will is now even more powerful than I am in close-quarters
combat.” Ning murmured to himself. His soul had advanced far, far
more than he had as a Fiendgod Body Refiner or as a Ki Refiner. His
soul was already at the level of ‘Opening the Celestial Eye,
Manifesting the Divine Sense’, a level which only Primal Daoists
should be able to reach.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every sweeping blow of
the controlled swords contained greater power than Ning’s earlier,
personal blows. These hundred swords were like a hundred amplified
Ning’s, dominating the region. Groups of strongmen continuously
collapsed, and as the rate at which they died quickened, the rate at
which they were reformed quickened slightly as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">New strongmen
continuously were condensed from the mist. Kill, kill, kill! The
hundred flashing sword lights struck out like roaring dragons,
bellowing through the air. However, the strongmen were growing
increasingly powerful as well. The killing rate dropped from a group
per blow, to five or six per blow, to two or three per blow, all the
way down to one per blow. However, because the hundred swords were
fighting in unision, they were still extremely efficient.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked around
himself. It was completely silent. There was no motion or sound, only
those hundred flying swords that were hovering in the air. “No
more?” Ning was stunned. “It’s empty?” Ning stared at his
surroundings. The only thing present was that pitch-black tablet. The
many weapons lay soundlessly on their table. It was as though this
world was telling Ning…that he had killed all of the strongmen!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. A figure
appeared by his side. It was the giant yellow bear, who stared at
Ning, surprise in his eyes. “Are you the reincarnation of a
Celestial Immortal?” The giant yellow bear murmured. “Or the
reincarnation of a Primordial Fiendgod?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Giving how
astonishingly keen Ning’s hearing was, he naturally heard the
murmured words of the giant yellow bear. Reincarnation of a Celestial
Immortal? Reincarnation of a Primordial Fiendgod? Others might not
know about their past lives, but Ning knew it with perfect clarity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Simply by relying on
comprehending the Dao, tempering your Dao-heart, and training your
Fiendgod body…it is virtually impossible for you to raise your soul
to the level of gaining ‘divine sense’.” The giant yellow bear
looked at Ning. “Immortal practitioners generally need to first
reach the Primal Daoist level. With the soul being nurtured within
primal energy, it will grow and develop, eventually opening the
Celestial Eye and establishing the divine sense.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First, become a
Primal Daoist; then, acquire divine sense. This is the case for
virtually everyone! Less than one in ten thousand Wanxiang Adepts
would be able to acquire divine sense.” The giant yellow bear shook
his head. “Generally speaking, those who are capable of acquiring
divine sense prior to the Primal Daoist level are in actuality
Immortals and other great powers who reincarnated. Or, of course,
those who encountered a tremendously good twist of fate. Can it be
that you are a reincarnated Immortal? But if you truly were a
reincarnated Immortal, there should have been elders of your school
who came to welcome you long ago. Or…can it be that you encountered
another fortunate twist of fate, even before you entered the
underwater estate?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just blinked, not
saying anything. Twist of fate? Would encountering the Lord of Cui
Palace of the Netherworld Kingdom, and being bestowed with the
visualization technique, [Nuwa Painting] count? Would the fact that,
by luck, he managed to avoid drinking Grandma Meng’s soup before
being reincarnated and thus was able to train in the [Nuwa Painting]
visualization technique as an infant count?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder, which divine
ability can I acquire?” Ning hurriedly asked. “You killed all of
the strongmen. Naturally, you can acquire the first.” The giant
yellow bear blinked. “Follow me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He grabbed Ning with
his paw. Whoosh! The surrounding region of gray mist began to tremble
and distort. Ning even had the strange feeling that time was passing
extremely slowly, then extremely quickly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How much time
passed?” Ning was rather nervous. He was afraid that if too much
time passed, unforeseen variables would occur at Oxhorn Mountain.
“Don’t worry. No need to be concerned over how long this process
of receiving the divine ability will take.” The giant yellow bear
said. “In the past, the manifestation and the divine ability which
Master left behind was placed in an area completely sealed off from
space and time. Thus, by comparison to the outside world, time here
was virtually frozen. You could spend a century here, but only a
single breath’s worth of time would occur in the outside world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
shocked, but he quickly calmed himself. When he had been in the
Netherworld Kingdom, the regions near the Bridge of Despair moved at
extremely different rates of time. Clearly, some of the great powers
in the Three Realms were capable of changing the flow of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder what sort
of divine ability the first master of the estate left behind.” Ning
secretly mused to himself.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 32 - Receiving the Divine Ability
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were surrounded by
fog. Ji Ning and the giant yellow bear stood above the fog, and the
previously contorting space and time had calmed down. “That is…!”
Ning stared towards the front. Far away, in the distant corners of
that boundless gray fog, there was a towering building that flashed
with eye-catching golden light. It was like an altar. From the
distance, one could see that it had layers of stairs, which led
towards the very top of this building.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why are you standing
here like an idiot?” The giant yellow bear grabbed Ning by the
elbow, then walked forward, traveling multiple kilometers with every
single step. The distant, towering edifice became clearer and
clearer, and its golden light became more and more dazzling. At the
same time, the boundless majesty it emanated caused Ning’s heart to
tremble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later, Ning
arrived at the very lowest step of this towering edifice. Raising his
head, he stared upwards at the various steps. He could immediately
tell that there were most likely thousands of steps, from the ground
to the peak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” The giant
yellow bear raised his head, looking towards the peak of the altar as
well. “Follow the steps to the very top, and accept the divine
ability which Master left behind.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
This was his stroke of good fortune! An incomparably precious stroke
of good fortune! This divine ability had been left behind by one of
the great powers of the Three Realms which had been created after
Pangu established the universe! After learning it, he would be able
to kill Adept Xu Li and save his father and family members.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father. Wait for
your child a few moments longer.” Ning immediately began to run up
the steps. But as soon as he stepped atop the first one….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG! It was as though
the world had collapsed. Ning sensed his entire soul tremble and
rumble. At the instant when Ning’s right foot landed on the first
stair, it was as though he had been fused with the entire altar, and
ancient, long-gone information began to transmit directly into Ning’s
soul, burrowing into his memories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The transmission had
begun! Ning hadn’t expected that he would begin to receive the
transmission of the divine ability upon stepping onto the very first
step…although he was caught somewhat off-guard, Ning quickly began
to submerge himself in understanding the ancient information that was
being sent towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After a few moments,
Ning stepped onto the second stair, and more of that ancient
information flooded towards him. One step, another step, yet another
step…this ancient, profound information slowly entered Ning’s
soul, having been divided into countless little bits and pieces, so
as to allow Ning to adapt to this process. As this was a truly,
incredibly powerful divine ability, if all the information regarding
it had been instantly sent into Ning’s soul, even though Ning’s
soul was powerful, he would’ve instantly been rendered an idiot.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It has begun.”
From the below the altar, the giant yellow bear lifted his head,
watching as Ning took one step after another atop the altar. His eyes
held a very complicated look within them; excitement, anticipation,
and wistfulness. “The divine ability which Master left behind has
finally found an heir.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master…are you
still alive?” A hint of tears appeared within the giant yellow
bear’s eyes. In his heart, he only had a single, true master. That
was the first master of the estate. The four masters who had come
afterwards, including Ji Ning, were in reality the heirs to the first
master, but unfortunately, the second, third, and fourth masters
hadn’t been able to acquire so much as a single one of the divine
abilities. Naturally, they couldn’t be considered true successors.
But now, Ji Ning was finally beginning to receive this divine
ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master’s
successor.” The giant yellow bear’s had a lost look in his eyes,
and his thoughts were whirling about. When the first master had left
behind this estate then left, the giant yellow bear had known…that
the first master had gone to deal with a tremendous tribulation.
Precisely because even the first master wasn’t absolutely confident
in his ability to survive the tribulation, he had created this
estate, as he was unwilling to permit the divine ability he was
proudest of to simply disappear with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless years had
passed…the Three Realms had become fixed and orderly. The three
thousand major worlds and the trillions of minor worlds had been
born. But his master had never returned to this estate. This filled
the giant yellow bear’s heart with unease. Was his master still
alive? Although he worried about his master in his heart, he
continued to obey his master’s order, and treated finding a
successor as the most important matter of all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One step. Then another
step. Atop the towering, lofty edifice, Ning continued to slowly
advance upwards. He didn’t know how much time had passed, but
finally, he had reached the top.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did Ning
awaken from his trance. The primordial, ancient divine ability’s
information as well as tricks and knacks had all been infused into
his soul. They were like words that had been printed atop his soul
itself; even if Ning wanted to forget them, he wouldn’t be able to.
And even if someone used a technique to search his soul, they
wouldn’t be able to find anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The divine
ability…[Starseizer Hand].” Ning murmured gently to himself. He
could clearly see one image after another in his mind. There was a
vast, boundless void, and within it, there was a giant hand that
seemed to be countless kilometers in length. The giant hand passed
through the endless void, actually snatching at one of the stars
within the void and easily crushing it into dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Under the strikes of
that infinitely large hand, the vast, towering bodies of a countless
sea of Fiendgods who were shouting boastfully were all smashed into
nothingness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That giant hand cupped
a world within it, and trapped within the world was a fiery Fiendgod
who radiated flames. With a gentle pinch of the giant hand, the world
was shattered and the Fiendgod perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Beyond the Three
Realms, there is the infinite void. The void contains the Solar Star
and the Lunar Star, the two most exalted of celestial bodies, as well
as numerous other powerful stars. These stars are infinitely majestic
and powerful, and even Celestial Immortals would find it difficult to
do anything to them. Some of the bits and pieces of rubble which fall
down from these stars, after passing through the endless, infinite
void, might land on various worlds, where they will be treated as
precious materials for forging magic treasures. And yet, my master’s
divine ability is named the ‘Starseizer’; from this, one can
imagine how infinitely powerful it is.” The giant yellow bear
appeared by Ning’s side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded lightly.
After having received this divine ability, he could clearly sense how
terrifyingly powerful it was. It’s power completely surpassed his
imagination. Ning understood, now, why the giant yellow bear had
wanted for him to wait five years…why he had felt that it would be
better to let Ning’s father and family die, rather than lose the
chance to acquire this divine ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, what was meant
to be would be. Although Ning had stubbornly insisted on immediately
challenging the Divine Abilities Hall, in the end, he had still
acquired this divine ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the end, you
still learned this divine ability.” The giant yellow bear looked at
Ning. “If it weren’t for the fact that your soul had reached the
‘divine will’ level, even five years later, you would only have
had a good chance at acquiring the first divine ability…even I
didn’t imagine that your soul would be able to make a
breakthrough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning was
shocked. “Is it truly so difficult to acquire the first divine
ability? I felt as though, after my soul made a breakthrough, I
completely dominated the enemies to the point of annihilating all of
the strongmen.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
glanced sideways at Ning. “If you didn’t have your divine will,
even after five years, would your divine power have lasted long
enough for you to annihilate that many strongmen?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning came to his
senses. Right. He had relied on his divine will to control nearly a
hundred swords to dominate and slaughter those strongmen. This didn’t
use up any of his divine power. But if he didn’t have divine will,
and had relied on close-quarters combat…he would have used up an
astonishing amount of divine power! For example, when he had reached
the later stages of the test of the Divine Abilities Hall, he had
less than 20% of his divine power remaining, while the strongmen had
only grown more and more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No matter what, in
the end, you succeeded and acquired this. This divine ability.” The
giant yellow bear pointed at a giant, distant prayer mat. “Go to
that prayer mat. To kneel and pay your respects to Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded The benevolence a master showed in teaching his art was as
weighty as the heavens themselves. Ning walked forward, then
immediately fell to his knees before the prayer mat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as he knelt
down, instantly, at the top of the altar, directly in front of Ning,
a towering figure suddenly appeared, at least three thousand meters
in height. He had ancient, bronze skin, a glowing face, and wore
roughly sown beastial furs as clothes. His appearance was similar to
humans, with the only difference being that he had only a single arm!
He had only a single right arm, and did not have a left arm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This majestic figure
stared at Ning, a faint look of pleasure on his face. He said softly,
“You have already received the divine ability. Once you overcome
your Celestial Tribulation and become a Celestial Immortal, you can
be considered the disciple of myself, Daoist Threelives. Do not be
negligent and lazy, and thus lower my prestige.” And then, the
massive, single-armed figure gently pointed with his right hand
towards Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh. Five rays of
light instantly shot towards Ning…and then, the towering figure
suddenly disappeared. A look of surprised joy on Ning’s face, Ning
instantly sat down in the lotus position. The five rays of light
quickly flooded into Ning’s body, and slowly, ripples began to
appear on Ning’s form as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” The giant
yellow bear saw the towering, one-armed figure appear, then vanish.
He couldn’t help but mumble to himself. He knew…that the illusion
was nothing more than something his master had left behind. Anyone
who received his master’s divine ability and who came to the top of
this altar and knelt down before this prayer mat would cause illusion
to appear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was seated in the
lotus position, and his two hands were currently emanating
five-colored lights. Ning’s hands seemed to have transformed into
some sort of precious treasures. The five-colored lights swirled
about them, then slowly began to fuse together into a chaotic color.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whew.” Everything
fell silent, and Ning’s hands returned to normal as well. Ning
opened his eyes, then lowered his head to look at the palms of his
hands. With but a thought, the palms of his hands manifested a
complicated, circular divine tattoo. “Divine Starseizing Tattoo!
The Starseizer has six cycles, and I’ve already successfully
completed the first one.” And then, the divine tattoos faded away,
no longer visible to the naked eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single divine
ability required tremendous amounts of time to train in. They
wouldn’t be mastered in one go. Even techniques like the [Heavenly
Transformation] or the [Windwing Evasion] had to be trained in
multiple stages.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for this divine
ability, [Starseizing Hand], the way in which it was trained in was
known as the [Six Cycles of the Starseizer]. Only upon reaching the
Zifu level as a Fiendgod could one train in the first cycle! At the
Wanxiang Adept level, one could train in the second. As a Primal
Daoist, one could train in the third.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With each breakthrough
into a completely new level as a Fiendgod, one could train in the
next cycle. This divine ability placed tremendous pressure on the
divine body, and if it wasn’t strong enough, there was no way it
could be trained.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The teachings you
received of the divine ability [Starseizing Hand] are the original
teachings.” The giant yellow bear said. “Even if you train all
the way to the first master’s level, this divine ability will still
be enough for you to use. As for the [Windwing Evasion] you trained
in, that was only the simplified version.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Simplified?” Ning
was startled. “How could the divine abilities that the primordial
Fiendgods used to dominate the Three Realms be so casually taught to
others?” The giant yellow bear shook his head. “Shortly after
Pangu established the heavens, one of the primordial Fiendgods, a
giant Roc, developed a type of flying evasion technique. With a
single sweep of his wings, he could traverse a hundred thousand
kilometers. This flying technique is the divine ability…[Garuda’s
Wings]! I imagine some great power must have watched the Roc fly.
After meditating on it for a long period of time, he wrote down this
book known as the [Windwing Evasion].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded slightly.
So this divine ability, [Windwing Evasion], was just actually the
simplified version of the [Garuda’s Wings].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you had the
original teachings of this technique in book form, you could spend
thousands of years reading it.” The giant yellow bear said. “You
spent many months memorizing Master’s [Starseizing Hand], even
though it was directly sent into your soul. How could the original
copy of a true divine ability be so easily memorized?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I spent months
traversing those steps?” Ning was shocked. “Only an instant
passed in the outside world. No need to worry about your father.”
The giant yellow bear said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded, then said
solemnly, “Senior, dare I ask, who exactly is this master of mine,
‘Daoist Threelives’?” Just now, that giant, towering illusion
had only referred to himself as ‘Daoist Threelives’. Ning knew
nothing else of him.
</P>

Chapter 33 - Evanescent Demonslayer Sword
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear,
upon hearing Ning speak of his master, ‘Daoist Threelives’,
couldn’t help but feel very happy. He immediately said, “Ji Ning,
do you know that when Fiendgods are born, there are differences in
their levels as well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Differences in
Fiendgods at birth? Aren’t they all born from the universe itself?”
Ning asked. “No.” The giant yellow bear said. “Before the Three
Realms were born, and even before Pangu established the universe,
there was nothing aside from primordial chaos. In that era, the
primordial chaos gave birth to some ancient and powerful Fiendgods,
such as Pangu or Nuwa. They were Fiendgods who were born from the
primordial chaos. Some of these Primordial Fiendgods were strong,
while others were weak. The most powerful of them was naturally
Pangu!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After Pangu
established the universe, the universe itself gave birth to some new
living creatures. These creatures, being born from the universe
itself, were also referred to as innate, Heavenborn Fiendgods.
Afterwards, after many transformations, the three thousand major
worlds were created, and in the process of the creation of each major
world, some Fiendgods would be created. These are the most ordinary
of Fiendgods.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In short, Fiendgods
can be classified according to when they were born; there are
Primordial Fiengods, Heavenborn Fiendgods, and ordinary Fiendgods.”
The giant yellow bear looked at Ning. “As for Master, he is one of
the Primordial Fiendgods.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning held his breath.
What a tremendous history! But when he thought about it carefully, it
made sense for Fiendgods to be divided into three different tiers,
based on their birth. After all, Pangu was capable of establishing
the universe itself; from this, one could imagine how powerful he
was. As for many of the other Fiendgods which Ning had heard of, some
of them were only at the Xiantian level when born. Compared to
Pangu…they were countless times weaker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for this Daoist
Threelives, since he was so powerful, it made sense that he was born
as a Primordial Fiendgod. “One’s tier of birth determines both
one’s potential as well as one’s power at birth.” The giant
yellow bear said. “But no matter how lowly one’s class is at
birth, one still has the chance to become an awe-inspiring, major
figure of the Three Realms. For example, there are some individuals
who were born as members of extremely ordinary races, but after
undergoing countless tribulations, also became powerful figures who
could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, although
you are merely a human, you too have this chance.” The giant yellow
bear said. Ning nodded gently. He understood. For example, the Lord
of Cui Palace was another person from his homeland of Earth. And yet,
he rose to become one of the most exalted figures of the Netherworld
Kingdom, the First Judge of the Dead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master had countless
experiences.” The giant yellow bear’s gaze grew dreamy as he
thought back to the past. “He personally knew figures like Pangu
and Nuwa, and even provided some guidance to the giant Roc and some
other juniors. He then established his own school, and many Fiendgods
flocked to his banner to listen to him expound on the Dao…and thus,
Master ended up having many titles. Daoist Threelives, Daoist
Starseizer, One-Armed Divine Master, True God of the Right Arm…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had a thought, and
he hurriedly asked, “Could it be that Master, Daoist Threelives,
was born with just one arm?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” The giant
yellow bear shook his head. “Although I don’t know the details, I
know that when Master was born from the primordial chaos, he had two
arms. Afterwards, because of a major battle, he lost an arm. Master
felt deep shame due to this, and thus from that day onwards, only
permitted himself to have a single arm. But precisely because he only
had a single arm, Master made a further breakthrough in the divine
ability, ‘Starseizing Hand’, which he had developed while
meditating within the primordial chaos. He reached an even more
divine, miraculous level! This breakthrough made it so that the
Starseizing Hand could be ranked as one of the ten strongest divine
abilities out of the countless divine abilities that had been devised
after Pangu established the universe!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A look of surprised
shock appeared on Ning’s face. What an incredible fellow! This
Master of Ning’s, whom he had only seen as an illusion, was
actually this powerful? How many Fiendgods had there been since Pangu
had established the universe? How many divine abilities had been
divised? For the Starseizing Hand to be ranked amongst the top ten…it
was far more astonishing than he had been able to imagine,
previously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You have no need to
ask about anything else for now.” The giant yellow bear looked at
Ning. “After countless years have passed and countless eras, the
universe is now in the era of the three thousand major worlds and the
trillion minor worlds. This is the era of the Celestial Court
administering the Three Realms harmoniously. To you, these ancient
secrets of the primordial eras are far too distant and irrelevant.
There is no point in you learning these things; they will only vex
you unnecessarily. Master once said that only after you become a
Celestial Immortal, will you truly be considered Master’s
disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is time for you
to leave now.” The giant yellow bear said. “No rush.” Ning said
hurriedly. “My Fiendgod body has just reached the Zifu level.
According to the rules of the Treasure Hall, I should be able to
select another Mortal-ranked magic treasure, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant yellow bear
nodded. To acquire a magic treasure from the Treasure Hall, there
were only two possibilities; one was to rise to a new level as a
Fiendgod, while the other was to challenge the Wargod Hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, please
provide me with a list of the Mortal-ranked magic treasures of the
Treasure Hall.” Ning said. “I’ll read it here, and decide on
which treasure I want. After I leave, I’ll be able to choose it
immediately.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You certainly know
how to save time.” The giant yellow bear laughed. The list of
treasures was extremely complicated. It required quite a bit of time
to review. In this place of transmission of knowledge, separated from
time and space from the outside world, time moved at a much slower
rate. It naturally would be best for him to do the reading here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The giant
yellow bear said. “Your soul has now reached the level of having
‘divine sense’, and you have learned the divine ability,
[Starseizing Hand]. It would be simplicity itself for you to
challenge the second level of the Wargod Hall, and you even have a
chance to challenge the third level. Would you be willing to do so?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I only have a
‘chance’ at challenging the third level?” Ning asked. His power
had already risen by an astonishing amount. He had made a spiritual
breakthrough! He had also now acquired an incredibly powerful divine
ability, the [Starseizing Hand]. He was completely confident in being
able to slay Adept Xu with a single blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If your divine power
was strong enough to allow you to use the [Starseizing Hand] with
abandon, then of course you would have a high chance of success.”
The giant yellow bear smirked. “But how many times will your
current level of Crimsonbright divine power permit you to use the
[Starseizing Hand]?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hesitated
slightly, then stretched out his hands. The Divine Starseizing
Tattoos appeared, and the Crimsonbright divine power in his body
filled his two palms. A surge of incomparably powerful might filled
Ning’s mind, and he even felt as though he could shatter a mountain
with a single slap from his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” “Bang!”
Ning’s two hands each formed sword-fingers, chopping down towards
the air in front of him. Swish! Swish! Two rays of pressured energy
waves, emitting an ear-piercing howl, rumbled out like crashing
thunder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So powerful.” Ning
was tongue-tied from awe. He hadn’t used any sword techniques,
simply pointed with two fingers in a sword-finger position, and yet
the energy wave had been so astonishing…Ning had the feeling that
if Jadechild was in front of him, he could smash Jadechild to
smithereens with a single palm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However, the amount
of divine power which is used up is also astonishing.” Ning mused
to himself, “I only struck out a single time, but I used up so
much. The Crimsonbright divine power in my body probably is only
enough to permit me to strike out a few dozen times.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In a life-and-death
battle, a few dozen strikes was more than enough. But to challenge
the Wargod Hall, for his divine power to only be able to last for so
long truly wouldn’t be enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I won’t challenge
the Wargod Hall.” Ning said. “I don’t have the time to waste.”
“Right.” The giant yellow bear nodded. He pointed to an empty
space nearby, and an extremely thick book with golden lettering
appeared. Atop it were two characters, for the words ‘Precious
Treasure’. “Because this is your second time selecting a
Mortal-ranked magic treasure, the amount of treasures available in
this book will be greater than previously. If you were to challenge
and overcome the second level of the Wargod Hall, when choosing your
third magic treasure, you would be permitted to freely choose from
all of the Mortal-ranked magic treasures which Master acquired.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood. This
was the difference between challenging the first and the second
levels of the Wargod Hall. The second level was far more difficult
than the first level, so naturally, the rewards would be different as
well. Although it was still a matter of selecting Mortal-ranked magic
treasures, the further along this path he went, the greater his
choices would be.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Indeed.” As Ning
flipped through the book, he immediately saw the difference. “There
are some more treasures recorded here than there was last time, and
the additions are all extremely rare and powerful treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Jade Dragon
Cutters…what a savage magic treasure.” Ning read carefully.
“Souldrinker Bell. Far more powerful than the Myriad Wraths Banner,
and on a much higher level.” Ning sighed in praise. If Bei Zishan
had completed his Myriad Wraiths banner, it would have become a
top-grade Mortal-ranked item. The methods by which it was created,
however, were simply too despicable. By comparison, this Souldrinker
Bell was far more intricate and exquisite, and in terms of power, it
was even more powerful than a Myriad Wraiths Banner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning read through the
descriptions of one treasure after another. There were magic
treasures, there were formation flags…although all of them moved
Ning, there wasn’t a single one which inspired a great feeling of
desire within Ji Ning. This was because, after acquiring the divine
ability, [Starseizing Hand], the Darknorth swords in Ning’s hands
would swing out with extremely great power already. Although these
magic treasures were powerful, if Ning were to control them, the
power released would be far weaker from the power released from him
using his divine ability.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Magic treasures are
inferior to divine abilities, it seems.” Ning sighed in his heart.
In reality, he had forgotten that the real issue was…what sort of
divine ability he had just learned!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning flipped
past another page. His eyes suddenly lit up. This magic treasure was
known as the Evanescent Demonslayer Sword. It was a top-grade
Mortal-ranked magic treasure, a magic treasure that had been created
for the purpose of slaughter. It was forged from an extremely
precious material, the golden Nirvana crystals. This was a magic
treasure which was extremely well suited for slaughter and for sneak
attacks. It was originally an Earth-ranked magic treasure, but after
repeated forgings, it had dropped in power to become a top-grade
Mortal-ranked magic treasure. However, after committing enough
slaughter, it could slowly rise in power to its innate level, and
once more become an Earth-ranked magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning read through the
descriptions carefully. There were incomparably detailed notes
regarding this magic treasure. According to the notes in this book,
it was indeed true that some of the top-grade Mortal-ranked magic
treasures Daoist Threelives had kept here had the potential for
future growth. However, it wasn’t its potential for growth which
attracted Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. This is the
one I choose.” Ning felt joy in his heart. The Evanescent
Demonslayer Sword had an aura of impermanence and transience about
it; it was very hard to detect. Even if the Evanescent Demonslayer
Sword drew close to a foe, the foe probably wouldn’t sense
anything. This was what pleased Ning the most about it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued to flip
through the book at a slightly faster clip, finally finishing it.
“And?” The giant yellow bear looked at Ning. “Evanescent
Demonslayer Sword.” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, good eye.”
The giant yellow bear nodded. “I, too, felt that the Evanescent
Demonslayer Sword is the most suited to you. This Evanescent
Demonslayer Sword is extremely good at hiding its aura, and quite
suited to stealth attacks. Now that you have made a breakthrough in
your soul, your divine will is incomparably astonishing. You can
absolutely control this Evanescent Demonslayer Sword to engage in
long-distance sneak attacks! More importantly, you don’t even need
to fill it with your elemental ki; this will further lessen the ki
ripples, making it even harder for your enemies to detect your
Evanescent Demonslayer Sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. This was
what he had been thinking about as well. He didn’t need to use his
elemental ki, and could simply use divine will to control this
Evanescent Demonslayer Sword…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This magic treasure was
innately hard to detect. Without any elemental ki ripples, it was
just like an ordinary piece of muddy rock. It was too hard to notice
it. His divine will could stealthily control the Evanescent
Demonslayer Sword to drill through the ground until it reached the
enemy, then suddenly attack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even a Wanxiang Adept,
upon suffering a sneak attack at close quarters, probably wouldn’t
have enough time to command his magic treasures before having his
head pierced.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My divine will is
perfectly matched for combination attacks with this Evanescent
Demonslayer Sword.” Ning mused to himself. “Senior, let’s go
now.” Ning said hurriedly. Since he had acquired the Evanescent
Demonslayer Sword, he needed to immediately return to Oxhorn
Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. Hurry up a
bit. Previously, you spent roughly an hour undergoing the trial of
the Divine Abilities Hall.” The giant yellow bear grabbed Ning, and
then in the next breath, they vanished into thin air.
</P>

Chapter 34 - Ji Ning Returns, the Final Battle
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was already close to
nightfall. The edges of the Golden Crow could still be seen, setting
in the west.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the northern edges
of Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! A figure
suddenly surged into the skies, moving as fast as lightning. This was
Ji Ning, who had just been teleported out of the aquatic estate.
Ning’s right hand was wielding one of his flying swords, the
Evanescent Demonslayer Sword. The Evanescent Demonslayer Sword was
the size of his palm, and it was so dim as to be half-translucent.
The dark, translucent, palm-sized flying sword had a faint bloodstain
atop it as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Windwing Evasion!”
Ning executed the Windwing Evasion, transforming into a ray of light
and moving far faster than sound, instantly tranversing a distance of
tens of kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father. Wait for
me.” Ning’s eyes were filled with urgency. Previously, he had
acquired this most suitable of assassination weapons, the Evanescent
Demonslayer Sword. Now, Ning had been immediately teleported to the
northernmost part of Serpentwing Lake. He immediately moved forward,
binding this new treasure to him while flying forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I spent an hour in
the Divine Abilities Hall. Father. You have to be able to hold on.”
Ning burned with urgency. Whoosh! He was like a giant Roc in flight.
Even Xiantian lifeforms probably wouldn’t even be able to catch a
glimpse of Ji Ning as he moved forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roughly two minutes
later, Ji Ning saw, far in the distance, that grand sealing
formation, which looked like a giant shell of clear water. The grand
sealing formation completely covered covered the entire Oxhorn
Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the distance
from Serpentwing Lake to Oxhorn Mountain was thousands of kilometers,
Ning’s speed was now extremely fast. It must be understood that a
Zifu Disciple who rode atop a magic treasure and travelled would be
able to move two hundred thousand kilometers a day. Prior to this,
when the Wanxiang Adept, Adept Xu Li, had led Dong Fanyu and the
others, they had spent just two hours to make it to Swallow Mountain.
They had travelled a hundred thousand kilometers in a single hour!
Thus, every few minutes, they were travelling thousands of
kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When using his divine
ability, Windwing Evasion, Ning was far faster than Adept Xu Li.
Thus, it made sense for him to be able to make it from Serpentwing
Lake to Oxhorn Mountain in two minutes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” Ning held
a Darknorth sword in his hand, and the divine tattoo atop the palm
gripping the hilt of the sword began to faintly emerge. The Darknorth
sword in his hand pierced straight towards the grand sealing
formation in front of him, and Ning himself didn’t lessen his speed
in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Ning shot through
like a meteor, piercing directly through the grand sealing formation
and into the other side! “Father!” Upon piercing through the
grand sealing formation, Ning saw the nether energy emanating from up
ahead. The enormous Netherwyrm lay coiled atop Oxhorn Mountain. With
but a thought, Ning’s awe-inspiring divine will parted a path
through the fog. His divine sense encompassed the entire Oxhorn
Mountain, including the entire Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the field of his
divine sense, everything was made clear. The frantic, worried
Patriarch Ninefire. The quietly waiting Granny Shadow. His father, Ji
Yichuan, who had executed the forbidden technique and whose aura had
risen to the heavens…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And also the
white-robed, white-haired man who looked similar to his father, but
whose aura was the same as the Whitewater Hound’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were within
the reach of his divine sense. “I made it.” Ning’s heart
relaxed as he hurried forward. His divine sense also encompassed
Adept Xu Li, Nong Zidao, and their group. To his divine sense, the
bewildering function of the nether fog was completely useless, unable
to affect Ning at all. Everything within the grand formation could be
clearly seen by Ning’s divine sense!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Charge.” Ning’s
speed didn’t lessen in the slightest. He immediately utilized his
Windwing Evasion to charge towards Adept Xu Li.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Halfway up Oxhorn
Mountain. The face of Ninefire, who was controlling the entire grand
formation, instantly changed. Others couldn’t see it, but as the
master of the formation, he immediately discovered Ning charging into
the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?”
Ninefire’s face instantly turned white from terror. Ning was the
hope for the Ji clan’s future rise to power. He had entrusted Ning
with the official writ for the City of Ten Thousand Swords. So long
as Ning survived…even if the rest of them all perished, it wouldn’t
impact the future of the Ji clan that much. Ninefire knew that all of
them were going to die, but in his heart, he had still been calm,
because Ning had already escaped.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now, Ning had
returned. “Ji Ning! Leave, quick, leave!” Ninefire transmitted
mentally, his thoughts filled with berserk fury. “Who told you to
come back? Leave, leave!” Ninefire was truly frantic. Frantic and
enraged, frantic to the point of insanity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ning were to die
here, then the Ji clan would truly be annihilated. He, Ninefire,
would have no face with which to meet the ancestors of the Ji clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave!!! Have you
come to throw your life away?” Ninefire howled with rage. His voice
carried a sobbing quality to it, but he could sense that Ning’s
speed hadn’t lessened at all, and that he was continuing to charge
straight towards Snowdragon Mountain’s group.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire, upon
discovering Ning’s appearance, had lost his mind out of
franticness. If he had calmed down, he would have realized…that
Ning was clearly within the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation, and he
hadn’t created a passage for Ning through the nether fog. How,
then, was Ning advancing directly towards Snowdragon Mountain’s
group, as though he could see them?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ninefire had been
driven to the brink of berserk madness. Even tears had begun to
appear in his eyes. How could he possibly calm down at a time like
this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, leave,
leave, quickly leave.” Ninefire sent frantically. “Yichuan,
Yichuan, quick, stop your son. Ning didn’t leave. He’s attacking
Snowdragon Mountain’s group again!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Yichuan was
currently leaning against a large, crooked tree trunk. Suddenly, he
heard the Patriarch’s voice transmitted into his mind. And then, a
corridor suddenly appeared within the nether fog which spanned into
the distance. In the distance, he saw a figure moving as fast as
lightning towards Yichuan’s general direction. This was because
Yichuan was currently very close to Snowdragon Mountain’s group.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?”
Yichuan’s face instantly turned completely white as well, and
disbelief appeared in his eyes. He had already prepared himself for
death, and his heart had been incomparably calm because his son had
departed. The Ji clan would flourish, thanks to his son, and his
son’s name would become famous throughout the vast world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But! Ji Ning had
actually returned. “LEAVE!!!!” Yichuan howled hoarsely towards
Ning, his face savage. “Ji Ning, who told you to return? Leave!!!
If you don’t leave, even in death, I won’t be able to close my
eyes in peace. Quick, leave!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immediately after
charging into the Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation, Ning heard the
voices of the Patriarch, and then a corridor in the nether fog ahead
of him appeared, revealing, in the distance, his father, Yichuan! His
father, Yichuan, was currently just three hundred meters away from
Adept Xu Li’s group.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave!” “Quick,
leave!” “If you leave, even in death, I won’t be able to close
my eyes in peace!” “We will be ashamed to face the ancestors of
the Ji clan!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Ninefire and
his father, Yichuan, had been incomparably calm in the face of death,
but they were now nearly at the point of collapse. Ning’s
appearance…was like an utter nightmare to them! They would rather
have their souls destroyed than see such a sight. They were at the
point of insanity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart trembled
upon hearing his father and the Patriarch’s voices. He knew what
his father and the Patriarch were thinking. “They’ll understand
soon enough.” Ning’s eyes turned sharp, and a ray of light
pierced through the ground, controlled by Ning’s divine will. The
Evanescent Demonslayer Sword was moving deep underground at a high
speed towards the direction of Adept Xu Li.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Ning himself
used his divine ability, the Windwing Evasion, and moved
lightning-fast towards Adept Xu Li’s group…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Surounded by nether fog
and a snowy white dragon, Adept Xu Li, Lu Huang, Nong Zidao, and the
other Immortal practitioners were all quite relaxed and leisurely.
Only Nong Zidao was frowning, his eyes closed as he focused on his
analysis. The nether fog bewildering formation’s elemental ki ley
lines had clearly grown much more complicated. Fortunately, he had
gained some experience from breaking the formation previously, and so
he was still able to break through this one. Only, he now needed
considerably more time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Adept Xu Li’s
face changed slightly. He turned his head, staring into the distance;
he could sense that the grand sealing formation he had set up had
been pierced through. “Who just passed through my sealing
formation?” Adept Xu Li’s heart clenched. He grew cautious, and a
Dao-seal appeared in his hand out of nowhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a Wanxiang Adept, he
had experienced quite a few dangers. Naturally, he was very cautious.
Before preparing for victory, he would first prepare his retreat in
event of defeat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoosh!” “Whoosh!”
The ‘Black Serpent Cord’ and the ‘Earth Garrison Seal’, his
two mighty Earth-ranked magic treasures, all appeared and hovered
around him, prepared to guard him at all times. But suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! A figure
charged in from within the nether fog, swooping in like a giant Roc.
The figure was currently wielding a pair of swords, and moved so fast
that Adept Xu Li and the others had to sigh in amazement. But upon
seeing the charging figure, Adept Xu Li let out a sigh of relief,
then called out in a high voice, “Ji Ning! Can it be that you have
come to deliver your life…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice was still
echoing within the region as he summoned seventy two flying swords
out of nowhere, sending them enveloping towards Ji Ning. Adept Xu Li
already had some experience with dealing with Ning’s speed; this
time, he immediately used the many flying swords to entangle Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” An
explosive sound rang out. One after another of the flying swords were
knocked flying away, and a sword flash immediately appeared in front
of Adept Xu Li. Boom! Boom! The Earth-ranked magic treasures, ‘Black
Serpent Cord’ and ‘Earth Garrison Seal’, were all blasted away,
and the sword light flashed past Adept Xu Li’s head…sending it
flying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Xu Li had died!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…the snowy
white dragon that had been coiling around them disappeared as well,
and the Zifu Disciples, astonished, weren’t able to react at all.
“Bang!” An illusory figure suddenly appeared from from the
ground, slashing past Nong Zidao’s head!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Nong Zidao had been
completely absorbed in analyzing the formation. Even now, he was
still absorbed in his task…and so, just like that, Nong Zidao died!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It all happened in the
blink of an eye! Adept Xu Li and Nong Zidao had both died in the
blink of an eye. Ji Ning had immediately used his divine ability,
‘Starseizing Hand’, while the Darknorth swords in his hands had
also unleashed their most powerful attacks. The power of these
attacks was incredible. The seventy two flying swords had all been
knocked away, and the two Earth-ranked magic treasures had both been
sent flying as well. The sword flash had passed directly through the
snowy white dragon and slaughtered Adept Xu Li!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was simply too fast.
Adept Xu Li, upon seeing Ning, had been quite confident, but Ning’s
terrifying sword blow…had simply been too fast and too furious.
Adept Xu had wanted to use his two Earth-ranked magic treasures to
block, but before he had, Ning’s sword had already killed him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…you…” Only
now did the other Zifu Disciples react. They stared in astonishment
at Ji Ning. It had simply been too fast. In the blink of an eye, both
Nong Zidao and Adept Xu Li had died? A mighty, venerable Wanxiang
Adept, Xu Li, who had prior experience fighting Ji Ning…how could
it be that he had been instantly killed in their first exchange of
blows, to the point where he didn’t even have the chance to flee?
What was going on?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave!” “Quick,
leave!” “If you leave, even in death, I won’t be able to close
my eyes in peace!” “We will be ashamed to face the ancestors of
the Ji clan!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their voices were still
echoing, but then…they fell silent. The controller of the
formation, Ji Ninefire, was completely stunned. As for Ning’s
father, Ji Yichuan, he had ignored everything and chaged more than
three hundred meters towards him. His face had been filled with
agonized rage, and he was bellowing out the words, “Ji Ning,
quick…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His words instantly
became trapped in his throat. He saw the two corpses which now lay
fallen on the ground. One was Wanxiang Adept Xu Li, who previously
had been as calm and composed as the wind or the clouds, yet who held
power that could shake the heavens. The other was the formations
expert, Nong Zidao. Blood and brain matter lay oozing on the ground.
Clearly, the two were deader than dead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This!” Yichuan was
completely stunned. He stared in disbelief at his nearby son, who was
holding a Darknorth sword in front of Adept Xu Li’s corpse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you can be
arrogant for now, but our Snowdragon Mountain will definitely avenge
us!” The frenzied, grief-stricken roars of the seven nearby Zifu
Disciples nearby rang out.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 35 - Snowdragon Mountain’s Prestige
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Yichuan was both
surprised and delighted. As for the seven nearby Zifu Disciples, who
were calling out bravely despite being in despair, Yichuan paid them
no mind at all. The only one he cared about was Ji Ning, who was next
to the bodies of those two on the ground; Adept Xu Li and Nong Zidao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could…how
could…it’s only, only been a short while…” Yichuan couldn’t
believe it. How short a period of time had transpired, as he had
charged over here from three hundred meters away? Adept Xu Li, an
exalted Wanxiang Adept, had perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A corridor through the
nether fog parted. Ji Ninefire, who had been watching from afar
halfway up the mountain, quickly ran this way through the corridor.
His face was covered with surprise and delight. Yichuan hadn’t
personally seen the slaughter that had just occurred, but Patriarch
Ninefire had been able to vaguely sense it all through his control of
the nether fog. Although it wasn’t very clear, he knew without a
doubt…that Ning had used only a single blow to kill Adept Xu Li.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In a short hour, Ji
Ning’s actually undergone a world-shaking transformation.”
Ninefire’s heart was filled with unspeakable joy. “This truly is
a blessing for our Ji clan!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Shadow, Liu
Xing, Truekeep, all of you, come over. Snowdragon Mountain’s Adept
Xu Li has already perished.” Ninefire sent to them while hurrying
over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the various other
regions. Granny Shadow and the others had felt shock and terror in
their hearts, because just now, they had heard Adept Xu Li roar, “Ji
Ning, have you come to deliver your life?” Granny Shadow and the
others were incomparably terrified upon hearing this; hadn’t Ning
left? Why had he returned? Or was Adept Xu Li lying?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And right in the middle
of their fear, the Patriarch’s voice came towards them. “Snowdragon
Mountain’s Adept Xu Li has already perished.” “Perished?”
“The Wanxiang Adept perished?” Truekeep, Granny Shadow, and the
others felt both astonishment as well as amazement. How could such a
powerful Wanxiang Adept have died like this? They hurriedly traversed
the corridors through the nether fog which had just opened before
them, and they hastened towards Ning’s direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon…one figure after
another arrived, moving at high speed. Ji Yichuan. Ji Ninefire.
Granny Shadow. Ji Truekeep. The old servant, Ah Xing. The
white-robed, white-haired man. The Thunderhawk.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White.” Ning
looked at the white-robed, white-haired man who had appeared before
him, especially at the face that was striking similar to his
father’s. He couldn’t help but call out in surprised delight,
“You made a breakthrough?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“By relying on the
liquefied elemental essence, I broke through.” The Whitewater Hound
nodded. He looked towards Ji Ning with eyes filled with love. “I
didn’t expect that at the end, we would all survive. After all
these years, I’ve never been able to speak with you. I didn’t
expect that today, Ning, son, I would be able to speak with you.”
Ning beamed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept Xu Li and Nong
Zidao?” Truekeep looked at the surrounding area. “They’ve been
cremated already.” Yichuan had a rare smile on his face as well.
Just now, Ning had immediately cremated the remains and taken the
magic treasures. Ning pointed at the seven utterly despondent Zifu
Disciples. “Patriarch, how should we deal with these seven? The
seven of them aren’t able to fight back at all; we can do with them
as we please.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The seven of them?”
Ninefire turned his head, sweeping them with a glance. “Kill them
all. Our Ji clan has already established an enormous grudge with
Snowdragon Mountain. There’s no point to keeping them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” “Don’t
kill me, I’m willing to give up my treasures in exchange for my
life. “You will regret it. Your Ji clan will definitely be
annihilated by the fiery rage of Snowdragon Mountain.” “Keep
acting arrogantly. Your Ji clan will definitely be annihilated within
a single day.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the seven Zifu
Disciples were begging for their lives, while others were cursing
angrily. Patriarch Ninefire frowned as he pointed at one of the
middle-aged men. He barked, “What did you say? Our Ji clan will be
annihilated within a single day?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha.” Lu Huang
laughed wildly. “Do you know who you killed? The person you just
killed was a Wanxiang Adept of our Snowdragon Mountain! Wanxiang
Adepts can be considered high-level members of our sect. When they
die, the main sect will instantly know, and also know where they
died.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of Ning,
Ninefire, and the others all changed. There were indeed quite a few
methods by which a location could be divided. For a major sect like
Snowdragon Mountain, it would be quite normal for them to leave some
markings behind on their Wanxiang Adepts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is one thing for
us Zifu Disciples to die, but the main sect will immediately send
people over to investigate the death of Adept Xu Li.” Lu Huang
looked at Ning. “Ji Ning. Although you are formidable and although
you are a talent, in the face of our entire Snowdragon Mountain, you
will definitely die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. The death of
an Adept is an enormous matter. The elders of the main sect will
definitely arrive within a single day. You will definitely perish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Before the Celestial
Envoys of the Grand Xia Dynasty who you are waiting for will arrive,
our elders of the sect will arrive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The morale of the Zifu
Disciples clearly began to rise. Swish! Suddenly, without giving them
any chance to respond, a semi-translucent shadow flashed past,
instantly piercing through the heads of the various Zifu Disciples.
Blood sprayed everywhere, and then all of them collapsed, dead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So fast.” “There
were no warning signs at all.” The faces of Ninefire, Truekeep, and
the others all changed. Ning’s attack had created no ripples or
disturbances at all! After all, Ning hadn’t even filled the
Evanescent Demonslayer Sword with his elemental ki; he had completely
relied on his divine will to control it. Naturally, Ning was able to
attack without giving any warning signs. The seven were still cursing
in despair, but in the next instant, they had all died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xu Li is already
dead.” Ning said solemnly. “The worst case scenario would be that
the Snowdragon Mountain really will send even more powerful experts
to come here to investigate. We need to immediately make
preparations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What the hell is
this? There’s no end to this!” Truekeep gritted his teeth
painfully. “Alas!” Patriarch Ninefire shook his head as well.
Previously, they had all been incomparably excited, but now, a bucket
of ice water had been poured on their heads. Their hearts turned
cold!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than a million
kilometers away from Swallow Mountain. Snow drifted down from the
skies. It was perpetually freezing here. The endless mountains
stretched in a chain, as far as the eye could see. Some were tall,
while others were short; some had peaks that stretched into the
clouds. This was the location of the main sect of one of the great
powers within Stillwater Commandery, Snowdragon Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snowdragon Mountain’s
main sect was divided into three factions, and the leaders of the
three factions were all Summit Lords, with the positions being
assumed by Primal Daoists.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three tallest, most
awe-inspiring majestic mountain peaks…were the residences of the
three Primal Daoists. There were many other mountain peaks around
them, which were the residences of the various Wanxiang Adepts.
Naturally, there were many Zifu Disciples who would follow these
Wanxiang Adepts or serve the Primal Daoists, waiting for a chance to
hear them expound on the Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Coldfocus Peak
of Snowdragon Mountain were halls and palaces. Within one of the main
palaces, there was a jade bed, atop which sat a red-clothed youth in
the lotus position. By his side stood a pair of maids. They stood
there nervously, not daring to make a sound and disturb him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Coldfocus Peak…it was
a mountain peak that was ranked amongst the top peaks of the many
mountains of Snowdragon Mountain’s main sect. The Summit Lord, Xue
Hongyi, was a truly outstanding genius that had been cultivated by
Snowdragon Mountain. Age ten, Xiantian. Age sixteen, Zifu. Age thirty
nine, Wanxiang. Thirty years later, after many trials and tests, he
had become a member of the Grand Xia Dynasty’s Raindragon Guard!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Raindragon
Guard, he had learned some particularly powerful techniques. His
battle prowess was now within the top three of the Wanxiang Adepts of
Snowdragon Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There could be a
tremendous gap in power between two Wanxiang Adepts. The likes of
Adept Xu Li were simply ordinary Wanxiang Adepts. There were some
particularly talented Wanxiang Adepts who trained in some extremely
powerful techniques, who had extremely formidable magic treasures or
divine abilities, or controlled particularly powerful golems who were
capable of fighting beyond their level and approach the Primal Daoist
level of combat power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amonst Zifu Disciples,
there were outstanding talents and also comparative weaklings. The
weaklings were like Ji Ninefire; the stronger ones were like Dong
Ziqi. Both were peak Zifu Disciples, but a single Dong Ziqi could
battle ten Ji Ninefire’s. As for the more formidable ones like
Jadechild, because of their divine abilities, they could dominate a
group of Zifu Disciples by themselves. And of course, there were
monsters like Ning, who could kill Jadechild as easily as
slaughtering a chicken.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Amongst Wanxiang
Adepts, there could similarly be a great difference in power levels.
Xue Hongyi was one of the most dazzling ones, who had close to a
Primal Daoist’s power in battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hongyi.” An icy
cold voice suddenly rang out by the ears of the red-clothed youth.
“Hm?” The red-clothed youth opened his eyes, a look of respect
appearing in them. “Master.” “Your junior apprentice-brother Xu
Li just perished, and it should have been within the Swallow Mountain
region.” The icy voice continued, “Hongyi, go make a trip to
Swallow Mountain and investigate how your junior apprentice-brother
Xu Li died. You are a member of the Raindragon Guard; you can borrow
their teleportation array to move to Swallow Mountain as quickly as
possible.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Master.” The
red-clothed youth nodded. He was an orphan whom his master had taken
in, because he had been discovered on Snowdragon Mountain’s
territory. Back then, because he had been found wearing naut but a
red, cotton-padded jacket, his master had bestowed him with the
surname of ‘Xue’, meaning ‘snow’, and his name as ‘Hongyi’,
meaning ‘red clothes’. The relationship between himself and his
master was akin to that between a true father and a son. Only, the
two weren’t good at expressing it, as they both had cold, sharp
personalities.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whoosh.” A red
cloud suddenly appeared before the red-clothed youth, and in an
instant, it flew out of the main hall, howling through the air as it
disappeared into the horizons at an astonishing speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Oxhorn Mountain. The Ji
clan was currently deciding how they should deal with the expert
which Snowdragon Mountain would invariably send over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A major sect such as
Snowdragon Mountain cares the most about their reputation. Our ‘puny
little Ji clan’ has killed so many of their disciples; they
definitely won’t let this matter rest.” Truekeep said
frantically. “Now, our only chance is to hope for the Celestial
Envoy of the Grand Xia Dynasty to arrive. Once the Celestial Envoy
arrives, we will have the protection of the Dynasty. No matter how
audacious Snowdragon Mountain is, they won’t dare attack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But the expert from
Snowdragon Mountain will arrive within the day.” Ninefire said with
a frown. “As for the Celestial Envoy of the Grand Xia Dynasty, the
Envoy probably won’t be able to arrive within a day.” All of them
were pondering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our only option is
to flee.” Granny Shadow said in her hoarse voice. “Right. Flee.”
Ninefire said. “We cannot fight head on. We can’t let Ji Ning
take on this sort of danger again. We shall flee immediately. After
we flee, Snowdragon Mountain will spend some extra time
investigating. As long as we can delay until the Celestial Envoy
arrives, we will have succeeded.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m just afraid
that if the experts of Snowdragon Mountain aren’t able to find us,
in their rage, they will harm our ordinary clansmen.” Truekeep
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face suddenly
changed as he turned to look into the distance. “Eh?” Everyone
else, seeing Ning’s face change, also turned to look towards the
distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nether fog around
them had grown sparse. Ning and the others could now see far into the
distance…and because Ning’s soul had reached the ‘divine sense’
level, his senses were extremely acute. He could sense that from far
away in the sky, there were faint ripples. Thus, he had turned to
look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From afar…a towering,
lofty, wide warship was currently pressing down, emanating waves of
energy as it flew over. There were massive armored warriors standing
atop the ship, and all of them had extraordinary auras and gazes.
This group of warriors surrounded a tall, slender youngster who was
dressed in a magnificent uniform and who wore a crown on his
forehead. His bearing was extraordinary, and by his side there was an
armored man who was fawning on him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The warship had two
mighty pillars and two flags fluttering atop them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the first flag
were two characters: “Still” and “Water.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the other flag
were two other characters: “North” and “Mont.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Northmont clan,
of the Marquis of Stillwater.” Ninefire raised his head, staring at
the enormous ship which flew through the airs towards them. Upon
seeing the great flag atop the warship, he couldn’t help but murmur
to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Marquis of
Stillwater!” Ning was shocked as well. The Sillwater Commandery was
a vast, vast land, and it had all been enfeoffed to the Marquis of
Stillwater! One could imagine how vast the power of the Marquis of
Stillwater was. Only the Raindragon Guards could be considered to be
on par with him, but with regards to some of the matters within the
territory of the Marquis, not even the Raindragon Guard would dare to
casually interfere in and disrupt the Marquis of Stillwater’s
management of his lands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That is…General
Dong.” Truekeep said. “The person standing next to the youngster
is General Dong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The warship continued
to fly towards them. General Dong, who stood atop the warship, by the
side of the youngster in the beautiful black uniform, hurriedly
barked downwards, “Members of the Ji clan and Snowdragon Mountain,
hurry and pay your respects to the exalted envoy of the Marquis of
Stillwater!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice echoed and
rumbled, reverberating throughout the lands.
</P>

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_36___The_Exalted_Envoy_o"></A>
Chapter 36 - The Exalted Envoy of the Marquisate of Stillwater
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The exalted envoy of
the Marquisate of Stillwater?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Ji Ninefire,
Ji Yichuan, and the others all felt puzzlement in their hearts. Upon
seeing the two massive flags aboard the giant warship, they all
understood that this warship belonged to to the Northpeak clan of the
Marquis of Stillwater, the clan with the most exalted power and
authority in the entirety of Stillwater Commandery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, they had
clearly made the report to the Grand Xia Dynasty, and had hoped to
transfer the rights to the elemental ore mine to the Grand Xia
Dynasty. It was the Celestial Envoy of the Grand Xia Dynasty which
they had been awaiting this entire time. Why, then, had the envoy of
the Marquis of Stillwater Commandery come?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, let’s go
up.” Ninefire said softly. “Right.” All of them acknowledged.
Although the arrival of the envoy of the Marquisate of Stillwater was
quite strange, even General Dong, the general in chage of the forces
of the Grand Xia Dynasty stationed in Swallow Mountain, was standing
next to the envoy like a fawning sycophant. How could the Ji clan
possibly dare offend them?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” A
flying boat appeared out of nowhere. Ning and the others boarded the
boat, then flew upwards into the sky. There, high in the sky, the
heroic warriors aboard the warship stood proudly, clearly all at the
Zifu Disciple level. This made the hearts of Ning and the others
clench. This really was the Northmont clan of the Marquis of
Stillwater, one of the eight hundred marquisdoms that had been
enfeoffed after the Grand Xia Dynasty had unified the world. An
ancient marquisate which had existed for countless years…any squad
of warriors it casually sent out would all be at least at the Zifu
Disciple level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ninefire, your Ji
clan has had a stroke of great fortune.” General Dong snorted
coldly. “The young master is right up ahead, awaiting you all.
Hurry and enter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, General
Dong.” Ninefire said with a smile while leading Ning and the others
within. The Ji clan’s forces moved across the deck of the warship,
under the guidance of the armored warriors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How impressive.”
Ning swept the area around himself slightly with his gaze, and
discovered that this warship was covered with complicated runes. A
powerful aura lay hidden within this warship. “This shouldn’t be
a magic treasure; it should be some sort of mechanical golem-ship!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The warship was divided
into three floors. Ascending the stairs, Ning and the others moved
into the main hall of the second floor. This main hall was extremely
broad, and within there was a youngster in a luxurious black uniform.
This black-uniformed youngster was staring through the window, hands
clasped, towards the boundless mist outside. By his side, there were
two maids, and an old man who was nervously standing in a corner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dong Fanyu!” Ning
instantly recognized this person. This was one of the Zifu Disciples
of the Swallow Mountain branch of Snowdragon Mountain. Although he
had never seen this man in person before, he had seen his image in
intelligence reports.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is Adept Xu?”
Dong Fanyu, upon seeing the Ji clan enter, couldn’t help but say in
astonishment, “Where are senior apprentice-brother Zidao and the
others?” But no members of the Ji clan paid him any heed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We pay our respects
to the exalted envoy,” Ninefire said, immediately bowing low,
almost to the ground. Behind him, Ning and the others all bowed in
respect as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did the
black-uniformed youth who had been looking through the window with
clasped hands turn to them. His face was smooth and pale. A faint
smile was on his face, and he looked quite amiable. Sweeping them
with a glance, he said, “Arise.” Only now did the members of the
Ji clan rise from their bow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” The
black-uniformed youth frowned, then laughed, “Just your group?
General Dong, didn’t you say that Snowdragon Mountain and the Ji
clan were engaging in a battle here at Oxhorn Mountain?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">General Dong hurriedly
said to him, “Reporting to the young master: Snowdragon Mountain
did indeed have quite a few Immortal practitioners who were battling
the Ji clan at Oxhorn Mountain. Didn’t Dong Fanyu also stated that
even the Wanxiang Adept, Xu Li, had gone to participate? Ji Ninefire!
I ask you this: Where are the forces of Snowdragon Mountain? The
exalted envoy of the Marquis of Stillwater has come; how dare they
not come to pay their respects?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ninefire hurriedly
said, “Reporting to the exalted envoy: The forces of Snowdragon
Mountain wished to destroy my Ji clan. My Ji clan strove to battle
against them, and in the end, annihilated all of the invading forces
of Snowdragon Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible!” Dong
Fanyu, who had been listening nearby, bellowed out, “Adept Xu Li
was a Wanxiang Adept. How could the Zifu Disciples of your Ji clan
have killed Adept Xu Li? As I see it, by relying on your grand
formation, you’ve separated everything within from the outside
world. You knew that the young master has arrived, but Adept Xu Li
and the others remain trapped within the formation and do not know of
his arrival.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-uniformed
youngster stood there, not speaking, just watching.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire said, “Adept
Xu Li truly has perished. Ji Ning.” Ninefire turned and spoke to
Ning. “Take out Adept Xu Li’s magic treasure, that giant seal;
let this Dong Fanyu take a look.” Ning waved his hand, and that
grand seal appeared within it. It was the ‘Earth Garrison Seal’.
The appearance of it alone indicated that it possessed extraordinary
power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Fanyu said,
astonished, “I, I’ve never seen Adept Xu Li use his grand seal,
but I’ve flown atop the Adept’s flying magic treasures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This should be an
Earth-ranked magic treasure.” The black-uniformed youngster
suddenly said. Ning waved his hand again, and a small ship appeared
within his palm. Although it was within his palm, it was enough to
instantly turn Dong Fanyu’s face ashen. “How can this be!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby General
Dong’s pupils contracted, and then he laughed, “It seems as
though this Ji clan has rather extraordinary abilities. Previously,
according to Dong Fanyu’s report, Dong Ziqi, Jadechild, and nearly
twenty other Zifu Disciples perished here at Oxhorn Mountain. I
didn’t expect that even Adept Xu Li and the others who hastened
here would all perish here as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clap! Clap! Clap! The
black-uniformed youngster suddenly began to clap his hands. “I am
Northmont Baiwei.” The black-uniforned youngster laughed. “I
imagine all of you from the Ji clan know why I have come on this
trip. I’m here for that elemental ore mine within the borders of
your Ji clan’s domain. My goal is simple - I wish for your Ji clan
to transfer the rights to the elemental ore mine to the Marquisate of
Stillwater, and our estate will also give your clan 30%!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire stuttered,
“But, but we’ve already report this to the Grand Xia Dynasty…”
“No need to worry.” The black-uniformed youngster shook his head.
“The Marquisate of Stillwater arrived first. After we sign a
transfer agreement, even if the Celestial Envoy of the Grand Xia
Dynasty arrives, it will be to no avail. The Marquisate of Stillwater
will naturally shield you in this matter.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The members of the Ji
clan all let out sighs of relief. To the Ji clan, transferring the
mine to the Marquisate of Stillwater or to the Grand Xia Dynasty made
no difference. Within the Stillwater Commandery…the Marquisate of
Stillwater had a status that was equivalent to the Grand Xia
Dynasty’s, because this land had been enfeoffed to the Marquis of
Stillwater. If the Marquis of Stillwater chose to take control over
certain matters, not even the Grand Xia Dynasty would find it easy to
casually intervene.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you willing?”
Northmont Baiwei smiled. “Willing, willing!” Ninefire said
hurriedly. Ning and the others didn’t speak out in opposition.
“Excellent.” Baiwei smiled, then nodded. “I will order my
people to go and investigate the quality of this elemental ore mine.
Also; the rest of you can retire, but Ji Ning is to stay behind.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was to stay
behind? The Ji clan was startled. The nearby Dong Fanyu and General
Dong all bowed and immediately said, “Yes,” then obediently
departed. Although the Ji clan was puzzled, they still acknowledged
the order and left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ninefire.
Congratulations.” General Dong, walking atop the wide planks of the
ship, said with clasped hands. “Luck, all luck.” Ninefire
hurriedly laughed, but a look of surprise was on his face. “Our Ji
clan didn’t make a report to the Marquisate of Stillwater. How did
they manage to send someone over so quickly?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How should I know?”
General Dong shook his head. “If I sent someone to make a report,
they probably wouldn’t even have arrived at the city of Stillwater
yet.” Ninefire nodded lightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone in the Ji clan
was rather worried about Ning, who had remained in the hall. Dong
Fanyu, off to the side, was gnashing his teeth. Even Adept Xu Li had
died. He felt completely unable to accept this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the hall. Only
Northmont Baiwei and Ji Ning were present, along with two maids.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, might
I ask why you have asked me, Ji Ning, to stay behind?” Ning said
with great courtesy. “No need to stand on ceremony.” Baiwei sat
down, the pointed at a nearby black chair and said, “You can sit as
well. Also, my name is Northmont Baiwei. You can just address me as
Baiwei; I don’t actually have an official position.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, young
master Baiwei.” Ning sat down. Baiwei looked towards Ning. “At
eleven years of age, you slaughtered the criminal Bei Zishan, who the
Raindragon Guard was pursuing. You should now be sixteen years of
age. If my guess is correct, the reason why the Ji clan was able to
exceed everyone’s expectations this time and cause Snowdragon
Mountain to suffer major losses was because of you, Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled. This
young master, Northmont Baiwei, seemed to know quite a few things. He
even knew that Ning was the one who had killed Bei Zishan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to worry. I
didn’t investigate you on purpose.” Baiwei smiled. “To be
honest, this is the first time I’ve come out on a mission on
Father’s orders. Naturally, I must be cautious when carrying out my
first assignment. Although this mission is a simple one, I still did
a careful investigation into your Ji clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was secretly
startled. The Northmont clan of Stillwater was an ancient clan that
had existed for as nearly as long as the Grand Xia Dynasty itself
had. The descendants of a clan like this were simply extraordinary;
even when serving as an envoy to a minor clan like the Ji clan, they
would first investigate everything clearly. From this, one could tell
how cautious they were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You killed Bei
Zishan at age eleven, then Jadechild and Xu Li at age sixteen.”
Baiwei sighed, impressed. “Even though you relied on the supporting
power of a formation, I must admit that I am in admiration for your
record in battle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I risked my life,
and luck was on my side.” Ning shook his head and sighed. “My Ji
clan very nearly perished, there at Oxhorn Mountain.” When he
thought back to the twists and turns of the battle on Oxhorn
Mountain, Ning still felt some lingering fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You had luck, but
you also had strength.” Baiwei said. “A genius like will truly be
stifled in a small place like Swallow Mountain. Given your talent…if
you don’t have a formidable master instructing you, I fear that in
the future, it will be hard for you to achieve great things. For
example, if you don’t have access to some supreme training
techniques, it will be hard for you to even become a Wanxiang Adept.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “I do
indeed have the intention of going on a journey and also paying
respects to a teacher and master, but I must wait a period of time
first.” Baiwei nodded. With a wave of his hand, he produced an
insignia. “If you go to the city of Stillwater, you can come seek
me out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was startled. An
insignia? If he accepted it, that meant that he was accepting a favor
from this person. This Northmont Baiwei had an exalted status, but he
acted in a cautious manner, and treated Ning, a Zifu Disciple from an
ordinary clan, with such courtesy. A person like this was worth
befriending.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, young
master Baiwei.” Ning hesitated slightly, then accepted the
insignia. The front side of the insignia had the characters ‘North’
and ‘Mont’, while the other side had the characters ‘Black’
and ‘Tiger’. Ning couldn’t help but mumble in a low voice,
“North Mont Black Tiger?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That refers to my
father, Northmont Blacktiger.” Baiwei smiled. Ning immediately
said, “When I go to Stillwater City, I will definitely pay you a
visit, young master Baiwei.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My subordinates will
spend quite some time investigating the quality of this elemental ore
mine. Let us listen to some music and wait for them.” Baiwei waved
his hand lightly, and instantly, the maids appeared from behind the
curtains at the sides of the hall. They were carrying musical
instruments and were all extremely beautiful. Soon, music began to
ring out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time, other
maids delivered delicacies for them to eat. After a long period of
casual conversation, Ning began to feel an increased sense of
goodwill towards this Northmont Baiwei. But suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Raindragon
Guards have a mission to capture the members of the Ji clan for
interrogation. I would like to ask the master of this warship to
assist me in this.” A cold, sharp voice rang out from straight
ahead, echoing within the warship. Even Ning and Baiwei, who were
within the main hall, could clearly hear this voice. Ning turned his
head to stare out through the glass. He saw, from afar, a red-clothed
youth who stood there above a red cloud. The youth was staring coldly
in their direction.

Chapter 37 - Matters Resolved
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the warship. Ji
Ninefire, Ji Yichuan, and the others all felt shock in their hearts.
The Raindragon Guards had come to arrest them for interrogation?
Their Ji clan had never committed any grave sins.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Raindragon
Guard is most likely a member of Snowdragon Mountain.” Ji Truekeep
sent. “Right. He came quite quickly. He hastened here in just two
short hours from the main Snowdragon Mountain sect.” Ninefire
nodded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only enemy they had
offended was Snowdragon Mountain. And, as a major sect, it was normal
for Snowdragon Mountain to have members who were also Raindragon
Guards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Raindragon Guard
is here to deal with a case?” A gentle voice rang out, and the
black-uniformed Northmont Baiwei leisurely strolled out down the
stairs from the second floor, with Ning following behind him. While
walking down, Baiwei glanced at the red-clothed youngster who stood
in midair in the distance. “What case does the Raindragon Guard
have, for you to come arrest the members of the Ji clan?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Xue Hongyi,
standing upon that red cloud, saw that black-uniformed youth, and his
face immediately changed. As a member of the Raindragon Guard, it
could be said that his power was extremely great, almost dominatingly
so, within Stillwater Commandery. However, upon encountering someone
from the Marquisate of Stillwater, he had to somewhat restrain
himself. An ordinary member of the Marquisate was one thing, but from
the clothes of the youngster before him, Hongyi could tell at one
glance that this youngster was of the main lineage of the Marquisate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How did I end up
running into someone from the main lineage of the Marquisate of
Stillwater?” Hongyi frowned slightly. He hesitated momentarily, but
then still said, “I have come here on assignment to arrest the
wanted criminal, ‘Kebu’. I suspect that the criminal Kebu is
hiding within the territory of the Ji clan, and is being protected by
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are in pursuit
of the wanted criminal, Kebu?” Baiwei said softly. “Do you have a
military order?” “I do.” A black scroll appeared out of nowhere
within Hongyi’s hands. He unwrapped it, and it was covered with
characters that proclaimed a military order had been sent for the
arrest of the wanted criminal, Kebu, and that the order had been
issued to ‘Xue Hongyi’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwei glanced at it,
immediately able to tell that this truly was a military order.
Frowning slightly, he glanced at Xue Hongyi. He mused to himself that
this Xue Hongyi truly was remarkable; upon seeing him, Baiwei had
immediately understood that this person should be a member of
Snowdragon Mountain, here to capture the Ji clan and take revenge
upon them! To a mighty, exalted Raindragon Guard, dealing with the Ji
clan would be simplicity itself. And yet, he had first gone to accept
a military mission, and then find the excuse of claiming that the Ji
clan was suspected of aiding and hiding a wanted criminal. This
really was an airtight plan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should we do?”
“A military order from the Raindragon Guard?” The members of the
Ji clan were all somewhat panicking. As for Ning, he stared at the
distant scroll of parchment, then gave the red-clothed youngster a
careful glance. “Based on what Adept Mu Xiao had told me, he had
only been permitted to join the Raindragon Guard after becoming a
late-stage Wanxiang Adept. I imagine that this red-clothed
youngster’s strength is considerable as well. Given how young he
appears…he must be a genius as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The younger a person
looked, the more others needed to be wary of that person. If, for
example, a toddler who appeared to be only five or six years old had
suddenly appeared, proclaiming that he was here on behalf of the
Raindragon Guard, that would be truly terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am here on
military orders to capture a wanted criminal. Young master, please
assist me in this matter.” Xue Hongyi’s attitude was noticeably
more polite now. “I only see that your military orders refer to the
capture of the wanted criminal ‘Kebu’; they say nothing about
seizing members of the Ji clan.” Northmont Baiwei snapped. “I
think you had best depart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xue Hongyi, standing
atop that red cloud in the distance, grew angry. He barked, “The
wanted criminal, Kebu, is hiding within the Ji clan. The Raindragon
Guard has come to arrest him. Can it be, young master, that you are
going to give him shelter?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At a time like this,
the reputation of Snowdragon Mountain was completely useless. Only
the reputation of the Raindragon Guard would be effective!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bullshit!” Baiwei
pointed at Xue Hongyi and cursed, “Do you know what is going on,
right now? Why have I come here? Go ask the members of Snowdragon
Mountain this question! Dong Fanyu, hurry up and go speak to your
uncle-master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Fanyu was nervous.
“Dong Fanyu.” Atop the red cloud, Xue Hongyi gave him a glance
and verified that it was indeed Dong Fanyu. Prior to coming, he
naturally had familiarized himself with the appearances of the
members of the Swallow Mountain branch. Earlier, when passing through
Snowdragon City, he had discovered that there wasn’t even a single
Zifu Disciple present. “What is going on, Fanyu? Why has this young
master of the Marquisate of Stillwater come here?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dong Fanyu hurriedly
said, “This young master of the Marquisate is the Marquisate’s
envoy. He has come to sign a transfer agreement with the Ji clan.”
“Transfer agreement?” Xue Hongyi frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Northmont Baiwei
laughed loudly. “Your fellow disciples of Snowdragon Mountain,
including Adept Xu Li, all died here, because they wanted to forcibly
take this elemental ore mine. However, this elemental ore mine has
already been transferred to the Marquisate of Stillwater; naturally,
we will protect the Ji clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if you came
with a military order specifically specifying the Ji clan as to be
apprehended, the high level members of your Raindragon Guard would
need to come to an accord with the Marquisate of Stillwater on this
matter.” Baiwei snapped. “In addition, carry a message from me to
the Primal Daoists of your Snowdragon Mountain. The Ji clan is under
the protection of the Marquisate of Stillwater! Let him be wiser in
his actions!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xue Hongyi, hearing
this, ground his teeth. “Fine.” Xue Hongyi immediately flew away
atop his red cloud, transforming into a streak of red light that
quickly disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Northmont Baiwei
wished to help the Ji clan due to personal reasons, he, Xue Hongyi,
would’ve dared to rely on his status as a Raindragon Guard to
struggle against him. But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If this person came in
the capacity of envoy, and had signed a transfer agreement, he was
currently representing the entire Marquisate of Stillwater! If the
Marquisate declared that someone was under their protection, then
within the borders of Stillwater Commandery, not even Raindragon
Guards would dare to interfere. If a truly evil and vicious criminal
was within the Ji clan, they would still need to go negotiate with
the Marquisate of Stillwater. Only after the Marquisate gave its
blessing would the Raindragon Guard go make the arrest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, young
master.” “Thank you, young master, for saving our Ji clan.” The
members of the Ji clan watched as the red-clothed youngster departed.
All of them spoke with great joy. Previously, when they had heard
that this person had come on orders from the Raindragon Guard, they
had been so terrified that their hearts had trembled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said hurriedly as
well, “Thank you, young master Baiwei.” “I came here to sign a
transfer agreement. It is my duty to guarantee your safety.” Baiwei
laughed softly. “That fellow name Xue Hongyi, he dressed himself in
the imperial garbs of the Raindragon Guard, but he forgot his
station! How dare he act so arrogantly in front of the Marquisate of
Stillwater? Hmph! Nothing more than Snowdragon Mountain!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ji clan, listening,
all felt envious. These words were utterly domineering. Nothing more
than Snowdragon Mountain! To the Marquisate of Stillwater, Snowdragon
Mountain was nothing more than one of the powers under its dominion.
If the Marquisate was angered, it wouldn’t be hard for it to
completely uproot the entire Snowdragon Mountain. But to the Ji clan,
Snowdragon Mountain was an enormous creature, while the Marquisate
was an even more unimaginably powerful behemoth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From far away, two
figures flew over. They quickly landed on the ship’s deck. They
were warriors, dressed in armor. One of them said respectfully,
“Reporting to the young master: We have finished our
investigations. This elemental ore mine has a circumference of four
thousand kilometers, and is more than three hundred kilometers deep.
The quality is extremely high, and there are even quite a few
high-grade elemental stones.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Baiwei nodded
slightly with satisfaction, then laughed as he looked towards Ning
and Ninefire. “Patriarch Ninefire of the Ji clan and Ji Ning, the
two of you can follow me into the main hall, where we shall sign the
transfer agreement.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ninefire
and Ning all acknowledged as they followed Baiwei into the second
floor of the hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were two scrolls
lying on a table within the room. The wording on both scrolls was
identical; they were both transfer agreements. They described how the
division would be, how the Ji clan would be protected; everything was
explained in detail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take out your
official writ for the City of Ten Thousand Swords. Press the insignia
of it against it as a seal, then sign your names.” Northmont Baiwei
said. “The grand seal of the Marquisate is already there. We are
simply waiting for your seals now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Ninefire
exchanged glances. Not hesitating at all, they immediately signed
their names and sealed both documents.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One of the
agreements will be left with you. The other will belong to the
Marquisate.” Baiwei smiled. “This is all according to the rules.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire immediately
laughed. “Our Ji clan is boundlessly overjoyed to have survived
this tribulation. 70% of this elemental ore mine shall belong to the
Marquisate, but for our Ji clan, 10% is enough. The remaining 20%,
our Ji clan would like to offer to you, young master, to thank you
for saving our Ji clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire was a sly old
fellow who had lived for nearly four centuries. How crafty was he? He
knew very well that although on the surface, 30% of this elemental
ore mine was to belong to the Ji clan, in reality, that amount would
be secretly whittled down. It was better for them to directly offer
it to an important person, so as to gain that person’s favor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need.” Baiwei
smiled. “As soon as Ji Ning and I met each other, it felt as though
we were two old friends. Don’t worry. There will be no ‘whittling
down’ of your share of the elemental ore mine. Who would dare try
to seize something belonging to my friend?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Friend? Ning’s heart
turned warm. Baiwei continued, “I will arrange for soldiers to take
responsibility for excavating this elemental ore mine. When the time
comes, your Ji clan can take responsibility for mining out the actual
ore. The elemental ore you mine out can simply be sent to the
soldiers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ninefire
hurriedly nodded. “Mm.” Baiwei nodded gently as well. Ninefire,
seeing that this person still wished to speak with Ning, immediately
said, “If there’s nothing else, I will leave.” And then, he
departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only ones left in
the hall were Ning, Baiwei, and the two maids.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning,” Baiwei
said, “You have had such incredible accomplishments, even within
the Ji clan; your innate talent vastly surpasses that of that‘Xue
Hongyi’ fellow’s. I urge you not to spend too much time in a
small place such as this. The vast world is the place you truly
belong. In the future, you will definitely become a momentous figure
within the entire Stillwater Commandery.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said hurriedly,
“Young master Baiwei, you praise me too highly. However, very soon,
I will go out adventuring.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Baiwei nodded
slightly. Ning continued, “I have always been interested about one
thing. Dare I ask, young master, how is it that you arrived at the Ji
clan so quickly? It most likely would’ve taken quite some time for
the news that the Ji clan has found an elemental ore mine to even
make its way to the Marquisate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the Marquisate of
Stillwater hadn’t arrived when he did, the Ji clan most likely
would’ve had no end of troubles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” Baiwei
laughed. “Do you know how this elemental ore mine was formed?”
Ning shook his head puzzled. “I…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Baiwei smiled. “This
elemental ore mine was formed after a magical formation was set up by
a Primal Daoist who was training here in seclusion to try and make a
breakthrough. The formation drew in and condensed boundless amounts
of natural, elemental energy, finally resulting in the formation of
this giant elemental ore mine. As for that Primal Daoist, he broke
through to the Earth Immortal stage.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Earth Immortal?”
Ning was startled. So that underground stone room was where the Earth
Immortal had stayed. “That Earth Immortal is known as Immortal
Firedragon.” Baiwei said. “After making his breakthrough, he was
invited to join the Marquisate of Stillwater. In his welcoming
banquet, my father spoke with him and quickly learned of the
existence of an elemental ore mine here, and that it was within the
Ji clan’s territory. Thus, I was given this mission and came to
sign the transfer agreement with your Ji clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now understood. So
it hadn’t been the Ji clan making a report; rather, it was that the
Marquisate had already known of this. No wonder they had arrived so
quickly!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. This matter
is now at an end. I won’t stay here any longer. If you, brother Ji,
have anything further that you need, you can come find me. I will
definitely show the hospitality expected of a host.” Northmont
Baiwei laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Definitely.” Ning
responded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Oxhorn Mountain. The
Netherwyrm Heavenlock Formation had been collected. The members of
the Ji clan raised their heads, staring towards the distant horizon.
That warship had already departed, leaving behind only eight Zifu
Disciple level soldiers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cough.” Ji
Yichuan, who up till now had maintained a fierce aura, suddenly
seemed to grow fragile. His face turned ashen, and he began to cough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father.” Ning
turned his head towards his father, Yichuan.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 38 - Leaving Swallow Mountain
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Yichuan coughed, his
face ashen. Seeing the worried look on his son’s face, he couldn’t
help but laugh. “Previously, I used multiple forbidden techniques.
My Zifu has been twisting and contorting, and is on the verge of
collapse. Thus, my body has suddenly grown much weaker.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Used multiple
forbidden techniques?” Ning was astonished. “Father, then, you…”
“Hahaha.” Yichuan laughed jubilantly as he stroked Ning’s head.
“This battle was the last battle I would ever fight. Afterwards, I
will become a useless cripple. Naturally, I had to use as many
forbidden techniques as I could.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face changed.
Forbidden techniques were enormously harmful to the body; they relied
on sacrificing the body’s future longevity, then using that to
reach a level of power beyond that which was normally possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yichuan, your
body…?” Ji Ninefire’s face changed as well. “I should be able
to live for another month.” Yichuan said. “A month!” Ning’s
face instantly turned white, without any trace of blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why. Why had it ended
up like this? He…he had clearly made it back in time. Why did it
have to be like this?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Yichuan
looked at his son. “You’ve seen so much life and death. Can it be
that you still do not understand? To me, living a life akin to a
cripple’s would be a life of torture. I would rather die gloriously
after my final, greatest battle…that the fate to which I belong.”
Ning’s body was faintly trembling as he listened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition, your
mother has been waiting for me for too long. I should go accompany
her.” Yichuan looked at his son. Looked at him closely. “After
your mother died, the only thing keeping me here was you. But you no
longer need my protection. You are now capable of truly spreading
your wings and roaming about the world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, Father…”
Ning looked at his father, his eyes turning moist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had survived a
tremendous tribulation. They should have been overjoyed, but Ning
simply couldn’t find it in himself to rejoice, no matter what.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed by. Ning
spent every single day with his father. Each time, the two of them,
father and son, would train in swordplay with each other. Although
they were simply sparring and displaying their techniques, the two of
them fully absorbed themselves within their fights. By their side, a
snowy white hound would often appear. At other times, a young
Bluestone would appear. Still other times, their steward, Autumn
Leaf, would watch from the side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally…that day
came.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan reclined on his
seat. The Whitewater Hound was in its original form and by Yichuan’s
side, its head gently nudging against Yichuan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little White.”
Yichuan gently stroked the fur atop the Whitewater Hound’s head.
“To have had a brother like you in my life…I die with no
regrets.” The Whitewater Hound lowered its head, its tears falling
down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Yichuan
looked at the nearby Ning. “Originally, I wanted to let Little
White regain his freedom. However, as a Zifu-level Godbeast, I’m
afraid that after he regains his free will, he will be captured by
other Immortal practitioners. In addition, Little White has watched
you grow up and is very close to you. I want to have him follow you.
This is my wish, and it is also Little White’s wish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded lightly.
“Alright.” Yichuan looked at his lifelong brother. “Little
White. Help me take care of Ji Ning. When I’m going, you will be
Ning’s elder relative. Make sure you keep him from going astray.”
The Whitewater Hound nodded lightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From within his
clothes, Yichuan retrieved a piece of beast skin parchment, handing
it over to Ning. “I know that you deeply desire to know who it was
that killed your uncle and harmed myself and your mother so badly.
The name is on this, along with some information about him. I
originally wanted to let Grandfather give it to you, but since I
survived and returned from Oxhorn Mountain, I decided to give it to
you personally.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning accepted the beast
skin, his eyes flashing with a fierce light. Grinding his teeth, he
said, “I swear that I, Ji Ning, will definitely kill them and take
revenge!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan nodded. “I
won’t stop you from taking revenge. However, remember this. In the
hearts of myself and your mother, your life is far more valuable than
theirs.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “I
understand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Yichuan could
clearly sense his life force ebbing away. His breathing grew weak.
Smiling, he said, “Remember. After I die, cremate me and scatter my
ashes over Serpentwing Lake. I once promised your mother that after I
died, I would accompany her.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning forced back his
tears as he listened. “In my life,” Yichuan continued, “I was
fearless and worry-free as a child, hard-working as a youth, and
relied on the sword in my hand to became famous throughout Swallow
Mountain.” He stared towards the empty skies, his gaze growing
distant. “I once swore that I would rely on the sword in my hand to
make my name resonate throughout the boundless lands of the Grand Xia
Dynasty! Unfortunately…I won’t be able to accomplish it.
However…my son will accomplish it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan looked at Ning.
His eyes were filled with endless expectations. “Ji Ning. You will
accomplish it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sour feeling was in
Ning’s heart. He could still clearly remember how his father had
taught him, step by step, how to use the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From today onwards,
I will train you in the sword.” He was only a toddler. His father
had seemed so tall, so muscular, so big. Starting from those thirteen
basic sword stances, his father had taught him, step by step…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now understood
that at that moment in time, his father, whose own Immortal path had
been shattered, had entrusted his expectations in the sword to Ning
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will accomplish
it.” Ning looked at his father and made gave his word. “Father, I
will accomplish it. I definitely will. I will definitely make my name
resound throughout the boundless lands of the Grand Xia Dynasty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan reached out
with his hand, gently stroking Ning’s face. His hand was trembling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember. Live a
good life. Live an exciting life.” Yichuan’s voice was beginning
to fade, but his smile only grew brighter and brighter. “Live a
happy life. A happy, free life…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His father’s hand
suddenly went limp, and his eyes closed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thud.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning fell to his knees,
pressing his head to the ground, grinding his teeth. “AAAAAH!”
Ning suddenly aised his head again, letting out a loud howl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Whitewater Hound
used its head to gently nudge Yichuan’s body. As it did, tears
appeared in the corner of its eyes as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No one was aware of
what had happened. Ji Yichuan died quietly. Only Ji Ning and the
Whitewater Hound were by his side. The other servants on Brightheart
Island did not have any idea.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Splash.” “Splash.”
A boat was floating about atop Serpentwing Lake. Ning was at the helm
of the boat, holding a crematory urn while sprinkling the ashes
within the urn towards the water of the lake, letting the wind pick
it up and merge it into the lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The glow of the setting
sun was around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A small boat. A
solitary youth. A large, snowy white hound. Together, they slowly
drifted on the lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t
immediately leave Swallow Mountain. He continued to live atop
Brightheart Island, within Serpentwing Lake. He also made a trip to
the underwater estate, where he challenged and passed the second
level of the Wargod Hall! The second level, to the current Ning,
posed no danger whatsoever. Afterwards, Ning selected yet another
Mortal-ranked magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed, and in the
blink of an eye, autumn left and winter arrived. There were large
goose-feathers of snow falling down from the skies in the outside
world. As for Ning, he sat within his study, executing swordplay
techniques with his fingers, then recording a few things down on a
beastskin parchment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Autumn Leaf.” Ning
called out. “Young master.” Autumn Leaf soon pushed the door open
and walked in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arrange for some
people to notify the City of Ten Thousand Swords and West Prefecture
City.” Ning said. “Tell them that I am leaving.” Autumn Leaf
was stunned, and she looked at Ning. “Leaving? Young master, are
you going to leave Swallow Mountain?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf had known
long ago that this day would come. Her young master was a supreme
talent, the likes of which was rarely seen in the world. Sooner or
later, he would leave Swallow Mountain. But now that this day had
actually arrived, Autumn Leaf still felt heartsick and unwilling to
part from him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You truly are
foolish.” Ning walked forward, reaching out and wiping away Autumn
Leaf’s tears. “I need to go out on a good adventure. The world is
so vast, and there are so many experts within it. I can’t just hide
here and bask in my own self-importance.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood. Autumn
Leaf understands.” Autumn Leaf said hurriedly. “Autumn Leaf.”
Ning took out a kalestone and handed it to her. “This kalestone has
some treasures within. I have prepared them for you and Bluestone.
Spring Grass died. Although I am leaving, I have to take good care of
Bluestone. There is a book within the kalestone that carefully
details the ways in which these treasures can be used.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Amongst them is an
essence-cleansing pill which I acquired from that Wanxiang Adept.
After eating it, one will qualitatively transform and rise in power,
making the likelihood of you entering the Xiantian lifeform stage
become much higher.” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…this is too
precious.” Autumn Leaf, shocked, hurriedly refused. Ning looked at
Autumn Leaf. “The path of Immortal cultivation is a long one. I
don’t want to see you die early on, Autumn Leaf. If you become a
Xiantian lifeform, you will live longer. Don’t refuse…perhaps in
places like Swallow Mountain, essence-cleansing pills are precious,
but to formidable figures like Wanxiang Adepts, they aren’t much at
all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Live longer.”
Autumn Leaf nodded gently, no longer refusing. She looked at Ning.
“Young master, will you return?” “Of course.” Ning sighed as
he spoke. “I will definitely return. Here within Serpentwing Lake,
there are many things which I cannot bear to part from. Once I have
reached my goals in training, I will return and live here at
Serpentwing Lake permanently.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will wait for you,
young master.” Autumn Leaf looked at Ning. Ning laughed. “Don’t
just wait pointlessly. If you do meet someone you like, then marry
him.” Autumn Leaf shook her head. “I am your handmaiden, young
master. I will be your handmaiden for my entire life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t say
anything further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The next day. The
outside world was covered with a decorative silver layer of snow. The
snow was so white, so pure. Ji Young, Ji Redflower, Ji Ninefire, Ji
Truekeep, and the other members of the Ji clan had all hurried here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are some
secret manuals that I managed to acquire by a stroke of good
fortune.” Ning handed them over to Patriarch Ninefire. “Most of
them are comparable to the [Melody of Ten Thousand Swords] or the
[Raindrop Sutra].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This scroll records
the insights on formations by a Loose Immortal, known as the [Nine
Scrolls on Formations].” Ning handed this to Patriarch Ninefire as
well. “The profound mysteries within are unfathomable. However, to
study formations requires talent and time. In the future, I hope that
it can be entrusted to a suitable clansman.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninefire, Truekeep, and
the others were all shocked. The insights of a Loose Immortal
regarding formations?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for this, this is
known as the [Thunderflame Sword Addendum].” Ning took out a
fur-clad book. “This was developed based on my hypotheses regarding
the fragments of the [Thunderflame Sword] we possess. It includes
some of my own insights regarding swordplay. I was able to create
four additional sword techniques, and thus this [Thunderflame Sword
Addendum] has a total of seven major sword techniques.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As for this…over
the course of the last half year, I have spent virtually all my
energy and effort on creating this.” Ning took out another fur-clad
book. It had three characters written on it: ‘Rain’ ‘Water’
‘Sutra’. “The set of sword techniques recorded within, I named
the [Rainwater Sutra]. In the future, if anyone in our Ji clan can
reach the level of mastery in the [Raindrop Sutra], they can learn
from this [Rainwater Sutra].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at the book
within his hands, filled with emotions. Over the past half year, he
had pondered nonstop regarding this. He had summarized all of the
insights he had gained regarding the ‘Dao of Rainwater’, then
written it all down into this [Rainwater Sutra]. The summarization
process had caused Ning to make great strides in further
understanding the Dao of Rainwater as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the person who had
comprehended the Rainwater Sword Domain, the [Rainwater Sutra] he had
written contained hundreds of different layers of insight regarding
the True Meaning of the Dao. Even his every stroke of the brush had
contained sword-intent within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This…” Ninefire
and the others, upon seeing the three large words imprinted atop the
[Rainwater Sutra], could sense the sword-intent pouring from this
tome. Their faces all changed. As experts, they could sense how
extraordinary this [Rainwater Sutra] was. Even they felt the
awe-inspiring presence from it; no wonder Ji Ning required
practitioners to master the [Raindrop Sutra] before learning from his
[Rainwater Sutra].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From today onwards,
the [Rainwater Sutra] will be the treasure that protects our entire
Ji clan.” Ninefire said with incomparable excitement. The other
clansmen were all excited as well. For the clan to produce a genius
was a matter of luck, but for this book to be left behind would allow
them to raise more geniuses in the future. This [Rainwater Sutra] was
clearly above the level of the [Melody of Ten Thousand Swords] and
other secret manuals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t ask for
others to send him off. He had Ninefire and the others all go back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Late at night. It was
very quiet. Ning, by himself, led the Whitewater Hound to the side of
the lake, then knelt down atop the snow. Facing the endless waters of
Serpentwing Lake, he kowtowed three times, then said solemnly,
“Father, Mother, I, Ji Ning, will execute our enemies within
Snowdragon Mountain and take revenge for the two of you. I will also
definitely make my name resound within the vast lands of the Grand
Xia Dynasty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please forgive your
son for having to depart for a time.” Ning rose to his feet, then
looked at the Whitewater Hound by his side. “Uncle White, let’s
go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That little girl…”
The Whitewater Hound sent to Ning. Ning glanced towards the distance.
There stood Autumn Flower, far away in the darkness. Autumn Flower
knew that Ning was going to leave, so she hadn’t slept at all. She
was waiting quietly. Upon her seeing Ning look towards her, she
couldn’t help but cry. Ning grinned towards her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
stepped onto the boat that had appeared out of nowhere in front of
him, and the Whitewater Hound followed him onto it as well. Whoosh!
The boat soared rapidly into the air, piercing through the dark night
skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
Autumn Leaf immediately ran forward a few steps. Raising her head,
she stared towards the distance. “I will definitely wait for your
return, young master. Definitely.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The night sky. The
flying boat was amidst the clouds. Ning looked down at the vast,
endless world. He could see the massive lake below him as well:
Serpentwing Lake. He could also see Brightheart Island at the center
of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gave it a deep,
meaningful look. There were too many things here which he couldn’t
bear to part from.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go!” Ning
turned his head, staring towards the vast, endless night sky. Outside
Swallow Mountain, there was an even larger, even more exciting world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying boat had
only a youngster and a snowy white dog atop it. It quickly
disappeared into the horizons of the world.
