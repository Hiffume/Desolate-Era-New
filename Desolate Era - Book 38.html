<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Fate
had never been kind to Ji Ning. Wracked by illnesses and infirm his
entire life on Earth, Ning knew early on that he would die as a
teenager. What he didn’t know was that there really was such a
thing as life after death, and that the multiverse was a far larger
place than he thought. A lucky twist of fate (one of the few in
Ning’s life) meant that Ning was reborn into a world of Immortals
and monsters, of Ki Refiners and powerful Fiendgods, a world where
Dynasties lasted for millions of years. A world which is both
greater…and yet also smaller…than he ever could imagine. He would
have the opportunity to join them, and in this life, Ning swore to
himself, he would never let himself be weak again! The Era he was
born into was a Desolate one, but Ning would make it his era.

Chapter 1: First Autarch Meeting</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Vastheaven
Palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ever
since the Jadefire Realm affair had concluded, the disciples of
Vastheaven Palace had returned to their headquarters. Vastheaven
Palace was now even more bustling than it had been in the past.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ji
Ning.” Emperor Solesky called out as he hurried towards Ning’s
residence. Emperor Solesky’s true body was now within the Dao
Alliance’s Palace of Immortals as one of their members, and he was
on quite good terms with Emperor Goldisle and Emperor Blackcloud.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Big
brother Solesky, what has you in such a rush?” The golden-robed
Ning was fishing relaxedly by himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Something
big just happened!” Emperor Solesky’s eyes were huge and round as
he whispered, “The Dao Alliance just received word and told me to
inform you about this right away. Autarch Titanos has already left
his estate and is heading towards the Flamedragon Realmverse. He
could be arriving any moment now!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“WHAT?!”
Ning’s entire body trembled for a moment before he came back to his
senses. He tossed down the fishing rod, jumped to his feet, then said
frantically: “When is Autarch Titanos arriving and where?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
can’t be sure. His estate is extremely far away from us, but as an
Autarch he moves incredibly fast. No one knows how long it would take
him to get here!” Emperor Solesky continued, “He might appear in
the next instant, but if he takes a few detours on the way it might
take him a few chaos cycles.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
felt his entire body tense up. Even though his Dao-heart was
tremendously resilient, he still felt extremely nervous. “He’s
finally coming.” Ning let out a long breath, his eyes filled with
excitement. “I’ve waited so long and fought so hard. Finally,
this day has come.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Not
even the Daomerge would’ve inspired such excitement in Ning. He
truly was eager to be able to bring Yu Wei back to life and reunite
with her. With his wife by his side, he would be more than satisfied
with living a life of a hundred thousand chaos cycles. This would be
far better than an endless life of loneliness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right,
right! The realmship.” Ning suddenly came back to his senses. “I
need to go bring the realmship back and be ready for him at any
moment.” Autarch Titanos needed Ning to give him the realmship in
exchange for his help. It would be extremely awkward if Ning didn’t
have the realmship on him!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Terror Starsea. The Jadefire Realm. The Flamewing God remained
trapped within the second hidden room, while Ning, Azurefiend, and
Whitethaw were by its side.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flamewing,”
Ning called out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,”
Flamewing responded obediently. After spending five chaos cycles with
Ning, it had grown accustomed to addressing Ning as ‘master’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
need to go out and handle some business. It shouldn’t take too
long,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
are going to come back, right?” Flamewing felt a strong sense of
attachment towards Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
couldn’t help but feel a bit of a headache. The legendary Chaos
Primordial was like a child! All Ning could do was to say, “Don’t
worry, I’ll definitely come back. Just take a quick nap. I’ll be
back by the time you wake up. The next time I see you, it’ll be
time for me to deal with those chains of yours.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Flamewing nodded repeatedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’re
off.” Ning immediately turned and left through the giant, ancient
copper gate, with Azurefiend and Whitethaw flying out by his side.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Flamewing
watched as Ning left. Once the great gate swung shut, it finally sat
back down once again. However, it had long ago grown accustomed to
loneliness, and so it quickly shut its eyes and entered a state of
slumber once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
short while later, Ning, Azurefiend, and Whitethaw reached the other
hidden room within the Jadefire Realm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
this is the Jadefire Realm’s formation-diagram?” Hegemon
Azurefiend stared at the enormous flower-like formation-diagram on
the altar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.
What, are you capable of understanding and mastering it?” Ning
laughed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
don’t understand it at all. This formation seems very odd; it’s
completely different from the other formations I’ve analyzed.”
Hegemon Azurefiend shook his head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
smiled. The Sithe had indeed embarked upon a unique path with regards
to the art of formations, a path that was very different from the
ones which cultivators walked. Without knowing the proper techniques,
it truly would be extremely difficult to even understand how these
formations worked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning waved his hand, causing a stream of fire to instantly descend
from him and form into the body of an Emperor-class golem. This was
one of the many golems which Ning had acquired from the Sithe ruins
in the Stone Hellephant Wall.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is the control technique which governs the flaming passageways and
the outermost areas in the Jadefire Realm.” Ning tossed a jade slip
over. “Hurry up and master it. Once you do, take control over the
Jadefire Realm for me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,”
the flaming Emperor-class golem said respectfully. Ning had only
given it the most basic of control techniques. Now that Ning fully
understood how the technique worked, it was easy for him to develop a
new control techniques of his own. However, this technique could only
be used to control the outer perimeter and the flaming passageways.
The techniques governing the prison regions were all quite complex.
For now, not even Ning was able to tell them apart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Remember,
there is a Hegemon within the flaming passageways.” Ning pointed at
a tiny little dot located in one of the countless passageways. “Keep
a close watch on him! Once he starts to run around, immediately
activate some of the most powerful mechanisms and kill him, or at
least trap him and send him into the prison regions.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood,”
the Emperor-class golem responded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
of course, he’s so terrified of dying that I expect he won’t move
around.” After making the necessary arrangements, Ning relaxed
slightly. “This place is now in your hands. Azurefiend, Whitethaw,
let’s go.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
didn’t feel the need to hold things back from Azurefiend, as the
lifeblood oaths binding a retainer were quite strong. He had to go
back to the Flamedragon Realmverse, which meant he couldn’t
continue to use a divine power clone to maintain the
formation-diagram. As a result, his only option was to rely on his
golems. Emperor-class golems were extremely intelligent, and it
wouldn’t be hard for them to control some basic formations. It must
be remembered that when major powers died, they’d often use
formation-spirits, treasure-spirits, or powerful golems to control
their legacy sites and await their successors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Golems
had infinite lifespans and would never betray their master unless
they were forcibly bound. Thus, both the Sithe and the cultivators
delighted in using golems.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
having finished with his other arrangements, Ning led the two in
flying in the realmship and departing from the flaming passageways.
The Jadefire Realm simply had far too many of those flaming
passageways, and they were all extremely long. Even though the
realmship had been repaired and was able to fly quite quickly, it
still took them two days to pass through the flaming passageways.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
the exit.” Ning was quite familiar with the formation-diagram and
thus knew where the breaches in the Jadefire Realm were. It had been
thoroughly wrecked, after all. Ning was able to easily exit while
following the breaches.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh.
The realmship charged through the flames, quickly discovering a
giant, cavernous gap which it was able to exit through. After flying
for roughly an hour and repeatedly changing directions, they managed
to leave the Jadefire Realm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
need to get back to the Flamedragon Realmverse as soon as possible.
Autarch Titanos could come at any moment.” Ning was so excited that
his eyes were slightly bloodshot. This was the most important goal in
his path of cultivation, after all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hey
kid! Calm down, there’s no rush.” A voice suddenly rang out by
his ears.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had just flown out of the Jadefire Realm. He couldn’t help but turn
his head, startled, only to see a bald black-robed elder standing in
the void in front of him. This bald old man had a pair of golden eyes
and two fleshy antennae growing out of his head. The antennae waved
at him in an amused fashion, while the old man had a smile on his
face as well. Anyone who saw him would feel the urge to laugh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The bald old man suddenly vanished into thin air.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning was startled. “Where did he go?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
right here,” the bald old man said merrily.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
turned his head, only to realize that the bald old man was standing
right next to him. Ning couldn’t help but feel speechless. The old
man had been able to enter the realmship without him even realizing
it… this was a level of ability that vastly outstripped Ning’s
imagination. It must be remembered that he was the master of the
realmship, and that he was in complete control of it… and yet, this
person had suddenly appeared right before him inside of it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth
greets you, Autarch.” Ning hurriedly bowed respectfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Azurefiend
greets you, Autarch,” Hegemon Azurefiend said respectfully as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whitethaw
stood right next to Ning. He bowed respectfully as well, but he
didn’t say a word.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Both
Ning and Azurefiend were major powers of extraordinary power ability.
They had seen far more than most, and they naturally saw right away
how terrifying this bald old man was. For example… they couldn’t
see any lines of karma binding this bald old man at all. It must be
remembered that any cultivator who was alive would be linked to
others by karma, but they weren’t able to sense any karma lines at
all on the old man. This was absolutely inconceivable.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Quite
clever.” The bald old man chortled as he turned his gaze towards
the Jadefire Realm. “The Seven Flaming Hells. Truly impressive. The
Sithe truly were formidable, to be able to capture a Chaos Primordial
and use it as their energy source for this facility and then absorb
its power with such ease. Judging from that Chaos Primordial’s
truesoul… it should already have a master. Is it you, kid?” The
bald old man looked at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was stunned. He had always heard of how incredible Autarchs were, but
he never would’ve imagined that an Autarch would be able to simply
glance at the Jadefire Realm and immediately know that there was a
Chaos Primordial there, AND know that Ning was its master. No wonder
even the mighty Sithe had ended up falling before the Autarchs and
the cultivator civilizations. The Autarchs were simply incredible.
They had all reached utterly inconceivable levels of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">To
Autarchs, even Chaos Primordials were nothing. They were capable of
slaying the creatures with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
I am its master,” Ning said.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_002__Daom"></A>
Chapter 2: Ning’s Nervousness</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Chaos
Primordials are born from within the prime essences of the vast
Chaosverse. They are blessed by the prime essences and born with
tremendous karmic luck. The vast majority of cultivators will never
have a chance to even encounter one of these creatures.” The bald
old man looked at Ning, a smile on his face as he offered his
congratulations: “Although you also have tremendous karmic luck,
you still can’t compare to that Chaos Primordial. I imagine it
wasn’t easy for you to run into it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning was briefly startled, but he quickly understood. It was indeed
true that running into Chaos Primordials was incredibly rare, due to
how much the prime essences of the Chaosverse doted upon them.
Indeed, Ning himself had entered the Jadefire Realm many chaos cycles
ago, but he had to undergo countless hardships before managing to
solve the formation-diagram and thus have the chance to meet the
Chaos Primordial.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
from another perspective, this was also proof that in the long run,
being ‘blessed with karmic luck’ and ‘beloved by the prime
essences’ didn’t count for THAT much. The Chaos Primordial had
still been trapped by the Sithe for countless years, right?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
had to solve the Jadefire Realm’s formation-diagram before I was
able to meet the Chaos Primordial,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Treat
it well. It will be of great help to you. Come, let us go to your
homeland,” the bald old man said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
As soon as these words came out, spacetime twisted around them and
everything became illusory and dreamlike. By the time spacetime went
back to normal, Ning immediately saw a chaosworld off in the
distance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ve
already left the Terror Starsea?” Ning was immediately able to
sense the location of his avatar and Primaltwin and thus knew where
he was. He couldn’t help but feel a sense of awe, but he was able
to keep his expression calm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
take you to my homeland right away, senior,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Wait,
wait. Not just yet. I teleported your realmship here because there’s
a young fellow that needs rescuing,” the bald old man immediately
called out. With a swoosh, he flew out of the realmship and towards
that distant chaosworld.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Needs
rescuing? Needs rescuing by an exalted AUTARCH?!” Ning and
Azurefiend shared a glance, both feeling rather puzzled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh.
Swoosh. Ning put away the realmship for now, then flew towards that
chaosworld as well. Azurefiend and Whitethaw followed close behind.
Once they flew into the chaosworld…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
Daolord Cleardust, you’ve been trapped with my formation and have
nowhere to run. In a mere thirty thousand years, the power of my
formation will have ground you into dust and wiped out your truesoul.
Did you think, young fellow, that you would be able to defeat me just
because you broke through to become a Samsara Daolord? This
chaosworld shall remain mine. No one can violate my will!” A
red-haired old man was seated at the peak of a mountain, staring
downwards into a valley.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
valley was filled with rolling black clouds and billowing flames.
Every so often, one could see a fragile-looking youth seated in the
air in the lotus position. He was suffering all sorts of torment. The
youth sat there in the lotus position, murmuring a chant while
completely ignoring the red-haired elder.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
established this chaosworld as my estate, and thus all the living
creatures within it are subject to my will. All shall be as I will
it! I never would’ve imagined that this chaosworld would actually
give birth to a freakishly talented genius like yourself. You
actually managed to reach the Samsara Daolord level because of a few
so-called legacies I left behind out of boredom.” The red-haired
elder was in a good mood, as victory was clearly at hand. “You, a
Daolord of the First Step, actually managed to fight me to a
standstill even though I am a Daolord of the Third Step. I truly
admire you very much. In the outside world, someone as talented as
you would probably be recruited by one of the major organizations.
Unfortunately, you shall die here.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
you shall die here!” A voice suddenly rang out, followed by a giant
foot descending from the heavens. Sploosh! The giant foot stomped
down upon the red-haired old man, smushing him into the ground. The
red-haired man instantly stopped moving.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
owner of the foot descended from the heavens. It was a merry-looking
bald old man. Moments later, Ning, Azurefiend, and Whitethaw all
descended as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
wonder this chaosworld was protected by so many barriers. I imagine
most Daolords of the Second Step and even Daolords of the Third Step
would be unable to pass through them,” Ning sent mentally. “So
this was the estate of that deceased Daolord over there.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch
Titanos intervened for the sake of that kid?” Azurefiend glanced
downwards at the valley.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
bald old man had already walked down into the valley, easily tearing
apart and destroying the formations. He was chatting with that
fragile-looking youth, whose gaze was calm and distant. It was as
though the youth had long ago seen and suffered countless torments
and had endured everything one could endure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hahaha.
That Daolord over there… just judging from his gaze, I can sense
that he has experienced much pain,” Azurefiend said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
chaosworld is an absolute hell.” Ning swept the area with his gaze,
seeing everything there was to see within this chaosworld. That
demonic Daolord had clearly delighted in tormenting and abusing all
the living creatures of this chaosworld, treating them as his
playthings.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
short while later… “Time to go.” The bald old man returned to
Ning’s side.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Ning and Azurefiend cast a final glance to ‘Daolord Cleardust’,
who remained within the gorge. Daolord Cleardust looked back at these
foreign cultivators, a slightly confused look in his eyes. He had no
idea who was before him. One was a terrifyingly powerful golem, one
was a supremely talented Daolord, the third was a Hegemon, and the
old man was an Autarch, supreme amongst the cultivator civilizations.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch.”
While flying away from the chaosworld, Azurefiend couldn’t help but
ask, “Why did you intervene to save a Daolord of the First Step?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Couldn’t
you sense how much karmic luck swirled around him? Of course I had to
aid him,” the bald old man said with a merry grin.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
have to help him because of his karmic luck?” Ning was puzzled.
Karmic luck was just a side benefit; personal power was what truly
mattered. No amount of karmic luck would protect you in the face of
overwhelming power!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Of
course!” The bald old man said hurriedly, “You clearly don’t
understand. Each time I help someone like him out, my own karmic luck
increases as well. When I act in accordance with the will of the
prime essences of the Chaosverse, my own karmic luck will
continuously increase. Do you know what will happen once your karmic
luck reaches an incredibly high level?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
will happen?” Ning was curious.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
sorts of rare and incredible treasures will appear out of nowhere,
almost as though they are throwing themselves at me. I could choose a
random boulder to sit on, and then I’d find out that it was part of
an incredibly rare ore vein. Any random tree I chose to take shade
under could possibly be a spirit-fruit tree of great value.” The
bald old man sighed. “All sorts of treasures will throw themselves
at me. It is quite the pleasant experience.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Buuut…
I’ve come here to help you reverse spacetime to revive a Celestial
Immortal. That goes against the will of the Chaosverse.” The bald
old man sighed again. “Looks like my karmic luck is going to drop
by quite a bit.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">An
awkward look appeared on Ning’s face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
I’m just teasing you. Honestly, karmic luck doesn’t matter all
that much. Once you’ve trained to my level, it really makes no
difference at all. It’s just a little game we play to keep score.”
The bald old man swept the area with his gaze. Boom! Suddenly, the
space around them seemed to retreat as karma, spacetime, and luck all
withdrew from them. A field of absolute void was formed around them,
a region of complete stillness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and Azurefiend could both sense that they were completely unable to
move. This invisible pressure had forced away even the prime essences
of the Chaosverse, to say nothing of them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“See
this? This area is now devoid of the prime essences of the
Chaosverse. This is now my absolute domain.” The bald old man
laughed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
suddenly remembered how the area around the Azureflower Estate was
similarly devoid of all outside types of energy. But of course, the
effect wasn’t as strong as it was right now, where Autarch Titanos
was personally and actively maintaining the effect.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
the end, personal power is what matters the most. Kid, as a
practitioner of an Omega Dao, if you somehow manage to succeed in
your Daomerge you’ll probably understand.” The bald old man
continued, “Alright, hurry up and bring out your realmship. Lead me
to your homeland.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Ning, Azurefiend, and Whitethaw could sense that they were able to
move again. They immediately entered the realmship. Whoosh! After
just a short spacetime blink, the realmship appeared within the void
outside the new Three Realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
bald old man stared at the distant Three Realms, then let out a
surprised breath: “What an impressive chaosworld! Just by looking
at it, I can tell that it is extraordinary. No wonder it was able to
produce a freak of a Daolord like yourself, someone who trains in an
Omega Dao!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
has already been destroyed once.” Ning pointed at the void next to
the new Three Realms. “That place over there used to be my
homeland, a world within the Three Realms which was known as the
‘Grand Xia world’. My Dao-companion used to live by my side
there.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
original Three Realms took up much more space than the new one, as it
had been shattered and splintered into countless pieces. There had
been a Celestial Realm, a Netherworld Kingdom, and three thousand
major worlds that had been scattered across an enormous amount of
space. The new Three Realms was a single complete entity which took
up much less space. The location the Grand Xia had been in was now
just an empty patch of space.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh.
Over here, right?” The bald old man walked over and chuckled while
spacetime churned around him and began to reverse at increasingly
high speeds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoooooosh.
Spacetime continued to reverse, and they quickly reached the scene of
the old Three Realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Slow
down a bit,” Ning urged.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry. I’ll find the old you first,” the bald old man said. “Oh.
There you are.” A projection of the Grand Xia had appeared,
centered around the old Black-White College. The scene was that of
Ning, who had just entered the Black-White College. He was about to
begin his duel against Yu Wei.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Black-White College?” The bald old man pointed towards Yu Wei’s
image. “That should be your wife, yes?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.”
Ning felt as though his blood was boiling from nervousness. It had
been a long, long time since he had been this nervous.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
seems she really did have a big impact on you.” The bald old man
laughed. “Wait for me to reverse the flows of spacetime and bring
her back to life!”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_003__Daom"></A>
Chapter 3: Origins</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh,
right. Where’s the realmship? I conduct business fairly. I have to
take your realmship in payment for reviving your Dao-companion.”
The old man looked at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Here
it is.” At a time like this, the realmship meant absolutely nothing
to Ji Ning. He immediately waved his hand, sending the palm-sized
realmship flying over. Hegemon Azurefiend watched with a rather
agonized look in his eyes, but all he could do was sigh to himself:
“Darknorth truly is willing to sacrifice anything in order to
revive his Dao-companion. A realmship has been lost, just like that.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
bald old man cared as little about the realmship as Ning did. He
waved his hand to accept it, then said solemnly: “None of you are
to disturb me. Stay far away from me as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Ning, Azurefiend, and Whitethaw all immediately retreated off into
the distance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Chaosverse,
I’ve come to steal yet another truesoul fragment from you.” A
hint of a smile appeared on the bald old man’s lips. He then
reached out with both hands, the fleshy antennae on his head
wriggling as a terrifying amount of power began to spread out from
him. He became the absolute master of this area of space.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Condense.”
The bald old man waved a finger, causing the illusory phantom of the
black-robed Yu Wei to begin to light up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom.
Boom. Boom. Countless specks of light began to appear deep within the
incredibly distant prime essences of the Chaosverse. They flew into
the illusory phantom of the black-robed Yu Wei, pulling at her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
has begun.” Ning watched nervously. The illusory Yu Wei was nothing
more than a phantom of the past. In order to make the phantom real,
it had to have a truesoul within it! However, when the living beings
of the Three Realms lost their truesouls, those truesouls would
return to where they came from – the prime essences of the
Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“To
reverse spacetime and revive someone who perished… this is my first
time seeing an Autarch do such a thing,” Hegemon Azurefiend sent
mentally. “Look at how nervous your master is!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whitethaw
looked at Ning, then nodded and sent back, “This is my master’s
deepest desire. Of course he is nervous.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“For
an ordinary mortal to train to such heights and then be able to ask
an Autarch to help him out… I truly do feel a great deal of
admiration for him.” Azurefiend sighed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Both
Azurefiend and Whitethaw were fairly calm. They watched this rare
sight with interest and appreciation, but the only thing Ning felt
was nervousness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
that empty region of space, the bald old Autarch Titanos had already
completely unleashed his power. The black-robed Yu Wei was glimmering
with countless specks of light, and she was becoming increasingly
‘real’. However… gradually, the gathering of the light seemed
to slow down. Some of the light actually started to disappear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?!”
The bald old man’s face tightened, while Ning’s heart shuddered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Get
over here!” A hint of anger flashed past the bald old man’s face,
and more light instantly began to gather around Yu Wei’s phantom
once more. The bald old man’s face became increasingly ugly to
behold, but Yu Wei’s body began to become more and more real.
Slowly, the light that gathered over her eyes caused a look of
sentience to appear within her eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Senior
apprentice-sister.” Ning looked at Yu Wei.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
light-bathed Yu Wei looked back at Ning. A hint of life flashed
through her eyes. She was no longer a phantom of the past; it was as
though a real person was looking back at Ning. Their gazes met… and
in that instant, Ning suddenly felt as though it was all worth it.
Anything was worth it, so long as she could come back to life.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ugh!”
The bald old man suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood. His face was
ashen, and Yu Wei’s phantom immediately began to crumble apart as
the countless specks of light began to dissipate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No…!”
Ning frantically reached out, wanting to claw back the dissipating
light. Alas, the power of the prime essences of the Chaosverse caused
all the specks of light to disappear into nothingness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“DAMNIT!”
The bald old man’s face was ashen. He was so angry that even the
two fleshy antennae on his head were quivering with rage. He howled
furiously, “Prime essences of the Chaosverse, the truesoul
fragments of countless living beings have returned to you upon death.
All I want is to bring a single one of them back! A single truesoul
is nothing to you! Why must you fight me to the death like this? Why
must you seize it back!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
binding power of the prime essences of the Chaosverse was simply too
great. Normally, Hegemons and even Otherverse Lords did not have the
power to try and resist it. Only Autarchs were qualified to make the
attempt.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Is
it worth it?! Is it worth it for you to spend so much effort in
fighting me?!” The old man’s entire body was trembling from rage.
The area around him, however, remained completely in silence. The
prime essences of the Chaosverse made no response at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
bald old man forced down his rage, then turned to look at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch.”
Ning looked at Autarch Titanos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Where
did your Dao-companion come from? I should be able to revive even a
World God with ease, to say nothing of a Celestial Immortal like
her.” The bald old man stared at Ning. “Just now, when I tried to
reverse spacetime and revive your wife, the prime essences of the
Chaosverse fought me so hard, I felt as though I was trying to revive
a Hegemon! Even if I killed myself trying to bring her back, I still
wouldn’t stand much of a chance.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
face turned ashen as well. What?! An Autarch could kill himself
trying to revive Yu Wei? Ning knew that there was no need for Autarch
Titanos to lie to someone like him. In fact, Autarch Titanos had
tried so hard that he had suffered an injury because of it, vomiting
blood as a result.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
is this possible? She’s nothing more than an ordinary Celestial
Immortal of the Three Realms. There was nothing special about her.”
Ning couldn’t understand either. “Why can’t you revive her?
This makes no sense.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
me take a closer look at things.” The bald old man turned to stare
at the surrounding void. Rumble… countless images began to flicker
through the void. These images included what had happened in the new
Three Realms, the events of the old Three Realms, the collision
between the Pangu Chaosworld and the Seamless Chaosworld, and even
the images of what had happened prior to the Pangu Chaosworld being
born.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Countless
images flashed through the void around him…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
that’s how it is.” The bald old man nodded slowly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch?”
Ning looked at the bald old man.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“During
the Dawn War, when we fought against the Sithe… we had a number of
Autarchs on our side,” the bald old man said. “One of them was
named Autarch Awakener.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch
Awakener?” Hegemon Azurefiend had a puzzled look on his face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning,
however, turned pale. He naturally knew that Autarch Awakener had
been the master of the Azureflower Estate. He immediately said, “This
has something to do with Autarch Awakener?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
seem to have heard of Awakener before.” The bald old man laughed.
“The number of people in the vast Chaosverse who were able to
become Autarchs can be counted on just two hands! Autarch Awakener
died long ago. It could be considered a form of suicide.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
died? Suicided?” Azurefiend became increasingly confused. Ning,
however, had heard this long ago and thus simply continued to listen
attentively.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
kid… Worldhearts can be naturally birthed from the primordial
chaos, but there is also a second way a chaosworld’s Worldheart can
be formed. Do you know what that way is?” The bald old man looked
at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“An
Eternal Emperor’s godgems,” Ning said. This was a secret, but
Ning had studied the countless techniques Autarch Awakener had
acquired from the Sithe and the cultivator civilizations. Thus, he
knew these secrets long ago.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
Samsara Daolord could have at most a total of 108,000 godgems in his
divine body. Once he completed his Daomerge, those godgems would
become Eternal godgems and be filled with miraculous powers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
an Eternal Emperor perished, each of his godgems could give birth to
a new chaosworld. The living beings in this chaosworld would
generally be fairly special, and it would give birth to experts at a
slightly higher rate. However, the difference between these
chaosworlds and ordinary chaosworlds wasn’t all that great.
However, the godgems left behind by a deceased Hegemon could give
birth to extremely special chaosworlds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Correct.”
The bald old man nodded. “As you may know, your Three Realms was
born from a collision between the Pangu Chaosworld and the Seamless
Chaosworld… but what you didn’t know was that each was formed
from a godgem.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
godgem?” Ning immediately thought back to the fused and dazzlingly
beautiful Worldheart he had seen when the old Three Realms had been
destroyed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.
Godgems from Autarch Awakener!” the bald old man said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!”
Azurefiend called out in shock.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“An
Autarch’s godgems?!” Ning was stunned as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch
Awakener died, but he made preparations prior to his death. He made
arrangements for all 108,000 of his godgems,” the bald old man
said. “Two of them were sent into the void and ended up becoming a
chaosworld.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
living beings in these two chaosworlds were all blessed with
incredible talent. These two chaosworlds vastly outstripped all other
chaosworlds, and each of them gave birth to as many geniuses as an
entire territory might,” the bald old man said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was starting to understand. No wonder the Pangu Chaosworld and
Seamless Chaosworld had so many freakishly talented people! They
didn’t have any good techniques or legacies, but they were still so
talented that they were able to fight at a higher level of power than
they were at. Once they were given good techniques, they skyrocketed
in power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Later
on, these two chaosworlds collided against each other. Their
Worldhearts smashed together as well, and parts of their Worldhearts
were actually broken off and splintered,” the bald old man said.
“The shattered Worldheart bits were completely melted away and
their power was dispersed upon the countless living beings of the new
world.”</P>

Chapter 4: A Graceful Departure</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning immediately remembered that the Worldheart of the Three Realms
was indeed composed of two damaged crystals that had somehow managed
to fuse together. Both were indeed incomplete, but they had managed
to come together and form a perfect whole.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
other words… small parts of an Autarch’s godgems were completely
dispersed into energy which was bestowed upon the living beings of
that era. That was why all of the living beings in that first era
underwent certain changes,” the bald old man said. “This was why
the woman known as ‘Nuwa’ was able to suddenly break through to
become a World God during that war. She had no techniques and no
teachers, but she was still able to break through! The one known as
Windfiend was also dramatically strengthened during the course of
that battle!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
living creatures below the World-level in that chaosworld were
blessed by the Autarch’s energies,” the bald old man said. “This
was why your master Subhuti, as well as many of those other major
powers, continued to slowly grow more and more powerful. Their
potential continued to deepen as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“As
for the countless ordinary mortals of the Three Realms, all of them
possess tremendous talent. You used to be nothing more than an
ordinary mortal. Back then, the amount of karmic luck you had was
vastly inferior to the amount your master Subhuti and the others
had.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eventually,
you rose to sudden prominence! As your power skyrocketed, you gained
more karmic luck and thus many of the blessings of the Three Realms
became focused upon you. During that battle against the Seamless
Alliance, you finally broke through to a new level of power, draining
away a large amount of karmic luck from the Three Realms.” The bald
old man looked at Ning. “You were blessed with tremendous
potential, becoming the most powerful figure of the Three Realms
Era.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“However…
in the end, karmic luck is secondary. It was primarily your own hard
work which brought you to this point,” the bald old man said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was beginning to slowly understand. He had indeed been blessed by
luck, which was why he was able to make it this far… but every
single powerful cultivator had his own lucky encounters! Take Archon
Silksnow as an example. Although he was a fiendish figure, he had
also experienced many lucky encounters in his life… but in the end,
he had still been forced by Ning to commit suicide.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
more powerful you became, the less of an impact the prime essences of
the Chaosverse would have upon you. There were evil figures who had
butchered entire territories, but they were still living happy lives,
yes? The prime essences of the Chaosverse weren’t able to do
anything to them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Three Realms Era ended, and the new Three Realms began. By now, the
Worldheart is in good shape. There are no longer any godgem
fragments, and so it is impossible for the generations to come in the
new Three Realms to be quite as monstrously talented as the
generation of the Three Realms Era.” The bald old man laughed.
“Your era was a special one which gave birth to special figures. If
you missed it, you missed it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. That era was an era where two Autarch’s godgems had
collided and given birth to a brand new world. It had indeed given
birth to many major powers, including over ten thousand World-level
cultivators and numerous Samsara Daolords, with Ning himself being
the strongest of them. But of course, the vast majority of the living
beings continued to live and die in an unending cycle of life and
death.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Every
single living being born from a chaosworld formed by an Autarch’s
godgem is unique,” the bald old man said. “This is because they
all have a tiny amount of the Autarch’s own essence within them.
Once their souls and truesouls are destroyed, their truesoul
fragments will be immediately taken away by the prime essences of the
Chaosverse and hidden within its depths.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
must understand, long long ago the vast Chaosverse didn’t have that
many living beings within it. It was the prime essences themselves
who gave birth to all things. However… after doing so, as the
living creatures grew stronger the prime essences themselves grew
weaker.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is because, when we cultivate and grow stronger, what we do is draw
upon the energy of the prime essences of the Chaosverse,” the old
man explained. “And when an Autarch rises to power? This is an
incredible event. The rise of every single Autarch is a momentous
occasion for the prime essences of the Chaosverse. Once an Autarch
dies, the prime essences will immediately do their best to absorb as
much of the Autarch’s power as possible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thus,
although it is very easy to revive a living being from an ordinary
chaosworld, to revive a living being from a chaosworld formed by an
Autarch’s godgem is far more difficult. The problem facing us is
that the Three Realms Era was an era where the living beings were
blessed with the energies of TWO fragmented godgems. Every single
living being of that era is incredibly special.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Your
Dao-companion was a Celestial Immortal of that era. To revive her
truly will be even more difficult than reviving a Hegemon!” the
bald old man said. “The prime essences have already swallowed her
truesoul fragments; there’s no way they will spit it back out
again. They will never agree to release your Dao-companion’s
truesoul fragments. They’ll use their full power to oppose anyone
who tries.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
now completely understood. He was a major power himself, and he had
seen the countless techniques of two mighty civilizations. He knew
far more than the vast majority of Hegemons.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
living beings were born, they would draw upon the energy of the
primordial chaos to grow more powerful. If this process continued
unabated, giving birth to more and more powerful experts… where
would all of that energy come from? From the Chaosverse itself! Thus,
the Chaosverse needed to reclaim its energies as well, and one of the
most basic ways to do that was to draw upon truesoul fragments. The
so-called destruction of the truesoul was nothing more than
completely shattering a truesoul into fragments which would then be
swallowed up by the Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was akin to the cycle of reincarnation. New experts would rise to
power, while dead ones would see their truesouls swallowed up by the
Chaosverse. It formed a complete cycle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Everworlds
had their own basic essences, which was why when living beings died
in an everworld their truesoul fragments would remain within the
everworld. Reviving them would be quite easy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Individuals
who lived in otherverses would see their truesouls remain within the
otherverse when they died. For example, the ‘Sword Hegemon’ who
was the big brother of the Paragon of Pills – when he died, his
truesoul was taken away by the prime essences of that alternate
universe. To revive him would be comparatively easier, but he was
still a Hegemon; the prime essences of that otherverse would fight
tooth-and-claw to keep his truesoul fragments. Only an Autarch would
be able to bring him back, but an Autarch would not casually revive a
Hegemon. The price for such a thing would be far more than a mere
realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Chaosworlds
were the most problematic! Alas, Yu Wei was a Celestial Immortal who
had been born and died within a chaosworld birthed by one of Autarch
Awakener’s godgems.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
nothing I can do.” The bald old man looked at Ning, then waved his
hand and tossed the realmship back to Ning. “I wasn’t able to
carry out your request. Here’s your realmship.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
not even an Autarch can accomplish this, who can?” Ning was rather
frantic.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph!
If an Autarch can’t do it, no one can. Duh!” The bald old man let
out a laugh, but then he suddenly noticed the look on Ning’s face.
He instantly understood that reviving this woman had been this
talented Daolord’s strongest desire, and he couldn’t help but let
out a sigh. “It is just too difficult. If even I would risk my life
in the attempt but still probably fail… who else could possibly
succeed?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was rather dazed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ehhh…”
the bald old man looked at Ning, then suddenly laughed. “There IS
one possibility.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
eyes lit up as he immediately stared at Autarch Titanos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
of us Autarchs were originally Hegemons who broke through to the next
step and became Autarchs.” The bald old man looked at Ning. “You,
however, train in an Omega Dao. If you can succeed in the Daomerge,
you’ll become a completely unprecedented Eternal Emperor who will
vastly outstrip other Hegemons in power! Not even I would dare claim
to understand the level of power you would reach.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
you can succeed in the Daomerge to gain eternity, then make another
breakthrough to reach Autarchy…! An Omega Dao Autarch would
probably be far more powerful than the rest of us. I suspect that
such a person would be capable of reviving your Dao-companion without
any difficulties,” the bald old man said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was speechless. He now felt a tremendous desire to succeed in the
Daomerge and then advance from Eternity to Autarchy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
but that’s just a hypothetical possibility. There’s never been
anyone to succeed in the Daomerge in an Omega Dao, to say nothing of
reaching Autarchy.” The bald old man began to walk away into the
void as he spoke. “Foolish child… sometimes, you have to learn
when to let go. On the path of cultivation, excessive obsession can
sometimes result in self-destruction.” As he spoke, he disappeared
into the distance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Just
like that… Autarch Titanos was gone.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
stood there, completely unmoving.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
should we do?” Whitethaw sent mentally to Azurefiend.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
should I know? Reversing spacetime to revive his Dao-companion was
his most ardent desire. Now that he’s lost all hope… who knows
what will happen?” Hegemon Azurefiend shook his head. “Autarch
Titanos was worried that his Dao-heart would collapse, which was why
he gave Darknorth one final glimmer of hope… but Omega Daos are
incredibly difficult! Even the Autarch himself stated that there has
never been anyone to succeed in the Daomerge for an Omega Dao, much
less reach Autarchy with it!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
has to first become an Emperor, then become an Autarch. Every step is
so difficult as to be completely impossible.” Azurefiend shook his
head. The Hegemons of the various territories and realmverses all
dreamed of becoming Autarchs, but it was all for naught.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
wished to use his Omega Dao to become an Autarch? Did he think all
the other Hegemons were fools who didn’t just ‘want it enough’?
Becoming an Autarch was no easy feat!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Actually,
there’s no need for him to waste too much time thinking about this
stuff. Right now, the greatest problem facing him is still the
Daomerge!” Azurefiend said, “Only if he succeeds in the Daomerge
shall he have a future! Tell me, do you think your master will
succeed in it?”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_005__Daom"></A>
Chapter 5: Remorseless Unto Death</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
can,” Whitethaw said solemnly. “I have faith in my master.” He
knew that Ji Ning had been blessed with tremendous good fortune
within the Azureflower Estate, and also that his master had only been
training for an extremely short period of time. Ning had a chance to
succeed at the Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Bah,
I don’t even know why I’m wasting time talking to a golem like
you.” Azurefiend shook his head and turned to stare at the distant
Ning. “But of course, I personally hope that he succeeds as well.
An Emperor who completed the Daomerge with an Omega Dao… how
powerful would he become? I can’t even imagine it. He’d probably
be far more powerful than even Otherverse Lords. He might even
approach the Autarchs themselves in power!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
distant Ning suddenly sent a hoarse mental message to them:
“Whitethaw, Azurefiend, I wish to be alone for a time. Do not
disturb me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
Master,” Whitethaw said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Some
alone time would do you good. Think things over. Cultivation is a way
of life; if your Dao-heart is not resolute enough, you won’t be
able to make it far along this path, much less master the Omega Dao,”
Azurefiend said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
didn’t respond. He simply strode away into the skies. Rumble… the
void around him suddenly began to change. The primordial chaos flexed
and trembled as a new world began to be born. Mountains rose, rivers
appeared, and an indescribably vast sea took shape as well. Earth
appeared, forming continents which were then covered with grasslands
and marshes. Even cities and forests began to appear, causing the
world to becoming increasingly beautiful.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Soon,
a completely new world had been created around Ning… the world of
the Grand Xia.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
it took was a single thought from Ning and the Grand Xia world was
quickly remade.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Stillwater
City.” Ning strode through the skies, surrounded by clouds. He
stared off into the distance, where a great city had appeared. This
was Stillwater City, a place of many memories for Ning. This
Stillwater City even had a Black-White College within it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Dao Debate Palace of the Black-White College.” Ning walked into the
Black-White College. It was just as it had been in his memories,
except there were no living creatures within it at all. He soon
reached the Dao Debate Palace. Ning sat down at the entranceway to
the Dao Debate Palace, then picked up a gourd of wine and began to
drink, his gaze distant as he stared into the palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
still remembered what had happened that year. He had been very young
and had joined the Black-White College alongside Mu Northson. He had
been a dazzling figure, and had defeated many senior
apprentice-brothers during the Dao Debates. In the end, it had been
Yu Wei who had intervened and defeated him effortlessly. He still
remembered what the wager for their fight had been – a hundred
black-white pellets and five kilograms of liquid essence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
hundred black-white pellets and five kilograms of liquid essence.
Senior apprentice-sister, why is it that the path to our reunion is
such a difficult one?!” Ning murmured to himself, then raised his
head and drank some more wine. He drank too quickly, causing himself
to cough. The wine splattered all over him, but he didn’t care. He
wanted to give vent to his pain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
felt a sense of rage and resentment in his heart, a sense of pain
which he had suppressed for too long. Why? He had clearly succeeded
and had even seen her coming back to life. When they had shared
gazes, he had known that everything was going to be perfect. He was
about to embrace her again at long last… but in the end, it had
been a failure!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Why!?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
keep walking down this path for as long as I must.” Ning stared
into the Dao Debate Palace as he murmured to himself. He felt as
though he could see those duels he had fought against Yu Wei and the
others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had never hesitated, never given up. If the Autarch said that this
would only be possible if he completed his Daomerge with his Omega
Dao and then became an Autarch… then that would be what Ning’s
goal would become!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
would be an extremely difficult path to take. Ning wouldn’t shirk
back from it, but he did understand how low his chances of success
were.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Perhaps
I shall one day collapse on this path.” Ning smiled. “When I
collapse, my truesoul will scatter and then return to the prime
essences of the Chaosverse. There, the two of us shall be together
once more.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
was still wine left in the gourd, but Ning was already drunk. Not
from the wine; from his hopes. Ning rose to his feet and began to
walk outside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoooosh.
Suddenly, large plumes of snow began to fly through the air. Ning
walked through the snow, carrying the wine gourd in one hand while
using a Northbow sword to train in sword-arts with the other. It
wasn’t an intentional display of sword-arts, it was just a way for
his spirit to give vent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
he wanted to do was to remain drunk. He continued to drink while
executing his sword-arts. Ning felt himself growing drunker and
drunker.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
vague outline of a person appeared before his eyes. It was Yu Wei.
She was as beautiful as ever. It felt as though they were meeting
again for the first time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Overwhelming
sorrow from farewells… but it is naught but one parting of many.”
Ning smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning’s sword suddenly manifested a blood-colored light that shot
out through the skies. He had just unconsciously and naturally
executed the thirteenth stance of the [Heartsword], ‘Snowland
Blood’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
sense of overwhelming sorrow, of the heart transcending all mortal
concerns… when Ning struck out with his sword, he felt as though
his sword was his lover. It was different from the eleventh stance,
‘Teardrop’, or the twelfth stance, ‘Swordtide’. Those were
frenzied attacks of overwhelming power. This attack had a sense of
melancholy to it, a sense of pain stemming from heartache.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
melancholy had caused him to pour all of his heart into the sword,
and thus the thirteenth stance had been mastered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Emperor
Heartsword… I wonder what sort of mental state you were in when you
first created this thirteenth stance of the Heartsword, ‘Snowland
Blood’.” Ning smiled as he waved his sword about. “The
fourteenth stance of the Heartsword is ‘Remorseless Unto Death’.”
Ning raised his head to take another gulp of wine, then let out a
loud cry as he struck out with a new, changed streak of sword-light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
his sword struck out, it became ephemeral and transcendant. It was
hard to even see his sword; it was as though the sword itself had
vanished. However, a few vague traces could be seen. Those
hard-to-see traces were indistinct but completely unblockable. It
would continue to advance, and if anyone tried to stand in its path
then that person would be slaughtered. The traces of this sword were
enough to inspire utter terror in any who saw it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was the fourteenth stance of the Heartsword – Remorseless Unto
Death.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the Flamedragon Realmverse, there had only ever been a total of two
cultivators who had mastered the fourteenth stance of the
[Heartsword] art, including Emperor Heartsword himself. Now, Ning had
become the third!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
thirteenth stance of the Heartsword, ‘Snowland Blood’. The
fourteenth stance of the Heartsword, ‘Remorseless Unto Death’.
These two were on the same general ‘level’. So long as one could
learn the thirteenth stance, it wouldn’t take too long for the
fourteenth stance to be mastered as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Heartsword’s experiences truly had been remarkable. Although he had
different experiences than Ning, they had reached a very similar
mental state. Ning felt a similar sense of sorrow and melancholy; he
knew that the chances of reversing spacetime and reviving his wife
were impossibly low. And yet… he would have no regrets at all for
pursuing this path, even in the face of death! No matter how low the
chances were, he would still continue on this path.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
danced with the sword as snow flew around him. Slowly, the skies
turned dark. Ning lay down on the snowy ground and went to sleep. It
had been a long, long time since he had slumbered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
‘snow’ and the ‘darkness’… these were nothing more than
reflections of his mental state. He had created this world, and so
its weather was invisibly influenced by his state of mind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
slept for a long period of time before finally reopening his eyes. By
now, a morning sun was rising from the horizon, bathing the world
with its warm rays of light. There was some fog, but it was unable to
block out the sunlight which pierced through everything as it
illuminated the world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
glanced at the gourd and the Northbow sword, both of which lay fallen
next to him. He smiled, then picked them up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
woken up. The Daomerge, eh?” Ning stared at the distant dawn sun,
then murmured to himself: “Then I’ll deal with the Daomerge
first! I’ll take things one step at a time. After the Daomerge,
I’ll then become an Autarch.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Senior
apprentice-sister… don’t blame me if I fail.” Ning chuckled,
then soared into the skies. Rumble… the Black-White College and the
city of Stillwater both began to break apart. The entire Grand Xia
began to break apart, quickly dissipating into nothingness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
stared at the two figures waiting for him in the distant void.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,”
Whitethaw called out respectfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
Hegemon Azurefiend was slightly startled. He could sense that Daolord
Darknorth seemed to have undergone a tremendous transformation. His
very aura had changed. In the past, Ning had a certain radiant
dynamism to him. He had been a dazzling figure who was filled with
hope… but now, his gaze was much calmer and more distant. It was
like an endlessly deep sea. There was nothing which could shake his
heart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Reversing
spacetime to revive Yu Wei had been a failure. All of that was over
now, and he only had one thought in his mind… to continue walking
his path of cultivation with no remorse and no regrets, unto death
itself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Either
he would succeed in reuniting with Yu Wei, or he would fail and die,
reuniting with her in the prime essences of the Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Azurefiend,
do you think I’ll succeed in the Daomerge?” Ning laughed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Azurefiend
was startled upon seeing Ning’s smile. He immediately said, “It’ll
be extremely hard… but then again, the number of people who became
Daolords of the Fourth Step via an Omega Dao is miniscule. The fact
that they failed doesn’t mean you will fail as well, Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Just
so.” Ning laughed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
you are too stubborn and attached. Remember what Autarch Titanos
said; excessive obsession can result in self-destruction,”
Azurefiend said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded and smiled. “But you know, he left out part of the saying.
The full saying is, excessive obsession can result in great
accomplishments, but it can also result in self-destruction. I have
the feeling… that I’m the type who will have great
accomplishments.”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_006__Daom"></A>
Chapter 6: Icepeak Army</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
I also believe that you’ll accomplish great things!” Azurefiend
looked at Ji Ning approvingly. He knew that some cultivators with
deep obsessions who suffered setbacks would be so damaged by them
that their Dao-hearts could crumble. This wasn’t rare! Even Autarch
Titanos had been worried that this dazzlingly talented Daolord would
perish out of despair, which was why he voiced that final possibility
of using an Omega Dao to become an Autarch. However, everyone knew
how remote those chances were.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
wish to remain in the Three Realms for a period of time,” Ning
said. “After I have fully mastered those formations, I’ll return
to the Jadefire Realm.” The Flamewing God was in a state of
slumber; to such a creature, a nap lasting one or two chaos cycles
was nothing special at all. In the end, Ning would have to rely on
his Primaltwin in the Azureflower Estate to unlock those formations.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“As
you desire,” Azurefiend smiled. “I’m going to spend some time
wandering your homeland as well. It has been quite some time since
I’ve experienced the mortal life.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. “Remember, you are not permitted to kill.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
what if someone tries to bully me?” Azurefiend stared.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Capture
them first. You can kill them if I give the nod,” Ning said. He
refused to allow a Hegemon to run wild within his homeland.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fine.
As you insist.” Azurefiend felt quite helpless. As a retainer, he
had to obey orders.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
chuckled, then began to walk towards the ‘Three Realms Domain’
with Whitethaw behind him. The Three Realms Domain referred to the
region of 3900 chaosworlds which had been established by Ning,
Subhuti, Windfiend, and the other major powers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
beautiful.” Ning stared at the thousands of chaosworlds that were
organized into that enormous triangular formation. They were like a
host of flickering stars in the sky, glowing with dazzling light.
Ning nodded slowly. “Later, it’ll be time to further perfect this
formation.” Stabilizing the Three Realms Domain was a long-term
endeavor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
territory that was extremely far away from the Flamedragon
Realmverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Whoosh. Whoosh. An endless black fog had spread out to cover a deep
chasm, and at the bottom of the chasm was the residence of a famed
Otherverse Lord known as ‘Lord Skyjade’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh.
Swoosh. An enormous tear in space appeared above the abyss, with
three towering figures exiting the tear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
were all onyx humanoids with icy expressions on their faces. Unlike
‘ordinary’ humanoids, their bodies were covered with strange
silver-white diagrams. Just standing in the air above the abyss, they
emanated an endless aura of cold that swept out and caused even the
endless black mist below them to freeze over.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
finally arrived.” The three onyx humanoids all smiled slightly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Lord
Skyjade, come out and meet with us,” one of the onyx humanoids
called out loudly. His voice boomed out, echoing into the abyss deep
within them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh.
A man dressed in dark golden robes walked out from the abyss,
emanating an aura of endless might which suppressed the freezing
cold. Lord Skyjade had handsome features and an extraordinary aura.
He was the master of this realmverse and a nearby otherverse, making
him far superior to ordinary Otherverse Lords.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.
Why have you sought me out?” Lord Skyjade’s voice held a tinge of
distaste, but he managed to suppress much of his anger as he spoke.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
wrong, Lord Skyjade? Do you detest the Icepeak Army?” one of the
onyx humanoids mocked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
you don’t wish to speak with us and wish to put on airs in front of
us, we can have our general, ‘Lord Wulf’, come and speak to you
instead,” another onyx humanoid said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Lord
Skyjade frowned. He did feel a great deal of trepidation when dealing
with the legendary Icepeak Army. “Cut the crap. What do you want,
exactly?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“While
the three of us were out adventuring, we suddenly heard word of a
distance place known as the Flamedragon Realmverse. Supposedly, an
incredibly talented Daolord has managed to procure a realmship. Alas…
as you might know, our Icepeak Army is extremely powerful and has
multiple realmships, but our general Lord Wulf doesn’t have one
despite his incredible power. Now, a Daolord does. Isn’t this quite
irritating? Thus, we are planning to head to the Flamedragon
Realmverse and force that Daolord to hand the realmship over,” a
skinny onyx humanoid said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
heard that the Icepeak Army has a total of five realmships, while
your general Lord Wulf is incredibly strong. Why doesn’t he have a
realmship to call his own?” Lord Skyjade feigned surprise.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.”
The three onyx humanoids snorted, not wanting to explain. Clearly,
even the mighty Icepeak Army had its own internal squabbles.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Lord
Skyjade, we’ve come here to ask you to help send us to the
Flamedragon Realmverse,” a muscular onyx humanoid said. “The
Flamedragon Realmverse is too far away. It would take us far longer
than tens of millions of chaos cycles to reach it if we were to fly
towards it. Daolords have short lives; we don’t have the time to
waste.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Flamedragon Realmverse? I don’t have a realmship.” Lord Skyjade
shook his head. “Are you actually expecting me to use up the energy
of my otherverse to send you there?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ll
compensate you appropriately, Lord Skyjade,” the cyclopean onyx
humanoid said. Although they were extraordinary figures of great
power, they still had to show a basic level of courtesy to an
Otherverse Lord.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
wish for me to take you all the way to the distant Flamedragon
Realmverse? That’s far too exhausting.” Lord Skyjade shook his
head. “How about this? I’ll ask one of my friends who has a
realmship to help you out and take you to the Flamedragon Realmverse,
but of course you’ll have to compensate him as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Naturally.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood,”
the three onyx humanoids said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Lord
Skyjade remained quite displeased. He was an exalted Otherverse Lord;
normal Hegemons had to treat him with great respect. These three were
nothing more than minor soldiers in the Icepeak Army, yet they dared
to behave so insolently towards him!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Alas,
when he thought of the supreme leader of the Icepeak Army, that
towering figure seated upon that mighty throne, Lord Skyjade couldn’t
help but shudder. He couldn’t help but let out a sigh for Daolord
Darknorth, who he had never met. “A minor Daolord was able to
convince a Hegemon to become his retainer. News has spread throughout
the Chaosverse. Even the Icepeak Army has heard of him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Remember,
that place is under the sway of the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance.
That is Realmslord Windgrace’s territory,” Lord Skyjade said.
“Realmslord Windgrace’s ‘Blacksun’ is not easy to deal with.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
were differences in status amongst Otherverse Lords as well.
Realmslord Windgrace, as the master of the Blacksun, was definitely a
terrifying figure even amongst Otherverse Lords.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
know. We’re only there for Daolord Darknorth, not to cause a war. I
don’t think Realmslord Windgrace would choose to make an enemy out
of the Icepeak Army for such a matter,” the three onyx humanoids
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fine.
Wait a while. Roughly a hundred thousand years from now, my friend
shall arrive and take you towards the Flamedragon Realmverse.” Lord
Skyjade turned and flew back into the deep abyss.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three watched him leave. “Hmph. Lord Skyjade is quite a prideful
figure.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
three of us are Black Emperors. If we worked together, he wouldn’t
be able to do anything to us even though he is an Otherverse Lord.
The only reason he dares to behave so arrogantly before the Icepeak
Army is because he can hide within his otherverse whenever he
pleases.” All three of them were rather disdainful towards him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh,
right. Realmslord Windgrace of the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance is
not a man to be trifled with. This won’t be a problem, will it?”
the muscular onyx humanoid frowned as he spoke.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry! Old man Windgrace is a clever fellow. He wouldn’t dare
launch an actual war against the Icepeak Army. He’s all by himself,
while we have an entire host of Hegemons on our side, as well as his
Majesty! Hmph. So long as we don’t go too far and merely act
against that Daolord, this won’t cause too much of a stir.
Realmslord Windgrace knows his limits.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Agreed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
flowed on. In the blink of an eye, ten million years had gone by, and
a realmship finally reached the Flamedragon Realmverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you, Hegemon Thunderstar. Wait for us here, just in case… but we
don’t think a mere Daolord would dare to go against our will. He’ll
probably hand the realmship over to us, and so we’ll probably just
fly back in the realmship without needing to trouble you again.”
The three onyx humanoids flew towards the Flamedragon Realmverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Thunderstar had become a Hegemon via the Dao of Lightning. He was
terrifyingly fast and an extremely famous figure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Emperors
will bide their time, but Daolords are different. They have such
short lives that they are usually quite temperamental,” Hegemon
Thunderstar said with a laugh. “Given that he has Hegemon
Azurefiend as a retainer… if he really does fight back and chooses
to hide within Hegemon Azurefiend’s estate-world, you won’t
necessarily be able to win the realmship from him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
trust he wouldn’t dare to make enemies out of us.” The three onyx
humanoids were quite confident in their chances. As for Hegemon
Thunderstar, he secretly smirked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
vast majority of the supreme powers of the Chaosverse all disliked
the Icepeak Army! It was, however, an extremely formidable force, and
so even Otherverse Lords were forced to give way before them.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_007__Daom"></A>
Chapter 7: The Lonely King</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Flamedragon Realmverse. Vastheaven Territory. Within the Vastheaven
Everworld.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoooosh.
An enormous tear in space appeared, with three towering onyx
humanoids emerging from within it. Each of them radiated auras of
tremendous power that showed them to be at the Hegemon level.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
is Vastheaven Palace,” one of the onyx humanoids said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thankfully,
Hegemon Winterflame has long ago spread word regarding Daolord
Darknorth. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have been able to acquire such
detailed information regarding him with such ease,” the skinny onyx
humanoid said with a laugh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
hear that Hegemon Winterflame remains trapped within the Jadefire
Realm.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
why he hates Daolord Darknorth so much. However… the Jadefire Realm
truly is a terrifying place. Not even the three of us would dare to
barge into it; only the general himself would dare to do such a
thing! However, I trust Daolord Darknorth will be wise enough not to
fight us head-on.” The three onyx humanoids flew through the skies
towards Vastheaven Palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
Vastheaven Palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Daolord
Pillsaint was working on his alchemy, while Su Youji, Ji Ning, and
Solesky were both watching.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can smell the fragrance of the pill,” Su Youji said eagerly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Crack.
Sizzle. Pop. The flames continued to sizzle away at the alchemy pot
as Pillsaint focused all of his efforts on controlling the fire.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
bad.” The nearby Ning nodded. “Pillsaint is getting to be
increasingly impressive in the Dao of Alchemy. He can now be
considered a legendary grandmaster in alchemy in the Endless
Territories. I have to admit, I’m far from being a match for him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
that’s because you didn’t put any effort into alchemy,” Su
Youji immediately rebutted. In her mind, Ning was the most talented
in every aspect.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, Ning was at such a high level of enlightenment with regards to
the Dao that he had reached incredible heights in both the Dao of
Formations and the Dao of Fire. In truth, he was better at
controlling the alchemical flame than Pillsaint, but he lacked
experience with regards to understanding how the medicinal properties
of the various materials were mixed together. This required countless
trials and experience.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Suddenly, a terrifying wave of power swept across the area. Bang!
Startled by this, Pillsaint lost control over the fire, causing the
alchemy pot to explode and the pill within to be destroyed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
going on?” Su Youji and Emperor Solesky both stared towards the
outside, stunned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Such
power… a Hegemon’s aura? Since when did Hegemons become this
commonplace?” Ning frowned. Hegemons were extremely rare; they were
supreme within their realmverses. For Hegemon Winterflame to attack
was one thing; it had only been a few dozen chaos cycles, but yet
another Hegemon had come. Judging from the way the Hegemon had flared
his aura, he clearly had come with bad intentions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go take a look.” Ning remained quite calm. With a swoosh, he flew
into the skies with Emperor Solesky flying right behind him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
two flew into the air of Vastheaven Palace and stared outside. Ning’s
face immediately turned solemn. There were three towering figures
standing in the air… and their bodies were not of cultivators but
the onyx humanoids he had encountered in the past. There were three
of them! However, they were different from the Sithe onyx humanoids
which Ning had encountered in the past. These three onyx humanoids
were all covered with silver diagrams and emanated an aura of endless
cold.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Black
Emperors of the Sithe?” Ning was shocked. “Three of them?”
Black Emperors were terrifyingly strong. Their bodies were much
tougher than the bodies of most Hegemons, which was why they had an
advantage in combat. In the cave which Ning and Ninedust had visited
all those years ago, they had found a Black Emperor who had perished
in battle while taking two Hegemons with it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
are Darknorth?” the skinny onyx humanoid said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes
I am,” Ning said. “Dare I ask why the three of you have come to
Vastheaven Palace?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
we’ve come to visit you on business, of course. Why else would we
come all the way here to the Flamedragon Realmverse?” the muscular
onyx humanoid said with a snicker.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
I hear you have a realmship,” the skinny onyx humanoid said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
heart trembled. As he had suspected, this was about his realmship.
Realmships were simply of tremendous interest to Hegemons, but he
never would’ve expected them to attract three Black Emperors.
Still… he hadn’t feared even an entire host of Hegemons from the
Sixteen Realmverses Alliance. Why would he fear these three onyx
humanoids?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
what if I do? So what if I don’t?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
dare act with such arrogance to our face? Quite bold.” A cold light
flashed through the skinny onyx humanoid’s eyes. “Hmph. If you do
have it, hand it over and we’ll spare your life. If you don’t
have it… then you are useless to us and shall die right now.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hand
over the realmship,” the cyclopean onyx humanoid commanded coldly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
you don’t hand it over, everyone connected to you will perish.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiiip.
A tear in space appeared off in the distance. The three onyx
humanoids all turned to look, only to see an ancient realmship fly
out of the tear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
realmship.” They immediately revealed looks of delight.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
the kid’s pretty straightforward.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
bad, not bad. You are a smart boy. Hand over the realmship and you
can all survive.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Give
us the realmship.” The three onyx humanoids nodded approvingly at
this. They had acquired quite a bit of intelligence regarding Ning
and knew that he wasn’t easy to deal with. If Daolord Darknorth had
chosen to remain hidden within the Jadefire Realm, there would’ve
been nothing they could do; their only option would’ve been to ask
their general, Lord Wulf, to intervene. But if they did that, they
wouldn’t have rendered any real merits to the organization.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Given
that this Daolord had Hegemon Azurefiend by his side, if he wanted to
flee and hide there really wouldn’t have been much they could do to
him. If Ning was willing to hand it over, though, they would be so
magnanimous as to spare his life.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
A white-robed youth, an honest-looking white-furred golem, and a
shriveled-up old man emerged from the realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
avatar and Emperor Solesky’s avatar both retreated for now.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“And
who are the three of you?” Ning asked. “Why have you immediately
demanded my realmship?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
three of us are soldiers from the Icepeak Army,” the skinnier black
humanoid said calmly. “While wandering through the various
realmverses, we heard word of you and so came here as quickly as
possible. We wish to take your realmship and offer it to our general,
‘Lord Wulf’. Kid, as a Daolord you will only live a short period
of time. You probably haven’t even finished exploring the
Flamedragon Realmverse. This realmship will be of little use to you.
Hand it over to us, and you’ll have avoided calamity.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Icepeak Army?” Ning frowned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
really is the Icepeak Army.” Hegemon Azurefiend’s face tightened
slightly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Azurefiend,
you’ve heard of the Icepeak Army before?” Ning sent mentally.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
as you might know, when we defeated the Sithe during the Dawn War the
Sithe left behind many treasures which ended up falling into our
hands,” Hegemon Azurefiend sent mentally. Ning just continued to
listen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Some
of the most powerful Sithe weapons of war, such as the ‘Blacksun’,
ended up in the hands of people like Realmslord Windgrace. That is
why Realmslord Windgrace is so famous and has such a higher status
than other Otherverse Lords. Not even the Icepeak Army would go cause
problems for him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
leader of the Icepeak Army is generally referred to respectfully as
the ‘Lonely King’. He was born an Ancient cultivator and has an
eccentric personality. He always has a cold look on his face, and he
delights in slaughter! It is said that he only ever smiles when he
kills. The Lonely King once acquired a Sithe treasury which was
filled with Sithe war machines and weapons. He is personally in
control of the most powerful war machines, but he also acquired four
‘Golden Emperors’ and sixty-nine ‘Black Emperors’. He used
one of them to undergo the Ritual Sacrificium to become a Golden
Emperor, while allowing three Hegemons who joined him to do the same!
Over the course of countless years, he allowed some of his Eternal
Emperors to be transformed into Black Emperors. As a result, he now
has a terrifyingly powerful army under his control, with him at the
lead. This army is named the Icepeak Army.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Although
the name sounds rather ordinary, it is legendary for its savagery. It
will battle to the death anyone who offends the Lonely King! They’ve
caused many great wars and have even destroyed an otherverse, causing
three Otherverse Lords to die by their hands. But of course, they
suffered certain losses during those wars as well. Supposedly, they
now only have sixty-one Black Emperors left.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was stunned upon hearing this. Even three Otherverse Lords had died
by their hands? “Aren’t Otherverse Lords able to hide within
their alternate universes?” Ning couldn’t help but ask, “Doesn’t
that mean they had to destroy the entire alternate universe?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
are two supremely powerful war machines publicly acknowledged to be
under the Lonely King’s control. One of them can be instantly
activated, which was why two of the Otherverse Lords were slain
before they even had a chance to run,” Azurefiend sent mentally.
“The third managed to hide within his otherverse, but the enraged
Lonely King continued his pursuit into the otherverse. No one knows
what exactly happened inside it, but the end result was that the
otherverse was completely destroyed and the Otherverse Lord died. It
was that battle which truly allowed the Lonely King to rise to fame
and for the Icepeak Army to become known as one of the most
terrifyingly powerful organizations in the Chaosverse.”</P>

Chapter 8: Ji Ning Battles Black Emperors</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“An
Otherverse Lord had escaped into his otherverse, yet had still been
killed and his entire otherverse had been destroyed.” Azurefiend
sent a mental sigh: “That is why everyone suspects that in addition
to the two war machines the Lonely King has made public, he should
also have a third Sithe war machine of incredible power. Thus,
Darknorth… I really do urge you to reconsider how you wish to treat
the Icepeak Army. They aren’t easy to deal with. I’m a solitary
wanderer who doesn’t have that many treasures, and so the Icepeak
Army won’t expend too much resources on hunting me down… but you,
Darknorth, have a realmship. The Icepeak Army isn’t going to just
give up.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Azurefiend
was quite a proud man, but he felt that Ji Ning had to consider what
was best for his sect and his homeland.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Azurefiend,
aside from the Lonely King, do the other three Golden Emperors of the
Icepeak Army have especially powerful war machines?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
do not.” Azurefiend’s response was quite succinct. “The Icepeak
Army has caused quite a few wars, but I’ve never heard of the three
Golden Emperors employing any war machines of repute.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
let out a sigh secretly. Given how exalted the Lonely King was, he
wouldn’t go so far as to act against a Daolord for the sake of a
mere realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh,
right. The Flamewing God vs the Lonely King… which should be
stronger?” Ning asked mentally. He had his own thoughts, but
Azurefiend had been alive for much longer and had seen many things.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hard
to say who is stronger. Flamewing is just a bit too dumb. It was born
with tremendous vitality and has a virtually indestructible body, but
Otherverse Lords should be able to stay alive against him,”
Azurefiend said. “The Lonely King, however, is different; he’s
able to use war machines and is thus a greater threat.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
if Flamewing fights the Lonely King?” Ning asked mentally.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flamewing
won’t be able to kill the Lonely King, but there’s no way the
Lonely King would be able to kill Flamewing. I’ve been alive for an
extremely long period of time, but I’ve never heard of any major
power who was capable of subduing a Chaos Primordial, save for the
Autarchs themselves. Kill one? Impossible,” Azurefiend sent
mentally. “Darknorth, as you know, the most powerful members of the
Sithe race were their Exalts, and it took three of them in order to
capture Flamewing… and it remained completely unharmed. Amongst
cultivators, everyone knows that only Autarchs are capable of killing
Chaos Primordials!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Good
to know.” Ning came to a decision. Based on the information he had,
he also felt confident that no one save for an Autarch would be able
to kill Flamewing. Perhaps the Sithe during their glory days were
capable of capturing Chaos Primordials when they sent out their most
powerful members, and perhaps they might even be able to kill Chaos
Primordials via their unique technology… but the Sithe were dust.
Although the Lonely King was terrifyingly strong, he had merely
gained access to a single war machine treasury the Sithe had left
behind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
do you plan to do?” Azurefiend sent back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Azurefiend,
will you be frightened if I refuse them?” Ning sent mentally.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Azurefiend
glanced at Ning, rather surprised. “I’m a solitary Hegemon who
wanders alone. What do I have to be afraid of? Have you really
decided?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.
I’m confident in my chances.” Ning nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three onyx humanoids simply stood there and waited as Ning and
Hegemon Azurefiend spoke mentally to each other. They were in no
rush. They could tell that Darknorth and Azurefiend were discussing
this matter. They felt that once this weak Daolord learned the truth
of the Icepeak Army’s might, he would make the wise choice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
do you know a bit more about the Icepeak Army now?” the skinny onyx
humanoid looked at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
a Daolord who is unlearned compared to my Hegemonic peers. I’ve
only heard of you for the first time today. Impressive, truly
impressive,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Cut
the crap.” The cyclopean onyx humanoid was growing a bit impatient.
Frowning, he barked out, “Hurry up and hand over the realmship.
Otherwise, we’re going to attack. When that happens, both you and
your sect shall both perish.” He had long ago grown accustomed to
acting as he pleased. He had originally been a fairly powerful
Eternal Emperor, and after he underwent the Ritual Sacrificium to
become a member of the Icepeak Army he had received deference from
even Hegemons and Otherverse Lords, all of whom feared the Icepeak
Army’s reputation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Originally,
his greatest worry was that this Daolord would cause trouble due to
the Daolord’s ignorance of the Icepeak Army’s might. That was why
he had held back. But now? Now, he was naturally going to press hard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
stood there, flanked by Azurefiend and Whitethaw. “I don’t wish
to make an enemy out of the Icepeak Army, and I’m not qualified to
do that either. However, realmships are incredibly precious. You wish
for me to simply hand it over for nothing? I might be a mere Daolord,
but I have my pride.” Ning smiled. “I have a simple, mutually
beneficial solution which will result in me handing over the
realmship willingly.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
mutually beneficial solution?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Speak.”
The three onyx humanoids were rather irritated. The Icepeak Army was
so incredibly famous that even Hegemons were terrified of them. Only
a few solitary Hegemons who wandered alone would dare act so
arrogantly before them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Simple.
The Icepeak Army can buy the realmship from me,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Buy?”
The three onyx humanoids exchanged a glance. “Very well. This
estate-world of mine has quite a few treasures inside. I’ll give it
to you in exchange for the realmship.” The skinny onyx humanoid
casually handed over a golden palm-sized disc which was actually an
estate-treasure. The two onyx humanoids were quite calm as well; they
felt certain that this Daolord simply wanted a way to save face. It
didn’t really matter if they tossed out a few treasures.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
shook his head. “The value has to be on par with the realmship.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“On
par?” Finally, the looks on the faces of the three onyx humanoids
changed. For the first time, they began to realize that this Daolord
wasn’t looking for a way to save face; he was going to be a tough
nut to crack! Realmships were incredibly valuable; not even treasures
like Crimsonwave Temple were even close in value to a realmship. Even
if the three onyx humanoids pooled all of their treasures together,
they still wouldn’t be able to afford one. Most likely, their
general Lord Wulf would have to trade all of his treasures to just
barely afford a realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Trade
for something of equivalent value? This would be a fairly good deal
if it was between two figures who were on par with each other, such
as the Lonely King and Realmslord Windgrace. This was because
generally speaking people were completely unwilling to sell
realmships; to merely ask for treasures of equivalent value was
already a good bargain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However…
Realmslord Windgrace was in command of the Blacksun. He was on the
same level as the Lonely King. How was it that a mere Daolord dared
to demand treasures of equivalent value?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Are
you looking to die?” the skinny onyx humanoid’s eyes flashed with
cold light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
already taken a step back and given face. If you accept, we’ll
carry out the trade. If you refuse? I can’t just hand over my
realmship for nothing.” Ning’s own aura began to sharpen as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You…!”
The three onyx humanoids stared at the Daolord before them, stunned.
He actually was going to face them head-on?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
courting death.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill
him.” The cyclopean onyx humanoid was the first to attack. He
instantly transformed into a streak of light who shot towards Ning.
He struck out with his right hand, sending it piercing towards Ning
like a long spear, with his fingernails being the tip! Black Emperors
all had incredibly powerful bodies; every single part of them was
like a weapon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
arm-spear pierced straight through the void, so powerful as to cause
Ning’s eyebrows to rise slightly. “Hmph.” Whitethaw, by Ning’s
side, let out an angry snort and immediately charged forwards. While
charging, he transformed into an enormous white cloth that swept out
towards his foe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
mere golem seeks to block me?” The cyclopean onyx humanoid felt
some disdain. He was at the Hegemon level of power! Although his
insights into the Dao were a bit inferior to true Hegemons, his Black
Emperor body gave him tremendous power and allowed him to match
Hegemons in battle. His body was so incredibly tough and resilient
that in a real battle of life and death, he actually had an
advantage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Bang!
This terrifying Hegemonic strike stabbed straight into the enormous
white cloth, but the white cloth was incredibly resilient and
dispersed all of the attacking energy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!”
The cyclopean onyx humanoid was shocked. The golem had actually
blocked his attack?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill
them all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill
them and take the realmship.” The two other onyx humanoids began to
attack as well. Whoosh! Whoosh! Both moved with incredible speed.
Although Whitethaw had blocked one of them, that was already his
limit; there was no way he could block the other two.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hahaha…”
Azurefiend laughed loudly as he transformed into his bestial form.
His entire body became covered with azure scales, and his head became
triangular in shape. His scale-covered tail waved menacingly like a
whip, and his entire body glimmered with dark light. He let out a
furious howl as he charged through the air, moving to engage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Daolord actually isn’t hiding in Hegemon Azurefiend’s
estate-world.” The skinny onyx humanoid was delighted by this and
sent mentally, “I’ll tie down Azurefiend. You go kill the
Daolord.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
The muscular onyx humanoid was delighted as well. Neither of them had
imagined that the Daolord wouldn’t go into hiding.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_009__Daom"></A>
Chapter 9: A Tough Nut</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
skinny onyx humanoid was skilled with the saber, but for the sake of
tying down Azurefiend he didn’t use any weapons at all. He used his
bare hands, and since every part of his body was akin to a weapon he
was able to tie down Azurefiend as best he could.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
He sent his right palm out, his arm stretching to become more than
ten thousand kilometers long.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whap!
Azurefiend, in his true form, struck out with his tail against the
incoming black palm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Crack!
The vast black arm suddenly changed directions, lashing out in a
strange whip-like manner as the arm seemed to transform into an arc
that built up power and then struck out once more. The skinny onyx
humanoid’s entire body seemed to have transformed into a bow-like
shape.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
Black Emperor really is tough to deal with.” Hegemon Azurefiend had
a complete advantage in power, and was significantly superior to his
opponent in terms of insights into the Dao, but his attacks were
doing absolutely nothing when being landed upon the Black Emperor’s
body. This allowed the Black Emperor to continuously tie him down.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth
has chosen to fight the other Black Emperor by himself. He should be
able to keep himself safe, right?” Azurefiend cast a sideways
glance at the distant Ning as he battled. A look of shock suddenly
appeared on his face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Puny
Daolord, you truly are arrogant. However, your arrogance has given us
a chance to deal with you. Otherwise, we’d probably have to
massacre everyone here to coerce you into complying, starting with
all the disciples of Vastheaven Palace. And yet, that might not be
enough.” The muscular Black Emperor was clearly in a good mood.
“Now, we simply have to kill you and we’ll have won the
realmship.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
might be celebrating just a bit too early.” Ning stood there in the
air, staring calmly at the onyx humanoid before him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
you are in such a hurry to die, then die you shall.” The muscular
onyx humanoid suddenly struck out with a giant black palm that
blotted out the skies as it swept out towards Ning. Whoosh! Ning
suddenly moved, disappearing from the onyx humanoid’s field of
vision.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
disappeared?” The muscular onyx humanoid’s palm-strike missed. He
immediately struck out in every direction with his palms. As he saw
it, even if Ning did vanish he would only be able to hide with his
evasion-arts. There was no way he would’ve been able to escape too
far.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
over here.” A voice rang out from behind him. The muscular onyx
humanoid stared backwards in astonishment, only to see the
white-robed youth with the black sheath on his back standing far
behind him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
fast.” A feeling of trepidation appeared within the onyx humanoid’s
heart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Black Emperor’s body is a waste on you. Your insights into the Dao
are too low. You have some innate advantages in a life-or-death
battle, but if I wanted to leave you wouldn’t be able to stop me at
all.” Ning slowly shook his head. He suddenly couldn’t help but
sigh a bit in his heart. When he had first seen that onyx humanoid’s
corpse, he had felt absolutely stunned. He never would’ve imagined
that he would have reached that same level of power as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
terms of the Dao of the Sword, Ning was on a full level higher than
Emperor Heartsword had been. Now that Ning had mastered the
fourteenth stance of the [Heartsword] art, he was just a single
stance behind Emperor Heartsword, who had created just fifteen
stances in total. On the whole, Ning was now far more powerful than
Emperor Heartsword. He truly had reached the Hegemon level of combat
power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Puny
Daolord, you are far too arrogant. Die for me!” The muscular onyx
humanoid was rather embarrassed and angered as he charged through the
air at Ning. Each step he took caused the void around him to shudder
as he once more struck out furiously with his giant palms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh.
Ning moved again. This time, he transformed into a streak of
sword-light that dodged hundreds of thousands of kilometers to one
side. “You can’t even touch me.” Ning shook his head slowly.
This was far too easy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
he had first relied on his Omega Sword Dao to become a Daolord of the
Fourth Step, he hadn’t been this fast. However, it had been more
than ten chaos cycles since then. He had reached the Archon level in
the Dao of Lightning, giving him an even more terrifying level of
speed. He had also reached the Archon level in the Dao of Space,
giving him a tremendous amount of skill in manipulating space.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thus,
Ning had now reached a brand new level of speed. Only a Hegemon who
was completely focused on speed would be able to catch up to Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
can’t even capture a Daolord?!” the distant skinny onyx humanoid
sent a frantic mental message.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Puny
Daolord!” This time, the muscular onyx humanoid truly was angry and
embarrassed. He raised his head, letting out a furious roar. Boom! A
thick black fog spread out from him to cover an area of nearly ten
million kilometers around him. Everything in this area was mired as
if in quicksand, causing Ning’s speed to dramatically lessen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ah,
I knew Black Emperors of the Sithe couldn’t possibly be THIS week.”
Ning’s body flickered as he transformed into his three-headed,
six-armed mode. All six of the Northbow swords flew out from the
sheath on his back and into his hands. “Come on.” Ning cracked a
smile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash!
Slash! Slash! The onyx humanoid struck out with extraordinary
strength, delivering one furious palm after another in an effort to
slay Ning as quickly as possible. Alas, he had merely reached the
Archon level in terms of insights into the Dao. His weaknesses were
quite apparent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was still able to easily maneuver around the onyx humanoid despite
the black fog. Ning didn’t even use his own secret arts! Although
his speed was lessened, his sword remained incredibly fast.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash!
Slash! Slash! Ning’s sword-light pierced through the skies, each
streak of sword-light being ephemeral and nigh-invisible. The hints
of sword-light were hard to detect, but they carried a terrifying
amount of power and seemed capable of chopping through anything which
stood in their path. This was a terrifying level of power that came
from the combination of the fourteenth stance of the [Heartsword] art
and a fourth-stage Daolord’s Omega Sword Dao. Each strike was
ghostly and unpredictable. The onyx humanoid felt as though the blows
were drilling straight through its body.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash!
Slash! Slash! In the blink of an eye, the two exchanged more than a
hundred blows against each other. The onyx humanoid wasn’t able to
land a single attack against Ning; in short, he was being utterly
dominated! However, Ning couldn’t help but frown as well: “His
body really is incredibly tough. Even when I use my full power, I
remain unable to injure him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
the hell? He’s no Daolord, he’s clearly a Hegemon!” The
muscular onyx humanoid suddenly pulled away as he shouted furiously,
“I can’t do anything to him!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go
all out and burn your essence. End it quickly!” the skinny onyx
humanoid, pressured by Hegemon Azurefiend, sent a frantic mental
message.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
try! I haven’t been able to even touch him a single time. His
sword-arts are completely flawless. Even if I really did go all out,
he could just flee over to Azurefiend.” The Black Emperor wasn’t
willing to go all-out. Unlike normal cultivators, they healed and
recovered quite slowly. Once they went all-out, they would be at risk
of energy exhaustion. Once they exhausted their energy reserves,
their bodies would grow weak and they could even be defeated and then
destroyed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Withdraw!”
The muscular onyx humanoid issued an order to withdraw, and the three
quickly rejoined each other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Azurefiend
and Whitethaw moved to stand by Ning’s side. The two sides stared
at each other from afar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three onyx humanoids were all rather angry, but they also felt
stunned. How was it that a Daolord had actually reached such a level
of power? He definitely had the power of a Hegemon! Thankfully, the
three onyx humanoids all had extremely tough bodies; ordinary
Emperors would’ve been slain with ease by Ning’s current level of
sword-arts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Formidable.
I truly do admire you, for a Daolord like yourself to have reached
such a level of power.” The skinny onyx humanoid stared at Ning.
“However… are you absolutely sure that you wish to become an
enemy of the Icepeak Army?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
do not wish to become an enemy of the Icepeak Army. However, there is
no way I’ll hand over a realmship for nothing.” Ning shook his
head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Bold.
These actions, however, are tantamount to declaring us your enemy!”
The skinny onyx humanoid laughed coldly, “I’ll give you one more
chance! Hand over the realmship. Otherwise, we’ll have no choice
but to go ahead to report to our superiors that you are being
defiant. In the end, the result shall be your death.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
just smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well then.” They saw the look on Ning’s face. The skinny onyx
humanoid barked, “Let’s go! Next time we come, we’ll kill them
all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go.” The three onyx humanoids immediately entered the spatial rift,
vanishing without a trace and leaving just Ning, Azurefiend, and
Whitethaw behind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Azurefiend
glanced at the white-robed youth by his side. He could sense that
Ning had grown tremendously more powerful since their battle in the
Jadefire Realm. By now, Ning truly had reached the Hegemon level of
power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
you have now become an enemy of the Icepeak Army,” Azurefiend said
softly. “The Icepeak Army is not an easy foe to deal with. Given
their disposition, they will definitely launch a war against you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
aren’t easy to deal with, but neither am I.” A flicker of killing
intent appeared in Ning’s eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You?”
Azurefiend was stunned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Soon,
I’ll have solved the formations and freed Flamewing,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
are confident in being able to resolve the formations soon?”
Azurefiend was overjoyed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“More
or less. Even if I end up taking longer than I expected, I should be
able to buy myself the time needed via the Jadefire Realm. If
necessary, I can also run around in the realmship and buy myself some
more time,” Ning said. “However… I don’t think we’ll need
to go to all that trouble. By the time they come back, the Flamewing
God will be waiting for them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hahaha!
If the Flamewing God comes out…” Azurefiend was absolutely
overjoyed and excited by this prospect. “You really will be able to
do whatever the hell you want. That is a Chaos Primordial! Hahaha!
With a Chaos Primordial at your beck and call, who would dare cause
trouble for you? If you gave the order, the Chaos Primordial would
charge straight into the Icepeak Army’s base and wreck it. The
Lonely King would be able to do nothing but stare, dumbstruck, as it
happened. There’s nothing he can do to the Flamewing God. Why
didn’t you tell me earlier?! I was so afraid that I thought we’d
have to go wandering through the cosmos.” Azurefiend stared at
Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Without
Flamewing, I wouldn’t have dared to take such a tough line against
them.” Ning smiled as well. “Let’s cut the chit-chat. Starting
today, I’m going to put all of my time and effort into solving the
formations and breaking them as soon as possible.”</P>

Chapter 10: Lord Wulf</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">An
area at the borders of the Flamedragon Realmverse. Countless bolts of
thunder were crackling throughout this region. Suddenly, three onyx
humanoids appeared and moved towards that area at high speeds.
“Hegemon Thunderstar,” the skinny onyx humanoid called out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The countless bolts of thunder merged together into a humanoid shape,
finally resolving into a violet-robed man. This was Hegemon
Thunderstar, who had brought them here via the realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
do you have the realmship?” Hegemon Thunderstar smiled at them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three onyx humanoids had no traces of amusement on their faces.
Previously, they had spoken so confidently… but who would’ve
thought that they’d come slinking back in disgrace? They had to
once again ask Hegemon Thunderstar to bring them back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, Hegemon Thunderstar had asked them that question on purpose.
He could clearly tell that they didn’t have the realmship! He was
quite pleased, however, to have the chance to mock a few Black
Emperors of the Icepeak Army.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
do not.” The skinny onyx humanoid said coldly, “Hegemon
Thunderstar, your guesses were spot-on. That puny Daolord truly is
fearless. He actually dared to defy our will.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
cyclopean onyx humanoid growled, “Daolord Darknorth is far too
arrogant. He actually dares to make an enemy out of the Icepeak Army!
I’ll definitely report this to the general. Hmph. We ran all the
way for nothing. In the end, we’ll need to ask the general to
personally intervene. He’s definitely going to die, and that
Vastheaven-whatever will be annihilated as well!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
have to make sure that he regrets this.” The muscular onyx humanoid
was filled with a killing rage as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Thunderstar couldn’t help but mutter beneath his breath. You failed
in your attempts to take it by force, but you still act with such
bravado. The Icepeak Army really did live up to its reputation. Who
would’ve thought that Daolord Darknorth truly was made of such
stern stuff?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Where
to next?” Hegemon Thunderstar asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“To
the general’s residence, Mount Doom,” the skinny onyx humanoid
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“And
where is Mount Doom?” Hegemon Thunderstar was puzzled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is the general’s estate within the Skywolf Realmverse.” The
skinny onyx humanoid said rather unhappily, “Hegemon Thunderstar,
don’t you know already?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Thunderstar didn’t argue. He truly hadn’t been to the Skywolf
Realmverse before, but he had heard that ‘Lord Wulf’s mountain’
was within the Skywolf Realmverse. However, the true name of the
place was ‘Mount Doom’; ‘Lord Wulf’s mountain’ was nothing
more than a nickname for it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come,
I’ll send you over there.” Hegemon Thunderstar waved his hand,
causing the realmship to appear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
need to travel quickly. We need to report this to the general as soon
as possible. Otherwise, I don’t know how I’m going to get this
taste out of my mouth,” the muscular onyx humanoid said rather
angrily. They had long ago grown accustomed to acting as they
pleased. As a result, when they occasionally encountered someone who
resisted them they couldn’t help but feel annoyed. In this case,
the person in question was a mere Daolord! This made them feel truly
insulted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Alas,
the Flamedragon Realmverse was incredibly far away from the Skywolf
Realmverse. There was no way for them to contact the Skywolf
Realmverse directly! Not even a Daolord’s true body and Primaltwin
would be able to sense each other from such a vast difference. One
had to at least be an Archon-class Eternal Emperor with an incredibly
powerful soul in order for your true body and Primaltwin to be able
to sense each other from such a great distance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Alas,
it was far too difficult to convince an Archon-class figure to follow
them like a retainer. Most would prefer death to such a life of
servitude.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The realmship tore through spacetime, departing at high speeds
towards the Skywolf Realmverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">18
million years later. Hegemon Thunderstar’s realmship had finally
reached the Skywolf Teritory.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
over there is Mount Doom.” The three Black Emperors stared from
afar at the towering mountain that jutted within the void. Looks of
delight were on their faces. This was their base.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Mount
Doom was completely gray and covered with countless runes and
patterns. At the very tip of Mount Doom was an area that glowed with
blurry silver light. The silver light illuminated the beautiful
palaces below. This was where Lord Wulf resided with his
subordinates.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“General.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“General.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“General.”
The three Black Emperors called out loudly after exiting the
realmship, their voices echoing in the air above Mount Doom.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ah,
Sealaw and the others are back.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is brother Sealaw and the others.” Figures began to fly out of
Mount Doom. All of them were onyx humanoids, their bodies covered
with silver diagrams and emanating auras of boundless cold.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Thunderstar couldn’t help but mutter to himself. They had all been
ordinary cultivators, but they had all chosen to undergo the Ritual
Sacrificium. They had abandoned their bodies, becoming freakish
creatures. Still, he understood that these Black Emperors had
originally been fairly mediocre Eternal Emperors. Now that they were
Black Emperors, they at least had Hegemonic levels of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
that? Is that a realmship?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Is
that our new realmship?” The onyx figures all turned to stare at
the distant realmship. Realmships were incredibly valuable; not even
their general, Lord Wulf, had access to one. Hegemon Thunderstar had
dared to come here because the three onyx humanoids had long ago
sworn lifeblood oaths guaranteeing his security. If they did not, all
three of them would die! Hegemon Thunderstar was also certain that he
would be able to escape safely.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Cut
the crap. Hurry up and take us to the general! Where is he? There’s
something important we need to report to him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
do you need to speak to me about?” A cold voice rang out, followed
by a golden figure emerging from the peak of Mount Doom. His entire
body seemed to have been composed out of gold, and his body was
similarly covered with silver diagrams. The aura emanating from him
was so powerful that it vastly outstripped the auras of the Black
Emperors serving him. He was one of the legendary Golden Emperors,
someone who had undergone the most powerful Ritual Sacrificium the
Sithe had to offer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for the so-called ‘Exalts’? That level could only be reached
through a mixture of cultivation and luck. They were supreme amongst
the Sithe and were the most powerful members of the entire race.
Hegemons could become transformed into Golden Emperors with ease and
‘manufactured’ in large numbers; there was naturally no way they
could be compared to the Exalts. Despite that, Golden Emperors still
had a level of power that was comparable to that of Otherverse Lords,
and their bodies were even tougher. To destroy their bodies was
nearly impossible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“General.”
The three Black Emperors who had just arrived immediately bowed
respectfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Speak.
You actually rushed over here in a realmship. What is this all
about?” Lord Wulf’s gaze was icy-cold. He glanced at the distant
realmship, then at his three subordinates.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“General,
we were on patrol as ordered,” the skinny onyx humanoid said
respectfully, “And we suddenly heard that in the Flamedragon
Realmverse, there was a Daolord named Darknorth who somehow managed
to take control over a Sithe site known as the Jadefire Realm. He
even managed to convince a Hegemon to serve him as his retainer.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
Daolord with a Hegemon as a retainer?” Lord Wulf was quite shocked,
as were the Black Emperors by his side. Although this news had spread
quite far, it hadn’t quite made it to the Skywolf Territory. These
two territories were simply too far away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“More
importantly, Daolord Darknorth actually has a realmship!” The
skinny Black Emperor said hurriedly, “The Hegemons of the
surrounding territories all wanted to take it from him, but in the
end, he actually managed to use the Jadefire Realm to take one of
them under his control. Once we heard the news, we immediately
travelled to the Flamedragon Realmverse. We wanted to force him to
hand it over so that we could offer it to you, General.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Lord
Wulf narrowed his eyes as he continued to listen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But…
he actually refused!” The skinny Black Emperor gritted his teeth
and growled, “He actually dared to refuse! We attacked him, but he
was so incredibly powerful that he was at the Hegemonic level of
might.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
Daolord comparable to Hegemons?” No matter how calm Lord Wulf
normally was, he couldn’t help but feel stunned. He nodded slowly.
“It seems he must have mastered one of the legendary Omega Daos,
and has had some other lucky experiences as well. Hmph… even if he
is a Daolord who is comparable to a Hegemon, he is still nothing
compared to our Icepeak Army. Are you sure that he dares to make an
enemy out of us?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.”
The skinny Black Emperor nodded, as did the other two. The cyclopean
Black Emperor explained, “He holds us in no regard at all. He
actually dared to say that he was willing to give us the realmship,
but only for treasures of equivalent value.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Does
he have some sort of special status?” Lord Wulf frowned. “For
example, is he an Autarch’s disciple? The Flamedragon Realmverse
should be under Realmslord Windgrace’s command. Could it be that he
has some sort of connection to Realmslord Windgrace?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
haven’t heard of him having any special status. He shouldn’t be
connected to Realmslord Windgrace at all! Previously, he attracted an
entire host of Hegemons and Emperors who attempted to kill him and
take his realmship, but Realmslord Windgrace didn’t intervene.
Clearly, there isn’t much of a relationship there. In the end, he
only survived because he took control over the Jadefire Realm,” the
skinny Black Emperor said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
he doesn’t have some sort of special background… no Daolord, no
matter how monstrously talented, is anything more than an ant in the
face of our Icepeak Army.” Lord Wulf swept the three with his icy
golden gaze, then turned to stare at the distant realmship. “If my
guess is correct, it should be Hegemon Thunderstar in command of that
realmship.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thunderstar
greets you, Lord Wulf.” Hegemon Thunderstar flew out of the
realmship and bowed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
wish to lead my Black Emperors to the Flamedragon Realmverse. I’d
like to trouble you to send us over there,” Lord Wulf said. “Of
course, we’ll make it worth your while.”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_011__Daom"></A>
Chapter 11: Chain Weapons</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Helping
you make a trip is a minor matter,” Hegemon Thunderstar said. The
Hegemons and Emperors of the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance had been in
a race against time to reach the Flamedragon Realmverse first, which
was why they had all been forced to pay exorbitant prices! Going by
normal prices, travelling the great distance from the Skywolf
Territory to the Flamedragon Realmverse was still going to be quite
expensive, but it was nothing to someone like Lord Wulf, who had
massacred and looted countless people.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
Black Emperors, assemble and move out alongside me!” Lord Wulf
ordered. “We are going to the Flamedragon Realmverse to take that
realmship.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Acknowledged!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
take that realmship.” A total of nine onyx humanoids flew out from
Mount Doom by his side.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Aside
from their supreme leader, the Lonely King, the Icepeak Army only had
a total of three generals! These three generals each commanded a
total of twelve Black Emperors. Normally, they would each have six
Black Emperors accompanying them. The other six would be assigned
into two squads responsible for patrolling the Chaosverse. Once they
heard anything important, they were to immediately come and report it
to their general!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three generals and the Lonely King operated in the same way. They
would have part of their soldiers with them, with the rest patrolling
the Chaosverse on a long-term basis. This ensured that the Icepeak
Army had a strong information network and was able to get involved in
any of the momentous events within the Chaosverse on short notice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
time, Lord Wulf had the three returned patrolling Black Emperors and
his six personal Black Emperors with him, making for a total of nine
Black Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“One
Golden Emperor and nine Black Emperors. A force like this is enough
to massacre the Flamedragon Realmverse ten times over.” Hegemon
Thunderstar mumbled to himself, “All I’m doing is earning a bit
of treasure by sending them over. Even if I declined, there would be
other Hegemons willing to help out. Daolord Darknorth, you are
nothing more than a Daolord but you dare to make an enemy out of the
Icepeak Army. I admire you for your courage… but the reason why the
other major powers were unwilling to act as you do is because the
consequences are too terrifying to bear.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Thunderstar couldn’t help but sigh a bit. He felt as though he
could see the end of the line for this genius Daolord. Golden
Emperors were all at the Otherverse Lord level of power! Nine Black
Emperors working in concert were equivalent in power to an Otherverse
Lord as well! How could the Flamedragon Realmverse possibly withstand
this level of power?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Flamedragon Realmverse remained as calm as always. Ning didn’t make
public the fact that he had faced off against three Black Emperors
belonging to the Icepeak Army. There was no point. Hegemon
Brightshore and the others wouldn’t be of any use, and so it was
best not to bother them about it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Terror Starsea. The Jadefire Realm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
it’s been twenty million years. The Icepeak Army could arrive at
any moment. How much longer is it going to take for you to break
these formations?” The skinny old man, Hegemon Azurefiend, was
seated in the lotus position on the deepfire blackstone floor, a
frantic look on his face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
was just estimating the time earlier!” Ning was standing atop the
Flamewing God’s back, focusing his efforts on the black chains in
front of him. “I wasn’t exactly sure as to how long it would take
for me to break these formations. I thought it would be quite fast,
but I ran into a few problems. Don’t be impatient and relax! The
Icepeak Army hasn’t even arrived yet. By the time they do arrive at
the Jadefire Realm, I’ll first use its defenses to tie them down
for quite some time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is Lord Wulf we are talking about! He’s supposedly a Golden Emperor
with an entire group of Black Emperors serving him. Your flaming
passageways won’t be able to withstand a force like his,” Hegemon
Azurefiend said hurriedly. “Why don’t we leave the Jadefire Realm
for now? Once you’ve fully mastered the formations, we can return
here. Otherwise, we’ll be caught here with nowhere to run.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Just
look at how freaked out you are. You are a Hegemon!” Ning raised
his head to glance sideways at Hegemon Azurefiend. “You look scared
out of your mind!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
just trying to be cautious,” Azurefiend immediately rebutted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry. The flaming passageways might not be able to kill them, but
they’ll definitely be able to slow them down.” Ning smiled. “When
I’m in the flaming passageways, I’ll be able to travel unimpeded.
I can shake them off with ease and escape as I please.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
no longer paid any further attention to Auzrefiend, focusing all of
his efforts on the countless formations covering the black chains
before him. Although he had memorized them all long ago, when he
viewed them in person and saw how the formations changed and flowed,
it was still of some help to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
continued to flow on. Azurefiend could do nothing but wait. The
feeling that the Icepeak Army was about to arrive at any moment was
quite an uncomfortable one. “Actually fighting to the death would
be better than just waiting here like this,” Azurefiend muttered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
even my master is as worried as you,” the nearby Whitethaw said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You…!”
Azurefiend glared at him. “H-he’s completely focused on his
formations, while I have nothing to do. Of course I’m going to be
miserable!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“To
put it plainly, you are a coward. You are scared.” Whitethaw
glanced sideways at Azurefiend.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Puny
golem, how dare you mock me!” Azurefiend glared at him. Whitethaw
just shut his mouth, paying Azurefiend no heed. Azurefiend was so
angry that his teeth hurt. Whitethaw only obeyed Ning’s orders and
didn’t seem to care about Azurefiend at all. There really was
nothing Azurefiend could do to the golem. He might be able to
completely dominate Whitethaw in a fight, but he wasn’t able to
actually injure Whitethaw.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
true body and Primaltwin were both consumed with their meditations.
Countless formations were flashing through their minds, circulating
nonstop and merging together. Some of the formations would then
vanish, replaced by other formations.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
art of formations relied heavily upon visualizations and divinations!
This was why the Dao of Formations was a legendarily complex one.
Anyone capable of becoming a Hegemon via the Dao of Formations would
definitely have a far higher level of status than ordinary Hegemons.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The countless formations were tweaked again and again. Suddenly, the
black-robed Ning in the Azureflower Estate and the white-robed Ning
within the hidden room in the Jadefire Realm both opened their eyes.
Their eyes were gleaming with shocking levels of light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
understand!” Ning murmured softly, his voice filled with suppressed
excitement. “These Sithe elders truly were incredible. They
actually managed to use formations in such a manner! Even though I
had all those Sithe techniques to serve as references, it still took
me an incredibly long period of time to understand and solve these
formations.” The more Ning researched the Sithe, the more impressed
he felt, even though he was currently just focusing on formations. No
wonder the Sithe had been so daring as to try and enslave all the
cultivator civilizations!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
is it?” The distant Azurefiend had been taking a nap while seated.
He opened his eyes to look at Ning, a hint of excitement in his gaze.
“Have you solved it?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master?”
Whitethaw looked at Ning as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
think I have.” Ning nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
do you mean, you THINK you have?” Azurefiend stared at him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
mental visualizations should be correct, but I need to actually try
them out.” Ning took a deep breath, manifesting three heads and six
arms as his aura grew markedly more powerful. All six of his arms
expanded in size as they simultaneously reached out to the six black
chains.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Each
of the fingers on Ning’s six hands turned crystalline in color as
he drew hand-seals with them. His fingers began to naturally come
together into a series of formations. The formations around his six
palms began to naturally merge together, almost like a marvelous
mechanism that was coming together in layers. Then, Ning’s six
hands separated to touch the black chains on six different spots.
Some moved slowly, some moved quickly, but there was a certain
natural beauty to the cadence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clack!
One of the black chains let out a series of clattering as it began to
move. The black chains began to undergo certain changes, transforming
to become significantly thicker in size. The thickened black chains
began to reach out towards one direction, moving alongside the
Flamewing God’s leg.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clack!
The black chain covering the leg suddenly expanded and then naturally
separated from the others. Once this happened, the second black chain
began to stretch out as well…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
six black chains seemed to be influencing each other. In the end, all
six of the chains imprisoning the Flamewing God began to naturally
separate from each other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Get
over here.” Ning reached out with all six hands, his crystalline
fingers once more tapping the six chains on six different locations.
Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh. All six black chains
were released from their void anchors and flew over towards Ning.
Ning dispelled the [Three Heads, Six Arms] technique. He reached out
with his right hand, causing all six chains to become very fine and
delicate as they coiled obediently around his arm like a bracelet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is a fine treasure, a unique weapon which the Sithe used in war.”
Ning smiled. “Once these chains coil around someone, they can fully
suppress it. Even Chaos Primordials can be suppressed by them! Most
likely, anyone below the Autarch level of power who is trapped by
them would be unable to break free.” However, Ning also knew that
no one would be so stupid as to allow the chains to just coil around
them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flamewing.
Flamewing!” Ning lept off the Flamewing God’s back and moved to
stand in front of it, then gave one of its paws a little kick.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
The slumbering Flamewing God opened its gigantic bleary eyes, then
stared downwards at the tiny white-robed figure standing in front of
it. Rather unhappy, it said, “Master, I’m still sleeping! Call me
once you break the formations.”</P>

Chapter 12: The Flamewing God Descends</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning secretly smirked. You are a Chaos Primordial! But all you do is
eat and sleep. You have no gravitas whatsoever. “Hurry up and get
up. Haven’t you noticed that the chains are gone?” Ning shook his
head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
chains are gone?” The Flamewing God’s eyes turned huge. He
hurriedly turned his head to stare at his two wings, then stared
downwards from his flank to look at his four stubby legs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hahaha!
They’re gone! They’re really gone! Those damnable chains are
finally gone!” The Flamewing God jumped to its feet, its giant body
quivering in excitement. “I’ve been trapped here forever. I
couldn’t even change my size or appearance, or find anything good
to eat! I didn’t have a good meal until you came, Master! That was
absolutely agonizing. Now? Ahahahaha!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Flamewing
raised his head and let out a delighted laugh. His laughter echoed
within the hidden room, forcing Ning, Azurefiend, and Whitethaw to
all press their hands over their ears. The laughter was simply far
too large.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Change!”
Flamewing boomed loudly. Whoosh! His large and winged frame instantly
transformed to become the same size as Ning and Azurefiend. He was
just slightly taller and very chubby. His skin was ruddy, and his
eyes were rather vacant-looking, as though he wasn’t all that
clever. His aura was completely reserved; he didn’t look like he
posed the slightest threat to anyone at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Whoah.
It’s been ages since I’ve taken human form. This feels nice! None
of those cultivators or Sithe would be able to recognize me like
this.” Flamewing smugly shook his rear a few times. In his normal
form, he was like a giant winged giant bear who loved to stretch his
wings. In human form, he naturally liked to shake his rear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Human
form?” Intrigued, Ning asked, “Flamewing, can it be that you
normally spent the majority of your time in human form?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
right!” Flamewing nodded. “I only use my true form when I was
wandering in the Great Dark. That allowed me to travel faster. When I
reached a realmverse, I’d occasionally feel so hungry that I’d
eat the entire thing. The vast majority of the time, however, I
wouldn’t want to do that. That’s because there are a lot of
things in realmverses which are unappetizing.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
thought suddenly entered Ning’s mind. Birth and death, destruction
and creation… this was a form of natural rhythm the Chaosverse went
through. Chaos Primordials had the intelligence levels of children…
that made them perfect tools for the prime essences of the Chaosverse
to exert their will. Powerful cultivators had incredibly strong
Dao-hearts, making it very hard for the Chaosverse to guide them.
However, guiding a Chaos Primordial was far simpler. When they felt a
sudden, powerful desire to eat, they’d eat entire realmverses!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Natural
destructive celestial bodies like Yin-Yang Samsara Wheels were
terrifying, but they took time to be born. Even the Chaosverse needed
time to create them, as well as many other factors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
wonder the Flamedragon Realmverse is threatened by the ‘Yin-Yang
Samsara Wheels’, but the Autarchs won’t intervene. If they
intervene, they’ll suffer a backlash from the Chaosverse.” Ning
couldn’t help but sigh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Flamewing
continued, “When I’m not in the mood to eat the realmverse, I’ll
secretly take human form. No one will be able to discover my true
entity, and I can just relax and wander through the various places
within that realmverse, searching for delicacies to eat. Eheheh…
when I accidentally reveal my true identity, I’ll immediately slip
away!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
able to sense when powerful cultivators appear nearby. It is a form
of precognition, and I’ll immediately slip away to ensure they
cannot find me,” Flamewing said smugly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. No wonder so few had ever encountered a Chaos Primordial!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Unfortunately…
the last time, I sensed danger coming and immediately fled, but the
Sithe were still able to catch up to me. After that, they caught me.”
The Flamewing God ground its teeth. “If I ever see another Sithe,
I’ll eat him alive.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sithe were wiped out long ago. Even if a few of them are still
around, you wouldn’t have a chance to kill them. The Autarchs
would’ve intervened long ago,” Ning said. “Alright, now that
the formations have been disrupted, you are free to leave. Come,
accompany me in a visit to my homeland.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright!”
Flamewing’s ruddy face was covered in excitement. “I wanna go
right now! It’s been so long since I’ve visited a realmverse.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
nearby Azurefiend and Whitethaw both felt rather embarrassed. It
really was like talking to a child.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Flamewing
glanced sideways at Azurefiend and Whitethaw. Suddenly, Flamewing
narrowed his eyes and sauntered over to them. He soon reached
Azurefiend, who stared at him, rather puzzled. “Eh?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Burp.”
Flamewing suddenly used his rear to shove Hegemon Azurefiend to one
side. “Starting today…” Flamewing slapped his chest with a
pudgy hand. “I’m the boss of Master’s servants. Whitethaw, you
are second. As for you, you ugly old man? You are ranked third?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
the hell?” Azurefiend was instantly irritated by this. The
Flamewing God was like a child but was terrifyingly strong. For it to
be ‘above’ him was one thing… but why the hell was the Sithe
Protector golem also ranked above him?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Because
I said so, and because I don’t like you!” Flamewing glanced
sideways at Azurefiend. “Don’t think I’m too stupid to notice.
I can tell just from the way you look at me that you look down at me.
Hmph! I’ve visited countless realmverses and seen countless
cultivators. I can tell at a glance who likes me and who dislikes me.
Whitethaw’s much better than you!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
nearby Ning let out a startled laugh. At the same time, he couldn’t
help but sigh. Flamewing wasn’t very smart, but he had the pure
heart of a child. He could immediately tell who was good to him and
who wasn’t.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Did
you hear me? I’m the boss, Whitethaw’s second, and you are third!
If you don’t agree, I’ll beat you up until you do.” Flamewing
tapped his pudgy white finger against Azurefiend’s chest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
hear you.” Azurefiend was speechless. “Fine. You are the boss,
Whitethaw’s second, I’m third.” There was no point squabbling
with a Chaos Primordial.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
more like it.” Flamewing walked over to Ning, then said in a very
fond manner, “Let’s go, Master.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
rubbed his head. He felt as though he had suddenly adopted a child.
“Alright. Let’s go back to the Flamedragon Realmverse,” Ning
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
should we finish off Winterflame first?” Azurefiend suddenly said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
rush. Winterflame is like meat that’s already on the chopping
block, but we would need Flamewing to actually kill him. Once
Flamewing attacks, Winterflame would definitely spread the news to
everyone before he dies.” Ning shook his head. “Best not to
introduce too many variables into the mix for now. I’m planning to
use Flamewing against the Icepeak Army.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Icepeak Army dares to attack you, Master? Hmph. Leave them to me.
I’ll eat them all.” Flamewing held the Icepeak Army in no regard
at all. Aside from the Autarchs and the Sithe Exalts, Flamewing truly
feared nothing and no one whatsoever.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Flamedragon Realmverse. An empty region within the imperial palace of
the Brightshore Kingdom. Hegemon Brightshore’s vast form was
located here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Hegemon Brightshore slowly opened his eyes, a hint of confusion in
them. “Why do I suddenly have a strange premonition that something
major has just happened within the Flamedragon Realmverse? The last
time I felt something like this was when Crimsonwave Temple appeared.
The fruits within it were quite useful to Hegemons and Emperors, and
the temple itself is tremendously important.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
time… it doesn’t feel as though a treasure has emerged. Rather, I
can sense a strange sort of pressure.” Hegemon Brightshore was
puzzled. It was as though something had just happened which caused a
wave of invisible pressure that pressed down on his heart, causing
him alarm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
one had reached certain heights in cultivation, one would be able to
sense when something incredibly important to them had just happened!
Hegemons were second only to Autarchs when it came to actual insights
into the Dao. The so-called ‘Otherverse Lords’ were nothing more
than Hegemons who had managed to take control over an otherverse.
With regards to the Dao, Hegemons and Otherverse Lords were on the
same level. This was true even for figures like Realmslord Windgrace
or the Lonely King, who had managed to take control of terrifyingly
powerful Sithe war machines.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?
What just happened in the Flamedragon Realmverse? I feel my heart
clenching for no reason, as though something terrifying just
happened.” Hegemon Windrain of the Aberrant special lifeforms was
awoken from his meditations. He began to worry.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
senses can’t be deceiving me. Something has to have happened in the
Flamedragon Realmverse. I’ll go talk to Brightshore and Windrain
and see if they know what just happened.” Hegemon Netherlily of the
Ancient cultivators felt rather uneasy. In the past, the truly
supreme powers of the Flamedragon Realmverse had always been the
three of them. They would always discuss any major events that
happened.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had successfully resolved the formations, unshackling the Flamewing
God and bringing it to the Flamedragon Realmverse with him into
Vastheaven Palace. The only ones in the Flamedragon Realmverse who
could sense that this had happened were the three Hegemons.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
major powers of other realmverses were simply too far away, and this
matter was of negligible impact to them. They naturally couldn’t
sense anything at all. However… there was one major power in the
Sixteen Realmverses Alliance outside the Flamedragon Realmverse who
was able to sense something. This was the true leader and most
powerful member of the alliance… Realmslord Windgrace!</P>

Chapter 13: Emperor Waveshift Returns</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Hiddenfiend Realmverse. The Blacksun.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">An
old man was seated atop an extremely slick boulder within a secluded
courtyard. This old man had a large, tousled beard and mussed-up
hair. His eyebrows were so messy that they were growing into a
unibrow, giving him a very unkempt appearance. However, his face was
extremely calm. His eyes were closed, and he just sat there silently
in the lotus position. Each time he entered this form of silent
meditation, it would last for varying amount of times. Sometimes, he
could sit there for more than ten thousand chaos cycles.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Realmslord
Windgrace enjoyed sitting quietly like this. When meditating, his
spirit felt free and unencumbered. All sorts of thoughts and insights
flowed through him. It was like both thinking and not-thinking at the
same time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">At
his level of insight, treasures which assisted in cultivation were of
no further use. He had simply been training for far too long; he had
already made breakthroughs in everything he possibly could. Right
now, what he needed was a true epiphany… but true epiphanies could
not be achieved via any treasures at all. The Autarch’s stone dais
which Ning used simply allowed him to emulate a quasi-epiphany state
that allowed him to train at incredibly faster speeds, but there was
nothing it could do to allow him to breach a true bottleneck.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Once
one had reached a bottleneck, no treasures would be of any use in
assisting you in the breakthrough. Only insights and epiphanies would
suffice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
An invisible tendril of power suddenly snaked its way through his
empty spirit like a premonition. Realmslord Windgrace suddenly opened
his eyes, a hint of surprise within them. Moments later, he regained
his usual calm, but he frowned in thought: “I have the feeling that
a terrifying force has just emerged, one which even I am incapable of
controlling. And yet, I can sense that it should be connected to me.
Is it within the Hiddenfiend Realm? Or is it elsewhere in the Sixteen
Realmverses Alliance?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sixteen Realmverses Alliance was his territory. Even a force as
arrogant as the Icepeak Army wanted to first verify that Daolord
Darknorth didn’t have a connection to Realmslord Windgrace before
taking action. Even then, they chose to sneak into the Flamedragon
Realmverse and would only act against Ji Ning and Ji Ning alone! They
didn’t want to cause too much trouble. This was a testament to what
a preeminent power Realmslord Windgrace was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Generally
speaking, the likes of Realmslord Windgrace or the Lonely King
wouldn’t get involved in minor squabbles. Avoiding causing too much
trouble was the key!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
even I am incapable of controlling it… what could it be?”
Realmslord Windgrace was puzzled. He immediately began to engage in
some Numerancy divinations.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had been a Hegemon for far, far too long; he was far more ancient
that even Hegemon Brightshore. He had been a legendary figure even
during the Dawn War, and he had been given guidance by more than one
Autarch. He had reached an incredibly high level of insight into
multiple Daos, and had mastered three Hegemonic Daos! However, the
Dao of Numerancy was simply far too difficult to master. He had yet
to reach even the Archon level in Numerancy; in fact, he was far from
it. Most likely, he was merely on par with the level which Daolord
Badlands would reach once the latter became a Daolord of the Fourth
Step. Still, he was able to divine a few things.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is connected to me, and it is indeed something within the Sixteen
Realmverses Alliance. However, no further details can be divined.”
Realmslord Windgrace frowned. The uneasy feeling in his heart made it
impossible for him to meditate calmly any further.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
have no idea where Emperor Waveshift is. My only choice is to ask
Blackwood to help out,” Realmslord Windgrace mused. Emperor
Waveshift had obviously reached terrifying heights in the Dao of
Numerancy; he had actually reached the Hegemon level in this Dao!
Although he was a bit weak in actual combat, he had reached the apex
of Numerancy for anyone aside from the Autarchs! Thus, not even the
likes of Realmslord Windgrace or the Lonely King were willing to
offend Waveshift. Everyone treated him with the utmost of respect.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Realmslord
Windgrace’s first reaction was to seek out Waveshift… but alas,
he was unable to find him and thus could only ask Blackwood for
assistance. Although Hegemon Blackwood only trained in Numerancy as a
secondary Dao, he had at least reached the Archon level in Numerancy
and thus was still incredibly skilled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
planet that was 900 million kilometers in diameter. This planet was
surrounded by eight gigantic azure wooden boards, each of which was
1.8 billion kilometers tall, 36,000 kilometers wide, and 9000
kilometers thick.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
were no living creatures on this planet, just a single bearded man
who was seated on the vast earth. This was Hegemon Blackwood.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
the eight titanic wooden boards slowly swiveled around the planet.
They moved like the functioning of the cosmos itself, carrying a
strange, unique cadence to them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Hegemon Blackwood suddenly opened his eyes. His face was a bit ashen.
The eight azure wooden boards surrounding the planet quickly flew
towards him and landed on his back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
calculations are complete. It happened in the Flamedragon
Realmverse.” Hegemon Blackwood nodded slowly. “A terrifying new
power has emerged, so strong as to be completely impossible. My
subconscious is warning me that it is even more dominating than
Realmslord Windgrace himself.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Who
does this new force represent? Can it be that a Hegemon has
discovered yet another Sithe war machine?” Hegemon Blackwood
couldn’t help but come to this conclusion. Terrifying Sithe war
machines were capable of terrifying amounts of power. Some were
stronger, some were weaker; for example, although Ning’s chain
weapons had incredible suppressive and absorptive powers, they had to
first be wrapped around a cultivator successfully. This meant that
they were fairly unique, but of limited use in combat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Blacksun, however… it was just a single item, but it was capable of
changing the results of an entire battlefield during the Dawn War.
Realmslord Windgrace had just one Sithe war machine while the Lonely
King had several, but the two were equal in status. This was why.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Flamedragon Realmverse?” After Realmslord Windgrace received
Hegemon Blackwood’s response, he immediately sent a message:
“Brightshore, Netherlily, Windrain, I believe a terrifying new
force has emerged within your Flamedragon Realmverse, one which is
beyond my abilities to control. You need to keep a close eye on your
realmverse. Once anything unusual happens, you need to immediately
inform me and I’ll head there right away.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
sensed something as well, a terrifying sense of pressure.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’re
already searching for it.” After receiving the word from Realmslord
Windgrace, all three Hegemons felt slightly more confident. If even
Realmslord Windgrace was able to sense it, then that meant that they
could ask him to intervene and help out if something happened.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">And
so Brightshore, Netherlily, and Windrain, alongside the Dao Alliance
(which also received orders from Realmslord Windgrace), began to
scour the Flamedragon Realmverse in an attempt to find any hints
about what the premonitions entailed. Alas, the Flamedragon
Realmverse remained extremely peaceful. Nothing happened at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
flowed on. More than six million years went by after the Flamewing
God’s release.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
A realmship suddenly appeared at the borders of the Flamedragon
Realmverse. Just one person was within the realmship. This person was
dressed in azure robes and stood tall. He didn’t have any weapons
on him at all, and his gaze was warm and calm, seemingly capable of
seeing through to the truth of everything. When he saw the
Flamedragon Realmverse appear before him, he revealed a hint of a
smile: “I’m back. Flamedragon Realmverse… I, Waveshift, am
back!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was the legendary Emperor Waveshift! In the vast Chaosverse, his web
of connections was far superior to even Realmslord Windgrace.
Although Windgrace was much stronger than him, the major powers
located in distant realmverses and otherverses didn’t care about
Windgrace at all because they would probably never meet the man!
There would never be anything they would need from Realmslord
Windgrace… but there were many who needed favors from Emperor
Waveshift.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
feeling of coming home…” Emperor Waveshift commanded his
realmship forwards, joy in his heart as he stared at the Flamedragon
Realmverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Waveshift had a very unique aura. It was quite transcendent, almost
as though he was a spectator viewing the vast Chaosverse from a lofty
height.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
never would’ve imagined that my homeland, the Flamedragon
Realmverse, would’ve produced such an incredible figure that even I
would sense it from afar.” Emperor Waveshift had a smile on his
face. He had reached such incredible heights in the Dao of Numerancy
that he would have premonitions whenever anything momentous happened
in his homeland, the Flamedragon Realmverse. He could sense when a
new Hegemon was born, and could also sense when the Flamewing God
came out alongside Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Time
for me to visit this incredible newcomer.” Emperor Waveshift
smiled. Swoosh! His realmship tore through spacetime and began to
advance towards Vastheaven Palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Given
Emperor Waveshift’s skills in Numerancy, he was able to divine
where the terrifying new force was currently located. Thus, he was
able to continuously move closer towards it with ease! He couldn’t
even be bothered to engage in repeated divinations. Instead, he tore
through spacetime and went straight to the Vastheaven Everworld. He
used the information he knew regarding the entire Flamedragon
Realmverse to engage in reverse-divination, skimming through the
countless lines of karma to find what he wanted to know.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
is highly probable that this incredible newcomer is that genius
Daolord, Daolord Darknorth, who has managed to develop an Omega Dao.”
Upon reaching the Flamedragon Realmverse, Emperor Waveshift quickly
came to a few rough conclusions. If his conclusions were wrong, he
would then engage in a few more divinations to come to a more
detailed level of understanding.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Waveshift stood there within the void outside the Vastheaven
Everworld, staring at everything within it. “Ah. My guesses were
correct.” Emperor Waveshift nodded slowly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Chaosverse was filled with countless lines of karma. Although Ning
was able to ‘see’ karma, it must be remembered that even ordinary
mortals were bound by countless lines of karma. Think about how many
people lived in everworlds! Everworlds were filled with so much
karma, they were like seas of smoke; there was simply no way to make
anything out clearly. Emperor Waveshift, however, was different. When
he viewed the Waveshift Everworld, he knew that his guesses were
correct.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
new power is indeed within the Vastheaven Everworld. Daolord
Darknorth, eh? I want to see just how terrifyingly powerful this new
force is.” Emperor Waveshift took a single step forwards and
entered the Vastheaven Everworld.</P>

Chapter 14: Ji Ning and Emperor Waveshift</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the Vastheaven Everworld.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning was seated in the lotus position next to a bridge, a few swirls
of sword-light flowing around him. Not too far away, a chubby man was
lying on the ground within a patch of flowers, crushing quite a few
of them beneath his bulk. The chubby man had a haunch of meat in his
hands, and he was enjoying a wonderful meal. He continuously rolled
right and left while he ate, almost as though he was in a rocking
cradle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Azurefiend was eating and drinking in a distant pavilion while
occasionally casting extremely unhappy looks towards the
ruddy-skinned fat man. As for Protector Whitethaw, he quietly sat in
a corner. He would always be on guard for Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Life
is great!” the chubby Flamewing mumbled while eating.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Bastard
Flamewing. He keeps taking my food. If it wasn’t for the fact that
I can’t outfight him… bah!” Azurefiend muttered to himself as
he ate, but made sure to keep up a barrier of Immortal energy to
ensure that his voice did not carry. Azurefiend really was irritated.
He was a glutton as well, but whenever he brought out any good food
it would be taken away by Flamewing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
was unable to outfight Flamewing. All he could do was to privately
insult the Chaos Primordial, but he had to ensure that Flamewing
didn’t hear it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fellow
Daoist Darknorth.” A voice suddenly rang out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning opened his eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fellow
Daoist, your formations certainly are formidable. Ordinary sect
formations are unable to bar my path, and I’m able to bypass them
with ease. The formations you set up, however, are inscrutable and
unfathomable. I’m not able to breach them yet.” A voice rang out
from outside Vastheaven Palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
turned to look, only to see an azure-robed man standing in the air
outside the formations. Ning couldn’t help but feel shocked when he
saw this man, who gave Ning a very unique feeling. The man radiated a
transcendent aura, almost as though he was beyond all worldly
concerns. Ning could even ‘see’ that the karma surrounding this
person was extremely calm and warm. The karma lines were all neat and
orderly, as though they were under the azure-robed man’s complete
control. This was because this azure-robed man was not bound by his
karma; instead, he used it as a form of tool.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Of
all the people Ning had ever encountered, only Autarch Titanos
surpassed this man. Autarch Titanos had completely surpassed karma
itself, which didn’t even touch him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Please
come in, fellow Daoist.” Ning immediately opened up the formations
and invited the azure-robed man in. The azure-robed man walked
through the air to come in, then entered Ning’s estate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
Hegemon… the legends said, Daolord Darknorth, that you have a
Hegemonic retainer by your side. This must be Hegemon Azurefiend.”
The azure-robed man cast a sidelong glance at the distant Hegemon
Azurefiend, then turned his gaze to the still-feasting chubby man who
was rolling around within the flowers. A hint of surprise finally
appeared in the azure-robed man’s eyes, and he let out a shocked
laugh: “So it is a Chaos Primordial! Impressive, truly impressive!
Judging from its karma lines… Daolord Darknorth, you actually
managed to tame a Chaos Primordial? I truly do admire you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was speechless. The karma lines connecting him and Flamewing were
indeed quite thick, but how was it that this person was able to
immediately recognize Flamewing as a Chaos Primordial? It must be
remembered that Flamewing’s transformation ability was an innate
gift; not even Ning himself was able to see any flaws in it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“And
who are you?” The skinny old Hegemon Azurefiend walked over, an
unhappy frown on his face. This newcomer had immediately called him a
‘Hegemonic retainer’ and didn’t seem to have much respect for
him. This naturally displeased Azurefiend greatly… and he didn’t
feel as though this person was much of a threat to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
name is Waveshift,” the azure-robed man said. Ignoring the shocked
look which appeared on Hegemon Azurefiend’s face, he turned to look
at Ning. “I was previously wandering the outside world when I
suddenly sensed that a new power had emerged within my homeland.
Thus, I immediately hastened back. I was able to divine that the new
power was within the Vastheaven Everworld and thus came to your
residence, Daolord Darknorth. I never would’ve imagined that this
new power would be a Chaos Primordial! Truly praiseworthy, Daolord…
with a Chaos Primordial at your command, you are now an incredible
figure of the Chaosverse.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
felt rather stunned, but was able to maintain an outwards appearance
of calm. “Emperor Waveshift, you truly do surprise me. I never
would’ve imagined that I’d be able to meet you today. Come, come!
Please have a seat. Let us chat.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well.” Emperor Waveshift nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was filled with admiration and curiosity towards the legendary
Emperor Waveshift, while Emperor Waveshift also viewed Ji Ning as a
truly legendary Daolord.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Anyone
capable of becoming a Daolord of the Fourth Step via an Omega Dao
could be described as a legendary figure. Incredibly few had ever
accomplished this; there were far more Otherverse Lords than Omega
Daolords. As for a Daolord capable of convincing a Hegemon to become
a retainer? That was even rarer… and now, this Daolord had even
tamed a Chaos Primordial! Emperor Waveshift truly did feel admiration
towards Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
two chatted and laughed together, quickly finding out that they were
birds of a feather.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ah,
so that’s how it is.” Emperor Waveshift nodded. “The Icepeak
Army truly is famous for its arrogance and overbearing behavior. As
they see it, you are a Daolord with a limited lifespan. Once you fail
your Daomerge, people will end up fighting over the realmship anyhow.
It only makes sense for them to want to get a head start on it. Given
that you also embarrassed them… there’s no way the Icepeak Army
is going to let things rest. Still, this time they should merely be
sending one of their Golden Emperors, ‘Lord Wulf’, and the Black
Emperors under his command. Given that you have a Chaos Primordial,
they are of no threat to you whatsoever.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded in agreement.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh,
right. When I arrived at Vastheaven Palace, I saw that the formations
protecting it truly are marvelous,” Emperor Waveshift said.
“Although the Dao of Formations is a secondary Dao for me, I’ve
still reached the Archon level in it. Given my skills in Numerancy,
I’m usually quite skilled in dissecting formations, but I found
your formations to be quite difficult and complex.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
laughed. “Big brother Waveshift, you truly are formidable. You were
able to recognize them as being set down by me with just one glance.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
minor parlor trick. Divination is the only thing I am good at,”
Emperor Waveshift said. By now, the two were already on such good
terms that they were referring to each other as ‘brother’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
formations primarily stem from two completely different schools of
thought which belong to the Sithe lineage. Their power stems from the
combination of these two schools of thought,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
wonder.” Emperor Waveshift nodded, then said, “You’ve only
trained for a brief period of time, but you’ve reached such heights
in the art of formations. You truly are a genius who has mastered an
Omega Dao! Although we’ve only known each other for a short period
of time, I feel that we are quite similar. I must remind you, now
that you have a Chaos Primordial there is no one capable of posing a
threat to you. You need to focus on your cultivating. To you, the
greatest problem shall be the Daomerge! If you fail the Daomerge…
ugh. Well. But if you succeed, you’ll gain eternal life and we’ll
be able to meet often.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Cultivators
each had their own unique personalities. Hegemon Brightshore, Hegemon
Windrain, Hegemon Netherlily… they all had their own unique
temperaments. Ning was on fairly good terms with them, but he wasn’t
exactly close friends with them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
experiences he had shared with Ninedust had resulted in them slowly
becoming friends for life. As for Emperor Waveshift? They shared
extremely similar personalities, resulting in both taking a liking to
the other right away. As a result, they became friends as well. It
wasn’t easy for major powers to become friends with each other. Now
that they were friends, Emperor Waveshift couldn’t help but worry
about Darknorth’s chances at the Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Daomerge… all I can do is try my utmost with no looking back. As
for whether I succeed or not… so long as I do my best, I’ll have
no regrets,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
flowed on. To Emperors, two chaos cycles was a very short period of
time. Thus, Emperor Waveshift decided to temporarily take up
residence in Vastheaven Palace. Later on, when Emperor Solesky
learned that the legendary Emperor Waveshift was actually within his
own palace, he was scared silly. He only kept it secret after being
requested to do so by Ning and Waveshift.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Waveshift would only meet those he wanted to meet. There were many he
did not wish to meet; they would just bring too much trouble.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ten
million years after Emperor Waveshift’s arrival.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
Emperor Waveshift and Ning were seated next to each other, playing a
game of chess. As a master of formations, Ning was quite skilled in
chess, while Emperor Waveshift was naturally even better. It was rare
for them to encounter such excellent opponents and so they often
played chess against each other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hm?”
Ning glanced over at Emperor Waveshift.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Icepeak Army should be arriving soon,” Emperor Waveshift said. “Let
us go and welcome them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They’ve
arrived?” Ning’s eyes lit up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Icepeak Army?” Hegemon Azurefiend and the chubby Flamewing were
eating and drinking together off in the distance. Both turned to look
at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
immediately rose to his feet and called out, “Let’s head out and
give the Icepeak Army a proper welcome.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They’ve
finally come. Grrr… I’m going to eat them all!” Flamewing was
quite excited. He had been waiting for this day for quite some time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning, Emperor Waveshift, Flamewing, Azurefiend, and Whitethaw all
boarded Ning’s realmship, then flew out to the margins of the
Flamedragon Realmverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
wait for them here.” The azure-robed Emperor Waveshift stared off
into the endless Great Dark. “In roughly the time needed to boil a
kettle of tea, the Icepeak Army shall arrive.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
felt a sense of absolute reverence for this level of Numerancy-fueled
precognitive foresight.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_015__Daom"></A>
Chapter 15: Kill!</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Here
they come,” Emperor Waveshift suddenly said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning also saw how a series of ripples began to appear at the margins
of the Great Dark. Moments later an enormous spacetime tear appeared
within the darkness, followed by a realmship flying out of it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph!”
An angered snort rang out from within the realmship as an aura of
tremendous might swept outwards, causing Ning, Azurefiend, and
Whitethaw to turn slightly pale. Emperor Waveshift and the Flamewing
God remained as composed as ever.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Waveshift wasn’t all that powerful, but he had experienced many,
many things. He had met some truly terrifying figures and had been to
many mysterious places, far more than even the Lonely King or
Realmslord Windgrace. He truly was the embodiment of the term ‘highly
experienced’; naturally, he was able to maintain his equanimity
when encountering a single Golden Emperor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for Flamewing? Most likely, only Sithe Exalts or the Autarchs were
capable of inspiring dread in him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
bold. You actually dare to appear before me.” A series of figures
began to fly out of the realmship, with a humanoid figure that
glittered like gold at their head. Behind him was a total of nine
black humanoids, each of whom had auras of transcendent power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
single Golden Emperor was equivalent to an Otherverse Lord in power!
Nine Black Emperors fighting in concert were also a match for an
Otherverse Lord! The amount of pressure they brought to their foes
was truly incredible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Waveshift?”
The Golden Emperor, Lord Wulf, turned to look at Emperor Waveshift. A
hint of astonishment flashed past his eyes. He snorted coldly, “No
wonder Daolord Darknorth just so happened to be waiting for us right
here. So he has you standing behind him, Emperor Waveshift! I’ve
heard of you long ago, but today is the first time we’ve met. Are
you here to stop me?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Waveshift laughed. “If I asked you to leave, would you actually
leave?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Of
course not.” Lord Wulf had a more baleful and more dominating aura
than anyone Ning had ever encountered, and he held Emperor Waveshift
in no regard at all. “Those who like you, Emperor Waveshift, will
flatter you… but to those who don’t like you, you aren’t worth
half a damn!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Lord
Wulf was an incredibly proud figure. There was nothing he wanted from
Emperor Waveshift, and this was actually the very first time the two
had met despite both having lived for countless years. He naturally
felt no respect for Waveshift, an Emperor who didn’t even have the
combat power of a Hegemon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
I’m quite weak; my talents lie in Numerancy and Numerancy alone. My
friends flatter me, but to those who have no need of my talents I
truly am worth very little.” Emperor Waveshift remained quite calm
and composed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Lord
Wulf’s face was a mask of icy arrogance, but many thoughts flitted
through his mind. “Emperor Waveshift is actually here… can this
be a scheme of some kind? But as a Golden Emperor, I’m even better
at staying alive than actual Otherverse Lords. Given my power and the
power of the nine Black Emperors who serve me, the only person in
this area who would pose a threat to me should be Realmslord
Windgrace! Even if Emperor Waveshift is plotting against me, he won’t
be able to do anything to me at all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
overwhelm them with raw power. In front of absolute power, all
schemes are nothing more than jokes.” Lord Wulf was extremely
confident in his abilities.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth.” Lord Wulf stared at the distant white-robed youth who
bore that black sheath on his back. Ning was looking at him as well,
and their gazes met in the air.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“General
Wulf,” Ning responded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
are an impressive Daolord. Truly, you are incredible,” Lord Wulf
said. “I’ve been alive for a very long time, but you are the only
Daolord I have any respect for.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
praise me too much, General,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
be modest. A Daolord who can reach Hegemonic levels of power and even
command a Hegemon retainer truly is incredible.” Lord Wulf glanced
sideways at Azurefiend, who was by Ning’s side. “However… your
retainer is a bit too cowardly. I would’ve committed suicide long
ago.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Cold
light flickered through Azurefiend’s eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
contempt is reserved for those who commit suicide,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hm?”
Lord Wulf frowned as he looked at the white-robed youth, then said
coldly, “You really don’t know what’s good for you. No wonder
you dared to make an enemy out of our Icepeak Army! Daolord
Darknorth, as a Daolord you shall merely live for 108,000 chaos
cycles. This is an incredibly short period of time! Once your
lifespan comes to an end, you shall perish and your realmship will
fall into the hands of others. In fact, there might even be a great
battle over it. Emperors like myself who possess limitless lifespans
can use it to wander the many realmverses and see more things… but
for you to hold a realmship is an absolute waste! I urge you to hand
it over. That way, you’ll at least remain alive,” Lord Wulf said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had been planning to attack immediately, but when he saw Emperor
Waveshift… he still felt extremely confident in his chances, but he
chose to be just a bit more cautious than he otherwise would have
been.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hand
it over?” Ning shook his head. “Why should I just hand my
treasures over to you?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Are
you sure you are going to refuse me?” The baleful aura surrounding
Lord Wulf began to froth and churn. The hint of caution he had felt
upon seeing Emperor Waveshift was beginning to dissipate, and his
innate brutal disposition was beginning to reveal itself once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
refuse.” Ning shook his head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
are courting death.” Lord Wulf’s gaze turned cold. He pointed
angrily at Ning as his voice echoed throughout the surrounding area:
“Kill them all, and exterminate Vastheaven Palace! Let everyone
know what happens when they make enemies out of our Icepeak Army!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Acknowledged,”
the nine onyx humanoids simultaneous said respectfully. “Kill them
all!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Kill!”
Murderous looks appeared on the faces of the nine Black Emperors, and
their auras began to flare with awesome power. They were like nine
streaks of black light that split apart the void as they shot
forward. They had long ago grown accustomed to warfare and conquest!
They had completely uprooted and destroyed quite a few powerful
organizations; to them, an organization that was merely headed by a
Daolord was nothing worth mentioning at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flamewing,
kill them all!” Ning pointed towards his foes and issued an order
as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
been waiting for you to say that.” Flamewing had been standing
restlessly by Ning’s side. Upon hearing the order, he wagged his
big butt excitedly, then let out an excited roar. This
ordinary-looking fatty suddenly transformed into a dazzling ball of
blazing fire which had a strange creature inside of it, a creature
that looked like a fiery-winged bear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
nine attacking Black Emperors all revealed looks of nervousness and
puzzlement. They could sense incredible danger, but they had no idea
what it was they were looking at.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
The distant Lord Wulf suddenly turned pale.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“GWAAAAR!”
Flamewing let out a shocking roar, and as he did so he belched forth
a torrent of dark-red flames from his mouth. It almost instantly
covered the surrounding void, including the nine Black Emperors who
were charging in their direction.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
that?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“ARGH!
Not good, those flames are too powerful. Quick, run!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
nine Black Emperors felt tremendous pain as soon as those dark-red
flames touched them. Even their black skin began to slowly melt away!
Although they were a bit more powerful than Whitethaw, they were
still just Black Emperors; in other words, they were living beings
who had used the Ritual Sacrificium to inherit a certain level of
power. In contrast, Whitethaw was a ‘pure’ golem who was designed
for defense; his survival abilities were far superior to theirs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
terrifying flames. These flames are far more powerful than even a
Hegemon’s flames,” Waveshift said with an amazed sigh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ordinary
Hegemons would be burned to death by those flames,” the nearby
Azurefiend said. “These Black Emperors have incredibly tough
bodies; they are just melting slightly from the heat.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
As Flamewing belched out those terrifying dark-red flames, his wings
fluttered and sent him streaking forwards like a bolt of terrifying
light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
fast!” Ning was shocked. Flamewing was flying far faster than even
a realmship!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
creature is far too fast!” Hegemon Thunderstar, hiding off in the
distance within his own realmship, was shocked by this as well. He
had become a Hegemon via the Dao of Lightning and could be described
as having reached the very apex of speed amongst cultivators, but he
still felt astonishment. “He’s far, far faster than me. How can
he be this fast?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Why
was Flamewing known as the Flamewing God? It was precisely because of
how incredibly fast he flew. This was why many classified him as a
bird, as his prowess lay in his flight speed. Attacking techniques
were of secondary importance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiip.
Flamewing transformed into a streak of light and almost instantly
shot towards a Black Emperor. He reached out with one of his chubby
paws and swiped at the Black Emperor with it, causing the Black
Emperor’s arm to twist unnaturally. A large wound appeared on the
Black Emperor’s chest as well, so deep as to expose the countless
stone passageways located within his chest. One of the planets inside
his body completely exploded. This was a lethal blow for the Black
Emperor, who instantly lost his life as a result.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash!
Yet another paw-strike, this time aimed at the head of a Black
Emperor. Although Black Emperors had incredibly sturdy heads, it was
still possible for one to shatter those heads with enough power. As a
result, this second Black Emperor died as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Retreat,
quick!” Lord Wulf could do nothing but watch as this all happened,
his eyes threatening to leave their sockets. As soon as he had seen
those dark-red flames, he knew something was wrong and so he
immediately charged forwards to rescue his subordinate… but
compared to Flamewing, his flying speed was far, far slower. They
were on completely different levels.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_016__Daom"></A>
Chapter 16: The Shocking Chaos Primordial</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">These
Black Emperors moved far more slowly than the Flamewing God, and the
terrifying dark-red flames had only caused them to slow down even
further.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for Lord Wulf coming to reinforce them? They immediately gave up that
notion. Given his speed, by the time he flew over, the Flamewing God
would’ve pretty much killed them all. Thus… they had to take care
of themselves!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Join
forces.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Work
together to buy some time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
only need to hold on for an instant.” The onyx humanoids were all
absolutely terrified. It was as though they had met their natural
predator! Fortunately, the nine of them had charged over together and
thus were quite close to each other. By the time the Flamewing God
had killed two of them, the other seven had already quickly gathered
together.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hide
inside this estate-treasure first.” One of the Black Emperors
tossed out an estate-type treasure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Crack!
The dark-red flames were powerful enough to kill even Hegemons. This
top-grade Eternal estate-treasure instantly began to crack apart,
followed by the treasure being completely destroyed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoooosh!
Bathed in flames, the Flamewing God’s wings fluttered a single
time, sending it straight towards the seven Black Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Block!”
The seven Black Emperors simultaneously swept out with their palms as
the silver diagrams covering their bodies began to light up. An
awesomely cold aura swept out from them as ice began to form over
their gigantic black palms, sweeping towards the attacking Flamewing
God.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Grrr…
die!” Flamewing was a dominating force of nature; it naturally
chose to meet their attacks head-on! It flew straight towards its
opponents, its giant bear-like paws smashing downwards with such
power that even Ning and Azurefiend felt their hearts tremble as they
watched from afar. Its attack collided head-on against the giant
black palms of the seven Black Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
This was a collision of incredible power, and it instantly caused
space around them to completely collapse and crumble.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
the seven Black Emperors joined forces, they were able to unleash an
amount of power that was equal to that of an Otherverse Lord’s.
Although they were clearly at a disadvantage when battling the
Flamewing God, they were at least able to briefly pause it in its
tracks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for the seven Black Emperors themselves, they were knocked flying
backwards, their bodies trembling and crackling as a large amount of
tears and injuries appeared on them. They had suffered incredibly
heavy injuries; even they would need quite a long period of time to
completely recover.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The Flamewing God was enraged at having been briefly stopped in its
tracks. It once more fluttered its wings. Swoosh! It instantly swept
through the void and charged at the Black Emperors, who were still in
the process of being blasted in each direction. They didn’t have
the chance to recover yet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
good.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flee
separately.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Save
yourselves!” The Black Emperors had all suffered heavy injuries,
and they had been blasted backwards with such force that they had
lost control over themselves. It was impossible for them to once more
join forces to block the Flamewing God, and so they simply followed
the momentum of the previous blast and began to flee for their lives.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiiip!
The Flamewing God was able to move at incredible speeds. Its claws
swept past the body of one of the fleeing Black Emperors, instantly
tearing the Black Emperor’s chest open. Quite a number of critical
systems lay within the chest, and so this strike was a lethal one.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“GWAAAAR!”
Flamewing opened its giant maw and bit down, crushing a Black Emperor
to bits with its teeth, then crunching through the remains and
swallowing them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was one of the most terrifying beasts in existence in the Chaosverse…
a Chaos Primordial! They would often eat entire realmverses when
hungry. In comparison, these onyx humanoids were devoured with ease
by Flamewing. In fact, Flamewing rather enjoyed the chewiness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Stop
that immediately!” Lord Wulf had finally arrive. Slash! Lord Wulf
had moved to bar Flamewing’s path, but Flamewing was still able to
land a clawing blow to a Black Emperor’s back, causing his spine to
completely cave in and a series of crackling sounds to emanate from
his body. The Black Emperor’s aura instantly whittled away into
nothingness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“DIE,
damn you!” The enraged Lord Wulf suddenly drew a saber in each of
his two hands. SLASH! SLASH! A pair of rainbow-like streaks of
saber-light chopped through the skies, filled with Lord Wulf’s
boundless rage and murderous will. The twin blows chopped straight
towards the Flamewing God, who simply fluttered its wings and used
them to block the two strikes like a shield. BOOM! The shockwave from
this collision was even more powerful than the one generated by the
clash between Flamewing and the seven Black Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Lord
Wulf was sent flying backwards, while Flamewing came to a halt as
well. It glanced at Lord Wulf, slightly surprised.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn,
damn, damn!” Lord Wulf glanced behind himself, only to see the four
heavily wounded surviving Black Emperors fleeing towards the distant
realmship. This caused Lord Wulf to feel a sense of pain in his
heart. “I had nine Black Emperors… and now, I’ve suddenly lost
five of them. The Icepeak Army has never, in all its history,
suffered such catastrophic losses before!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Icepeak Army had conquered all within its path, stirring up one war
after another, but even then its total losses had merely been eight
Black Emperors. This time, they had been planning to slay this puny
Daolord with ease… and yet they had instantly lost five of their
Black Emperors?!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
are pretty strong. You should be on par with those Otherverse Lords.
I probably won’t be able to kill you,” Flamewing growled. “So
you can go ahead and fuck off. Can’t be bothered to fight you! If
it wasn’t for the fact that those seven were able to block me
briefly, I would’ve wiped them all out by now.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Indeed.
Given the Flamewing God’s terrifying speed, he was in fact capable
of killing all of the onyx humanoids before Lord Wulf had arrived.
However, that extra moment of time the seven Black Emperors had
bought themselves by joining forces had caused the Flamewing God to
briefly slow down, resulting in ‘just’ five perishing and four
escaping.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Y-you…!”
Lord Wulf felt even angrier. He had never suffered such catastrophic
losses before, and felt as though he was about to go crazy. “DIE!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can’t beat you to death so I was planning on not beating you up at
all… but you insist on attacking ME?” Flamewing let out a furious
roar as he charged over.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Space
for ten billion kilometers around them completely collapsed, with the
void itself having been ground up into countless tiny scorching
pieces of space-sand as the titanic Flamewing battled furiously
against that golden figure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was combat on a completely different level, a clash of the titans.
Flamewing had the advantage and was completely dominating the golden
figure, smashing it backwards over and over again! However, Golden
Emperors simply had incredibly durable bodies; not a single scratch
could be seen on Lord Wulf’s golden form, and so Lord Wulf
continued to attack again and again with his indescribably exquisite
Hegemonic saber-arts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
terrifying clashes caused Ning and Azurefiend to both tremble.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
this is what a battle between Otherverse Lords looks like?” Ning
nodded slowly. Flamewing was indeed quite a bit stronger than an
Otherverse Lord, but it was still incapable of actually killing them.
In the end, its insights into the Dao were simply too weak. It
completely relied on its innate gifts to do battle, and thus
Otherverse Lords were able to stay alive in the face of its
onslaught. However, there was no way they could actually overpower
Flamewing in a frontal clash.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Even
someone whose body was as durable as Lord Wulf, a Golden Emperor, was
sent flying backwards with every single clash. However, rage caused
Lord Wulf to continue to press the futile attack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
truly was a scene of apocalyptic might. Even Hegemons would perish
before attacks like these! “And this is just one of the Icepeak
Army’s generals…” Azurefiend let out an amazed sigh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
is a Golden Emperor. Even the Lonely King himself is just a Golden
Emperor,” the nearby Emperor Waveshift said. “The Lonely King’s
advantage lies in his war machines, but those war machines would
barely tickle your Flamewing God; there’s no way they can damage
the Flamewing God’s nigh-indestructible body. Thus, even if the
Lonely King came he would still be dominated and abused by your Chaos
Primordial. This is what makes those creatures so terrifying.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. Suddenly, a spacetime ripple appeared off in the distance,
followed by a white-robed, white-bearded elder with six curved horns
on his head emerging from a spacetime rift. It was Hegemon
Brightshore.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
terrifying shockwaves!” Hegemon Brightshore stared ashen-faced at
the apocalyptic scene before him. This was a level of combat which
was vastly beyond him, and these shockwaves were on a completely
different level as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Such
power! Is this the terrifying force which Realmslord Windgrace spoke
of, the force which is beyond even his ability to control?” Yet
another figure appeared in the distance. It was Hegemon Windrain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
Golden Emperor? One of the legendary Golden Emperors, who are
supposedly on par with Otherverse Lords, is being completely
dominated in battle? Where the hell did this beast come from?!”
Hegemon Netherlily appeared as well. The terrifying shockwaves from
this battle had been sensed by all three of the mighty Hegemons of
the Flamedragon Realmverse, and so they had all hastened over here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">On
one side was Hegemon Thunderstar and his realmship, along with the
four surviving Black Emperors. On the other side was Ning’s party
and the three newly arrived Hegemons. All of them stared, stunned, as
the battle progressed between Flamewing and the crazed Lord Wulf.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn,
damn, DAMN! AAAAAAARGH!” Lord Wulf let out an infuriated bellow
which rang out in every direction, his voice filled with rage,
resentment, and humiliation. He had never been as angry as he was
right now! He had launched countless attacks, but he wouldn’t be
able to continue fighting like this. This was because the energy
stores in his body would begin to be exhausted if he kept this up, at
which point he would be in mortal danger.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth, I won’t forget this. I won’t forget this!” Lord Wulf
turned to glare at the distant white-robed youth, his eyes filled
with terrifying hatred and malice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go!” Lord Wulf immediately began to flee.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_017__Daom"></A>
Chapter 17: Pursuit</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh,
NOW you want to flee?” By now, the Flamewing God had been
thoroughly enraged by Lord Wulf as well. Its wings fluttered, sending
it soaring through the void at terrifying speeds as it instantly
caught up to the fleeing Lord Wulf. Flamewing once more sent its
clawed paws against Lord Wulf: “So you think you can just attack
and run as you please?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
A titanic explosion rang out. Lord Wulf remained undamaged, and the
warblades in his hands seemed to spin like circles of light. He
himself arced outwards, borrowing from the momentum of the shockwave
to continue fleeing. His body was so tough that it was completely
undamaged.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Lord
Wulf continued to flee, while Flamewing pressed the attack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Chase
him down, Flamewing!” Ning ordered mentally.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Leave
it to me. This guy thinks he can just flee whenever he wants? It wont
be that easy!” Flamewing chased furiously, giving vent to his rage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
follow them!” Ning waved his hand, producing his realmship. Ning,
Azurefiend, Emperor Waveshift, and Whitethaw all flew into it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
let us watch as well!” Hegemon Brightshore flew over, followed by
Hegemon Netherlily and Hegemon Windrain. They were extremely
interested in watching a battle between Otherverse Lord-level
combatants, especially since they themselves were in no danger. The
brief part of the battle they had seen earlier had already caused
them to learn a few things. Without question, the mysterious and
terrifying beast which had completely dominated the Golden Emperor
had to be on Ning’s side.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright,
let’s go together.” Ning didn’t refuse them. And so Ning,
Emperor Waveshift, Azurefiend, Brightshore, Windrain, Netherlily, and
Whitethaw all rode the realmship as it chased after the two
combatants. Although in raw speed alone Ning was unable to make the
realmship move as fast as the Flamewing God, Lord Wulf was much much
slower than both of them. As the Flamewing God continued to hunt
after and beat down upon Lord Wulf, Ning and the others were able to
keep up with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Waveshift!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Long
time no see, Waveshift.” Hegemon Brightshore and the other two
Hegemons all greeted Emperor Waveshift. Like them, Emperor Waveshift
was a native of the Flamedragon Realmverse; he had naturally met all
three of them long ago. They chatted amongst themselves as they
watched the distant, high-level battle occurring before them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
is this creature one of those legendary ‘Chaos Primordials’?”
Hegemon Brightshore soon asked the question he wanted to ask the
most. The nearby Hegemon Windrain and Hegemon Netherlily were both
curious as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. “It is indeed a Chaos Primordial. Its name is the
‘Flamewing God’.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
wonder.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
knew it. Only the legendary Chaos Primordials could possibly possess
such a level of power.” Hegemon Brightshore and the others were
enlightened. Although they had their guesses, they had never actually
seen a Chaos Primordial before. Those were legendary creatures which
were never seen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Incredible,
simply incredible! Flamewing God, a Chaos Primordial, is battling
against the Icepeak Army. It must have been tamed, right?” Hegemon
Windrain asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Netherlily turned to look at Emperor Waveshift. A smile on her face,
she said, “Waveshift, did you tame this Chaos Primordial?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
of them felt amazement and awe. The legendary Chaos Primordials were
incredibly rare, and taming one of the creatures was something out of
the myths! Still, for Emperor Waveshift to accomplish this was
shocking but believable to them. Emperor Waveshift was often invited
and feted by the most supreme of major powers, who asked him to
accompany them to some incredibly mysterious places. It was
believable for him to have been lucky enough to tame a Chaos
Primordial on one of those trips.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
don’t have that sort of ability.” Emperor Waveshift shook his
head. “It was Darknorth who tamed it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth?”
Hegemon Brightshore and the others all turned to stare at Ning in
disbelief. For a moment, none of them knew what to say.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Daolord
Darknorth was an absolute monster! They had never heard of such a
terrifying Daolord. It would be understandable if a powerful Emperor
like the Lonely King or Hegemon Windrain had tamed a Chaos
Primordial, but a Daolord?! This was truly miraculous.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nothing
more than lucky.” Ning calmly watched as the battle proceed, his
gaze focused on the enemy realmship that was following from behind
like a streak of lightning. “That realmship really is fast. It
flies far more quickly than even my own realmship. I can sense from
its sudden bursts of speed that its even faster than Flamewing.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hegemon
Thunderstar became a Hegemon via the Dao of Lightning. He’s
extremely skilled in speed, and when he is in command of a realmship
he’s able to more perfectly draw out its full power than many,
allowing it to move much faster,” the nearby Emperor Waveshift
said. “Thus, personal insights truly do matter. Different treasures
in the hands of different major powers will be capable of unleashing
different levels of might.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Hegemon Thunderstar kept his realmship at the margins of the battle,
hiding far away and watching as the Flamewing God continued its
pursuit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thunderstar,
hurry up and go rescue our general!” the other four Black Emperors
urged desperately.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
no way for me to save him.” Hegemon Thunderstar shook his head.
“That Chaos Primordial is too fast. Although I’m skilled in
flying, my speed still isn’t even close to being on par with that
creature’s. Even though I’m in command of a realmship which is
famous for its speed, I’m still just slightly faster than it. The
problem is, your general Lord Wulf is far too slow, even slower than
me flying normally! The Chaos Primordial continues to circle around
him. Once I go nearby, I’ll probably be captured by it as well…
and once it captures us, we’re doomed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ugh.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damn.”
The four Black Emperors were utterly enraged as well. They had
suffered severe mental and physical blows from this, but they knew
just how terrifying the Flamewing God was. It had slain five of their
comrades in the blink of an eye, after all! If they had been just a
heartbeat slower, they would’ve died as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry. I can tell that Lord Wulf is more than capable of keeping
himself alive,” Hegemon Thunderstar said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
the general has stopped launching all those crazy attacks. If all he
needs to do is keep himself alive, he’s able to dramatically lessen
the amount of energy he uses up. He’ll be able to keep fighting for
an extremely long period of time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Although
that Chaos Primordial is very strong, its insights are too weak. Its
attacks are all quite clumsy, making it easy for the general to stay
alive.” All four of the Black Emperors nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
they also knew that Lord Wulf was only able to keep himself safe
thanks to the fact that he had an Otherverse Lord’s combat prowess!
Black Emperors like them? Yes, the Chaos Primordial might have an
extremely low level of insight into the Dao, but it would still crush
them with contemptuous ease. No amount of insights would be enough in
the face of such an overwhelming disparity in power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Lord
Wulf was being battered around like a ball. Each time, he was able to
exquisitely time his defenses to make use of the momentum generated
by the Flamewing God’s attacks to flee, allowing him to use up just
a small amount of his energy even though he was sent flying
repeatedly. Lord Wulf remained quite calm, and he continued to pay
close attention to the realmship following behind them. “Daolord
Darknorth. I won’t forget about this. Just wait and see.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
flowed on, with the pursuit lasting for tens of thousands of years.
Ning continued to pursue the two in his realmship, but the frown on
his face was beginning to deepen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
was continuing the pursuit because he didn’t wish to give up the
chance to kill a Golden Emperor. His Chaos Primordial was born with
tremendous karmic blessings and had a virtually indestructible body
as well as unearthly amounts of strength with it replenished
incredibly fast. This was why the Sithe had chosen to use it as a
power source for the Jadefire Realm! Golden Emperors, however,
replenished their energy stores much more slowly. Ning had been
eagerly awaiting the sight of Lord Wulf exhausting his energy stores,
at which point he would probably perish.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Alas,
his foe was no fool. Lord Wulf had ceased his frenzied attacks and
was instead borrowing from the momentum of Flamewing’s own strikes.
As a result, he was keeping energy expenditures low enough that he
was able to replenish whatever he used up, allowing him to resist for
an extremely long period of time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Its
been tens of thousands of years, but Lord Wulf remains able to defend
with ease.” Ning frowned. “It seems clear that his energy
expenditure rates are below his replenishment rates.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come
back, Flamewing.” Ning finally issued the order.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“GWAR!”
Flamewing let out a final, proud roar within the Great Dark. For it,
pursuing an opponent for tens of thousands of years was nothing. It
could spend an entire chaos cycle just taking a nap!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
fleeing Lord Wulf was briefly startled. Moments later, he realized
that the Flamewing God had finally ceased its pursuit. Only then did
Lord Wulf turn to fly towards Hegemon Thunderstar’s realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh.
He quickly flew into the realmship, which then sped up dramatically
and transformed into a dazzling streak of electric light and
disappeared into the Great Dark.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
quietly stared into the darkness. The nearby Emperor Waveshift said,
“In terms of energy stores, Chaos Primordials vastly outstrip
Otherverse Lords. Alas, its insights into the Dao are too low-level.
It is like a child, capable of just the most basic forms of combat!
Thus, all of its overwhelming power is of no use; it’s only able to
suppress, not kill, Otherverse Lords in combat. The legends say that
there has never been an Otherverse Lord or a Golden Emperor who has
perished to a Chaos Primordial.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. “It does not make efficient use of its power. The Sithe
were able to take all of its terrifying energy to set up the Jadefire
Realm, then transform it into a ‘Decimatus Wave’ which could kill
Otherverse Lords with ease.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
Flamewing had reached Ning’s level of insights into the Dao, it
would be able to kill Golden Emperors with ease. Alas, its insights
into the Dao were negligibly low, and it possessed just the most
basic of animalistic instincts. All it knew was the most basic forms
of attack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
pity that we had to let that Golden Emperor escape,” Azurefiend
mumbled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
can’t chase after it any longer. If we did, then we’d be in
trouble once the Lonely King commanded the rest of the Icepeak Army
to come and reinforce them,” Emperor Waveshift said. “By then,
we’d have no choice but to hide behind the Flamewing God’s
protection.”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_018__Daom"></A>
Chapter 18: Two Competing Sides</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning nodded. The entire Icepeak Army had a total of four Golden
Emperors, with the most powerful being the Lonely King due to his
possession of multiple Sithe war machines. He had destroyed even
otherverses with those machines! The Flamewing God was all by itself,
after all; it would be very hard for it to fight that many people at
once. If it had to protect others as well, the only way for it to do
so would be for them to hide within its estate-world as it fought.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Of
course, Ning could’ve ordered for the Flamewing God to charge
straight into the Lonely King’s base. In other words, if this
battle truly got out of hand it wouldn’t be good for anyone
involved.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Flamewing transformed back into a ruddy-faced fatty and re-entered
the realmship. “That was a good fight! Its been ages since I’ve
had the chance to fight like that. Whew!” Flamewing was quite
delighted with itself. “That Lord Wolf or Wolfe or whatever, he
sure can take a beating! I can’t even count the number of times I
whacked him, but I just couldn’t put him down.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Brightshore, Hegemon Netherlily, Hegemon Windrain, and Azurefiend all
stared at the fatty with a look of some dread. This harmless-looking
man was capable of butchering Hegemons with ease when he fought. Even
Otherverse Lords would be completely dominated, albeit still capable
of staying alive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“And
who are these three?” Flamewing glanced at Hegemon Brightshore and
the other two, then licked its lips. “Master, should I eat them?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t!”
Hegemon Brightshore and the others were badly frightened by that
offhand comment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
are my friends, Flamewing. Stop causing trouble,” Ning immediately
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh.”
Flamewing nodded, then casually slouched over a nearby chair. It then
waved its hand, causing some food to appear which it began to munch
down on.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Chaos
Primordials truly are exceptional!” Hegemon Brightshore let out a
relieved breath. All of them unconsciously moved closer towards Ning,
wanting to keep a safe distance away from the Flamewing God.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
horizons have been expanded after seeing that battle,” Hegemon
Windrain said with a sigh. “I’ve often heard of how terrifying
the battles between Otherverse Lords can be, but I’ve never
witnessed one myself. Experts on that level rarely fight, after all!
This was the very first time, and it truly was an incredible sight.
They really do completely surpass us in power.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. He had also been stunned by this recent fight. The Flamewing
God’s flames alone would’ve been enough to roast him to death,
while the Golden Emperors lived up to their reputation; Flamewing had
unleashed everything it had but remained unable to harm Lord Wulf.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was slowly beginning to understand that Flamewing had slightly more
attack power than Otherverse Lords, but wasn’t capable of actually
killing them! In terms of defensive strength, however, Flamewing was
completely indestructible, and its strength was nearly limitless as
well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Lonely King’s Sithe war machines allowed him to actually slay
Otherverse Lords! And yet, he still wouldn’t be able to harm
Flamewing in the slightest, and his defensive strength was merely on
par with other Golden Emperors. Most importantly of all, he was
unable to fight an extended battle. Much like how Realmslord
Windgrace would expend an enormous amount of energy with each
activation of the Blacksun, the Lonely King’s Sithe war machines
also consumed a terrifying amount of energy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Thus…
even though some major powers clearly had greater attack power than a
Chaos Primordial, they still remained completely unable to harm those
creatures. Flamewing could slaughter all of the Lonely King’s
subordinates with impunity, and the Lonely King would be able to do
nothing but watch.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
battle truly had been quite stunning for everyone involved. Ji Ning,
Azurefiend, Brightshore, Windrain, Netherlily… they were all
Hegemonic figures, and today they realized how terrifying the
higher-level Otherverse Lords were. The others were also envious of
the fact that Ning had actually managed to tame a Chaos Primordial.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Damnit.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Multiple
figures were scattered throughout the realmship. All of them were
silent, and the golden humanoid was the first to speak and disrupt
the deathly silence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Lord
Wulf stood there, his eyes cold and filled with murder. The air
around him seemed to have frozen solid. He had never suffered a
humiliating defeat like today’s.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“General?”
The other four looked at Lord Wulf.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
definitely cannot just let things end here.” Lord Wulf gritted his
teeth. “We have to invite his Majesty to help out.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoooooosh.
An endless aura of cold emanated out to cover the surrounding void.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
giant iceberg was hanging in the middle of the void, and the iceberg
was filled with frozen mountain peaks. A figure was levitating in the
air above the peak of one of those mountains.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
figure was seated on a giant levitating silver throne and dressed in
beautiful silver robes. His hands, his neck, his face, and the other
exposed parts of his body were all golden! The silver-robed golden
humanoid sat there atop his throne, his arms resting against the
throne’s armrest. A blood-red gemstone was affixed to the middle of
his forehead like a third eye, and it brimmed with might.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
man was staring into the distant void silently.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Everyone
in the Icepeak Army knew that the Lonely King would often sit there
by himself and stare off into the void. The Lonely King always had a
cold look on his face, a look that inspired terror in those who saw
him. With but a thought, he could rescind the Golden Emperor and
Black Emperor bodies of his subordinates, then give them over to
others. Thus, all of the soldiers of the Icepeak Army were filled
with dread towards him. They were terrified of incurring his
displeasure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
only time he ever revealed the hint of a smile was when he was
engaged in battle and slaughter.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Majesty.”
A gray-robed figure flew over, then bowed respectfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Lonely King turned his golden gaze across the gray figure. “You are
Lord Wulf’s retainer?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
am,” the gray-robed figure said respectfully. “My true body has
accompanied the general for many years now. Just now, I received
orders from Lord Wulf to report some news of grave import to you,
your Majesty.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Speak,”
the Lonely King commanded calmly, his gaze focused upon the infinite
void once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
matter involves a Daolord known as Darknorth.” The gray-robed
figure began to respectfully narrate the entire affair in detail, not
exaggerating anything at all. He described things exactly as they had
occurred.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Lonely King listened to the entire story without interrupting a
single time. When he heard that Ji Ning had the power of a Hegemon,
his only response was a blink. It wasn’t until he heard the words
‘Chaos Primordial’ that he turned to look at the gray-robed
figure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
Chaos Primordial?” The Lonely King murmured softly, “And who does
it serve? Waveshift?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No.
Lord Wulf said that he saw Daolord Darknorth issue an order to the
Chaos Primordial. He said, ‘Flamewing, kill them all’,” the
gray-robed figure replied. “This Chaos Primordial should therefore
be named ‘Flamewing’, and its master should be Daolord
Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
Chaos Primordial’s master is Daolord Darknorth?” The Lonely
King’s lips curved upwards slightly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
was smiling.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
scene inspired terror in the gray-robed Emperor. Whenever he saw the
Lonely King smile, he felt a sense of terror.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Good.
It is good that he serves a Daolord.” The Lonely King nodded
slowly, seeming to be quite pleased.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Lord
Wulf said that he lost five Black Emperors,” the gray-robed figure
said hurriedly. “What should we do? We’re waiting for your
orders, Majesty.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
bygones be bygones. Let this matter come to an end,” the Lonely
King said calmly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
what of our five slain Black Emperors?” the gray-robed figure
asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
they died, they died.” The Lonely King remained quite calm and
indifferent. “Let this matter come to an end. This ‘Daolord
Darknorth’ deserves his reputation as an unbelievable genius. He
now has a Chaos Primordial at his beck and call… and most Daolords
are madmen! Best not to fight against this Daolord Darknorth. If we
fight against him and he orders his Chaos Primordial to attack our
base, who can withstand it?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
gray-robed figure continued to listen obediently.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Send
my response to Lord Wulf. He and his subordinates are to be stationed
permanently in the Flamedragon Realmverse!” A hint of anticipation
was in the Lonely King’s eyes. “Let him wait and collect every
bit of information he can find about Daolord Darknorth. Once he
receives word that Daolord Darknorth has failed his Daomerge, have
him notify me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood,”
the gray-robed figure said respectfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Remember!
From this day forth, you are not to antagonize Daolord Darknorth. Do
not speak to me of him until he fails his Daomerge,” the Lonely
King commanded. “Now go.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
gray-robed figure bowed respectfully, then immediately departed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Lonely King continued to sit there atop his levitating silver throne,
staring quietly into the void. A hint of anticipation was within his
eyes. “So its master is a Daolord? Daolords have such short lives.
Once the Daolord dies, it’ll be time for the creature to accept a
new master.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Hiddenfiend Realmverse. The Blacksun.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Realmslord
Windgrace had received the reports from Hegemon Brightshore, Hegemon
Windrain, and Hegemon Netherlily.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
Chaos Primordial? And its master is Daolord Darknorth?” The
disheveled-looking old man walked out of his little courtyard, his
eyes brighter than ever.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
one of the legendary Chaos Primordials has appeared.” Realmslord
Windgrace immediately barked, “On my orders, ensure that no news
regarding the Chaos Primordial is divulged to outsiders. All Hegemons
within the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance, as well as the visiting
Hegemons and Emperors, are all under strict orders to not spread this
information to anyone.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
Master,” the two nearby disciples both said respectfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Realmslord
Windgrace mused softly, “Once word spreads, even more of those old
fellows will be drawn over here. Daolords have such short lives. Once
this Daolord dies… if he issued an order for the Chaos Primordial
to follow another, it would quickly come to accept its new master.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
the Lonely King should be aware of this matter as well,” Hegemon
Wuye said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
know the Lonely King. He would never divulge this information to
others.” Realmslord Windgrace shook his head. “As for what
happens when Darknorth fails his Daomerge… if the Lonely King tries
to fight with me over it, he’ll learn that he cannot beat me.
Hmph!”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_019__Daom"></A>
Chapter 19: All Grows Calm Again</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
what should we do next?” Hegemon Wuye said softly. He had once been
one of Realmslord Windgrace’s least remarkable students, but in the
end he had become the most successful. Hegemon Wuye looked rather
foolish, but how could a Hegemon who devoted his life to analyzing
Sithe golems possibly be foolish? At critical times like this, he was
able to maintain a level of incredible calm. Wuye knew that the
question of who the Chaos Primordial belonged to was a question which
would impact his own master’s status.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Unlike
Daolord Darknorth, his master was going to be around for an extremely
long period of time. Daolord Darknorth had a limited lifespan, while
his master had won eternity for himself. If he could also tame a
Chaos Primordial, then his status in the vast Chaosverse would rise
up once more to new heights. The Lonely King would no longer be on
the same level as him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Do
nothing at all.” Realmslord Windgrace shook his head. “There’s
no need for us to try and force things. Daolord Darknorth is an
intelligent man. He has his own plans.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Wuye nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
more you try to force something, the less likely it will work out as
you hoped. The only result would be that Daolord Darknorth might feel
a sense of enmity towards us. The Lonely King’s subordinates have
already caused the seeds of enmity to be sown between him and
Darknorth. Based on my understanding of his personality, he’s
definitely going to try and force things…” Realmslord Windgrace
smiled. “We cannot try to rush this matter. We must be patient.
Daolord Darknorth has to willingly hand over control. Once he fails
his Daomerge, he’s eventually going to have to come to a decision
about what he will do.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
nearby Emperor Skylight asked, “Master, what if Daolord Darknorth
succeeds in his Daomerge?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Succeeds?”
Realmslord Windgrace laughed. “He trains in an Omega Dao. I once
heard from an Autarch that there has never been a Daolord who has
successfully completed the Daomerge for an Omega Dao! If he does
succeed, he’ll reach such a terrifyingly high level of power that
he’ll probably be far stronger than even the Chaos Primordial. By
then, the Chaos Primordial won’t matter; what would matter would be
Darknorth himself.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Wuye and Hegemon Skylight couldn’t help but begin to silently
speculate as to how powerful an Omega Dao Emperor would be!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Stop
thinking about it. The cultivator civilizations of the vast
Chaosverse have given birth to a number of Autarchs, but it has never
given birth to so much as a single Omega Dao Emperor.” Realmslord
Windgrace shook his head. “His chances of success are very, very
low.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Since
Realmslord Windgrace had issued orders, everyone in the Sixteen
Realmverses Alliance immediately moved to obey.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, realmverses were all extremely distant from each other. It was
quite difficult for news to spread across multiple realmverses, and
the only ones within the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance who were
capable of contacting the outside world were the Hegemon-class
Emperors. So long as they kept their mouths shut, there was no way
word would spread.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
as for within the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance? Word had already
spread! Hegemon Brightshore, Hegemon Windrain, and Hegemon Netherlily
had only managed to contact Realmslord Windgrace by going through
several other Hegemons and Emperors! They didn’t have Primaltwins
or avatars in the Blacksun, and so they had to convey their messages
through others, who then conveyed the message to Emperor Skylight to
give to Realmslord Windgrace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Given
how many had been informed, word naturally began to spread within the
Sixteen Realmverses Alliance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
realmship suddenly appeared at the borders between the Flamedragon
Realmverse and the Great Dark. This was the realmship which Hegemon
Thunderstar commanded. Within it were a total of six figures. One was
a golden humanoid, four were onyx humanoids, and the final figure was
a violet-robed, violet-haired man.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
were Lord Wulf of the Icepeak Army, four Black Emperors, and Hegemon
Thunderstar, respectively.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Swear
the oath right away.” Lord Wulf cast the violet-robed,
violet-haired man a cold look.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Sure,
sure.” Hegemon Thunderstar immediately smiled. “I would never
dare to go against the Lonely King’s orders. I, Thunderstar, swear
on my very life itself…” Hegemon Thunderstar had been forced to
swear an oath not to divulge any information regarding the Chaos
Primordial known as the Flamewing God.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
can leave now.” Lord Wulf tossed out a storage-type magic treasure,
then left alongside his four Black Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The realmship quickly departed, leaving Lord Wulf and his four Black
Emperors at the borders of the Great Dark.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“General?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Are
we really supposed to just swallow this crap?” The four Black
Emperors remained unwilling to accept this. They had just suffered a
huge loss; were they to take this lying down? The Icepeak Army would
generally launch frenzied reprisals against any who dared to
challenge them! This was why the Lonely King had gone so far as to
kill three Otherverse Lords.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
already know what his Majesty has commanded,” Lord Wulf said
coldly. “What his Majesty commands, we shall carry out! Right now,
his Majesty doesn’t care about this ‘Daolord Darknorth’; the
only thing he cares about is that Chaos Primordial. If he can take
control of it in the future, then our Icepeak Army shall become far
more powerful than it is right now.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
the four Black Emperors thought back to how terrifying the Flamewing
God had been, they couldn’t help but shudder.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
the coming days, we shall remain hidden within the Flamedragon
Realmverse and keep a close watch on Daolord Darknorth. We shall wait
for him to fail his Daomerge.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
news that a Chaos Primordial had appeared was like a bomb exploding
within the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance! It shocked all of the
Hegemons and Emperors. As for the Lonely King and Realmslord
Windgrace, they just waited quietly. Both of them were waiting for
Ning to fail his Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go.” A vile, blood-robed elder who radiated a reeking aura of blood
stood there in the air. He let out a sigh. Behind him was an entire
host of evil Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Are
we… are we really going to just leave like this?” The Emperors
were rather unwilling to go.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
lost.” The blood-robed Emperor shook his head. “Daolord Darknorth
has survived many attempts against his life, and he now has both a
Hegemon retainer and a Chaos Primordial. There’s no way we can
possibly be a match for him. If we stay in the Flamedragon
Realmverse… given his influence and power, we’ll probably be
wiped out soon.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now…
our only chance for survival lies in departing from the Flamedragon
Realmverse,” the blood-robed elder said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
us go our separate ways and begin to wander through the Great Dark.
Only by leaving can we survive.” The blood-robed elder let out a
sigh. “I, Bloodcloud, simply am not strong enough. I feel ashamed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The legendary Emperor Bloodcloud, a man who had reached the Archon
level of power, tore through spacetime and departed on his own.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
other Emperors traded glances with each other. All of them were truly
unwilling to accept this. It would take them at least a million chaos
cycles to travel another realmverse, after all. This would take an
incredibly long period of time!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
the end, there shall be other places in the chaosverse where we can
live and thrive. Let us go.” The Emperors quickly came to the
decision to depart. Singly and in small groups, they began to depart
from the Flamedragon Realmverse and begin to wander through the Great
Dark. Ji Ning had once sworn to slay every single one of the demons
of Silksnow Palace. How could they possibly dare to remain here any
longer?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Vastheaven
Palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">By
now, Hegemon Brightshore and the others had departed. Now, Emperor
Waveshift had come to bid Ning farewell as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Big
brother Waveshift, you are leaving as well?” Ning was rather
surprised and unwilling to part from him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
main reason I came back was to see just what new power has arisen
within my homeland. Now that I know it is the Flamewing God and have
met with you, Darknorth, I’m satisfied.” Emperor Waveshift
smiled. “I have other business to attend to in the outside world.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
that you have Flamewing under your control, the only ones you need to
keep an eye out for are two people. One is the Lonely King of the
Icepeak Army, and the other is Realmslord Windgrace.” Emperor
Waveshift smiled. “The Lonely King’s temperament is a bit too
bloodthirsty, and in comparison he isn’t quite as experienced as
the Realmslord. He was simply someone who was lucky enough to find a
Sithe armory and thus rose to power! Realmslord Windgrace is
different. He rendered great merits during the Dawn War and has been
guided by multiple Autarchs. He has seen far more things, and as a
result he has chosen to be low-key.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
hard to predict what Realmslord Windgrace will do. If you do fail the
Daomerge, you can entrust your final wishes to Realmslord Windgrace.
That old man is quite trustworthy,” Emperor Waveshift said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was slightly startled by this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Of
course, I hope you succeed in the Daomerge.” Emperor Waveshift let
out a long sigh. “You’ve only seen a tiny fraction of what the
Chaosverse holds; you haven’t even left the Flamedragon Realmverse!
Countless marvels are waiting for you, and there are countless
secrets waiting for you to uncover them. Darknorth, I truly do hope
that you succeed in the Daomerge. When you do, I’ll ride your
coat-tails and have you take me to some places I would never dare to
visit on my own.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
said with some surprise, “Countless marvels are awaiting me?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You’ve
barely visited any places.” Emperor Waveshift shook his head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
visited an alternate universe before!” Ning said. “And also many
places here in the Flamedragon Realmverse.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“As
I said, you’ve barely visited any places. Otherverses are created
by Autarchs for amusement, and they hold nothing special within
them,” Emperor Waveshift said. “The Chaosverse… now THAT is
truly something. Even the Sithe were nothing more than part of the
Chaosverse. Only those who truly understand how marvelous the
Chaosverse is will know how tiny they themselves are!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is why Realmslord Windgrace, who has served and followed Autarchs in
the past, is such a low-key figure, while the short-sighted and
ignorant Lonely King is so arrogant and brash. His only claim to fame
stems from those Sithe war machines. In terms of real power, those
Otherverse Lords who managed to merge their heartforce, divine power,
and Immortal energy together are the truly terrifying figures of the
Chaosverse. They truly do stand at the very peak of power, save for
the Autarchs.”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_020__Daom"></A>
Chapter 20: Regret</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning nodded as well. If an Otherverse Lord managed to merge all of
his types of energy together, he would truly become a force to
reckoned with.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had received legacies from over three hundred Hegemons, with God
Emperor Helong being one of them. God Emperor Helong had been an
Otherverse Lord who had created the [God Emperor’s Apocalypse]
technique, a technique akin to the [Heartsword] art. As a result, he
had been far more powerful than most Otherverse Lords, and was strong
enough to fight Chaos Primordials head-on with his own power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“However…
on the other hand, Sithe war machines come in varying levels of power
as well. The Lonely King has multiple war machines and is capable of
slaying ordinary Otherverse Lords and destroy entire otherverses.”
Emperor Waveshift nodded. “Although he is rather short-sighted,
he’s still not someone to trifle with. Sithe war machines are
simply terrifying to behold. You need to be wary of him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
understand.” Ning nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Train
hard and succeed in the Daomerge.” Emperor Waveshift looked at
Ning. “The Chaosverse holds far too many marvels which you have yet
to see. For example, the most stunning sight I’ve ever seen is a
Sithe Exalt who is kept in perpetual imprisonment. That terrifying
presence he had… even though I only saw his blurred outlines from
afar, I still felt completely shaken. Well, that’s enough of that.
Here’s a treasure for you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Waveshift suddenly waved his hand, causing a cube-shaped treasure to
appear within it. He gently flicked this crystalline cube over
towards Ning. “All you have to do is shatter it, and I’ll be able
to sense it.” Emperor Waveshift looked at Ning. “I’ll then head
back to the Flamedragon Realmverse at top speed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you.” Ning felt rather moved.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
feel like we are old friends, even though we have just met.”
Emperor Waveshift let out a sigh. He scanned the area with his gaze,
then used his Immortal energy to block the sound of their voices from
the outside world. “Before I leave, there’s one more thing I need
to tell you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
Ning saw how cautious Emperor Waveshift was, to the point of not even
wanting Flamewing or Azurefiend to overheard the conversation, Ning
couldn’t help but feel rather surprised.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
recent days, I secretly used all the power and skill I had to engage
in Numerancy divination on your behalf,” Emperor Waveshift said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
heart lurched.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Your
Daomerge… it will have a tremendous impact on the world. Even
though I did everything I could, I was still only able to see a tiny
amount.” Emperor Waveshift looked at Ning. He elected not to
mention the fact that he had used up an incredibly important treasure
to carry out this divination; otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able
to see anything at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
saw a tiny amount?” Ning listened carefully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
tiny, blurry amount.” Emperor Waveshift nodded. “All I can say
is… I saw nothing but darkness!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
do you mean?” Ning’s face paled slightly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
means that there was no life at all!” Emperor Waveshift shook his
head. “Based on what I saw just now… you will definitely fail
your Daomerge!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Are
you absolutely certain?” Ning found it hard to accept this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
be hasty or disheartened. Remember… the Dao of Numerancy involves
divination and probability, not ironclad prophecy; nothing is fixed!
The future is always filled with infinite possibilities,” Emperor
Waveshift said. “Thus… you need to seize every single
possibility, every single bit of karmic luck. You have to fight for
every scrap of every chance, for every treasure and every legacy you
can find. Do everything you can to improve your chances… because if
you do not, you will fail.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
you do your utmost, perhaps you may stand a chance.” Emperor
Waveshift looked at Ning. “That’s all I have to say. I’m going
to leave now.” After speaking, Emperor Waveshift turned and
departed into the skies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Waves
of emotion were rocking through Ning’s heart. He had felt certain
that he had reached a sufficiently high level of insight into the
Dao. He never would’ve imagined that Emperor Waveshift’s
divinations would suggest that he had no chance whatsoever at
succeeding.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
right. If I want to succeed in the Daomerge for an Omega Dao, I truly
do have to do everything I can. I can’t let myself relax in the
slightest.” Ning nodded slowly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
has Waveshift departed?” Flamewing sauntered over lazily.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
left.” Ning nodded. “Life shall become rather peaceful and
uneventful for a time. No one will come to disturb us.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was planning to continue his training. He had multiple other Daos he
needed to train to the Archon level, so as to fulfill the
requirements Autarch Awakener had laid down. That would allow him to
gain a treasure which the Autarch had left behind, a treasure which
the Autarch had believed to be supremely useful for the Daomerge. He
absolutely had to acquire that treasure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
there’s nothing else to do for now?” Azurefiend asked.
“Darknorth, are you planning to remain in secluded meditation here
at Vastheaven Palace?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.”
Ning nodded. “However, before I go into secluded meditation, I’m
planning to pay a visit to the Jadefire Realm. There’s still a
Hegemon imprisoned there.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Winterflame!”
Azurefiend’s eyes lit up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">By
now, the only person remaining in the flaming passageways of the
Jadefire Realm was Hegemon Winterflame.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
silver-robed and devilishly handsome Hegemon Winterflame was seated
in the lotus position within a flaming passageway. He was quite
patient, and ever since he had ended negotiations with Daolord
Darknorth he had begun to wait. He was waiting for Daolord Darknorth
to fail his Daomerge, at which time he would stand a chance at
surviving and escaping.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!
A Chaos Primordial?!” Hegemon Winterflame’s face turned
completely pale. “Impossible! That’s absolutely impossible.” A
look of terror was in his eyes. He finally began to panic, and it was
impossible for him to remain calm any further.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">By
now, the entire Sixteen Realmverses Alliance was frothing after
receive word that Daolord Darknorth had tamed a Chaos Primordial.
Hegemon Winterflame’s avatar was in the outside world and he thus
received word of it as well. To the other Hegemons and Daolords, this
was nothing more than a bit of entertaining news… but to Hegemon
Winterflame, it was a sudden pronouncement of doom!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had always been a vicious and unscrupulous man, which was why he had
planned on kidnapping everyone in Vastheaven Palace to threaten Ning.
He had even battled against Ning’s avatar, and Hegemon Brightshore
had to intervene to stop him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the end, he had been unwilling to completely accede to Ning’s
demands within the flaming passageway. He wanted to await for the day
that Daolord Darknorth failed his Daomerge and perished, and so he
had been waiting… but who would’ve imagined that this terrifying
news of a Chaos Primordial would suddenly descend upon him?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Is
this real? The Chaos Primordial is named the ‘Flamewing God’, and
he easily butchered five Black Emperors of the Icepeak Army? Lord
Wulf of the Icepeak Army was beaten so badly he had to flee in
terror?” The more Hegemon Winterflame heard, the more terrified he
became. If even Black Emperors had been slain, how could he,
Winterflame, pose any threat to the creature at all?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
could this have happened? He’s just a Daolord! H-how is this
possible? I-I… I’ve always been so careful.” Hegemon
Winterflame was rather dazed. He had never been so foolish as to make
an enemy out of any truly formidable figures. Although he was
unscrupulous and capable of anything, causing many to hate him, he
had still been able to remain alive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Alas…
if one always walks by the riverside, sooner or later one’s shoes
would get wet! Daolords were usually nothing more than bugs to be
crushed… but this time, one of them had just given him a huge
‘surprise’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“N-no…
I can’t accept this…” Hegemon Winterflame’s face turned
completely red as countless thoughts flitted through his mind. He
asked for more and more information from those in the outside world
before, finally, he gave up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flee!”
Hegemon Winterflame’s eyes were bloodshot. “I have to flee! Since
Daolord Darknorth is now fighting against the Icepeak Army, his true
body isn’t present. Perhaps the Jadefire Realm is unguarded for
now.” Hegemon Winterflame felt a thin tendril of hope.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
He immediately transformed into a streak of white fire and began to
flee.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
really is safe now.” Hegemon Winterflame flew for several seconds
without activating any traps. He immediately felt a sense of delight.
“Daolord Darknorth must have left. There’s no one in control of
the Jadefire Realm.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
Right at this moment, a wave of terrifying power swept towards him
with terrifying destructive power. Hegemon Winterflame immediately
retreated in a blind panic, but the flame still split his body in
half.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash!
After putting up a struggle, half of his flaming body was completely
destroyed by that wave of power. The other half quickly reformed into
Hegemon Winterflame’s appearance. His face was ashen, and a look of
horror was in his eyes. He had very nearly died just now.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hegemon
Winterflame. On Master’s commands, I’ve been watching over you.”
A voice boomed out, echoing within every part of the surrounding
area.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Winterflame lifted up his head to scan the surrounding area, a
feeling of dread in his heart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
were pretty lucky this time, but next time you are dead meat. The
flaming passageways are quite long. You’ll have to fly for very,
very long before you can escape them. You survived the first time,
but I refuse to believe you’ll survive a second and third time,”
the cold voice said. This was the Emperor-class golem which Ning had
ordered to remain here and watch over this place.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Y-you…”
Hegemon Winterflame was panicking. He called out loudly, “Is your
master Daolord Darknorth? Hurry up and help me send word to him. Let
him know that I’ll accept his terms. I’ll give him all of my
treasures, including my armor and my Universe weapon. I’m willing
to offer all of them to Daolord Darknorth, so long as he is willing
to let me go and spare my life.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hmph.
So NOW you choose to beg for your life?” the cold voice boomed out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Just
hurry up and tell your master!” Hegemon Winterflame said
frantically. “I don’t want to be enemies with him!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Just
wait. He will be arriving soon,” the cold voice replied.</P>

Chapter 21: Of Little Use</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
realmship appeared within a spatial tear outside the Jadefire Realm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“And
here we are.” Ji Ning stared at the vast blazing whirlpool of
blazing flames and smiled: “Hegemon Winterflame has probably heard
the news by now.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
definitely has.” A look of excitement was on Azurefiend’s old
face, and his eyes were gleaming. “Based on my understanding of
him… he’s probably scared out of his mind. He might immediately
beg for mercy once you arrive, Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go and take a look.” Ning was looking forward to seeing that
panicked look on Hegemon Winterflame’s face. In the past,
Winterflame had always behaved in an arrogant and domineering manner.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The realmship flew into the Jadefire Realm at high speeds, descending
into the flaming passageways.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.”
A voice rang out from the surrounding area. This was the voice of the
Emperor-class golem in control of the flaming passageways.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Is
Winterflame still in the same old position?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,”
the voice rang out, “Hegemon Winterflame attempted to flee, but I
took control over the mechanisms in accordance with your orders and
nearly killed him. This frightened Hegemon Winterflame so badly that
he no longer dared to flee again, and he’s very close to where he
originally started.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
actually tried to flee?” Azurefiend grinned and said, “He finally
knows the meaning of fear. He has an invulnerable form, which means
that even though I am a bit stronger than him I cannot kill him…
but now that we have Flamewing, killing him will be simplicity
itself. If he tries to run, the mechanisms in the flaming passageways
are also capable of claiming his life! Both fleeing and not-fleeing
will both spell doom. Haha, I’m looking forward to seeing that look
on his stupid face!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
laughed as well. He also felt delighted! After they flew for a period
of time, they finally saw Hegemon Winterflame. Hegemon Winterflame
was seated in the lotus position in the void. He still looked as
devilishly handsome as ever, but his aura was rather chaotic.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Hegemon Winterflame turned his head as the distant realmship
approached him. He hurriedly rose to his feet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Four
figures flew out of the realmship, with the leader being the
white-robed youth with a black sheath on his back. Next to him was
the chubby Flamewing and Hegemon Azurefiend, with Protector Whitethaw
standing behind them all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
greet you, Daolord Darknorth,” Hegemon Winterflame said. His
attitude was very humble, and he cast Flamewing a glance as he spoke.
Flamewing was chomping through some food he was holding as he glanced
sideways at Winterflame as well. Winterflame couldn’t help but feel
as though he himself was being devoured bit-by-bit, and his mental
state grew even more chaotic.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hah!
Look at how respectful our dear Hegemon Winterflame is being.”
Azurefiend roared with laughter as he clutched his sides: “He’s
being as humble as a servant! Last time we saw him, he was quite
arrogant and proud, no? Winterflame, do you remember the final words
you said to us when we last met?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Winterflame’s face was ashen as Azurefiend continued to speak: “I
think you’ve forgotten, but I haven’t. I recall it all quite
clearly. Watch, Winterflame!” Azurefiend waved his hand, causing an
illusory image to appear next to them. This was the scene of their
previous meeting, and in the illusory images Winterflame was snarling
with hatred as he roared, “Let’s see if you die first or if I die
first!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Winterflame
gritted his teeth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Enough,
Azurefiend,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fine.”
Azurefiend fell silent as instructed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Winterflame
relaxed slightly. Although he was completely unscrupulous, as a
Hegemon he still cared about face. He felt miserable suffering such
mockery from Azurefiend. Upon hearing Ning order Azurefiend to halt,
he was suddenly filled with hope. Perhaps Daolord Darknorth wasn’t
going to hold a grudge and would release him?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He’s
about to die soon. There’s no need to go too far.” Ning’s voice
rang out once more, and Winterflame’s face instantly turned
bone-white.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“DAOLORD
DARKNORTH!!!” Hegemon Winterflame let out a throat-rending howl.
Even Ning was badly startled by the grief and rage in Hegemon
Winterflame’s voice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth, I was wrong! It was all my fault! I was being too arrogant
and ruthless.” Hegemon Winterflame stared at Ning, then said in a
begging manner, “I know I made a huge mistake. I beg you to give me
a chance, Daolord Darknorth. Everyone should be given a chance. Give
me one!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
your dreams,” Azurefiend muttered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Winterflame gritted his teeth. “I’m willing to be your retainer.
So long as you spare my life, I’ll serve you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
just watched quietly, while Azurefiend chuckled: “Didn’t you look
down at me for becoming his retainer?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’d
be honored to be given the chance to serve Daolord Darknorth as his
retainer,” Hegemon Winterflame said hurriedly. Upon seeing that
Ning appeared completely unmoved, he began to panic even further.
“I’m willing to be an eternal retainer. Even if you fail your
Daomerge and die, Daolord Darknorth, I’d be willing to swear an
oath to follow your orders to the end of my days. Uh, I don’t mean
to suggest that I hope you will fail the Daomerge, Daolord Darknorth.
I obviously hope that you will succ-”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Halfway
through his babbling, Ning suddenly shook his head. “Flamewing, get
rid of him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
I was waiting for you to say that!” Flamewing let out a strange
howl, transforming into his normal form of a giant blazing winged
bear as he charged straight towards Hegemon Winterflame.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Winterflame had a terrified look on his face, but moments later it
was replaced by a look of savagery. He glared at the distant Ning
with a hate-filled look in his eyes, then howled, “Daolord
Darknorth, you’ll die too! You’ll die too!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiiiip.
Flamewing destroyed everything in its path with its overwhelming
power. Even though Hegemon Winterflame was able to transform into a
sea of fire, he was still extinguished by the Chaos Primordial’s
might. Nothing was left save a few scattered treasures.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Azurefiend
shook his head when he saw this. “Darknorth, Winterflame was still
a Hegemon. Taking him on as a retainer wasn’t a bad idea. I thought
you’d choose to accept him in the end.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
stared at the scattered treasures floating in the air. “I did
briefly consider taking him on as a retainer, but… for some reason,
he just disgusted me far too much. I already have the three of you;
an extra Hegemon retainer really wouldn’t make much of a
difference. Better to keep my surroundings clear of such filth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Azurefiend
was speechless. He never would’ve imagined that Ning would have
declined a Hegemonic retainer for a reason like this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go.” Ning had already made certain plans for the Three Realms. By
now, Hegemon Winterflame truly was of little use to him, as Ning
simply wouldn’t trust a Hegemon like Winterflame to watch over the
Three Realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Winterflame died, and his avatar perished alongside him. This news
quickly spread throughout the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Hegemons and Emperors of the alliance all knew long ago that Hegemon
Winterflame had been trapped within the flaming passageways. They all
suspected that the killer was Daolord Darknorth, the controller of
the Jadefire Realm! All of them couldn’t help but feel a lingering
sense of dread towards him. They knew that Daolord Darknorth was not
the benevolent, merciful type… and they secretly celebrated the
fact that they handed over their treasures and had been able to leave
the Jadefire Realm safely.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">And
so, the Hegemons and Emperors of the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance now
feared a total of two people. The first was Realmslord Windgrace,
while the second was the monstrously talented Daolord who had tamed
the Flamewing God – Daolord Darknorth. These two people were mighty
enough to cause even Hegemons to fear the approach of death.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
didn’t really care about what was happening in the outside world.
His focus was on cultivation. He had to come up with those ten
Archon-class techniques as soon as possible, so that he could earn
the precious reward which Autarch Awakener had left behind. Even the
Autarch viewed that treasure as valuable and not to be casually
handed over to others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">According
to the estate-spirit, this treasure was the number one most helpful
cultivation treasure in all the Chaosverse, and it was number one in
assisting during Daomerges as well!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
absolutely had to acquire such a supreme treasure. The Daomerge for
the Omega Dao would be incredibly difficult; even Emperor Waveshift
said that he saw no hope at all for Ning in attempting it. In
addition, the path of the Omega Dao was the only path available for
Ning if he wished to revive Yu Wei. Only through this path would he
have a chance to surpass the Autarchs and take back Yu Wei’s
truesoul fragments from the prime essences of the Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Of
course, it was highly likely that he would fail and perish… but he
still had to do his absolute utmost!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
flowed on.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Vastheaven
Palace. Within Darknorth’s estate. Ning was seated by himself in
quiet meditation atop a mountain. Next to him was a hot stove that
had a flagon of wine atop it, while there was some snow on the
boulder nearby.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
Primaltwin remained in secluded meditation atop the Autarch’s stone
dais, while Ning’s true body lived a fairly relaxed life. This
dichotomy of harsh training and relaxedness actually caused many
insights to flicker through Ning’s mind. He broke through a number
of bottlenecks in this way.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
finally reached the Archon level in the final Dao, the Dao of Earth.”
The white-robed Ning’s eyebrows were covered in snow. He suddenly
opened his eyes to stare at the nearby flagon of wine. This wine had
been kept warm for an extremely long period of time, because Ning
only permitted himself a single drink of wine when he finished
completing a Dao. Thus, it had been countless years since he had last
drank from the wine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now,
all ten techniques have been developed.” An eager look was in
Ning’s eyes. “I wonder what sort of precious treasure Autarch
Awakener has left behind for me?”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_022__Daom"></A>
Chapter 22: Stonefire Pearl</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the Azureflower Estate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
black-robed Ji Ning was seated in the lotus position atop the stone
dais. He had already been in this position for more than ten chaos
cycles without moving at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Success.”
The black-robed Ning suddenly opened his eyes and smiled. He waved
his hand, causing a series of jade slips to appear next to him. Ning
had filled every sigle one of the jade slips with all sorts of
techniques which he had devised over the course of many years.
Although only ten chaos cycles had gone past in the real world, he
had spent that entire period of time under 100x temporal
acceleration. In other words, for him over a thousand chaos cycles
had already gone by.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had come up with a total of ten Archon-class techniques. These
techniques were based on his Omega Sword Dao, his heartforce
illusions, the Dao of Fire, the Dao of Water, the Dao of Lightning,
the Dao of Space, the Dao of Formations, the Dao of Metal, the Dao of
Wood, and the Dao of Earth. There were ten Daos in total.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
slaughtering Hegemon Winterflame, Ning had chosen to work in simpler
Daos such as that of Metal, Wood, and Earth, so that he would more
quickly acquire the treasure reward. He personally wanted to study
the Dao of Time, but judging from how he had spent more than two
hundred chaos cycles working on the Dao of Space, he felt likely that
he would need to spend even more time on Time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the end, he was a sword cultivator. As a result, he was quite quick
with the Dao of Metal, making his breakthrough in just twenty or so
chaos cycles. He wasn’t very talented in the Dao of Wood, and so he
spent more than fifty chaos cycles on it. As for the final member of
the Five Elements, ‘Earth’? Thanks to the fact that he had
already mastered the first four, he had actually managed to complete
his mastery of it in just ten or so chaos cycles.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
just ninety ‘real’ chaos cycles (9000 chaos cycles for him), he
had actually managed to create three Archon-class techniques.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Senior,”
the black-robed Ning called out. The distant white-haired elder, also
seated in the lotus position, slowly opened his eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Senior,
you already know about my Omega Sword Dao and my illusions. Here are
the other eight techniques.” Ning pointed at the eight slips
levitating in the air behind him. “Please take a look at them.”
The eight jade slips all floated over to the white-haired man.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
fast?” The white-haired old man’s eyes lit up as he immediately
stared at the eight slips. After analyzing them, he nodded: “Not
bad. You’ve mastered all five of the Five Elements, and you
actually made tremendous progress in even the Dao of Formations. You
truly do have an incredibly high level of comprehension of the Dao.
In truth, just judging from how quickly you were able to create your
Omega Sword Dao and then reach the Fourth Step as a Daolord, I felt
certain that your comprehension skills were exceptional. However, I
still had to obey my master’s orders.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Of
course.” Ning nodded. In truth, one’s comprehension skills could
change. For example, even the most ‘talented’ of newborns
wouldn’t be able to comprehend much. The many experiences you went
through in life would mold you like metal in a forge, either breaking
you or making you stronger, harder, and more dazzling. Ning’s heart
had been completely focused on the Dao of the Sword, and he had
experienced many exceptional things before reaching his current
heights. Now that he had reached the fourteenth stance of the
[Heartsword], his heart and his will were both incredibly pure,
allowing him to train even more quickly than before.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You’ve
created ten techniques, which means I can give that treasure which
Master left behind.” The white-haired old man waved his hand.
Whoosh. The hall suddenly seemed to ripple as rays of light appeared,
causing a tiny fist-sized space to appear at the very center of the
room. After this tiny space appeared, one could vaguely make out two
objects levitating within it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
first object was a completely round and slick pearl. It looked to be
roughly the size of an egg, and it emanated incorporeal ripples that
could be seen with the naked eye. Ning could sense the waves of power
sweeping across him, causing him to feel more relaxed and comfortable
than he ever had before. He felt almost like a child in his mother’s
embrace; that was how incredibly warm and soothing this felt.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
second object was also round, but it was covered with countless lines
and runes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come
here.” The white-haired man waved his hand, causing both objects to
float over towards him. “Darknorth.” The white-haired elder
looked at Ning. “This first treasure was named by my master and the
Autarchs as the ‘Stonefire Pearl’. All of them concur that it had
to be a naturally-occuring treasure manifested by the Chaosverse, and
that it is the number one most helpful cultivation treasure. Master
focused all of his efforts on completing the Nine Chaos Seals, and so
he found these types of treasures to be invaluable. As a result, he
paid a fairly significant price to convince the other Autarchs to let
him have it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was shocked. So Autarch Awakener had personally used this treasure in
the past?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
me tell you about its history.” The white-haired elder laughed.
“Our story begins when the Sithe were at the prime of their power.
They had yet to launch the great war against the cultivator
civilizations, but my master and the others were already secretly on
guard against them, keeping a vigilant eye on them at all times. One
time, Master and the others suddenly sensed a hint of danger appear
and so they hurriedly joined forces to go to that location. They
discovered that the Sithe had captured and were escorting a strange
stone lifeform who was completely covered in flames. My Master and
the others did not hesitate at all; they immediately attacked! The
Sithe either fled or died. As for the ‘stonefire’ lifeform? It
was actually on par with my Master and the other Autarchs in might!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“On
par with Autarchs?!” Ning was amazed. “The Sithe are actually in
control of creatures with such power?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
creature probably wasn’t a Sithe. None of us know where the Sithe
found the thing and how they took control over it,” the
white-haired elder said. “Master and his peers spent tens of
thousands of years battling it before it finally ran out of energy
and died. As soon as the strange stonefire creature died, its body
crumbled apart and revealed this pearl within it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
pearl has marvelous properties and is of tremendous use to
cultivators when training,” the white-haired elder said. “We
found a total of just two creatures which had reached this level of
power. One was this stonefire creature, the other was an iceberg
creature that was also controlled by the Sithe and fought for them
during the Dawn War. The Autarchs killed both of these creatures. I
imagine they should know more about where these creatures came from,
but they’ve never discussed it with me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
sighed in amazement. Living creatures who were on par with Autarchs
in power? “Can the Sithe have created them?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Impossible.
They were actual living beings,” the white-haired elder.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch
Awakener didn’t provide any additional information about them?”
Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No.
He did once say that with the Sithe having been annihilated, these
creatures will no longer be seen ever again,” the white-haired
elder said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded, but he was still completely puzzled. Why was it that these
terrifying creatures would no longer appear now that the Sithe were
gone? Ning couldn’t help but sigh to himself. In the end, he simply
hadn’t visited enough places. He hadn’t even seen a fraction of
what Emperor Waveshift had seen, to say nothing of the Autarchs. He
knew far too little about the vast Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
Stonefire Pearl is now yours.” The white-haired elder handed it
over to Ning while saying, “But of course, you are not allowed to
give it to others. If you die in the future, it’ll fly back to the
estate and await its next destined owner.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fly
back?” After accepting the pearl, Ning at first felt as though it
was rather cool. Soon, however, the warmth of his hand began to heat
it up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
sent his divine power into the pearl to investigate it. “Eh, it’s
not a magic treasure?” Ning was surprised. This was just an
ordinary item, not a magic treasure; how was he supposed to bind and
use it?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is a natural treasure. All you need to do is to send a strand of your
godsense into it and you’ll be able to activate it,” the
white-haired elder said. “This estate also holds the stonefire
creature’s corpse within it. If no one is in control of the pearl,
it’ll pass through spacetime and then come back.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
incredible.” Ning was shocked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Autarchs destroyed the stonefire creature and shattered its bodies
into tiny bits, but the Stonefire Pearl would fly back towards the
shattered bits of its body and quickly bring it back to life.” The
white-haired elder laughed. “In the end, Master and the others had
to destroy its soul and truesoul before it stopped trying to revive
itself. By now, the corpse has been ensorcered by Master and remains
suppressed in here, and so once you die, Darknorth, the Stonefire
Pearl will come back to this place.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. As soon as he had sent a strand of his godsense into the
pearl, he was able to sense that it seemed to have become part of
himself and had become completely one with him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come
in.” Ning willed the Stonefire Pearl to enter his body. A faint
warmth spread throughout every part of him, and his soul and truesoul
both felt incredibly at ease. When Ning attempted to meditate on the
Dao of Time in this state, he immediately felt as though a wellspring
of insights began to flow through his mind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is incredibly useful for cultivation.” The white-haired elder
smiled. “It is the number one cultivation treasure, which means it
is naturally also the number one Daomerge treasure.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
felt a sense of excitement in his heart. Hegemon Brightshore and the
others had actively contested over Crimsonwave Temple’s fruits.
Why? Because those fruits could be used to forge spirit-pills which
when eaten would be of tremendous use for cultivation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Stonefire Pearl was the supreme cultivation treasure which had been
used by Autarch Awakener himself, and the same was true for the stone
dais. Now… both had been inherited by Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
sure you know what Master was hoping for when he left these things to
you.” The white-haired elder looked at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
understand. Autarch Awakener’s greatest wish was for the Nine Chaos
Seals to be perfected,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.
This was his greatest regret in life.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-haired elder nodded, then gently waved a finger and caused the
second floating sphere to fly over towards Ning as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
saw that this sphere was covered with countless runes and patterned
lines which flowed across its surface. He immediately had the feeling
that it was connected to the Nine Chaos Seals somehow. The
white-haired elder explained, “This is the Heart of Eternity. It is
covered with layers of runes, all of which must be deciphered and
resolved. Darknorth, you should continuously work at solving these
layers of runes. Once you’ve completely mastered all ninety-nine
layers of runes which cover the Heart of Eternity, you will have
reached Master’s level of insight into the Nine Chaos Seals.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
solving and comprehending the Heart of Eternity merely means you have
reached his level in just a single aspect!” The white-haired elder
looked at Ning. “My master’s hope is that someone can improve
this technique to the Eternal Emperor level, which was why he named
this sphere the Heart of Eternity. Learning to solve it will be of
some assistance to you in the Daomerge. Although the assistance will
be fairly minimal, Master left behind a final treasure within the
core of the Heart of Eternity. If you can fully solve it then the
treasure inside it will be yours, and I can promise you that it is
just as valuable as the Stonefire Pearl.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
felt both joy and sorrow. Autarch Awakener truly had spared no
expense in trying to ensure that his ‘heirs’ would complete the
Nine Chaos Seals. He had even gone so far as to seal away a treasure
inside the Heart of Eternity! If someone wanted to acquire it, they
would have to first completely deconstruct the Heart of Eternity and
reach Autarch Awakener’s level of insight in the Nine Chaos Seals.
This would truly require an enormous amount of effort.</P>

Chapter 23: Difference</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Senior,”
Ji Ning asked, “Might I ask what other external treasures exist in
the Chaosverse which are of major benefit to someone attempting the
Daomerge?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Success
in the Daomerge was a combination of two factors; internal and
external. Internal referred to one’s self and one’s insights!
Only if one reached a sufficiently high level of comprehension would
one’s chances increase.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">External
factors referred to special treasures which would improve one’s
chances, such as the Autarch’s stone dais or the Stonefire Pearl.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">What
Ning was attempting was something which had never been successfully
carried out… a Daomerge in an Omega Dao! No one in the history of
the entire Chaosverse had ever successfully done such a thing, and so
he naturally had to both perfect himself as well as acquire all
external sources of help he could find. That way, his chances at the
Daomerge would improve slightly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“External
treasures?” The white-haired elder glanced at Ning in surprise,
then pointed at the Autarch’s stone dais beneath Ning. “This
serves as the core for the estate, and Master spent countless amounts
of effort in forging it. You’ve already acquired a Stonefire Pearl
as well, which is the essence core of a creature which was comparable
to an Autarch in might. These were treasures which my master himself
used to assist him in cultivation. With them, what other external
treasures could you possibly want?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
understand,” Ning said hurriedly. “The Autarch’s stone dais and
the Stonefire Pearl are both tremendously helpful in cultivation.
They will provide me with sustained, long-term benefits while I am
training. What I was referring to just now is another type of
external treasure, something akin to the ‘Voidsea Jadeseal’ or
the ‘Nine Orifices Void Pill’, treasures which can generate an
astonishing effect for a brief period of time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ahh.”
The white-haired elder nodded. Many talented Daolords would create
magic altars and seek out special spirit-pills in preparation for
their Daomerge. Those spirit-pills, when eaten, would cause the
truesoul to be tremendously stimulated. As for the Voidsea Jadeseal,
it actually allowed for a complete Daomerge simulation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
walk the path of the Omega Dao, and so there is no way to simulate
your Daomerge,” the white-haired elder said. “As for special
spirit-pills… they probably wouldn’t even be as useful as the
state you are normally in when using the Autarch’s stone dais and
the Stonefire Pearl.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
immediately asked, “Isn’t there something particularly special
which I could use?” Ning would go for anything and everything which
was of use to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-haired old man pondered for a while, then said, “If you
absolutely HAVE to have something… I do remember an incredible
single-use Daomerge treasure which can instantly unleash a tremendous
amount of power for an extremely brief period of time. Master once
mentioned it briefly to me and described it as one of the top three
treasures in its class!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
eyes lit up upon hearing this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
number one treasure is known as the ‘Daomerge Firecloud Flower’.
The second-ranked treasure is known as the ‘Incense Spirit-Fruit’.
The third is known as the ‘Cloudworld Jade’.” The white-haired
elder said resignedly, “But I’ve only heard of them because my
master once chatted casually about them with other Autarchs. They
didn’t speak in detail and so I know very little about them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
Darknorth, these are all limited-time objects. Once you use them up,
they are gone. They aren’t even close to being comparable to the
stone dais or the Stonefire Pearl in value.” The white-haired elder
shook his head. “And, I recall my master once saying that the
Cloudworld Jade’s effect only lasts for roughly three months or so,
but the effect is merely as strong as the Stonefire Pearl’s
constant effect.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
can only be used for three months, while the Stonefire Pearl is
constant and can be used long-term.” The white-haired elder looked
at Ning. “Finding the Cloudworld Jade would be enormously
difficult. Why bother?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
just silently memorized all of this information. There clearly was no
reason to seek out the third-ranked treasure, the ‘Cloudworld
Jade’. The other two, however, were worth searching for. Anything
that might increase his chances at the Daomerge by even a smidgeon
was worth hunting for.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Senior,
where should I go to find these things?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
idea.” The white-haired elder shook his head. “I never asked
Master about them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh.”
Ning pondered for a moment. In the past, he had never even heard of
‘Incense Spirit-Fruit’ or ‘Daomerge Firecloud Flower’. It
seemed as though only truly experienced and worldly figures would
know of them. A pity that he hadn’t asked his big brother Waveshift
about them! In all the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance, perhaps the most
worldly figure outside of Emperor Waveshift was Realmslord Windgrace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Realmslord
Windgrace had served and been taught by more than one Autarch!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.
I have to warn you,” the white-haired elder said solemnly,
“Treasures of such rarity are all extremely hard to find. Not even
the Autarchs know everything there is to know about the vast
Chaosverse! The technology of the Sithe, the two slain Autarch-level
creatures… they are all testament to the fact that the Chaosverse
holds many terrifying secrets within it. You are still just a
Daolord; so what if you are strong? There are some truly dangerous
places which would cause even Hegemons to fall, to say nothing of
you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
understand.” Ning nodded. However, since he had the Flamewing God
he felt that he was still able to give it a good shot. Chaos
Primordials were famous for its virtually indestructible body, after
all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Flamedragon Realmverse is nothing more than a tiny part of the
Chaosverse. It is best for you to harbor a healthy fear of the
universe,” the white-haired elder said with a sigh. “I hope that
you won’t overestimate yourself prior to completing your Daomerge.
If you succeed in it, you’ll probably become far more powerful than
even an Otherverse Lord. You can go and wander the Chaosverse them;
only then will you be assured of staying alive.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you, senior.” Ning could sense that the estate-spirit remained
worried, and so he quickly explained, “Actually, I’ve already
tamed a Chaos Primordial.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-haired elder instantly turned speechless. “You… wha…?
Ahem. Well, enough of that.” The white-haired elder didn’t seem
to know what to say, and so he immediately began to vanish into thin
air. His voice echoed for one final time within the second hall:
“Remember, for you to solve the Heart of Eternity is the one final
wish my Master had. It will be of tremendous benefit to all
cultivator civilizations as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
understand.” Ning nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
black-robed Ning was seated atop the Autarch’s stone dais, toying
with the runed Heart of Eternity with his hands.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh,
Autarch Awakener…” Ning looked at the Heart of Eternity. “So
this is your final wish, eh? But… my only wish is to complete the
Daomerge and then become an Autarch in the future.” Ning’s heart
was filled with mixed emotions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
wish and Autarch Awakener’s wish… they involved heading down two
different paths. Ever since they had gained victory in the Dawn War,
the Autarchs had stood at the very apex of the universe and were
without equal. As a result they were quite lonely, and they often
searched for things to do. Autarch Bolin had created the Aeonians,
while Autarch Awakener had spent his efforts on analyzing the Nine
Chaos Seals and creating a type of cultivation technique similar to
what the Sithe used.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
cultivation technique the Sithe used created something similar to the
azureflower mist energy, but it was clearly even more profound. Alas,
they were completely different types of living creatures than
cultivators, and thus there was no way for cultivators to use their
cultivation techniques.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Autarch
Awakener put all of his efforts in creating something similar. If he
truly succeeded, it would’ve benefited all cultivator
civilizations. Alas, he was only able to at most create something
which allowed for Daolords of the Fourth Step to convert their divine
power and Immortal energy. There was no way to transform
Emperor-class energy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch
Awakener, I’ll give it a try. If I turn out to have incredible
talent for this, I might be able to help you.” Ning remained quite
clear-minded. As a Daolord, his time was limited. There was no way he
could spend all of it on researching the Nine Chaos Seals. But if it
looked like he might somehow managed to succeed in a short period of
time due to having an incredible affinity for it, he didn’t mind
spending that time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break.”
Ning looked at the runes covering the sphere. Ning was able to break
through the first layer of runes with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Break
again.” Ning was at an incredibly high level of insight and had
trained in the Nine Chaos Seals before. Thus, he found it quite
simple to break the second layer of runes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
broke through one layer after another, but the difficulty level began
to gradually increase. Ning began to need more and more time for each
layer. In the blink of an eye, over a hundred million years went by.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Time
to give it a rest.” Ning suddenly came to a halt. The Heart of
Eternity had a total of ninety-nine layers, and solving all of them
would represent having reached the same level of insight into the
Nine Chaos Seals as Autarch Awakener had reached.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
only solved nineteen layers.” Ning felt a sense of misery in his
heart; the difference between the two of them was simply too great.
Things would only grow more difficult as he progressed, and for now
nineteen layers was his limit. If he spent an extremely long period
of time, he would at most be able to just barely solve the twentieth
and twenty-first levels. Ninety-nine? Far too hard!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Autarch
Awakener, you created your stone dais and procured the Stonefire
Pearl, yet still spent countless years to reach your final level of
insight into the Nine Chaos Seals. How can I possibly compare?”
Ning shook his head. “Even if I spent another hundred thousand
chaos cycles on this, my chances of successfully breaking through all
ninety-nine levels are still very low.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
need to complete the Daomerge. Even if I did manage to somehow create
this technique, it would be of no use to me in the Daomerge.” Ning
secretly sighed to himself. “I’m sorry, Autarch Awakener.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had no choice but to put aside this mission of solving the Heart of
Eternity for now. To occasionally spend some time on solving the
Heart of Eternity to balance out the time spent on other things, but
if he focused all of his efforts on it it would make the
already-difficult Daomerge completely impossible. The end result
would most likely be what big brother Waveshift had divined…
certain doom.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ninety-nine
levels… nineteen levels…” Ning could only laugh at the
difference between the two. He then waved his hand, putting the Heart
of Eternity away.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_024__Daom"></A>
Chapter 24: Life Training</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning didn’t hesitate at all. He was completely focused on his own
path… the path of the Daomerge! With regards to the Daomerge, all
external sources of help were still of secondary use. In the end, his
own insights were what counted for the most!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was unable to make further strides with his Omega Sword Dao. Even
though he occasionally gained a few insights, they were scattered
rather than systemized. This was why he had decided to emulate
Autarch Bolin. Back when Autarch Bolin had been a Hegemon, he had
gone out of his way to train in many other Daos. As he had raised
nine different Daos to the Hegemonic level, he had gained so many
scattered insights into the Dao of the Claw that in the end, they had
allowed him to suddenly burst through his bottleneck and reach
Autarchy, becoming one of the paramount leaders of the cultivator
civilizations.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
am quite similar to how Autarch Bolin was. I’m unable to make any
further advancements in my Omega Sword Dao, and it’s also quite
difficult to gain even scattered insights. However, all Daos are
linked together. The more I train in other Daos, the better my
chances of succeeding in the Daomerge for my Omega Sword Dao.” Ning
calmed his mind and began to train in other Daos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Metal,
Wood, Water, Fire, Earth, Formations, Space, Thunder, Illusions… he
was quite accomplished in all of them already. Ning’s next target
was the Dao of Wind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Amongst
Daos, there were certain groupings. For example, the Five Elements
were viewed as one group, while ‘Wind Earth Fire Water’ was yet
another grouping. Ning found it quite simple to train in Wind,
especially after having acquired the Stonefire Pearl. He needed
merely a single Chaos Cycle to train the Dao of Wind to the Archon
level. Time, however, was even more difficult than Space.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
flowed on like water. Ning’s black-robed Primaltwin constantly
trained, while Ning’s true body began to rove the universe
alongside Azurefiend, Whitethaw, and Flamewing. He had visited fairly
few places within even just the Flamedragon Realmverse, after all.
There were many dangerous places he had yet to visit. By visiting
more places and seeing more things, he would be stimulated and have a
better chance at an epiphany.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had a realmship, was at the Hegemonic level of power, and also had
Flamewing for protection. He only needed to spend around eighteen
chaos cycles to completely go through all of the special ‘danger
zones’ of the Flamedragon Realmverse. However, he had yet to truly
traverse the Terror Starsea, which was filled with far too many
dangers. That had been a battlefield of the Dawn War, after all. Even
Flamewing would find itself easily caught by some of the dire traps
located there.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
finishing his wanderings through the danger zones of the Flamedragon
Realmverse, Ning began to wander through some ordinary chaosworlds
and everworlds, living amongst ordinary mortals and countless aliens.
Ning viewed them all from afar and up close.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
an ordinary chaosworld. Thirty thousand years ago, a tremendous
calamity had descended upon this world, causing its denizens to
suffer countless casualties. This world had lost virtually all of its
experts and many of its clans, and it was now thousands of times more
difficult for mortals to cultivate to become Immortals.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Old
man, what do you think you can do? You are merely at the Houtian
level, while I am as well. I’m just twenty years old but still
couldn’t make the cutoff. Look at how old you are! What makes you
think you can succeed?” A young man dressed in brocade who was
within a teahouse was laughing and teasing an older man.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
age cutoff this time is just fifty years, and one has to have reached
the Xiantian level. You don’t fit either of the two criteria,”
some of the longtime customers teased the teahouse owner.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
heard that countless unaffiliated cultivators have been gathering
within Pureplume City, located at the base of the mountain which
houses the Pureplume Sect. By now, there are hundreds of thousands of
them present. Just a few months remain before the great ceremony…
most likely, by then nearly a million cultivators will have arrived
to fight over the slots.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
million Xiantian experts fighting over a thousand honorary disciple
slots? Uh… I can count the number of Xiantian experts in our little
city on two hands. It is truly unfathomable that the Pureplume Sect
can attract nearly a million cultivators when it openly recruits for
new disciples.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
all shook their heads and discussed this topic eagerly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Several
figures were seated in the corner of this teahouse. One was a
white-robed youth, one was a chubby man, one was a skinny old man,
and another was a muscular, honest-looking man who was clearly the
bodyguard. The skinny old man looked like a steward, while the chubby
man had to be a retainer. As for the white-robed youth, he had to be
a young master of a clan. However, judging from how they dressed they
had to be quite ordinary. It seemed unlikely that they were from a
major clan or family.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
four were Ning and his three followers. Ning continued to eat while
listening attentively.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
go, big brother.” A young man and woman were seated at a nearby
table. The maiden was lively and dressed in green robes, and she was
begging the man: “Big brother, you just broke through to the
Xiantian level a short while ago and are merely at the early stage of
it. Didn’t you hear? Nearly a million Xiantian experts have
gathered there and all of them want to enter the Pureplume Sect!
Peak-level Xiantian experts might stand a chance, while late-stage
Xiantian experts can at least give it a try, but you are just an
early-stage Xiantian cultivator! Going will be suicide!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Even
if I risk my life, I have to go.” The youth gritted his teeth. “If
I go, at least I have a chance at one day clearing the names of our
parents and clan. If I don’t go, I’ll probably never be strong
enough to gain revenge, and our clan shall forever bear the infamy of
those lies. Father… mother… all the seniors of the clan… none
of them will be able to rest in ease.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Big
brother…” the green-robed maiden begged, “Let’s just find a
quiet little place and live a peaceful life. What’s wrong with
that?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
want me to swallow this feud and live a peaceful life? I can’t
endure it.” The youth shook his head. “Give it up, little sister.
We’re already quite close to Pureplume City. We’ve already spent
three years on the road, and we’re finally about to reach our
destination. You know you won’t change my mind.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
green-robed maiden gnawed at her lips. “I… I only have you left,
big brother.” The youth’s eyes reddened in response.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
two of them were also in a corner, and they spoke in hushed whispers.
The people next to them were unable to hear what they were saying.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Live
a good life. If I can enter the Pureplume Sect, I’ll come find you
one day.” The youth rose to his feet, then walked over to Ning’s
table and said, “Brother Ning, we’ve travelled together for half
a month. Today, we must part ways. Today’s drinks are on me! If
fate wills it, we will meet again.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
fate wills it, we will meet again.” Ning smiled as he lifted up his
own cup. “Brother Qu, I hope you will succeed in joining the
Pureplume Sect.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
definitely will.” The youth’s eyes shone with great
determination.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come,
let me offer you a final toast prior to our parting.” As Ning
spoke, he picked up two cups of wine and offered one to the youth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
youth was slightly startled, but he still accepted it. “Cheers.”
The youth immediately raised his head and drank the wine. As he did,
a faint stream of light within the wine flowed into his body,
invisibly and naturally coming to nest within his sea of
consciousness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Time
to go.” The youth put down the cup of wine, then turned and left.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
revealed a hint of a smile as ‘brother Qu’ left. He had spent
nearly twenty chaos cycles wandering through various ordinary
chaosworlds, and he rarely revealed his power. He chose to act just
like an ordinary mortal. Ning had met this youth previously while
riding a ship alongside him. The two had shared a spirited
conversation while drinking one night on the ship, and thus they had
travelled together until today.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Little
sister Qu.” Ning walked over to the young maiden’s table. The
young maiden’s eyes were rather red and wet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Big
brother Ning,” the green-robed maiden said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Your
big brother will definitely join the Pureplume Sect, and he might
become one of the most incredible cultivators in their history. He’ll
definitely come back and find you,” Ning said. “I want to offer
you a toast as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
The green-robed maiden shared a cup with Ning as well, and once more
that invisible essence of light slipped into her body via the wine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
short while later, the green-robed maiden bade Ning farewell as she
departed from the teanhouse. She was going to Pureplume City as well
to watch what happened. She was worried about her big brother.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
Azurefiend watched as the green-robed maiden departed, then walked
over to Ning. Puzzled, he asked, “You’ve spent nearly twenty
chaos cycles wandering through various ordinary worlds. You rarely
show your power, and even when you do choose to help someone you
merely provide them with a tiny bit of guidance. Why did you go out
of your way to help these two so much? Not only did you begin an
invisible process of completely transforming their bodies, you even
bequeathed each of them them with a legacy.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
laughed. In the past, he had merely provided a bit of guidance
through karmic magic, using it to change a few mortal destinies. This
time, however, he had indeed provided the two with an enormous amount
of help. The help he had just provided was enough to allow these two
to reach the absolute apex of this chaosworld with ease, and they
would even have a chance to reach the World level.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
this is because today is the final day of my twenty chaos cycles of
voyaging,” Ning said with a laugh. “Why can’t I have a bit of
fun on my last day?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Last
day?” Azurefiend, Whitethaw, and Flamewing all stared at Ning in
surprise. They had spent nearly twenty chaos cycles wandering through
mortal worlds. Why was today suddenly the final day?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.
I’ve more or less finished my training.” Ning nodded.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_025__Daom"></A>
Chapter 25: The Dao of Karma</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go.” Ji Ning rose to his feet, departing the teahouse with
Azurefiend, Whitethaw, and Flamewing by his side. As they walked,
their forms gradually dissipated into nothingness. None of the
ordinary mortals in the teahouse noticed a thing at all. They
continued to live their ordinary lives.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning and the other three appeared out of nowhere in the void outside
this chaosworld.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
it’s all over? You don’t need to train any further?” Azurefiend
asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.”
Ning nodded. “I’ve already succeeded in training in the Dao of
Karma. Everything has been completed, and at my current level of
mastery of the Dao of Karma I can subconsciously sense that even if I
trained in other Daos, it would be of no use in attempting the
Daomerge for my Omega Dao.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had trained for nearly 38 chaos cycles after acquiring the Stonefire
Pearl. Given that his Primaltwin had constantly been under 100x
temporal acceleration, he had actually spent over 3000 chaos cycles
training.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Dao of Wind had been completed incredibly fast, while the Dao of Time
had cost him over 300 chaos cycles. The rest of the 3000-plus chaos
cycles had all been spent on the Dao of Karma.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Dao of Karma was legendary for its complexity. Generally speaking,
Eternal Emperors would at most learn how to follow karma lines to
slay all of an enemy’s clones and avatars. Their mastery of karma
would be limited to simply that. Of all the Hegemons and Emperors
which Ning had met, Emperor Waveshift had reached the highest level
of insight into ‘karma’. Emperor Waveshift had organized all of
the karma lines surrounding him in a very neat and orderly way,
ensuring that he was no longer bound by it and instead was in control
of it and able to make use of it. However, Emperor Waveshift had
actually merely reached the Archon level of mastery in the Dao of
Karma.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had the Autarch’s stone dais and the Stonefire Pearl, as well as
incredible powers of comprehension, but it had still taken him nearly
3000 chaos cycles in order to reach the Archon level. This was a
testament to how difficult this Dao was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Once
one mastered the Dao of Karma, one would surpass even Hegemons in
understanding how all living things were connected to each other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Metal,
Wood, Water, Fire, Earth… the Five Elements. They are supported by
the Storm of wind and thunder, while Spacetime envelopes them all.
Formations and Illusions merge them into one whole, while Karma
serves as the heart.” Ning nodded. Nine represented the apex of
numbers, while ten represented perfection. After mastering the Dao of
Karma, Ning understood this concept. Now that he had reached the apex
in these ten paths, he had already reached the level of full
perfection.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
could train more in other Daos, such as the Dao of the Saber, Dao of
Snow, or the Dao of Ice, but it would be of no use. They wouldn’t
allow Ning to gain any more fragmentary insights into the Omega Sword
Dao at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Karma.”
Ning stood there in the void outside the chaosworld, gazing at
everything around him. He had just mastered the Dao of Karma, and he
was attuning to the many new insights into the universe it was
bringing him. He was gaining many new ideas into the Omega Sword Dao.
Although they weren’t systemized, they would be of use to him when
the Daomerge came.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
turned to scan the surrounding area. Spacetime could no longer bar
his gaze, and he saw countless distant chaosworlds, planets, and even
everworlds. He was able to see through over a hundred territories
around them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
saw the grass emerge from the dirt of a distant world…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
saw how a mortal lived for a hundred years, then returned to the
embrace of the earth…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
saw a mortal embark upon the path of cultivation, completely focused
on becoming an Immortal…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
saw monsters struggling in terror, fearing that they would be found
and slain by cultivators…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
saw Diremonsters claim hegemony over a region, devouring and
massacring countless humans within it…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
saw aliens propagate to become legion in number, becoming the rulers
of a land…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">These
were all things which Ning had personally experienced and witnessed
at close range during the past twenty chaos cycles.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had seen many powerful Fiendgods and Immortals wander the lands
unimpeded. He had seen ‘mighty’ World-level cultivators who rose
to dominate their respective chaosworlds and become the undisputed
overlords of them. He also saw them battle against other World-level
cultivators for supremacy, with some dying in those battles.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
saw World-level cultivators focus on their cultivation. He saw
Samsara Daolords experience all sorts of tempering experiences. Some
fearlessly went out adventuring and finally attempted the Daomerge.
Even though they all perished, they continued to charge towards the
Daomerge like moths towards the flame. Every so often, a few would
succeed and gain Eternity for themselves, but perhaps 99,999 out of
every 100,000 would fail the Daomerge and perish.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Everyone
from ordinary mortals to Samsara Daolords have their own paths,”
Ning murmured softly. “This is the nature of the cultivator
civilizations.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
wonderful.” This was how Ning summarized it all. He liked how the
cultivator civilizations worked. Thank goodness they had won the Dawn
War! Otherwise, all living beings would’ve been enslaved by the
Sithe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
living beings within the cultivator civilizations should feel
gratitude towards the Autarchs.” When Ning thought of this, he
could immediately but subconsciously sense that all living beings
were connected to the Autarchs by karma. They all owed the Autarchs.
However, the Autarchs were so overwhelmingly powerful that karma had
no power over them any longer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
hope the cultivator civilizations will be able to survive and thrive
unto eternity. I hope we won’t be destroyed by the Sithe or other
similarly terrifying groups.” Ning then smiled. “Not really for
me to worry about, though. I’m not even as strong as Flamewing
right now.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
put this out of his mind and began to make the karma lines around him
more orderly. He hadn’t been alive for too long, and so although
the karma lines around him seemed complicated he was able to realign
them and smooth them out in short order.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?
Two knots?” Ning frowned upon realizing that there were two ‘knots’
in his karma. If he didn’t solve these knots, he would definitely
fail his Daomerge!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
first knot was the lifeblood oath he had once sworn. Prior to
attempting his Daomerge, he had to accept ten honorary disciples on
behalf of Emperor Mirrorsnow. This was something he was bound to do
by his lifeblood oath, and Ning knew of it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
second knot was what truly surprised Ning. It was his promise to slay
Emperor Melobo.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">When
Ning had first left the Three Realms and was merely an Elder God, he
had visited the Allgod Estate. He had been bestowed with the
[Novessence Thunder] technique by the formation-spirit, which was one
of the nine novessence arts. As the formation-spirit had put it, it
was ‘sowing the seeds of good karma’ with Ning. It had said to
Ning: “I won’t force you to do it; I merely hope that you can
help,” and had also said that “I’m just planting seeds to
sprout in the future. I don’t expect all of them to blossom.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Back
then, the formation-spirit would never have dared to imagine that one
of its many seeds would blossom in such a manner. It only hoped that
if Ning did become powerful in the future, that he would slay Emperor
Melobo.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had felt this to be an impossible and impossibly distant task, but he
had still been rewarded the [Novessence Thunder] technique.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
now reached the Hegemonic level of power; killing Emperor Melobo
would be extremely simple,” Ning mused. “Indeed, now that I think
back to it, I do owe both the formation-spirit and Daolord Allgod!
During my Daomerge, even the slightest of karmic debts can cause me
to be negatively impacted. An Omega Daomerge cannot accept even the
slightest of such impacts. It would definitely cause me to fail.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right.
I absolutely must complete these two tasks before the Daomerge.”
Ning nodded. “It’ll take time for me to track down Emperor
Melobo, and it’ll also take time for me to accept ten honorary
disciples,” Ning mused. “I’ll go visit Realmslord Windgrace
first, then take care of these two matters.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Sorry
for the trouble, Hegemon Brightshore.” Ning had come to ask Hegemon
Brightshore to assist him in tracking down Emperor Melobo. Hegemon
Brightshore was the number one Hegemon of the Flamedragon Realmverse,
after all, and he was skilled in the Dao of Spacetime. He also had a
strong web of relationships. It would be easy for him to locate
Melobo.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
minor matter,” Hegemon Brightshore replied casually.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Please
keep this secret. Don’t let Melobo find out and then flee the
realmverse,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry. I’ll handle this matter personally and will ensure that no
mistakes happen. If you don’t mind, I can help you kill him,”
Hegemon Brightshore said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
would be best if I did it personally,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mm,
very well. Go ahead and visit Realmslord Windgrace. By the time you
are back, I’ll have handled everything.” Hegemon Brightshore was
quite confident. He knew that Emperor Melobo was definitely within
the Flamedragon Realmverse. Where, exactly? He didn’t know, as it
was difficult to find where an Emperor was hiding… but if Hegemon
Brightshore personally investigated this matter, he would definitely
be able to find Melobo within a hundred thousand years.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
having asked Hegemon Brightshore for help, Ning, Flamewing,
Azurefiend, and Whitethaw rode the realmship out of the Flamedragon
Realmverse and towards the Hiddenfiend Realmverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">These
two realmverses were fairly far away from each other. The realmship
needed to engage in extremely long-distance spacetime teleports, and
it needed as much time as was needed to boil a kettle of tea in order
to build up energy between each teleport.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Sixty
thousand years later. Whoosh. A realmship suddenly appeared from a
spatial tear within the void outside the Hiddenfiend Realmverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“And
here we are.” Ning stared at the world outside the realmship, his
eyes lighting up. This was his first time visiting another
realmverse. In contrast, Whitethaw, Azurefiend, and Flamewing were
all quite calm. They had all visited many places; Ning was the only
inexperienced one present.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mm.
This place is fairly close to the Blacksun. A single teleport will
take us there.” Ning had already acquired a star map of the
Hiddenfiend Realmverse prior to arriving.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">One
more spacetime teleport later, Ning found himself staring at a
beautiful and distant star. To be precise, it was an absolutely
enormous war machine that was riddled with channels and canals that
made up complicated rune-paths. The Blacksun was a terrifying war
machine that was capable of changing the destiny of entire realmverse
sectors. Just by looking at it, Ning felt an ancient aura of power
sweep across him, pressing down upon him like an invisible threat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fellow
Daoist Darknorth.” A voice rang out, followed by a chubby youth
appearing on the Blacksun who stared in Ning’s direction. Although
they were over a hundred billion kilometers away, the two were able
to see each other with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hegemon
Wuye.” Ning put away his realmship.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_026__Daom"></A>
Chapter 26: Jade Slip</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Prior
to visiting Realmslord Windgrace, Ji Ning had long ago sent word via
the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance that he would be coming. Realmslord
Windgrace was quite willing to meet with Ning as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Blacksun. Ning’s group of four was led to a courtyard within it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Wuye smiled: “Master has been waiting for quite some time. When he
heard that you were coming, he was quite excited. I felt quite eager
as well. I’ve heard of your illustrious reputation long ago,
Darknorth, and I’ve also heard of Flamewing God the Chaos
Primordial. Today, I’ve finally met you two.” He was unable to
disguise his interested glance towards the nearby Flamewing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Flamewing
was quite chubby, but was much larger than Wuye. When he saw Wuye, he
mumbled, “He looks yummy.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hegemon
Wuye’s face turned pale and he hurriedly pushed the door open and
called, “Master!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
was a withered tree inside the courtyard. Below it was a prayer mat,
with a disheveled-looking old man seated atop it. The old man’s
eyebrows looked quite messy, but his gaze was extremely calm. He had
a smile on his face, and he pointed to the prayer mats next to him.
“Darknorth, my young friend. Sit.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you, Realmslord Windgrace.” Ning walked over and sat down on a
prayer mat. Azurefiend and Whitethaw did the same, while Flamewing
lazily sauntered over to a boulder and lay down on it while shaking
his rump.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Chaos
Primordials truly are extraordinary,” Realmslord Windgrace praised.
He then glanced at Ning. “Darknorth, my young friend… I’m sure
you didn’t come to visit me just to show off your Chaos
Primordial.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
is indeed something I wish for you to help me with, Realmslord,”
Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go
ahead and explain.” Realmslord Windgrace was quite willing to help
Ning out; the more he helped Ning out, the greater his chances of
acquiring the Flamewing God after Ning failed the Daomerge would be.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
heard legends of two marvelous items that are of tremendous use
during the Daomerge. One is known as the Daomerge Firecloud Flower,
while the other is known as the Incense Spirit-Fruit,” Ning said.
“Are you aware of them, Realmslord?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Realmslord
Windgrace looked at Ning in astonishment, then sighed. “Impressive,
truly impressive. Daolord Darknorth, how is it that you know of such
incredibly rare items? Even I only learned of them due to a lucky
encounter.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was delighted. He immediately asked, “Realmslord, do you know where
they can be found?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daomerge
Firecloud Flowers and Incense Spirit-Fruits should be considered
legendary treasures for Daolords attempting the Daomerge,”
Realmslord Windgrace said. “When I served Autarch Titanos, we once
discussed Daomerge treasures, with the topic focusing on the
treasures that provided incredibly marvelous effects for short
periods of time. Autarch Titanos praised the Daomerge Firecloud
Flower as being best, with the Incense Spirit-Fruit being second.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Both
of these items vastly surpass the Voidsea Jadeseals. During the
Daomerge, someone who has eaten an Incense Spirit-Fruit will enter a
truly profound state where his body is divided into nine different
incarnations. All nine of them can test out a simulated Daomerge
while the true body undergoes the real Daomerge. So long as one of
the nine incarnations succeeds, the true body can succeed in the
Daomerge as well,” Realmslord Windgrace said. “As for the
Daomerge Firecloud Flower, it’s even more remarkable. It can allow
for the creation of eighty-one incarnations that will all simulate
the Daomerge at the same time!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
of course, what I’m saying only stands true for ordinary Daolords.
The more talented a Daolord is, the more energy each incarnation
consumes from an Incense Spirit-Fruit or a Daomerge Firecloud Flower.
Those who have fused multiple Supreme Daos will only be able to
create a single incarnation after eating an Incense Spirit-Fruit,
while a Daomerge Firecloud Flower can at most maintain a total of
nine incarnations. These two treasures have a similar function, which
means you can only choose to use one of them. You can’t mix and
match… and they only have these marvelous effects when you use them
during your actual Daomerge.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Realmslord
Windgrace looked at Ning and smiled. “What, Darknorth… do you
need the Daomerge Firecloud Flower?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was amazed. So this was the effect these items had? The Voidsea
Jadeseal allowed for just a single simulated Daomerge, but it didn’t
have to be used during the actual Daomerge! The problem with it was
that it just wasn’t all that powerful in comparison. For supreme
Daolords who had fused multiple Supreme Daos, it would only allow for
a small part of the Daomerge to be simulated.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
comparison, the Incense Spirit-Fruit was clearly far more powerful,
while the Daomerge Firecloud Flower was ridiculously effective. The
problem was, they could only be used during the actual Daomerge!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
someone who has fused multiple Supreme Daos can have nine
incarnations assisting him when he uses the Daomerge Firecloud
Flower?” Ning mused to himself, “Then my Omega Dao… I wonder if
I’ll have even a single incarnation.” As for the Incense
Spirit-Fruit, Ning had already mentally discarded it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
train in an Omega Dao, yes?” Realmslord Windgrace asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.”
Ning acknowledged it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daomerges
for Omega Daos are incredibly difficult. I imagine only the top
Daomerge treasure, the Daomerge Firecloud Flower, will be of some use
to you.” Realmslord Windgrace shook his head. “And its use will
probably be highly limited. I’ve heard of Omega Daolords who have
used it but still failed. There has just never been anyone successful
in an Omega Daomerge.” Realmslord Windgrace let out a sigh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Every
single realmverse had a few Hegemons, which meant that the vast
Chaosverse had a large number of them… but it had never seen so
much as a single successful Omega Daomerge!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“As
long as it helps out, I’ll take it.” Ning laughed. “Anything
that can increase my chances by even a sliver is a good thing.
Perhaps that’ll be the sliver that pushes me over to success during
the Daomerge.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
a nice way to view it. You need that sort of attitude when you
attempt the Daomerge. If you are panicking, you’ll have lost half
the battle before it even starts,” Realmslord Windgrace said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Realmslord,
do you know where Daomerge Firecloud Flowers can be found?” Ning
asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
do. They can be found in several places,” Realmslord Windgrace
said. “Daomerge Firecloud Flowers are incredibly valuable to
Daolords, but to us they are nothing more than fairly unusual
treasures that are generally used to create pills.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was overjoyed. His eyes lit up as he asked, “If the Daomerge
Firecloud Flowers are used to create pills, will they perhaps be of
even greater assistance during the Daomerge?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No,
no! If you use them to make pills, you’ll actually waste the
special effect they have during the Daomerge,” Realmslord Windgrace
said hurriedly. “Daomerge Firecloud Flowers are naturally endowed
with those unique properties, but once you use it to create a pill
the properties are lost. In addition, they can only be used within a
thousand years after they first bloom! After a thousand years go by,
their aura will completely vanish and their medicinal value will drop
by over 90% as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. “Then where can they be harvested?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Realmslord
Windgrace frowned. “Are you still going to go for one? The place
they are located is incredibly dangerous. I know where they can be
found, but even I wouldn’t dare to go there without a good reason.
Generally speaking, several of my friends would join forces in
venturing there.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
place is that dangerous?” Ning was surprised.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Chaosverse is filled with countless marvels as well as many
incredibly dangerous places. However, the Chaosverse is so vast that
it’s hard to even locate those places unless you know exactly where
they are,” Realmslord Windgrace said. “Ordinary realmverses and
otherverses would never be able to give birth to something like a
Daomerge Firecloud Flower. Only some of the truly marvelous places of
the Chaosverse, places which gather together countless different
types of universal essence, can possibly give birth to such
remarkable treasures.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
of these places, however, are tightly protected by the prime essences
of the Chaosverse,” Realmslord Windgrace said. “The Sithe
attempted to invade and conquer many of these places and take their
contents by force, but the result was that they suffered tremendously
heavy casualties.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
what type of dangers do those places hold?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
type of being known as a ‘Sourcewalker’,” Realmslord Windgrace
said. “Let me put it to you like this. Normally, the Chaosverse can
give birth to two extremely perfect types of beings. The first are
known as the ‘Chaos Godbeasts’, while the second are known as the
‘Ancients’.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded slowly. Hegemon Brightshore was a Chaos Godbeast, while
Ninedust was a member of the Ancients. They were born at the World
level and had incredibly perfect divine bodies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Chaos
Godbeasts have comparatively lower levels of comprehension, while
Ancients take human form and have much higher comprehension skills,”
Realmslord Windgrace said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
smiled. The only member of the Brightshore Imperials to succeed in
the Daomerge was Hegemon Brightshore himself. It was incredibly
difficult for Chaos Godbeasts as a race to succeed in the Daomerge.
Azurefiend and Welkin were both Chaos Godbeasts, but they were the
only Hegemons to have ever arisen from their race. They had no
colleagues at all. They were unable or unwilling to spend their
entire lives taking care of weaker Chaos Godbeasts as Hegemon
Brightshore did, and so they wandered by themselves through the
Chaosverse. This was something they had been accustomed to since
youth. In contrast, Ancients were far more intelligent and thus had
far more Eternal Emperors in comparison.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Chaos
Godbeasts and Ancients… they are present in virtually every
realmverse. They are quite common,” Realmslord Windgrace said.
“However… two types of living beings are born within the prime
essences of the Chaosverse, and they are even more elite. One type is
fairly unintelligent, and they are known as the ‘Chaos
Primordials’. The other is fairly intelligent and also has human
form, and they are known as ‘Chaos Essence Walkers’, or
‘Sourcewalkers’ for short.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Chaos
Primordials and Sourcewalkers are born with far more exalted
bloodlines than Chaos Godbeasts and Ancients,” Realmslord Windgrace
said. “However… they represent even greater extremes as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Chaos
Primordials are as unintelligent as mortal children, but are born
with virtually indestructible bodies. In contrast, Sourcewalkers are
very intelligent and have incredible comprehension skills. They are
incredibly solitary and proud figures who do not dwell in ordinary
places. They delight in dwelling in treasured places where countless
streams of essence from the Chaosverse gather together, and they
treat those places as their own territories,” Realmslord Windgrace
said. “Unlike Chaos Primordials, they cannot be ‘tamed’; they
are simply far too intelligent. There is no way one can force them to
submit.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
you wish to go to one of those sacred places where Daomerge Firecloud
Flowers can be harvested, that means you are going to steal treasures
from a Sourcewalker’s territory. You will enrage them.”
Realmslord Windgrace shook his head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
pondered this matter. He wasn’t surprised at all. Although this was
his first time hearing of ‘Sourcewalkers’, he had already heard
of strange beings that were on par with the Autarchs themselves. Why
would he be shocked to hear that there were certain creatures on par
with Chaos Primordials in might?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Sourcewalkers
are all extremely intelligent, which means they do have a weakness;
their bodies aren’t nearly as indestructible as that of the Chaos
Primordials, and they are born with much lower levels of strength.
However, they can slowly cultivate and grow with time! Thus, there
are varying levels of power amongst Sourcewalkers. The weaker ones
are perhaps merely at the Hegemonic level, while the most powerful
were supposedly on par with the Sithe Exalts, capable of killing us
in an instant,” Realmslord Windgrace said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
relaxed slightly. If even the most powerful were ‘merely’ on par
with Sith Exalts, that meant they were still much weaker than the
Autarchs. It must be remembered that it took three Sithe Exalts
working together to capture the Flamewing God; a single one wasn’t
able to do the trick. Plus, he wouldn’t be so unlucky as to run
into literally the most powerful type of Sourcewalker in existence,
right?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“When
the Sithe furiously invaded those sacred places to loot the
treasures, they enraged the prime essences of the Chaosverse with
their greed. The prime essences allowed the Sourcewalkers to borrow
from the inherent power of those sacred places, resulting in them
becoming much more powerful. This was why the Sithe suffered greatly
for their actions,” Realmslord Windgrace said. “However… you
must be cautious if you do go.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Realmslord
Windgrace suddenly waved his hand, causing a jade slip to appear. He
then filled it with his godsense, imprinting it with a great deal of
information.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is one of the closer locations. If you ride on your realmship, you
should reach it in just a few hundred thousand years. As I recall,
this place has Daomerge Firecloud Flowers within it. This slip now
contains all of the information I know regarding that place.” As
Realmslord Windgrace spoke, he delivered the jade slip to Ning.
“Remember, the information I provided covers just the vast majority
of situations, not all situations. I didn’t delve too deeply into
that place either. You really must be careful.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you, Realmslord.” Ning accepted the slip.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
having received the intelligence he needed, that very day Ning bade
Realmslord Windgrace farewell and embarked on a return journey.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had to first deal with Emperor Melobo, then take on ten honorary
disciples for Emperor Mirrorsnow. Only then could he go adventuring
with a calm heart. Anything was possible while out adventuring, after
all. He might be forced to initiate the Daomerge for some reason,
which would be disastrous if these karmic knots were not resolved.</P>

Chapter 27: Emperor Melobo</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
sixty thousand years, Ji Ning returned from the Hiddenfiend
Realmverse to his homeland in the Flamedragon Realmverse, at which
point his first course of action was to go meet with Hegemon
Brightshore.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Hegemon Brightshore noticed right away when Ning and the others
entered the Brightshore Kingdom. He appeared at the peak of a tall
mountain, having set a banquet in welcome.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth!”
Hegemon Brightshore called out loudly. Ning and the others turned to
look, then all flew over and landed. They sat down, with Flamewing
naturally beginning to eat and drink with delight.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
embarrassed to say this…” Hegemon Brightshore shook his head,
stroking his beard after downing two cups of wine, “I thought I’d
definitely be able to find Emperor Melobo within a hundred thousand
years, but this Aeonian Emperor truly is slippery. I’ve been
tracking him in secret, but I haven’t been able to find his true
body. Recently, I asked Netherlily to help out as well. Only when the
two of us worked together did we managed to find him roughly ten
thousand years ago.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
let out a sigh of relief upon hearing the words ‘managed to find
him’. “I’ll have to thank Hegemon Netherlily,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
minor matter. The three of us are usually quite bored,” Hegemon
Brightshore said with a laugh. “Honestly though, Emperor Melobo
really did hide his tracks quite carefully. He’s afraid that the
Dao Alliance will discover him devouring some of their Daolords of
the Fourth Step, and so he has been cautious to the extreme. Not even
the other Aeonians know his whereabouts.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
you truly wish to go into hiding, you need to ensure that not even
your allies know where you are. That’s the safest way to handle
it.” Ning asked, “Oh, right. So where is Emperor Melobo
currently?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Orchidfall Everworld of the Orchidfall Territory,” Hegemon
Brightshore said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Orchidfall Territory?” Ning nodded slowly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Orchidfall Territory was an ordinary territory located within the Dao
Alliance. Inside the Orchidfall Everworld was a powerful sect known
as the Sacred Orchidfall, with the most powerful member being a
Daolord of the Fourth Step who had quite a few disciples.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
aren’t Daolord Orchidfall. Who are you?” An alluringly beautiful
woman stared angrily at the plainly dressed man before her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha…
my aura is Daolord Orchidfall’s aura, and my appearance is his
appearance. How could I possibly not be him?” The man’s voice
seemed quite strange and sinister.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Orchidfall isn’t as powerful as you are. There’s no way he
could’ve destroyed my avatar in just one strike, then caught me
with such ease.” The woman’s forehead was creased in anger. “Who
are you?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
man laughed, his laughter becoming even more evil and piercing to the
ear. It echoed within the vast palace, but there was no one else in
the entire palace aside from the two of them. “Who am I?” The
man’s appearance slowly began to change, as did his aura. Soon, he
had transformed into an evil-looking man with long red hair. His eyes
were staring greedily at the woman in front of him, as though he was
caressing her with his gaze.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You…”
A puzzled look appeared on the woman’s face. “An Emperor?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh,
it seems you do not recognize me.” The long red-haired man let out
a smile. “I am an Aeonian, the mighty Emperor Melobo. I am your
savior, the one who shall rescue you from your doomed path as a
Samsara Daolord.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
do you want?” The woman was rather nervous. Her power had been
completely sealed away, making it impossible for her to fight back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
are absolutely beautiful. Whew. Such beauty…” the long red-haired
man said, a blissful look on his face, “I have to say, Emperor
Waveshift has truly been a blessing to the Flamedragon Realmverse. He
gave us Crimsonwave Temple, and even techniques like [Vitalis]. As a
result, I can now easily simulate the auras of others, allowing me to
infiltrate the Dao Alliance and catch beautiful Daolords like
yourself with increasing ease.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Y-you…
you are an Aeonian. Are you….” the woman began to panic.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Yu, do your best to fight back and struggle against me. That’ll
make things more fun.” Emperor Melobo walked towards her one step
at a time, licking his lips.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Aeonians
were a very special race. They devoured cultivators like food, which
allowed their Aeonian bloodline to evolve. However, after completing
the Daomerge and becoming an Eternal Emperor, eating Daolords became
of negligible assistance no matter how many they ate. Alas, there
were some Aeonians who simply liked to eat cultivators. Not for the
sake of growing stronger, but just for the taste; it was just an
intrinsic hunger they had! Emperor Melobo was one who delighted in
devouring surpassingly beautiful female Daolords. Their auras made
him feel extremely comfortable, which was why he viewed them as
perfectly delicious morsels.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Long
ago, Emperor Melobo had devoured Daolord Allgod’s Dao-companion.
Daolord Allgod had gone completely crazy, with killing Emperor Melobo
becoming his strongest desire.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Aeonians…”
the woman felt shock, horror, and anger. And yet, there was nothing
she could do.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
view you cultivators the same way you might view wild animals! You,
however, are the most delicious of morsels.” Emperor Melobo enjoyed
the horrified look on the woman’s face. “Don’t worry. More and
more female Daolords will accompany you in my belly.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Dao Alliance will definitely discover you. You’ll definitely die!”
The woman was filled with hatred.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Impossible.”
Emperor Melobo shook his head. “Prior to acquiring the [Vitalis]
technique, I already moved with great care for fear of the Dao
Alliance… and now that I have it and can disguise myself? It’ll
be completely impossible for them to find me. I only act when all
factors are completely under my control, and I never make any
mistakes. Even if they try to reverse spacetime to scan for what had
happened, they won’t find me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Melobo was very confident in his own cautious nature. He felt certain
that although a Hegemon who whole-heartedly searched for him via
multiple channels might be able to find him, it was virtually
impossible for anyone else. Only the most supreme powers of the
realmverse would be able to find him, and that’s only if they were
using all of their resources.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Y-you…”
Daolord Yu felt a sense of sorrow and grief in her heart. There had
to be a reason why Emperor Melobo had been able to stay alive for so
long. How much longer would it be before he died?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
look of despair on your face is simply delicious.” Emperor Melobo
continued to slowly walk towards her, extending a hand to gently
stroke her face. Daolord Yu wanted to dodge, but her power had been
completely sealed away; how could she possibly avoid him? A twisted,
excited look appeared on Emperor Melobo’s face, and he began to
open his mouth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Right
at this moment, a foot was suddenly planted right in his face. This
kick was lightning fast, giving him no time to dodge at all. A
muffled boom could be heard as Emperor Melobo was knocked flying
backwards, smashing into the distant dais at the end of the palace.
He bounced off the dais, then smashed into an enormous pillar before
finally falling to the ground. He was bleeding from every orifice,
and his face had been completely wrecked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Who?!”
Emperor Melobo stared forwards in shock and horror.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Who
is this?” Moments ago, Daolord Yu had been gripped by despair. Now,
her eyes lit up as she saw that a white-robed youth who had a black
scabbard on his back had appeared in front of her. Next to him were
four figures. The first was a white-bearded, white-robed old man who
had six curved horns on his head. The second was a wizened old man.
The third was a muscular, white-furred creature. The fourth was a fat
man who was eating some meat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Daolord
Yu didn’t recognize any of the other four, but she instantly
recognized the white-robed youth who had kicked Emperor Melobo.
“Daolord Darknorth!” she cried out in delight. This was the most
legendary Daolord to have ever existed in the Endless Territories.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
turned to glance at her. He recognized her as well. Long ago, when he
had first gone out exploring, he had acquired information on all of
the known Daolords of the Flamedragon Realmverse. He immediately
smiled and said, “Daolord Yu, everything has come to an end. There
will no longer be an Emperor Melobo in this world.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Daolord
Yu immediately understood what this meant. She said with grateful
excitement, “Thank you, Daolord Darknorth.” When she looked at
him, she felt for some unknown reason that his aura truly was
special. In fact, she couldn’t help but begin to feel stirred by
him. She was a female Daolord of the Fourth Step, but she had never
had a Dao-companion in her life. This was her first time meeting
Ning, and she could feel her heart stirring.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“NO!”
The heavily-bleeding Emperor Melobo hurriedly crawled to his feet,
frantically smiling and bowing. “Daolord Darknorth, Hegemon
Brightshore, Hegemon Azurefiend, Flamewing God… I’ve never
offended any of you! Daolord Darknorth, please spare me. I’ll never
dare to enter the Dao Alliance’s territory again. Never again!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Just
now, when Ning had said that there would ‘no longer be an Emperor
Melobo in this world’, Melobo had felt truly terrified. In truth,
Daolord Darknorth’s very appearance had terrified him. Daolord
Darknorth was now an exalted figure who had a Hegemon as his retainer
and a Chaos Primordial as his servant. Even the other Hegemons
dreaded him. Who would dare to antagonize him? There were now two
transcendent figures in the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance. One was
Realmslord Windgrace, the other was this monstrously talented
Daolord, Darknorth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hegemon
Brightshore? Hegemon Azurefiend?” Daolord Yu was stunned. She
didn’t know the secret identity of the Flamewing God, but she was
shocked to hear that there were actually two Hegemons standing before
her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
Hegemon Brightshore chuckled and said, “Don’t waste words on
Melobo. Just go ahead and kill him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
kill me!” Emperor Melobo was on the verge of tears. He was an
ordinary Emperor and didn’t have all that much courage. He begged,
“I’ve never caused trouble for any of you. If there’s something
you want, just tell me, Daolord Darknorth! I’ll definitely obey
you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
said, “Melobo, there’s a reason I didn’t just kill you with
that earlier kick. There’s something I need to tell you first.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Melobo’s
face turned pale. And indeed, Ning was telling the truth. Given his
Hegemonic power, he was easily capable of annihilating Emperor Melobo
with a single kick.</P>

Chapter 28: Daolord Darknorth’s Era</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I-I…”
Emperor Melobo really did begin to cry. Begging was useless. What was
he to do?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning continued, “The reason why I’m going to kill you… is
because of Daolord Allgod.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Allgod?” Emperor Melobo’s already-pale face turned completely
ashen. Of course he remembered that madman! Daolord Allgod had been
willing to pay any price in his efforts to kill Melobo, and he had
nearly succeeded. Emperor Melobo had only been able to escape by the
skin of his teeth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
died! He died long ago! There’s no way you could’ve ever met
him.” Emperor Melobo was panicking.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“True.
I never met him. When I was an Elder God, however, I received a bit
of kindness from him. His formation-spirit bestowed me with a secret
art,” Ning said, “And then expressed the hope that if I ever grew
strong enough, I would help Daolord Allgod exact revenge upon you and
kill you. Although this was nothing more than the dying will of a man
who had already lost himself to despair… since I have benefited
from him, I’m naturally going to help him carry out his wishes.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
reason I’m telling you this is so that you’ll understand that
you… are now dying because of Daolord Allgod,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I-I…”
Emperor Melobo now understood everything, and his mind was in a state
of chaos. Daolord Allgod had once been an extraordinarily talented
figure, and he and his Dao-companion had been like a pair of truly
divine lovers. Alas, Emperor Melobo’s devouring of his
Dao-companion had driven him completely mad. Daolord Allgod had been
filled with resentment and hatred until the day he died, and even
when he died his eyes remained open and filled with rage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Neither
Emperor Melobo nor Allgod ever would’ve imagined that the Allgod
Estate he casually set up before dying would result in an Elder God,
Ji Ning, owing him a debt… and then coming to repay it. Today,
Emperor Melobo would die!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash.
Ning waved his hand, causing a streak of sword-light to appear in the
air. The sword-light was ephemeral and indistinct, hard to see with
the naked eye. It instantly slashed across Emperor Melobo’s body,
and as it did so it spread out alongside the Aeonian’s karma lines.
Everything which had any of his soul or truesoul within it was
completely severed!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Melobo’s gaze grew dim. His soul was shattered, and he perished on
the spot. Now that Ning had reached such incredible heights in the
Dao of Karma, he had learned some new and truly terrifying ways of
killing people.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fine
sword-arts,” Hegemon Brightshore said in praise.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
pity.” Ning glanced at Emperor Melobo’s corpse, then murmured
softly, “Daolord Allgod was a true genius, but he spent most of his
life a madman because of this Aeonian. Not even death was an escape
for him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
Daolord Allgod knew what you did for him, he would feel relieved,”
Hegemon Brightshore said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
he has died and his Dao has vanished. There’s no way for him to
know.” Ning sighed, then turned to leave.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Daolord
Yu continued to stare at Ning, her eyes shining. Ning gently waved a
finger at her, causing a stream of Immortal energy to fly into her
body. It easily undid the seals that were inside of her. Given Ning’s
current level of mastery of the Dao of Formations, unlocking seals
like these was incredibly simple.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
go,” Ning said. Hegemon Brightshore and Hegemon Azurefiend both
glanced at Daolord Yu, and then they followed Ning in stepping into
the void and vanishing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Daolord
Yu stared as Ning vanished before her very eyes. “Daolord
Darknorth… Daolord Darknorth…” she murmured repeatedly. He had
appeared in her hour of need, when she had been gripped by complete
despair. Then, with unbelievable power, he had killed Emperor Melobo
as easily as squishing an ant. All of this had intoxicated her. Even
Hegemon Brightshore and Hegemon Azurefiend, two mighty Hegemons, had
clearly accepted Ning as their leader in this affair.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
power, his voice, his sword-light… all of these things stirred her
heart. However, she also knew that this was nothing more than a bit
of infatuation. “It feels like a dream.” Daolord Yu smiled. A
dream was enough for her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">She
suddenly turned and saw the various treasures which Emperor Melobo
had left behind. A long-lived Emperor like Melobo had many treasures,
but Daolord Darknorth and the others had left without touching them.
Clearly, they had left the treasures for her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“For
me?” Daolord Yu rose to her feet. “Daolord Darknorth left them
behind for me?” She felt a surge of joy in her heart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, Ning had already swept through the Jadefire Realm’s prisons
and possessed an incredible amount of treasures. Emperor Melobo
wasn’t even at the Archon level; how could Ning feel any interest
towards his treasures? Ning didn’t even want to bother going
through them, and the same was doubly true for Azurefiend and
Brightshore.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the Aeonian Kingdom. An avatar was lying within an ancient palace.
This was Emperor Melobo’s avatar. Moments ago, he had been begging
for help. Now, his aura had vanished.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Anchen, Emperor Islehide, and Emperor Duug all stared at his avatar’s
corpse. “It was Daolord Darknorth who did the deed,” Emperor
Islehide said softly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
can we do?” Emperor Duug said helplessly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Nothing
but just stare.” Emperor Anchen laughed bitterly. “We should feel
thankful that Daolord Darknorth has chosen not to cause trouble for
us Aeonians. There’s no way we would ever dare to go find him! All
we can do is hide here in the Aeonian Kingdom and keep ourselves
alive.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
three of them felt quite resigned. Emperor Melobo had begged them for
help, but who were they supposed to beg? It was Daolord Darknorth who
had killed Melobo! Who in the entire Sixteen Realmverses Alliance
would dare stand in his path? Realmslord Windgrace, perhaps… but if
he knew of this matter, he’d probably come help Darknorth out!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
of the Hegemons and Emperors were quite intelligent. By now, they
could all guess that Realmslord Windgrace and the Lonely King, two
truly terrifying figures, were both waiting for the day Daolord
Darknorth failed his Daomerge! Neither of them wished to make an
enemy out of Darknorth at a time like this. If they pressed him too
hard, it would be of no benefit to them but could possibly bring
disaster upon themselves. Nobody could stop a rampaging Flamewing,
after all!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
told them all long ago, given that we aren’t on good terms with
Daolord Darknorth, we Aeonians need to stay low-key during this era,
the era of Daolord Darknorth. Don’t cause trouble!” Emperor
Anchen muttered, “Melobo actually dared to secretly infiltrate the
Dao Alliance. He has no one to blame for his death but himself. Send
word once more to all the elders that they need to be good boys!
Daolord Darknorth isn’t as reasonable as the other major powers,
and there’s no one who can stop him if he attacks.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Agreed.”
All of them understood that so long as Daolord Darknorth was alive,
this era would belong to him. He was the most dazzling figure in all
the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance, and even Realmslord Windgrace would
stand on his side.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
if my visions serves, that female Daolord seems to be a bit smitten
with you.” After leaving the Orchidfall Everworld, Hegemon
Brightshore began to tease Ning a bit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha…”
Ning laughed. “Nothing more than a bit of infatuation. It doesn’t
count for much.” By now, the only person in all the Sixteen
Realmverses Alliance who was on par with Ning in the Dao of Karma was
Emperor Waveshift himself. Ning had naturally been able to discern
Daolord Yu’s interest in him through his mastery of karma. But it
was nothing more than a bit of interest; it wouldn’t have any true
impact on her at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hegemon
Brightshore, next I plan to scour the entire Flamedragon Realmverse
to accept disciples on behalf of my master,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Accept
disciples on behalf of your master?” Hegemon Brightshore was
puzzled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
on behalf of my master, Emperor Mirrorsnow,” Ning said. “I need
to accept ten! Although I’m technically accepting on his behalf,
given that he is adventuring in the outside world I’ll naturally
have to teach them myself.” He would be their senior
apprentice-brother in name, but their teacher in truth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
might be taking on disciples on his behalf, but I still cannot be
casual about this,” Ning said. “I’m planning to divide the
Flamedragon Realmverse into nine ‘regions’, and will pick out ten
World-level cultivators from each region. I’ll then select ten
disciples from those ninety World-level cultivators. If I meet a few
I’m truly interested in, I might even accept them as my own
personal disciple.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Only
after this concluded would he go out adventuring. He would be fully
prepared for the Daomerge by then, and so he would also have to
select a few more heirs in the event of his failure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Three Realms was simply too small of a place. Although he was leaving
his Omega Sword Dao behind in the Three Realms, he had yet to find
anyone he felt truly worthy of passing his technique down to.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
accepting a disciple would be a momentous occasion.” Hegemon
Brightshore grew a bit excited. “Haha, a Daolord who has the power
of a Hegemon… this is truly unprecedented. Your Dao has to be far
stronger than ours! Perhaps I’ll send a few geniuses from the
Brightshore Kingdom to take part as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
fine.” Ning nodded. “Everyone in the Flamedragon Realmverse is
invited, save for the Aeonians.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
didn’t feel any enmity towards the Dark Kingdom. In truth, it
consisted of cultivators who had escaped a destroyed realmverse.
There was no need to truly treat them as enemies. As Ning had grown
more powerful, his view of the universe had changed as well. The only
ones he continued to harbor enmity towards were the Aeonians.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Aeonians
treated cultivators as food. Ning felt a tremendous amount of
distaste towards them. However, since he knew that Autarch Bolin had
been the one to create the Aeonians, Ning elected to simply ignore
them. There was no way he would go accept one of them as his
disciple.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
also told Hegemon Windrain, Hegemon Netherlily, and the Dao Alliance
about his plans to accept disciples on behalf of his master! He
informed them that he would be accepting ten disciples and could
possibly even choose a few personal disciples. However, all
candidates had to be skilled in the sword and be at the World level
of cultivation!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
entire Flamedragon Realmverse was thrown into a state of chaos by
this news. It must be understood that Ning would never casually
transmit his Omega Sword Dao to others; to date, the only one he had
shown it to was Daoist Bluestone. Everyone knew how incredibly
powerful Ning was, and every organization hoped that one of their
geniuses of the Dao of the Sword would have the chance to inherit
Daolord Darknorth’s supreme technique.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">And
so, word of how the Flamedragon Realmverse was being divided into
nine ‘regions’ quickly began to spread. Even many of the
independent cultivators heard of this, and they all began to hasten
towards the region closest to them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
countless World-level cultivators all wished to become apprenticed to
the most peerless Daolord to have ever existed, Daolord Darknorth.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_029__Daom"></A>
Chapter 29: Sword Shack</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
a private room inside Vastheaven Palace. The white-robed Ji Ning was
seated alone. Waving his hand, he caused ten stones to fly towards
him and then hang there in the air before him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Crackle,
crackle, crackle. Ning waved his finger gently, causing flames to
appear around the ten levitating stones and blaze away against them.
The stones slowly began to melt, with runic patterns beginning to
gradually appear on their surfaces. Everything was as Ning willed it,
and so the runic patterns joined together into a complex runic
formation that caused the ten stones to transform into ten black
loops. Ning then picked out a few other precious materials and
infused them into the loops.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had reached incredible heights in both the Dao of Fire and the Dao of
Formations. As a result, creating simple Eternal treasures like these
was incredibly easy for him. As for the materials he used, they were
valuable enough to drive many Eternal Emperors mad with greed… but
to Ning, he had literal mountains of them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Success.”
Ning smiled. All ten bracelets glimmered with golden, silver, and
violet lines that emanated strange ripples of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Top-grade
Eternal treasures. Given the ingredients I put into them, only
Hegemons should be able to destroy them.” Ning then took control
over the ten loops, sending his godsense into one of them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
A space that was ten thousand kilometers in size appeared before him.
These loops were all estate-type treasures! However, they were
limited in size to ‘just’ ten thousand kilometers because they
were exceptionally stable.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
the earth form.” A vast earth began to emerge from the bottom of
the space, quickly covering up all ten thousand kilometers of the
estate-treasure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
the mountains arise!” Soon, a vast mountain range thundered up from
the earth, stretching upwards for nearly ten thousand kilometers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
accordance with Ning’s will, this ten thousand kilometer world
became primarily filled with mountain ranges as well as a few rivers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sword Shack.” Ning’s godsense incarnation waved a finger, causing
an ordinary looking thatched cottage to appear within the largest
mountain valley.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Another
hour went past. By now, Ning’s true body had created a prayer mat
which he put within the Sword Shack. The most valuable item in this
entire estate-treasure was this prayer mat, something which even many
Eternal Emperors would pine for as they cultivated. Cultivators would
find that their hearts and minds would grow very calm as they sat
there, and they would be able to train and meditate much more quickly
than normally. Ning had emulated the Autarch’s stone dais in his
creation of this prayer mat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
he wasn’t even close to the Autarch’s level of insight, his
prayer mats still had roughly 5% of the effectiveness of the Stone
Censor of Reunion; thus, they could be considered rare and valuable
treasures.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
world shall be a world of the Dao of the Sword.” Ning’s godsense
incarnation swept the world with his gaze. Rumble… every single
part of this world, including the mountains and the deep crevices,
all became filled with sword-arts. There were many of them, all of
them varied and complex.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">These
were the various sword-arts which could be discovered once one
researched and dissected Emperor Mirrorsnow’s [Heartseal]
sword-art. By now, Ning had reached a higher level of insight into
the Dao of the Sword than Emperor Mirrorsnow ever had. He had first
dissected all of the many sword-arts which were the underpinnings of
the [Heartseal] sword-art, and then used the [Heartseal] sword-art as
the basis for formulating eight even more profound sword-arts that
were focused in different areas. Ning had now reached a high level of
mastery over karma, giving him even greater powers of deductive
reasoning. Given that he already had the Omega Sword Dao as his
foundation, it was quite simple for him to formulate multiple
Archon-class sword-arts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
Ning merely wished to attempt the Daomerge via a single Supreme Dao,
he would probably find the Daomerge to be much easier. However, his
path was already set. Once it was set, there was no way to go back,
no room for regret.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Besides…
all things were relative. Ning’s path was that of the Omega Sword
Dao. He had seen and experienced many things, and had also created
multiple Archon-class techniques for the Daos of Space, Formations,
Time, Karma, and more. This was why he was able to create so many
Archon-class sword-arts with ease. If he had chosen to embark upon a
simpler path, he would’ve been much more limited in his abilities
and would never have reached his current heights.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sword Shack is perfect for meditation, allowing one to train quite
quickly.” Ning nodded. “Within the world of the Sword Shack,
those who wish to acquire rare and exceptional sword-arts must first
pass a few tests.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.
The Sword Shack will be more than enough to guide them on their
paths.” Ning revealed a smile. Since he had chosen to accept
disciples on behalf of his teacher, he naturally had to give these
‘fellow disciples’ some treasures.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was guaranteed that he wouldn’t have much time to personally teach
them, which was why he had put all this effort into creating the
Sword Shack. This was a treasure that was far more valuable than the
godsense legacy which Emperor Mirrorsnow had provided him when
Mirrorsnow had taken him on as a disciple. Ning had a higher level of
insight into the Dao of the Sword, after all, which meant that he
also had better ways of teaching. He truly did hope that these ten
‘junior apprentice-brothers’ or ‘junior apprentice-sisters’
would be able to surpass what he was able to offer them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
took Ning half a day to create these ten Sword Shack worlds, then
another eighty-plus years creating five more Silver Sword Shacks.
Thanks to his mastery of the Dao of Karma, Ning had the vague feeling
that he would at most take on a maximum of nine disciples.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had previously already taken on Bluecliff Xiaoyu, ‘Green Bamboo’
Yang Quding, and young master Skywind; three disciples in total! If
he factored in the legacy he had left behind after becoming a Daolord
of the Fourth Step, it was guaranteed that he would have a fourth
disciple as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had the feeling that he would at most take on five more disciples.
This time, he would see if there was anyone who interested and
intrigued him enough so that he would take them on as a personal
disciple instead of an honorary disciple on behalf of his master. He
wouldn’t try to force things; it would all be left up to luck and
fate. If he found someone interesting, he would accept them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">These
five Silver Sword Shacks were meant for his personal disciples. Thus,
Ning spent much more effort on them. They were quite similar to the
other sword shacks, but Ning used even more precious ingredients on
the prayer mats, and also put much more effort into the creation of
the formations. Every single one of the prayer mats was almost 20% as
effective as the Stone Censer of Reunion! More importantly, the
Silver Sword Shacks were not centered around Emperor Mirrorsnow’s
[Heartseal] sword-art; rather, they were centered around Ning’s own
[Omega Sword Dao].</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
of course, he couldn’t simply transmit his Dao to them. Rather, he
used many different sword-techniques to serve as guides, and also
left behind imprints of the sword-intent of the five stances of his
Omega Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
have given them all I can give. Even the ten ordinary Sword Shacks
have been filled with all the foundations they need; with those
foundations, they have enough to develop the Omega Sword Dao on their
own if they have the talent.” Ning nodded. He himself had slowly
gained bits and pieces of insights which he had gradually used to
make up for the deficiencies in his foundations, then finally been
tempered into developing his Omega Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
finishing the creation of his gifts, Ning waited for another nine
million years before the grand event which spanned the entire
Flamedragon Realmverse began! Everyone was filled with excitement.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
said that many powerful Daolords of the Fourth Step have come to
watch the competitions. Even if we cannot end up being apprenticed to
Daolord Darknorth, we might be able to become apprenticed to other
powerful Daolords.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
are even some legendary Eternal Emperors and other ancient figures
who have come to watch. They might take the opportunity to accept a
disciple as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
nothing! All three of the almighty Hegemons have come alongside
Daolord Darknorth! To be apprenticed to one of the three Hegemons or
Daolord Darknorth would be truly incredible.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
event was simply on far too vast of a scale. The six major
organizations in the Flamedragon Realmverse were normally in a state
of balance, and so it was impossible for anyone save Ning to cause
the entire realmverse to be thrown into such a state of upheaval.
This sort of tournament and selection process was far grander than
the ones which the Brightshore Kingdom utilized! But of course, there
were many major powers and Emperors who were watching intently,
wanting to take advantage of Ning’s event to perhaps choose a few
genius disciples for themselves.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
nine major regions were each governed by Archon-class major powers as
well as their subordinate Emperors. There was an orderly process that
had been implemented.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
the number of independent cultivators who came was simply enormous.
Thus, the first year was just the pre-selection competition, where
all those who didn’t reach a certain minimum level of power were
washed out. Ning was naturally the one who set the ‘minimum
threshold’, which was simply the ‘supreme World God’ level.
This alone washed out 99% of the cultivators.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Next,
he teleported the remaining elites into the Vastheaven Everworld, to
a place Ning had personally created… the Stairway to Heaven! The
next trial would be the process of ascending the Stairway to Heaven.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Stairway to Heaven was unfathomably high. If you wished to advance
farther along the Stairway to Heaven, you would have to go through
one contest after another. One side had to be killed or surrender
before the other side could advance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Emperors, Hegemons, and Ning all watched intently as the battles in
the Stairway to Heaven proceeded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
kid isn’t bad. I want him.” One of the Eternal Emperors in the
Dao Alliance laughed, then waved a finger gently as he caused a
strand of Eternal power to reach out and evelope the World-level
cultivator who had nearly died just now.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the three Hegemons sat upon the highest thrones, watching from
afar. They didn’t move to interfere. Only Emperors were qualified
to select disciples from those who were on the Stairway to Heaven…
but even then, they could only choose those who had failed! Only Ning
and the three Hegemons were permitted to choose successful
competitors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Interesting.”
Ning’s gaze pierced through the void, coming to a rest atop of two
figures who were walking side-by-side through the titanic Stairway to
Heaven.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
have you taken an interest in those two kids?” Hegemon Brightshore
asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
want to watch for a bit longer and see how they perform. I do quite
like the two of them, though.” Ning revealed a smile, causing
Hegemon Brightshore, Hegemon Netherlily, and Hegemon Windrain to all
laugh. It must be remembered that there were several peerless
geniuses on the Stairway to Heaven who had fused multiple Supreme
Daos together. The two Ning were staring at had each mastered just a
single Supreme Dao.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_030__Daom"></A>
Chapter 30: Fifth Disciple, Sixth Disciple</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
young man and woman were standing side-by-side upon the Stairway to
Heaven. The stairways were incredibly vast and covered with vague
sword-scars. Ji Ning had left them here in order to benefit the
World-level cultivators who were selected to take part in the
tournament. As for how much benefit they would gain from it, that
would be up to their own comprehension abilities.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Absolutely
incredible.” The youth and the maiden were staring upwards at the
sword-scars above the stairs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Boundless,
even the sword-scars which Daolord Darknorth left behind in a casual
manner are filled with unfathomable profundity. Even if we don’t
manage to become apprenticed to him or the other major powers, just
having viewed them here at the Stairway to Heaven means it was all
worth it,” the white-robed maiden said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
youth nodded. Both of them knew their own limits. Although they were
excellent figures in the world at large, here at the Stairway to
Heaven they were ranked close to the bottom. However, as they
ascended the Stairway to Heaven and viewed more and more of the
sword-scars they were beginning to skyrocket in power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
the controller of the Stairway to Heaven, Ning made sure that they
weren’t given ridiculously powerful opponents. Only the weakest
would be washed out, while the strongest would be able to walk
farther and farther. Ning wanted to make sure that the strongest
wouldn’t run into each other and then be washed out early.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
passed on, one year after another. The World-level cultivators all
moved quite slowly up the Stairway to Heaven, as all of them wished
to meditate on the mysteries hidden within the sword-scars. Each
battle meant that they might lose and be forced to leave, and so they
were all quite slow and cautious.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ten
thousand years had passed since their arrival at the Stairway to
Heaven.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Boundless,
you’ve now mastered two Supreme Daos? You were faster than me!”
the maiden said jubilantly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Muse,
you were one step ahead of me in mastering the first Supreme Dao.”
The youth smiled as he looked at the maiden. Everyone could easily
tell how deeply they loved each other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
two had arisen together step-by-step from the mortal world. The
maiden had once been young master Boundless’ maidservant, and she
had been given the name of ‘Muse’. Muse had been born with an
incredible soul-physique and had been selected and taken away by an
Immortal to a so-called ‘Immortal Realm’. As for young master
Boundless, he continued to struggle his way through the mortal world,
eventually clambering into the path of Immortal cultivation as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
countless battles and tempering experiences, he managed to dazzle
everyone as he ascended into the Immortal realm, where he finally met
his former maidservant ‘Muse’ once more. The two even had a child
together! Eventually, the two ascended to the World-level almost
simultaneously, and to this very day they were the only World-level
cultivators their homeland had ever produced.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Muse
was a Chaos Immortal, while young master Boundless was a dual
refiner; both a Ki Refiner and a Fiendgod Body Refiner. As a result,
both had Primaltwins which they had left behind in their homelands.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
were a pair of divine lovers, and together they departed from their
homeland to wander the Chaosverse, encountering quite a few
fortuitous events in the process. The story of how the legendary
Daolord Darknorth was going to accept disciples on behalf of his
master was an earth-shattering piece of news, resulting in them
deciding to take part as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
admit defeat!” Muse’s sword-formation had been overcome by her
opponent. She knew that she no longer had any chance, and so she
immediately and voluntarily admitted defeat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
the battle. “Boundless, I lost. Be careful as you proceed up the
Stairway. If you are unable to win, just admit defeat.” Muse could
sense how the Stairway to Heaven was becoming increasingly difficult,
and so she wanted to admonish her Dao-companion.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
know.” Boundless nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Half
a month later, Boundless and Muse reunited at the base of the
Stairway. “He was just too powerful. Not only was he an Ancient
cultivator, he had even reached a higher level of comprehension than
I did. I was thoroughly convinced by my defeat.” Boundless shook
his head, then said helplessly, “I thought that the two of us could
be considered quite talented and would attract some attention from
one of the major powers watching, or perhaps a Daolord of the Fourth
Step… but who would’ve thought that not a single one would reach
out to us?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
waited for half a month at the base of the Stairway without anyone
coming to meet me either.” Muse nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Both
were proud and talented figures, the only World-level cultivators
their homeland had ever produced. They had benefited greatly from
this experience, but in the end no major powers had come to take them
on as disciples.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
wait for a while longer. Perhaps there will be a Daolord who takes
interest in us,” Boundless said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright,
let’s wait.” Muse held onto hope as well. Having a good master
could make all the difference in the world. Neither Boundless nor
Muse had received any guidance from a Daolord, and thus they knew
almost nothing at all about the Endless Territories as a whole.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hey
there, kids.” A voice suddenly rang out. Boundless and Muse both
turned to look, rather excited and eager. Had a major power just
chosen them? Who was it? Was it a Daolord of the Fourth Step, or
perhaps even an Eternal Emperor? Or could it be a Hegemon… or
perhaps even Daolord Darknorth? Although they knew rationally that it
was unlikely someone particularly powerful had chosen them, they
still clung onto their hopes and dreams.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
saw a white-robed youth walking towards them from afar. His aura was
quite unique, and he didn’t give them any sense of pressure at all.
He seemed quite… ordinary.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
Daolord?” Both Boundless and Muse felt rather disappointed. It was
still fairly easy to distinguish a Daolord’s aura from an Eternal
Emperor’s aura. Every single Eternal Emperor emanated an aura that
had the scent of ‘eternity’ about it, an aura that whispered that
time had no hold over this person.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Moments
later, they quickly regained their usual calm. They were still quite
pleased, to tell the truth; perhaps the Daolords who chose disciples
here were the weakest masters available, but at least the two of them
had been chosen! If no one had chosen them at all, they really
would’ve felt saddened.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
two have superb comprehension of the sword,” Ning congratulated
with a smile. Indeed, they were quite impressive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
far as growth went, Boundless and Muse could actually be ranked in
the top ten amongst the World-level cultivators who had come here and
learned from the sword-scars. It must be remembered that he knew that
the other powers would also be interested in taking on disciples,
which was why he had merely required all of the World-level
cultivators be ‘skilled in the sword’, rather than exclusively
focus on the Dao of the Sword. Thus, there were (for example) some
incredibly talented figures who were skilled in swordplay, but whose
true forte lay in the Dao of Spacetime, in the Dao of the Saber, or
even heartforce!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Of
those who focused on the Dao of the Sword, Muse and Boundless had
grown and improved faster than everyone else. Ning was able to tell
at a glance that the two hadn’t received the proper tutelage, which
was why they had improved at such a rapid pace. When Ning saw them,
he felt like he saw the mirror images of himself when he had first
left the Three Realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was only after Ning had joined the Twelve Palaces of Brightshore that
he developed a Supreme Dao, and it wasn’t until he had entered the
alternate universe that he had mastered fused Supreme Daos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
addition, Boundless and Muse were so close to each other that Ning
couldn’t help but think back to the feelings he and Yu Wei had
shared for each other. “What a pity,” Ning sighed to himself. If
she was still alive, perhaps the two of them could adventure the
Chaosverse together, just like Boundless and Muse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Are
the two of you willing to enter my tutelage?” Ning asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Senior,
are you skilled in the Dao of the Sword?” Muse asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. As he did so, he caused a terrifyingly powerful aura of
sword-intent to emanate from his body, an aura so strong that both
Boundless and Muse felt their hearts quiver. However, they didn’t
truly understand what this aura entailed. They were merely a pair of
inexperienced World-level cultivators, after all; in their eyes, all
Daolords of the Fourth Step were terrifyingly powerful. They only
felt that Ning was terrifyingly strong, capable of wiping them out
with just a fraction of his might.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boundless
and Muse exchanged a glance, then immediately knelt down: “Your
disciples greet you, Master.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Mm.”
Ning nodded. “Follow me, then.” An invisible dimensional ripple
swept across the two of them. Ning took a single step forwards,
shuttling through spacetime and arriving back at the place where the
Hegemons and the Emperors were all gathered together.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Congratulations,
Daolord Darknorth, on having accepted some fine disciples.” The
Hegemons and Emperors were all laughing and congratulating Ning as
they glanced at the two young fellows standing behind them. They
couldn’t help but secretly sigh at how incredibly lucky those two
young fellows were! Instead of choosing more powerful cultivators,
Ning had actually ended up choosing this pair of Dao-companions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
returned to sit in the lotus position atop his cloud, with Hegemon
Netherlily, Hegemon Windrain, and Hegemon Brightshore by his side.
The four of them were seated the highest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“B-but…”
Boundless and Muse continued to stand behind Ning. They stared at the
three awesome Hegemons next to them, then at the many Eternal
Emperors below them. Every single person here emanated an aura of
eternity. Even the most foolish of World-level cultivators would
immediately understand that the many major powers standing
subserviently before them were all Eternal Emperors… and so,
Boundless and Muse instantly understood that they had just become
apprenticed to the legendary Daolord Darknorth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“W-we…”
Boundless and Muse exchanged a glance. Both felt rather light-headed.
The auras of the Hegemons and the many Eternal Emperors present were
simply too oppressive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,”
Boundless whispered softly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“From
this day forth, you shall be the fifth and sixth disciples under my
tutelage,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boundless
and Muse instantly felt excited. Boundless asked, “Master, I heard
you are taking on ten disciples in total?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No.
Misinformation certainly spreads quickly.” Ning shook his head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
of you young fellows have been spreading all sorts of wild rumors
around.” Hegemon Brightshore laughed merrily, “For this event,
Darknorth is accepting disciples on behalf of his own teacher, which
means those ten are technically just his junior apprentice brothers
and sisters who he will teach in his teacher’s stead. As for the
two of you? You are Daolord Darknorth’s personal disciples.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boundless
and Muse turned to stare at the white-robed, white-haired old man
next to them. They felt a sense of closeness and warmth radiating
from him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
how many disciples do you plan on selecting?” Brightshore asked.
“If you are done picking, I’m going to start.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
done.” Ning nodded. “I’ll only choose these two from this
event. I’ll pick ten junior apprentice-brothers and sisters at the
very end.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
quite a few geniuses had taken part in this event, the only ones who
had truly moved and intrigued Ning were Boundless and Muse. He felt
as though he saw himself and Yu Wei in them, and so he had taken them
on as his disciples! At Ning’s level, taking on a disciple was more
a matter of personal feelings than anything else. For example, his
second disciple ‘Green Bamboo’ Yang Quding had been nothing more
than an ordinary mortal.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
didn’t keep his words private at all, allowing everyone to hear
them. All the Emperors below him turned to stare towards Boundless
and Muse with changed looks in their eyes. These two lucky kids! They
don’t even know how lucky they are. Their master was someone who no
one in all the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance would dare to offend, a
peerless Daolord who caused even Hegemons to feel dread. He had set
up this great tournament which covered the entire Flamedragon
Realmverse… and in the end, the only two disciples he had chosen
were the two of them.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_031__Daom"></A>
Chapter 31: A Distant Journey</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Finally,
this great Flamedragon Realmverse event came to an end. The Hegemons
and Emperors all departed one by one, with the Vastheaven Everworld
regaining its usual calm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
Vastheaven Palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Greetings
to you, senior apprentice-brother Darknorth.” Ten World-level
cultivators were present. There were youths, elders, aliens, Aberrant
special lifeforms, and even an Ancient cultivator. They all bowed
respectfully, their gazes filled with unabashed excitement. They had
finally been selected! It must be remembered that there were some
geniuses who took part in this competition that were just as talented
as them. A few were even more talented!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“From
this day forth, you are now honorary disciples of Emperor
Mirrorsnow,” Ning said. “Our master, Emperor Mirrorsnow, has long
ago departed from the Flamedragon Realmverse and gone off
adventuring, which is why I shall teach you in his stead. However, in
the end cultivation must come from the self. Thus, I will only
provide each of you with ten sessions of individualized guidance.
After the ten sessions are over, I will not provide you with any
further guidance until you become Daolords. Understood?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”
Although these World-level cultivators were all secretly surprised,
they remained quite calm. They were all geniuses and all quite proud.
They usually weren’t all that impressed by most major powers, but
they were filled with almost fanatical devotion towards Daolord
Darknorth. This was why they had striven so hard to become
apprenticed to him. It certainly wasn’t because of ‘Emperor
Mirrorsnow’! Not even the chance to become Emperor Mirrorsnow’s
personal disciples, rather than just honorary disciples, was nearly
as attractive as the chance to have Daolord Darknorth personally
instruct them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ten
sessions? They felt certain that there was a reason why Daolord
Darknorth had said this!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Good.”
Ning smiled upon seeing their reactions. “The ten of you are all
extremely talented in the Dao of the Sword. Three of you have fused
Supreme Daos together, while the other seven have all mastered
multiple individual Supreme Daos. All I really need to do is provide
you with some guidance. In the end, it will be up to you to walk the
path between life and death as you become Samsara Daolords.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Disciples
weren’t necessarily capable of learning everything a teacher had to
offer; in life, you had to make do with what materials you had to
work with. Every single Samsara Daolord had to find his or her own
Dao. Ning felt that it would be quite incredible if even a single one
of his personal disciples or ‘junior apprentice-brothers’ and
‘junior apprentice-sisters’ ended up embarking on the path of an
Omega Dao. The far more likely result would be that none of them
would find that path.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Omega Dao simply couldn’t be taught. You had to go find it on your
own! As a wise teacher, Ning knew that all he could do was guide them
on their paths. Fortunately for them, Ning’s own path was that of
the Omega Sword Dao. His Dao was like a tall, sturdily-built house,
and his guidance was the best guidance possible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is the world of the Sword Shack.” Ning waved his hand, causing ten
black loops that glowed with runic lines to fly towards the ten.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sword Shack is filled with countless sword-arts. Aside from the
[Heartseal] sword-art of our master, Emperor Mirrorsnow, it also
includes all foundations for the Dao of the Sword,” Ning said. In
other words… it contained the foundations for his own Omega Dao.
This was why he dared to make the claim that it contained ‘all
foundations for the Dao of the Sword’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
can train in seclusion within the Sword Shack, but you must be
tempered via adventuring through the outside world. Perhaps you will
then be able to understand and find a path which truly belongs to
you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you, senior apprentice-brother.” The ten disciples were all
delighted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
are the only ones permitted inside the Sword Shack. If anyone else
tries to bind it, the estate-world inside will be automatically
destroyed,” Ning said. “Thus, you must not give it to anyone
else.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”
Many of the ten mused that only a fool would give something like this
to another!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
waved his hand again, causing a number of Dao-seals to fly out
towards the ten as well. “These are Dao-seals which I personally
forged. Some involve the Dao of the Sword, some involve the Dao of
Space, some involve the Dao of Time, some involve heartforce, some
involve the Dao of Karma… each of you shall have nine seals total,
and they come in varying levels of power. Some are meant for escape,
some are meant to kill foes, and some are used to scout and explore.
Just three of them can be used to attack foes head-on,” Ning said.
“When you go out adventuring, you must be careful and also conserve
your Dao-seals. If you use them all up, I’m not going to just
remake them for you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">These
ten disciples were all overjoyed, but they also felt stunned. Daolord
Darknorth had personally forged them? Forging Dao-seals was fairly
easy, and many major powers were capable of it, but the cost was
quite high as only valuable materials could be used to store such
incredible levels of power. And… more importantly, the creator of
the Dao-seal had to understand the Daos he was infusing into each
seal.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
other words… if their senior apprentice-brother Darknorth created
that many Dao-seals for them, he must have reached inconceivable
heights in the Dao of the Sword, the Dao of Space, the Dao of Time,
the Dao of Karma, and multiple other Daos!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Here
are a hundred million cubes of chaos nectar for each of you.” Ning
waved his hand, causing a few more storage-type treasures to fly out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Here
are some top-grade Eternal swords which have been made in accordance
with your own specific insights into the Dao of the Sword. Each of
you can have six.” Ning waved his hand again, causing a total of
sixty swords to fly out towards the ten.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Top-grade
Eternal treasures? Ning had a literal mountain of these things. In
truth, every single Hegemon had piles and piles of top-grade Eternal
treasures. Ning was far wealthier than most Hegemons. Not only had he
blackmailed multiple Hegemons and killed Hegemon Winterflame, he had
also accumulated a terrifying amount of treasure when he had swept
through the Jadefire Realm. He had a total of six Universe treasures!
Alas, none of them were swords.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
already given you everything I can and should. Sword-arts, divine
abilities, secret arts… you’ll find them all within the Sword
Shack,” Ning said. “If you want to earn them, go into the Sword
Shack and fight for them. Go now. I’ve already set up estates for
you within Vastheaven Palace. Calm your minds and train hard. You can
come find me if you have any questions… but remember, each of you
will only have ten opportunities!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”
The ten fellow disciples all departed excitedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
an absolute fortune.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Each
of us was given a hundred million cubes!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Perhaps
ordinary Daolords of the Fourth Step might feel pain at giving away a
billion cubes of chaos nectar, but senior apprentice-brother treats
Hegemons as equals. He’s able to toss out such sums without batting
an eye.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ah!
The Sword Shack has a prayer mat inside. When my Primaltwin sat down
upon it, its cultivation speed increased dramatically. This thing is
far more valuable than the cubes of chaos nectar!” While journeying
towards their estates, these ten ‘fellow disciples’ began to
discover how marvelous the prayer mat was. All of them were stunned
by it. There were many Eternal Emperors who would be envious of such
a treasure!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Most
of the treasures which Ning had prepared for his fifth disciple
Boundless and his sixth disciple Muse were on par with what the other
ten had been given. The only difference lay in the Sword Shack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Before
you become Samsara Daolords, the two of you shall also have ten
chances to come ask me for instruction,” Ning said. “Therefore,
you should train hard within the Sword Shack. Do your best to resolve
your questions on your own. If you find that you can make no progress
at all, come find me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”
Boundless and Muse were incredibly respectful.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
can go now,” Ning instructed, and the two immediately departed
obediently.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Upon
seeing everyone finally leave, the nearby Hegemon Azurefiend finally
spoke up: “Darknorth, don’t you think you are just a bit too
casual when it comes to teaching your students?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
can guide them, but providing them with overly detailed tutelage will
actually constrain their growth,” Ning said. “It’ll be far more
helpful for them if they can find answers to their questions on their
own, rather than come to me for everything. Besides… the ‘Sword
Shack’ I created for them can be viewed as half a teacher as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
might be overestimating your disciples a bit. Most of them have
merely devised multiple Supreme Daos and have yet to even fuse them
together. Not everyone is as freakishly talented as you, you know.”
Azurefiend shook his head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Well…
if they just can’t progress, then they can live in mediocrity.”
Ning smiled. By its very nature, the Dao of the Sword required one to
advance without looking back and to act in accordance with one’s
own nature. How could one possibly become a major power if someone
was always yammering at him about what he should do? Even though he
was their teacher, he couldn’t interfere too much in their choices.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Besides…
the more famous a teacher was, the greater his influence would be on
his students. He had to be careful, and he couldn’t provide them
with excessive guidance. If he did, he might end up causing his
students to depart from the path which actually suited them the most.
The path which was best for Ning wasn’t necessarily the path which
was best for his students.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However…
just letting them roam freely wasn’t an option either. This was why
Ning had chosen to create the Sword Shack, which he had infused with
the foundations of virtually all paths one could take in the Dao of
the Sword. He would let his disciples choose the path which suited
them the most.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
it looked as though Ning was acting in a casual fashion, in reality
he had put a lot of effort and consideration into how he was going to
teach the disciples he had chosen. This was true for both his
personal disciples and the disciples he had chosen on behalf of
Emperor Mirrorsnow. Yes, he was technically just their ‘senior
apprentice-brother’, but in reality he was like their master. This
was why Ning had worked so hard to create all those different types
of Dao-seals for them, which would be enough to allow them to deal
with all sorts of strange predicaments. They were more than enough
for the types of adventures which World-level cultivators would get
into.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
having accepted all these disciples, Ning led Flamewing, Azurefiend,
and Whitethaw in departing from the Flamedragon Realmverse once more.
This time, they were going to go on a very distant journey to a place
outside the demesnes of the Sixteen Realmverses Alliance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for his disciples? Ning’s avatar would be permanently stationed at
Vastheaven Palace and would keep an eye on everything which happened
in Flamedragon Realmverse. Thus, it could also teach and guide the
disciples.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The realmship continued its advance through the endless Great Dark.
Inside the realmship, Azurefiend and Flamewing were gorging on a
veritable sea of food, while Whitethaw quietly stood guard over Ning.
Ning, in turn, was pondering while holding onto a jade slip.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Realmslord
Windgrace had given him this slip, and it included all the
information he had acquired regarding the dangerous place he was
about to visit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Icewind Sea?” Ning mused silently. The Icewind Sea was a place
which Realmslord Windgrace and his peers had scouted out in the past,
and they were the ones who had chosen this name.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Icewind Sea could be described in one word – cold! However, it was
a place which gave birth to quite a few fire-aligned treasures, with
the Daomerge Firecloud Flower being one of them. This was also the
treasure which Ning valued the most highly.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_032__Daom"></A>
Chapter 32: Icewind Sea</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Realmslord
Windgrace and his peers have ventured inside the Icewind Sea in the
past, and they encountered a Sourcewalker who was at the Otherverse
Lord level of power when they were there.” Ji Ning nodded. “Within
the realms of what we can handle. Although he’s beyond myself and
Azurefiend, so long as we have Flamewing with us we can deal with him
with ease. However, this Sourcewalker has lived within the Icewind
Sea and is able to make use of its local environs. It’ll be quite
difficult to deal with.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
have to be careful. If we let it catch us offguard and ambush us,
both I and Azurefiend will both be at risk of dying,” Ning mused.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
realmship warped through spacetime for over half a million years
before finally reaching the distant ‘Icewind Sea’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
beautiful.” Ning, Azurefiend, Whitethaw, and Flamewing stood within
the realmship, staring in amazement at the beautiful scenes outside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
endless Great Dark should be filled with nothing but darkness. It was
an empty, lonely place without even a hint of light… but now, an
enormous silvery-white vortex-world had appeared before them. A
fierce, icy gale was howling throughout the region, forming an icy
maelstrom of absolutely inconceivable size around it. Although Ning’s
group was able to see it with the naked eye, they were actually still
extremely far away from it. This vortex had to be comparable in size
to an entire territory!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Icewind Sea,” Ning murmured softly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
an enormous sea of cold energy. I feel as though endless amounts of
freezing energy have gathered around this area,”Azurefiend said
with an amazed sigh. “Although I’ve visited many realmverses and
seen quite a few dangerous places, this truly is my first time seeing
such an enormous conglomeration of cold energy.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
concurred, “Normal realmverses are filled with lightning, wind,
light, darkness, and all types of other energy. That’s why life is
able to flourish and take root! In addition, the various streams of
energy will be fairly docile and not too agitated… but the cold
energy here has spread out to cover an entire territory in size! We
could take all of the cold energy out of the Flamedragon Realmverse
and put it here, and it still wouldn’t be as dense as this.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Weaker
Eternal Emperors would probably be frozen to death,” Azurefiend
said with a laugh. “That’s why this place, filled with such
freezing might, is capable of giving birth to so many inconceivable
treasures. Realmverses are quite plain and ordinary by comparison,
which means they are unable to give birth to truly remarkable
treasures.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
don’t like this place,” the nearby Flamewing muttered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ll
leave right after I harvest the Daomerge Firecloud Flower,” Ning
consoled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The realmship began to engage in short-distance warps. It soon
arrived at the borders to the Icewind Sea.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slash.
Slash. Slash. The furious wind howled against the realmship, striking
against it as though it was formed from icy knives. The realmship was
in peak condition and thus was able to endure the attacks with ease,
but its flight path became slightly twisted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
wind is far too powerful,” Azurefiend muttered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
learned long ago from this jade slip that we must pass through this
tempest layer if we wish to reach the continent inside the Icewind
Sea,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Icewind Sea was called a ‘sea’ but it wasn’t an actual sea. It
was actually an absolutely enormous iceberg which naturally attracted
all of the surrounding cold energy of the Chaosverse in an extremely
large area. This was why such a terrifying vortex had appeared around
it. This terrifying vortex was capable of killing even weaker Eternal
Emperors. This sort of extreme environment was highly inhospitable
for ordinary lifeforms to enter or live in.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Only
Hegemons and Otherverse Lords and other major powers on or above
their level would dare to enter a place like this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
was no way to teleport through spacetime within the tempest layer.
The only option was to slowly fly through it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Under
Ning’s control, the realmship slowly stabilized as it followed the
wind inwards. Given Ning’s mastery over the Dao of Wind and the Dao
of Lightning, the realmship was able to maintain its incredible
speeds as it pressed onwards. Alas, the tempest layer was simply so
vast that flying through it would take time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
flew at top speed for over ninety thousand years.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Look!
There’s a planet up ahead,” Azurefiend called out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
planet?” Flamewing turned to look, then smirked. “That’s not a
planet, that’s just a hunk of ice.” Indeed, it was a piece of ice
that was billions of kilometers in diameter which was flying through
the tempest layer at high speeds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
move over and take a look. According to Realmslord Windgrace’s
records, these planet-sized hunks of ice all broke free from the main
Windsea ‘continent’ and often have marvelous treasures hidden
within them.” Ning smiled. “If we’re lucky, we might even find
a Daomerge Firecloud Fruit.” Ning and the others were quite
patient; even if they spent a few dozen chaos cycles hunting for the
Daomerge Firecloud Fruit, it would be fine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
as the realmship drew closer, a wave of chaotic force suddenly swept
across the realmship, causing it to tremble. It took Ning nearly an
hour before they were finally able to successfully land on the ice
‘planet’.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
ice planet had its own gravitational field which repelled the tempest
outside of it. As a result, things were quite calm on the surface of
the planet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Whew.
We finally made it out.” Azurefiend flew out, rather excited. Ning
put away the realmship and then descended as well. This was a world
of nothing but ice; even the ‘ground’ was solid ice!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
ice…?” Ning made a casual grabbing motion towards the ground,
causing a claw-shadow to sweep out against the icy ground. He wanted
to forcibly tear out a chunk of it, but the only result was a
clacking sound as a few scratches appeared on the ice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
that tough?” Ning was rather amazed. It looked as though he would
have to put some real effort into it. He waved a finger, causing a
streak of sword-light to fly out and carve a large hole in the
ground, digging out a large chunk of ice. The ice then flew straight
towards Ning, who reached out to touch it. He could sense the
terrifying cold within the ice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
couldn’t help but feel speechless. This was far colder than some of
the famous types of mystic ice which existed in the Flamedragon
Realmverse, and it was far tougher as well. His claw-strike had
failed to pull anything out of it. In the end, he had been forced to
exert 50% of his full power to carve this piece out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Azurefiend’s
voice suddenly rang out from off in the distance: “What the hell
type of ice is this? It’s incredibly tough! I’m a freaking
Hegemon, but I wasn’t able to break it apart by stomping on it!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
ice is everywhere. Don’t worry about it for now. Hurry up and
search this place. Let’s see if we can find any treasures,” Ning
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
Master,” Whitethaw said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
go search as well.” Flamewing returned to his usual form, excitedly
spreading his wings and then flying into the air. It had been quite
some time since he had flown about in such a manner.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for Ning, he began to search this place using his powers over
spacetime. Godsense was of no use; every part of the Icewind Sea was
filled with such an overwhelming aura of limitless cold that even
godsense was suppressed, making it impossible for him to search too
far with it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning scanned the area, his gaze seeing past space and time as he
scoured the place. “That’s a lot of treasure.” Ning quickly
found certain treasures which lay within some fairly well-hidden
places.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
saw a completely crystalline-looking tree of ice, a warm jewel, a
fiery-red clump of grass, and more. Ning was able to name some of
them, but most were completely foreign to him. All of them were
clearly quite valuable. However, Ning was so incredibly wealthy by
now that he didn’t really care about these treasures. Most likely,
all of the treasures he had discovered would be at most compared to
the networth of an ordinary Eternal Emperor. Still… this was a
testament to what an incredible place the Icewind Sea was and how
many treasures it held!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
this was a place so dangerous that even someone like Realmslord
Windgrace would only enter after calling a few friends to help out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master!
Master!” Flamewing let out an excited cry, his voice forcibly
tearing through the suppressive effect of the terrifying aura of
cold. Ning was able to hear him clearly from afar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flamewing,
what happened?!” Ning immediately moved, transforming into a streak
of light as he flew straight towards Flamewing. Flamewing was
standing within an icy gorge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
take a look! Do you see that?” Flamewing was rather excited, and he
flapped his wing a few times as he pointed towards the front.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
hurriedly looked, only to see a series of long slender green leaves
that were each three meters long. They were all growing slanted
alongside the distant, icy-jade walls of the gorge. There had to be
hundreds of those leaves, and there was a fruit at the very center of
them. This fruit was completely azure in color, and it emanated a
particularly pungent smell.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Incense
Spirit-Fruit?” Ning was rather amazed. This fruit was the
second-ranked Daomerge treasure, but it clearly wasn’t ripe yet.
Fully ripened Incense Spirit-Fruit was flecked with red and would
emanate an absolutely alluring aroma which would cause even Hegemons
to drool. For many major powers, Incense Spirit-Fruit was primarily
considered a delicacy to be eaten. How many Daolords could possibly
procure such a treasure, after all?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
the Icewind Sea has Incense Spirit-Fruit within it?” Ning was very
surprised. When Realmslord Windgrace had come here, he hadn’t found
any Incense Spirit-Fruit. However, the Icewind Sea was a very large
place; there had to be many places here which the Realmslord had yet
to visit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha.”
Hegemon Azurefiend flew over as well. He stared at the Incense
Spirit-Fruit, then laughed, “Darknorth, your luck isn’t bad.
We’ve just entered the Icewind Sea and haven’t even landed on the
main continent, and you’ve already discovered some Incense
Spirit-Fruit on an iceberg planet floating at the very outskirts.
Given your crazy luck, you will probably be able to find the Daomerge
Cloudfire Flower after all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Right.”
Ning nodded. Judging from the information Realmslord Windgrace had
provided, Incense Spirit-Fruit would probably be of very limited use
to him. However, it was still far more valuable than a Voidsea
Jadeseal and still could be considered a valuable treasure.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_033__Daom"></A>
Chapter 33: Descending Upon the Continent</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
an hour, Ji Ning and his team had finished fully scouting out this
ice planet. They didn’t find any Daomerge Firecloud Flowers, while
they only found a single Incense Spirit-Fruit. They did find quite a
number of other marvelous items.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
was nothing?” The Flamewing God continued to fly about the skies
like a streak of light, unwilling to admit defeat as he continued the
search.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Forget
it, Flamewing. This ice planet was nothing more than a tiny fragment
of the Icewind Sea continent. We should feel lucky that we even found
a single Incense Spirit-Fruit,” Ning called out loudly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Flamewing descended and transformed into human form. He stared at the
floating azure fruit before them, then muttered, “It isn’t even
ripe yet. I wonder how long it would take for it to fully ripen.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Judging
from the looks of it, it’ll take roughly ten thousand chaos cycles
to fully ripen,” Ning estimated with a smile. “But that’s
simple.” Ning stepped forward to set up a formation around the
spirit-fruit, causing spacetime to accelerate. As time began to speed
up around the spirit-fruit, it began to absorb increasingly greater
amounts of energy from the surrounding area.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
couldn’t just harvest it right away, as fruits like this could only
develop in highly specific environments! Even if Ning moved it over
to another part of the Icewind Sea, he still might not be able to
ensure its survival.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
accelerate time around it by a rate of 3000x. If I increase it any
further, the rate of energy absorption will destroy the entire frozen
gorge,” Ning said. Powerful cultivators were living beings, making
it extremely difficult to accelerate time for them. The Incense
Spirit-Fruit, however, was just a type of unique vegetable. Given
Ning’s mastery over the Dao of Time and the Dao of Formations, he
would be able to easily accelerate time by even a rate of
10,000,000x. Slowing down time wasn’t too hard either. His main
worry was that if he accelerated time too fast, the environment
wouldn’t be able to provide the Incense Spirit-Fruit with enough
energy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thankfully,
the Incense Spirit-Fruit will maintain its potency indefinitely after
ripening.” Ning shook his head. “If it was like the Daomerge
Firecloud Flower, which must be used within a thousand years after it
ripens, it would be a pain to deal with.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Daomerge Firecloud Flower has a far more powerful effect. Of course
it also comes with more stringent requirements,” Azurefiend said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
scanned the area one final time, then said: “Let’s go. If we have
enough time, we can come back after a few chaos cycles.” Ning and
the others boarded the realmship, then departed from this ice planet
and entered the tempest once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Because
Ning had personally set up a formation on the planet, he was able to
sense its location even as they flew farther and farther away from
the ice planet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whooooosh.
A wild wind howled ravenously through the void, causing even Ning and
the others to have a limited field of vision. All of them were
staring at the outside, but there was nothing but a haze blocking
their sight.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Still,
judging from how powerful the infinitely cold aura radiating from the
icy sea of energy was in each direction, they were able to sense the
general direction of the main continent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
flowed on, one year at a time. The realmship continued to fly
forwards at maximum speed, while Ning and his team remained within
the warm interior, eating and drinking. Ning and Azurefiend often
discussed the Dao with each other. Ning’s advantage was that he was
skilled in many Daos, while Azurefiend was a Hegemon. They
occasionally gained insights from their discussions with each other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
spent over 150,000,000 years slowly flying through the tempest.
During this time, they only encountered one additional ice planet.
Alas, this one didn’t have any treasures which intrigued Ning at
all, and the total value of the materials they found on it was
perhaps at most comparable to an Archon’s networth. Ning naturally
didn’t care at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Here
we are.” Ning revealed a smile as he rose to his feet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ve
made it already?” Flamewing, Azurefiend, and Whitethaw all looked
towards the outside, only to see an utterly vast iceworld that was a
bit hard to make out due to the storm. This was a world that was
unfathomably vaster than the two planet-sized pieces of ice they had
encountered previously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Starting
from today, all of us must be careful. Especially you, Flamewing;
don’t cause any trouble!” Ning instructed. “The Icewind Sea is
quite massive; so long as we remain cautious, we might be able to
avoid detection by Sourcewalkers.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
have we to fear?” Flamewing was unhappy. “Master, based on what
Realmslord Windgrace told us, the Sourcewalkers of the Icewind Sea
are at most comparable to Otherverse Lords in power. I can beat the
crap out of any of them!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Obey
my commands.” Ning frowned. He was afraid of Flamewing causing
trouble. Azurefiend was a Hegemon; he would definitely be extremely
cautious in such a terrifying place as the Icewind Sea. The Protector
Whitethaw went without saying; he would obey all orders
unquestioningly. Flamewing, however… Ning might have tamed him, but
he was still like a child. He might just go crazy and start causing
chaos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Flamewing
lowered his head and started to mumble to itself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sourcewalkers might be a bit weaker than you, but they’ve lived in
the Icewind Sea for an extremely long period of time and understand
it much better than us. They might use the local environment against
us. If Azurefiend and I aren’t careful, they might end up ambushing
and killing us before you can do anything,” Ning explained.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ll
make sure to protect you and keep you safe, Master,” Flamewing said
hurriedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Also
keep in mind that Realmslord Windgrace and the others only explored a
small part of the Icewind Sea. There might be other unknown dangers
here,” Ning said seriously. “That’s why you have to obey my
orders.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Oh.”
When Flamewing saw the serious look on Ning’s face, he nodded
obediently. “I’ll do exactly what you tell me to do. If you tell
me to fly, I definitely won’t walk on the ground. If you tell me to
walk on the ground, I definitely won’t fly.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
secretly let out a sigh of relief. Without Flamewing, he and
Azurefiend would never dare to enter a place like the Icewind Sea.
That’s why he had to make sure that Flamewing obeyed all of his
orders; if they weren’t careful, they could very well die.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Come,
let’s keep going,” Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Icewind Sea!” Azurefiend was quite excited as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">By
now, the realmship had already landed upon the infinitely vast
continent of ice. Ning and the other three flew out, then scanned
their surroundings.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
far as they could see, the vast icy world around them seemed quiet
and calm. However, a few vortexes rising into the skies could
occasionally be seen. Given their ocular prowess, they were able to
see to a distance of a trillion kilometers. Even there, they saw over
ten thousand vortexes spiraling into the skies and merging into the
tempest layer above.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Scout
the area out and find all treasures that are hidden here. Remember,
stay close to each other and don’t run around,” Ning said. The
four began to scout the place carefully by themselves…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
vast continent of ice had gorges, canyons, mountains, and more.
However, everything was completely made out of ice!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
ice continent was almost as large as an entire territory in size. As
a result, it had its own systemized ‘laws’, to the point where it
had its own prime essences! Much like how the (much-smaller)
everworlds had their own laws and essences, this vast continent did
as well. Although it was merely the size of the Badlands Territory or
Vastheaven Territory, its total energy levels surpassed that of
entire otherverses!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
had its own laws and its own prime essences. Once a cultivator took
control over the prime essences of an otherverse, that cultivator
would become known as an ‘Otherverse Lord’. However, there was no
way for anyone to take control over the prime essences of the Icewind
Sea. Not even the Sourcewalkers who had lived in here since time
immemorial were capable of it! The Sourcewalkers had merely been
blessed by the prime essences of the Chaosverse, who had been enraged
by the manner in which the Sithe had invaded and looted so many
sacred sites. As a result, the Sourcewalkers were able to borrow some
of the power from the sacred sites, causing the Sithe to suffer great
losses as a result.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
a Sourcewalker was able to take control over the entire Icewind Sea,
then even Flamewing would be of no use. It might be able to stay
alive, but the rest of us would probably be wiped out
instantaneously.” After wandering the Icewind Sea for just a single
year, Azurefiend found enough treasures to rival an ordinary
Hegemon’s networth. This caused him to feel stunned as to how
marvelous the Icewind Sea was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sithe were too proud and too ravenous, causing even the prime
essences of the Chaosverse to feel enraged. That’s why the
Sourcewalkers were granted power from these sacred places.” Ning
smiled. “Ever since the Sithe were destroyed, there have been no
further tales of Sourcewalkers being able to control such power.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly,
Ning’s Immortal energy flared out. Swish! It grabbed the other
three, then brought them with Ning as he warped to the edges of a
distant gorge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Even
ice planets had their own chaotic gravitational fields, preventing
Ning and the others from warping through spacetime. The great ice
continent, however, was extremely stable and had its own system of
laws. The only places where things were chaotic were those vast
vortexes which rose into the skies; there, warping through spacetime
was impossible. Thus, Ning and the others engaged in fairly short
warp teleports, ensuring that they were able to avoid those places.
This process was still far faster than flying normally.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hm?”
When the four arrived in the air above the canyon, they all peered
downwards into it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
don’t see a Daomerge Firecloud Flower.” Azurefiend shook his
head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
don’t sense any Fire-type energy at all,” Flamewing agreed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
gorge was the place where Realmslord Windgrace and the others had
discovered that Daomerge Firecloud Flower. Ning and the others had
been making haste towards it, although of course they would’ve been
pleased to find another flower midway.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">One
years… two years… three years. Ning and his team continued to
advance through the Icewind Sea, searching for the flower Ning
needed. They encountered and picked up a number of valuable fruits,
but most were unripe. In addition, they were afraid to harvest too
much, for fear of being discovered by the Sourcewalkers.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_034__Daom"></A>
Chapter 34: Sourcewalkers</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Another
129 years went by in the blink of an eye.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoooosh.
A vortex could be seen rising into the skies in the distance, causing
spacetime to be twisted and distorted. Ji Ning and the other three
were in a cave close to the margins of the vortex, peering towards
it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Azurefiend
murmured softly, “According to what Realmslord Windgrace said, the
most precious materials are all located deep inside the vortexes,
which connect to the very deepest underground tunnels. Darknorth,
shall we go in and take a look?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
need. Our target is the Daomerge Firecloud Flower! There’s no need
for us to enter the depths of those vortexes,” Ning said. “If we
do go in, we would be easily discovered by the Sourcewalkers.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Azurefiend didn’t argue, even though he really did want to go in
and give it a try. They hadn’t picked up many treasures in the past
few years, as they were afraid that scouring too much would result in
them being discovered, but even so the few treasures Azurefiend had
picked up were worth two or three times more than his previous
networth. Thus, he wanted to go into the depths of the abyss and
search for even rarer treasures… but the only way he could do that
was if he relied on Ning’s Flamewing God.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
other valley Realmslord Windgrace mentioned isn’t too far away. We
should be able to reach it in around thirty years,” Ning said. “Let
us continue.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Daomerge
Firecloud Flowers were simply too rare. They had searched for many
years but found nothing at all. They did find another Incense
Spirit-Fruit, but unfortunately it was yet another unripened one.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the others had only walked for the time needed to boil a kettle
of tea when suddenly… boom! A blurry black light suddenly appeared
beneath their feet, oozing out of the icy ground and forming into
curved lines that stretched out trillions of kilometers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Not
good. That’s a formation.” Ning’s face tightened. “An alarm
formation.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ve
been discovered.” Hegemon Azurefiend was shocked as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…
an enormous earth-shaking boom rang out in the distance as the ground
began to crack apart. A titanic mountain-sized ice humanoid emerged
from the ground, using his two hands to tear through it as he rose
from the depths.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
gaze narrowed. The ice here was so tough that if he didn’t use his
Northbow swords, he’d need to use roughly 50% of his full power to
break through it. Most likely, fairly powerful Archons would have to
use 100% of their full power to just barely break through the ice.
This person, however, had been able to instantly tear through the
ground with his bare hands. This terrifying level of strength alone
showed that this creature was vastly stronger than Hegemons. Most
likely, he was at the Otherverse Lord level of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
the Sourcewalker,” Ning sent mentally.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Sourcewalker?”
Azurefiend’s face turned pale.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
finally came!” Flamewing, on the other hand, was excited. It really
hated the Icewind Sea, as every single part of this place was filled
with uncomfortable icy energy. When it saw the Sourcewalker, it
instantly grew excited.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sourcewalker before them was covered in a layer of extremely thick
ice which served as a form of icy armor which glowed with azure
light. His head was covered with a helmet that had two icicles
protruding from it, and he had long azure hair which fell down to his
waist. He had a great deal of facial hair, and his gloomy azure eyes
were filled with rage and violence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“More
of you thieves, come to steal my treasures!” The Sourcewalker let
out a furious bellow, his voice transforming into a wind of
terrifying power which swept out in every direction. The endless
might in his voice alone caused Ning and Azurefiend to quail. The
difference in power was simply too great.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
ran into a Sourcewalker before we even found a Daomerge Firecloud
Flower. What terrible luck.” Ning felt rather resigned. They hadn’t
even gone into any of the vortexes or deep underground, where the
treasures were more abundant and more valuable. That was where the
Sourcewalkers usually resided.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Sourcewalker,”
Ning called out loudly, “We’ve come here just for the sake of
finding a Daomerge Firecloud Flower! Its not all that valuable, and
we’re willing to use our own treasures to trade for one. We’ll
leave immediately after acquiring the flower.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Daomerge
Firecloud Flowers were incredible treasures for Daolords, but they
were fairly ordinary when compared to the other treasures of the
Icewind Sea. There were treasures here which would drive even
Hegemons and Otherverse Lords mad with excitement.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
Daomerge Firecloud Flower?” The ice-armored Sourcewalker was
540,000 meters tall. It stared downwards at Ning’s group and said
angrily, “You can forget about taking away so much as a piece of
ice from my turf! All you cultivators are nothing more than damnable
thieves. This is my territory!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We
can trade for it with our treasures!” Ning said frantically.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Treasures?
What use do I have for your miserable treasures?” The Sourcewalker
took a furious step forwards, then shot forwards through the air:
“Just die instead!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
felt speechless. This Sourcewalker was just as Realmslord Windgrace
had described; a berserker!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The Sourcewalker wielded a long frozen halberd which gleamed with
azure light, sweeping it towards Ning’s group with such power that
Ning had no choice but to instruct Flamewing to defend. “Flamewing,
go!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha…
I was at the verge of losing my patience!” The chubby Flamewing
instantly let out an excited cry as it reverted to its true form,
transforming into the titanic Flamewing God. Its giant flaming wings
spread out fully as its body became bathed in furious flames that
were so powerful, even the frigid energy of the surrounding area was
pushed away. Everything within ten billion kilometers began to grow
blazingly hot.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Otherverses
had their own prime essences, as did the Icewind Sea… and in a
sense, the Flamewing God itself had its own prime essences! Its
energy levels truly were virtually inexhaustible, and its body was
virtually indestructible. Ever since it was born, it had wandered the
Chaosverse and had devoured entire realmverses with ease. Truly, its
power was inconceivable. Its only weakness was that its level of
insight was extremely, extremely low. If it was just a bit more
clever, it would be able to massacre even Otherverse Lords with ease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Still,
all things came in balance. There was no way even the prime essences
of the Chaosverse could give birth to creatures as powerful as Chaos
Primordials which also had the comprehension skills of Sourcewalkers.
This was completely impossible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“A
Chaos Primordial?” The attacking Sourcewalker was rather stunned
when it saw those vast wings unfurl and the flames spread out in
every direction around the Flamewing God.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
I’ve never eaten a Sourcewalker before!” Flamewing howled through
the skies, while Ning, Azurefiend, and Whitethaw all immediately
moved to hide within the realmship. They weren’t qualified to get
involved in a battle of this magnitude.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is my first time meeting a Chaos Primordial as well. Let’s do
this!” The Sourcewalker was just as eager to do battle, and he
valiantly charged forwards with his halberd at the ready.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swoosh!
His halberd suddenly pierced forwards, howling through the skies with
incredible speed… but Flamewing was even faster! The strike missed,
just barely managing to scrape past Flamewing’s claws but not
injuring Flamewing in the slightest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Up
you go!” The Sourcewalker suddenly changed his stance. Previously,
he had been using the halberd to ‘stab’ at Flamewing; now, he
suddenly lifted it upwards!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was a strike that seemed to split even the heavens in two. Not even
Flamewing was able to avoid this strike… but of course, Flamewing
wouldn’t deign to do so.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Flamewing had already been flying through the air; this strike sent
it stumbling a few hundred kilometers higher.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Sourcewalker was shocked. When he had used this killer technique
against the cultivator Otherverse Lords he had fought, they had all
been knocked backwards and suffered heavy injuries. The Chaos
Primordial had merely stumbled a bit?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Grwaaaar!”
Flamewing excitedly flapped its wings, instantly charging downwards
while using its enormous and thick claws to strike at the
Sourcewalker. The Sourcewalker hurriedly brandished his halberd,
spinning it into a circle that defended against the approaching
attack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Flamewing
completely ignored the profundity of his opponent’s attack, just
striking down with its claws in an absolutely savage blow. BOOM! An
enormous collision rang out as the earth itself began to split apart.
As for the Sourcewalker, half of its body had just been hammered into
the ground from this collision.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
ablated over 90% of its power, but it still suppressed me
completely?” The Sourcewalker was rather speechless at this result.
Moments later, the look within its eyes grew even more frenzied.
“Again!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom.
Boom. Boom! The Sourcewalker was incredibly valiant. At first, it
chose to meet all of Flamewing’s attacks head on, but later on it
began to choose to dodge instead in an effort to win through
technique. In terms of comprehension, it was already at the Archon
level of insight. Due to its innate gifts, this level of insight was
already enough for it to unleash the Otherverse Lord level of power
in battle! Supposedly, the legendary Sourcewalkers who could fight
even Sithe Exalts were actually just at the Hegemonic level of
insight.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Then
again, the Hegemonic level of insight was an incredibly high level.
Realmslord Windgrace, the Lonely King, and the other major powers
were all at this level of insight. The only thing above this level
was Autarchy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Every
so often, the Sourcewalker was sent slamming into the nearby
mountains, hammered into the ground, or smashed so hard that it
created deep craters and gouges in the earth beneath it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Clearly,
after Flamewing became a bit more accustomed to the way in which the
Sourcewalker fought, Flamewing became able to completely dominate it
in battle. The Sourcewalker had even lost his helmet, and his azure
hair fluttered about wildly. He continued to roar with fury, but it
was clear that he was being crushed in this fight. However, the icy
armor that covered his upper body remained completely unscathed. It
was quite a marvelous item.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
the Sourcewalker can’t hold back Flamewing.” Azurefiend chuckled
merrily as he watched from within the realmship. “The Sourcewalker
will probably retreat soon. If this fight continues, it’ll be
nothing but bad news for him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
smiled and nodded as well. He was still going to be able to find the
Daomerge Firecloud Flower.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! At first, the Sourcewalker had been filled with a
towering desire to do battle, but after being dominated for so long
it was beginning to feel rather miserable. It had been a long, long
time since it had felt this miserable.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
body wasn’t nearly as tough as a Chaos Primordial’s, but it was
still vastly better than the bodies of cultivators. Thus, when he
encountered cultivators like Realmslord Windgrace, he was able to
chase down the cultivators and beat them down as he pleased. It had
been quite some time since it had suffered in a fight like this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
being slammed into a mountain yet again, the Sourcewalker angrily
raised his head. His long azure hair fluttered in the wind as he
roared, “Big brother! Hurry up and come out, I’m getting killed
here!” His roar was like thunder, and it shook the world around
them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Big
brother?” Within the realmship, Ning and Azurefiend’s eyes both
bulged out. “He has a big brother?” Ning couldn’t help but feel
rather dazed.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_035__Daom"></A>
Chapter 35: Clash</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
thought you enjoyed fighting and causing a ruckus. Why are you asking
me for help this time?” An icy voice rang out, shaking the world
around them as the icy ground off in the distance suddenly split
apart. An enormous crevice appeared, followed by a similarly towering
figure emerging from it. This figure was dressed in long black robes
that had silver patterns embroidered on them. His black hair fell
down to his waist. He looked fairly handsome, but his eyes were ice
cold. It felt as though there was nothing capable of stirring or
shaking his heart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
slowly walked over, causing an invisible wave of pressure to push
down upon Ji Ning and Azurefiend. Both turned pale.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
black-robed Sourcewalker is far more powerful than the other one,”
Ning mused.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Gwaaaaar!
Another one? I’ll eat this one, then I’ll eat you!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
fire blazing around Flamewing towered ever-higher as the boundless
sea of flames around him swept outwards. He flapped his wings, once
more charging towards the increasingly-battered armored Sourcewalker.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Big
brother!” The armored Sourcewalker was terrified, hurriedly dodging
while flying towards his big brother. The black-robed Sourcewalker
took a single step forwards, moving to block in front of his little
brother.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fuck
off!” The black-robed Sourcewalker stretched out both hands
simultaneously, causing a strange, gloomy black light to appear from
his palms which seemed capable of devouring everything in the world.
As for Flamewing, he continued to charge forwards with brute force as
he sent his giant fleshy claws towards the black light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
The twin palms met the twin claws head-on. Both were extremely
confident in their abilities.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
black-robed Sourcewalker’s face tightened slightly as he hurriedly
took a few steps back, each step causing the icy ground beneath him
to crack and shatter. He had to retreat a total of eight steps before
coming to a halt. As for Flamewing, it was also knocked flying
backwards. It had to hurriedly flap its wings a few times before
stabilizing itself in midair.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What?!
He’s actually able to fight Flamewing head-on to a standstill?”
Ning, watching from within the distant realmship, felt rather
stunned. Although Flamewing seemed to have a slight advantage, the
difference in power was clearly minimal.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
Sourcewalker is as powerful as that?!” Azurefiend was shocked as
well. “Chaos Primordials can effortlessly dominate even Otherverse
Lords and Golden Emperors! It took three Sithe Exalts working
together to catch the Flamewing God. For this Sourcewalker to be able
to fight Flamewing to a standstill means that it is probably quite
close in power to the Sithe Exalts.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Be
careful, Flamewing!” Ning immediately sent mentally. “Don’t be
overconfident.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Wow!”
Flamewing let out a strange cry in midair, the scales on its body
standing up like the hair on a cat. An excited look was in its eyes
as it howled, “You are pretty strong, Sourcewalker! The only foes
I’ve ever met who are stronger than you were those Sithe Exalts.
However… you still aren’t a match for me!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’ve
long heard of how powerful Chaos Primordials are… but now, it
seems, you aren’t all that impressive.” The black-robed
Sourcewalker remained quite confident in his chances. He leapt
forwards, once more charging towards Flamewing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swish!
Swish! Swish! Both transformed into blurs as they fought against each
other at high speeds. The black-robed Sourcewalker had clearly chosen
to stop using the clumsy method of meeting Flamewing blow-for-blow,
as that was simply too exhausting. Unlike the Chaos Primordial, he
didn’t have endless reservoirs of energy. However, he clearly was
highly superior on a technical level, and so he chose to use his
superior techniques to deal with Flamewing, using all sorts of
defensive techniques to ablate and draw away Flamewing’s power,
causing Flamewing to begin to struggle a little bit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
still aren’t a match for me!” Flamewing let out a loud bellow as
it finally went crazy. SWISH! Its speed instantly skyrocketed to its
absolute maximum.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
fast.” The black-robed Sourcewalker’s face tightened.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiiip!
Flamewing pounced towards its foe at terrifying speeds, its fierce
claws tearing through the air. The black-robed Sourcewalker hurriedly
moved to defend. Just as it was about to counter-attack, Flamewing
suddenly flew away, then arced back from afar to once more assault
him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swish!
Swish! Swish! The skies became filled with countless streaks of
flaming light. Flamewing was so incredibly fast that this was all
that could be seen of him. There was no need for it to allow the
black-robed Sourcewalker to fight back against it. It relied on its
raw speed to launch repeated and unanswered attacks, causing even the
black-robed Sourcewalker to feel quite frustrated. Flamewing was
simply too fast!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Flamewing’s
speed vastly surpassed the speed of any Hegemon. Even Hegemon
Thunderstar, who was extremely skilled in speed, was far from being a
match for Flamewing; only when Hegemon Thunderstar was riding in his
realmship was he able to just barely surpass Flamewing in speed. As
for Ning, he was slower than Flamewing even in a realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
too fast. Although I have a realmship, I still wouldn’t be able to
outpace it,” the black-robed Sourcewalker mused. In the end, it had
yet to reach Hegemony in terms of its insights. In contrast, Hegemon
Thunderstar had become a Hegemon via the Dao of Lightning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master!
Master!” Flamewing sent mentally to Ning, “This Sourcewalker is a
pain to deal with. I’ve yet to harm him at all, despite hitting him
with everything I have. It doesn’t look like he’s using up too
much energy. If this continues, he’ll probably be able to continue
holding on against me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
Flamewing had the initiative thanks to its speed, the black-robed
Sourcewalker had reached such a high level of insight that he was
still capable of protecting himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
instantly began to frown. What were they to do? Flamewing was
extremely strong, having completely suppressed the first armored
Sourcewalker and injuring him, causing his energy to deplete rapidly.
As a result, the first Sourcewalker chose to flee after a brief bout!
But this black-robed Sourcewalker… its only weakness lay in its
speed. In all other aspects, it was Flamewing’s equal; in fact, it
actually had an advantage in close combat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
are pretty strong after all, Chaos Primordial. You’ll make a good
mount for me!” The black-robed Sourcewalker suddenly let out a
laugh. “Arise!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Light
began to shine all around them as power began to circulate through
the area. Countless runic lines appeared in the icy earth around them
as an enormous formation began to reveal itself. The entire area
became blanketed in blurry light; clearly, this was a trapping
formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
I had to deal with you anywhere else, it’d probably be quite hard…
but this is my turf. Admit defeat, Chaos Primordial.” The
black-robed Sourcewalker was extremely self-confident.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Retreat,
Flamewing,” Ning sent mentally. Flamewing immediately flapped its
wings and charged back towards Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Store
the realmship into your estate-world, then obey my orders with
regards to breaking this formation apart,” Ning sent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright,
Master.” Flamewing was quite unhappy after having been trapped
within the opponent’s formation. It didn’t really understand
formations, given how low its level of insight was. All it could do
was try to overwhelm the formation with raw power! Given that it was
strong enough to dominate even Otherverse Lords, ordinary formations
were no match for it. However, this was a formation that was
controlled by a Sourcewalker that was every bit as strong as
Flamewing; overpowering it probably wasn’t an option.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Flamewing put away the realmship. Even though Ning was now within
Flamewing’s estate-treasure, his gaze was still able to see past
the dimensional barriers and into the world outside. This was
primarily because Flamewing was in control of the estate-treasure. It
didn’t move to oppose Ning, and so Ning was able to see what was
happening outside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
trap formation is a bit interesting, but defeating it won’t be
hard. Flamewing, given how strong you are, this is actually going to
be easy.” Ning felt quite confident. “Obey my commands.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Dao of Formations was an incredibly difficult one, but Ning had
reached terrifying heights in it. In all the Sixteen Realmverses
Alliance, there was probably no one superior to him in this regard!
When he had first unlocked the secrets behind the Jadefire Realm’s
formation-diagram, he had already reached the Archon level in the Dao
of Formations. He had then spent another long period of time studying
formations in order to unleash Flamewing, and as a result his insight
into the Dao of Formations had deepened even further.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Swish!
Flamewing transformed into an arced streak of light, flying through
the blurry formation at high speed. It repeatedly changed directions,
sometimes choosing to ram through certain points with raw force.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">To
break the entire formation through raw power was impossible for
Flamewing, but Ning’s level of mastery over the Dao of Formations
was so high that he was able to find its weak spots with ease. To
locate and then break through those weak spots was naturally quite
simple.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! A number of explosions could be heard in succession. The
formation which the black-robed Sourcewalker had spent quite a bit of
time setting up was instantly disrupted, and the surrounding area
returned to its usual appearance. It was once again possible for
everyone to clearly see the vast, icy world around them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Why
did it break?! Big brother, your formation was so powerful that when
I was trapped inside it, I had no idea how I was supposed to escape.
How was it breached like that?!” The armored Sourcewalker was
rather dazed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
idiot. All you know how to do is fight. You know nothing of
formations.” The black-robed Sourcewalker stared towards the
fleeing Flamewing, his eyes shining. “It was actually able to
disrupt my formation in the blink of an eye. There’s no way that
Chaos Primordial could’ve accomplished it on its own; those things
are legendary for their stupidity. That means that it had to have
been one of the two cultivators in that realmship. So one of them is
actually a grandmaster in the art of formations!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">After
breaking through the formation, Flamewing instantly grew excited. It
let out an earth-shattering roar, then said: “Hey, Sourcewalker!
Wasn’t your formation supposed to be really awesome? Why don’t
you activate a few more and let’s see how they do?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Formations
had to be set up in advance. The black-robed Sourcewalker had
detected Ning’s group early on and thus had set up this formation
before revealing himself. How could he suddenly manifest another
powerful formation out of thin air?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Gentlemen.”
The black-robed Sourcewalker had an excited look in his eyes, and he
said with a smile: “Do you think you can escape simply because you
breached my formation?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Without
your formations, do you think you can stop me?” Flamewing howled
back, “Be good and hand over the Daomerge Firecloud Flower.
Otherwise, I’m going to loot the entire Icewind Sea completely
clean.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
place is my territory. You should play nice and listen to what I have
to say.” A strange, rhomboid-covered globe suddenly flew out from
the black-robed Sourcewalker’s forehead and into the air. Boom! A
strange power which belonged to the Dao of Space suddenly swept out
and covered the entire area, moving at such incredible speeds that it
completely covered a trillion kilometers in the blink of an eye.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
entire region covered by this power completely changed. It had
transformed into a world of the starry skies, with Flamewing and the
two Sourcewalkers both located within it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is a weapon which I acquired from a Sithe who once attacked this
place.” The black-robed Sourcewalker’s voice echoed throughout
every part of the starry skies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flamewing.”
Ning immediately issued an order from within the estate-wrold: “War
machines might be powerful, but activating them uses up an enormous
amount of energy. Don’t worry about him. You have a virtually
indestructible body and limitless energy; focus all of your efforts
on tearing through this astral world. Rip it to pieces with your
power!”</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_036__Daom"></A>
Chapter 36: Easily Accomplished</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
Master.” Ji Ning’s command was perfectly suited to the Flamewing
God’s temperament. It immediately unleashed an earth-shaking howl
as it flapped its wings, leaving behind a jagged scar in the air as
it soared towards the limits of this astral world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
black-robed Sourcewalker simply watched calmly: “The forceful
response, eh?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
The ‘membranes’ of this astral world rumbled as the charging
Flamewing’s giant fleshy claws slammed into them, with the
explosion filling the entire starry realm. However, this astral world
remained quite stable; it didn’t even budge in the slightest.
Instead, it was Flamewing who was knocked flying backwards by tens of
thousands of kilometers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Sithe
war machines truly are impressive,” Ning sent mentally. “This
black-robed Sourcewalker may be far more powerful than most Hegemons,
but there’s no way it can possess limitless power like you,
Flamewing. Ignore all else and just launch repeated attacks. A
hundred attacks, a thousand attacks, ten thousand attacks… I want
to see how long the Sourcewalker can resist you!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fine.”
Flamewing’s confidence was soaring thanks to its master’s words,
and it once more sent itself slamming into the edges of the realm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! Flamewing used all of its power to slam into the edges of
the realm, moving in a fairly rhythmic manner. Seeing this, the
black-robed Sourcewalker slowly shook his head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The Sourcewalker willed it, and the strange energy that had covered
this area of a trillion kilometers instantly dissipated, flying back
into the globe in front of the Sourcewalker. The world around them
once more reverted to the normal icy world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
gave up.” Ning felt a sense of delight.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
misunderstand. I’m not afraid of you.” The black-robed
Sourcewalker’s voice boomed out, echoing through the skies: “The
dimension formed by this Sithe war machine is incredibly stable and
is not easily breached. I, Daoist Towerdawn, have wandered the
Chaosverse for countless years and have many tricks up my sleeve.
Even if I cannot kill you, it would be very easy for me to keep you
trapped here! If you wish to leave this place, you must go through
the tempest region. Even if no one is bothering you, it will take you
a hundred million years to fly through it! If I chose to interfere,
you might be able to stay alive but you’ll never be able to
escape.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
heart sank. Indeed, the only way out was to slowly fly out rather
than warp through spacetime. The black-robed Sourcewalker was
probably telling the truth. However, thanks to Flamewing’s power it
wouldn’t be that easy for him to trap them either.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The realmship appeared next to the Flamewing, with Ning, Azurefiend,
and Whitethaw inside of it. They didn’t dare to leave it, for fear
of being ambushed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
talk a big game,” Azurefiend called out. “Why did you put away
that Sithe weapon, then?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha…”
Daoist Towerdawn actually let out a rare laugh. This caused the
armored Sourcewalker to stare at him in astonishment. His big brother
almost always had an icy look on his face, and he rarely laughed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
were able to defeat my formation with ease. I refuse to believe this
Chaos Primordial learned the art of formations! That means one of you
two has to be a formations expert.” Daoist Towerdawn’s gaze was
cold and calm as he stared at Ning’s realmship. “That’s why I
feel that there’s no need for us to fight.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
you want is a Daomerge Firecloud Flower, right? Those things are of
no use to us at all. I want your help in breaching a formation. If my
guess is correct, you need the flower for the white-robed Daolord
inside the realmship, yes? So long as you help me breach that
formation, I’ll gift the flower to you! Not just that; I’ll give
you other Daomerge treasures as well, like the Spirit Incense-Fruit.
I’ll give them all to you!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But
big brother! The Spirit Incense-Fruit is delicious!” the armored
Sourcewalker couldn’t help but interrupt. Daoist Towerdawn cast him
a cold gaze, causing him to instantly shut his mouth and fall silent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Breach
a formation?” Ning and Azurefiend were both intrigued as they
considered this from within the realmship. If they could avoid a
fight, they would prefer to do so. Clearly, this Sourcewalker wasn’t
easy to deal with! Azurefiend sent mentally, “Darknorth, the
Daomerge Firecloud Flower and the Spirit Incense-Fruit are only
useful to Daolords; they aren’t all that valuable to Sourcewalkers
or Eternal Emperors! He probably won’t try to cheat you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
works for me. However, you must swear a lifeblood oath on this,”
Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well. However, I do want to let you know something; the entire
Icewind Sea only holds a single Daomerge Firecloud Flower, and it is
still growing. I estimate that it’ll take tens of thousands of
chaos cycles before it ripens! Even if you accelerate time, you’ll
only be able to accelerate it by a ratio of 1000x; otherwise, you’ll
impact its growth cycle. In other words, you’ll have to wait a
minimum of a few dozen chaos cycles before you can actually obtain
it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That’s
fine.” Ning had suspected this would be possible, as Daomerge
Firecloud Flowers had to be used within a thousand years of ripening.
Thus, any ones he encountered were likely to be unripe. These
marvelous flowers needed extremely long periods of time to grow. A
few dozen chaos cycles… this was a fairly long period of time, but
he needed to make other preparations for his Daomerge as well. Once
the flower bloomed, he would need to immediately begin the Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Very
well. I need you to unlock the restrictive seals covering this
shield.” Daoist Towerdawn waved his hand, causing a bronze shield
which was roughly nine meters long to immediately appear before him.
This shield had the enormous face of a beast as its motif, and it
emanated a mysterious yet dominating aura.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is something I came across by accident when I was wandering the
borders of the Sithe homelands, but I’ve been unable to defeat the
formations sealing it,” Daoist Towerdawn said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Sithe homelands?” Ning and Azurefiend were both surprised.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes,
the homeland of the entire Sithe race,” Daoist Towerdawn said.
“Don’t ask any more questions; the only task before you is for
you to unlock these seals.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and Daoist Towerdawn both swore lifeblood oaths. Only then did Ning
exit his realmship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Daoist Towerdawn rapidly shrank in size from 540,000 meters to a
height equivalent to Ning’s. He glanced at the armored
Sourcewalker, who obediently shrank down as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning,
Azurefiend, Whitethaw, and Flamewing all walked over as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
cowards,” the armored Sourcewalker mumbled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“They
are simply being cautious,” Daoist Towerdawn said, then glanced at
Ning and the other two. “If you can breach the restrictions
covering this shield, it shall be as I swore. If not, you can forget
about acquiring those treasures.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
walked straight over to the shield as he said, “Don’t worry, if I
can’t break it we can just keep fighting if that is what you wish.
There’ll be plenty of time for that.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Grr…”
Flamewing let out a low growl towards the two Sourcewalkers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hah!
You really do have a Sithe treasure here.” Ning nodded. “It is
actually covered with seven layers of restrictive seals. This has to
be an extremely important treasure.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Early
on, one of my friends guessed that since it is shaped like a shield,
it is probably meant for defense,” Daoist Towerdawn said. There
were many types of Sithe war machines. Some were strong, some were
weaker. The chains which Ning had acquired had suppressive effects
and could absorb energy, while the one Daoist Towerdawn had just used
was able to create a dimension of its own. Realmslord Windgrace’s
‘Blacksun’ was capable of allowing instantaneous teleportation
across great distances and also had incredibly powerful attacks. The
Realmslord’s single war machine was so powerful that it could
influence entire sectors, making it incredibly precious.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded, then lowered his head to carefully inspect the shield. He
smiled. “Interesting. The person who set down this formation can be
considered an expert, I suppose.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
formations over the shield served to suppress and seal its power,
making it quite similar to the chains which had imprisoned the
Flamewing God. However, it was clearly much less complicated. The
Flamewing God had been incredibly important to the Sithe; they had
sent three Sithe Exalts to capture it, then had fashioned the chains
which kept it imprisoned. There was no way this buckler was
equivalent to a Chaos Primordial in value, and the person who created
the seals over it hadn’t been at the Sithe Exalt level.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
seals over the chains that had been around the Flamewing God? Now
those had been complex! If it hadn’t been for the fact that Ning
had a detailed library of many Sithe formations, there was no way he
would’ve been able to solve them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had been at a very high level of insight into the Dao of Formations,
and also had many detailed guides. Despite that, he still had to
spend hundreds of chaos cycles analyzing the chains before managing
to succeed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
comparison, the formations before him were far simpler. Ning had
reached a high level of mastery over Sithe-style formations, and the
formation before him was actually something which was written down
within that library of Sithe techniques.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
need to rush things. Let’s take it slow. So long as you can finish
before the Daomerge Firecloud Flower ripens, it’ll be fine. You
have dozens of chaos cycles,” Daoist Towerdawn said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Dozens
of chaos cycles? I’m gonna take a nap, big brother. Wake me when
it’s over.” The armored Sourcewalker turned, preparing to go take
a nap.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
need for all that trouble.” Ning simply reached out and gently
tapped the surface of the buckler. Instantly, a unique type of
Immortal energy flowed out from Ning’s finger and began to silently
break through the layers of formations covering the shield. In just
the blink of an eye, all seven layers of formations were instantly
breached. The azure shield immediately began to emanate with a
terrifying aura that seemed to have the weight of mountains. Ning
himself felt as though he could use all his power but still be
completely unable to budge the shield at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“…big
brother, didn’t you say that the formations were really tough?”
The armored Sourcewalker stared in shock.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Daoist
Towerdawn was rather surprised as well. Moments later, an overjoyed
smile appeared on his face, and he actually slapped Ning on the
shoulders in a very friendly manner. This caused Ning to feel rather
surprised himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Daoist
Towerdawn said with a joyful laugh, “You aren’t bad, you little
Daolord tyke! I thought it was the skinny old man standing behind you
who was the one skilled in formations. When I saw that it was you, I
actually lost hope. I never would’ve imagined you’d break it
almost instantly! You really are incredible. Feel free to take the
Daomerge Firecloud Flower and the Incense Spirit-Fruit! Haha. Oh,
right. I have a few other Incense Spirit-Fruits here in my
estate-treasure. I was planning to serve them to any friends who came
calling, but I’ll just give them to you instead.”</P>

Chapter 37: Fifty Chaos Cycles in the Icewind Sea</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Daoist
Towerdawn waved his hand as he spoke, causing a jade green box to
open in front of him. Within the box was five fiery red fruits that
emanated such succulent auras, Ji Ning couldn’t help but begin to
drool.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Thank
you.” Ning gladly waved his hand and accepted them all. Although
these fruits might be of limited use to him, they would be of
tremendous use to the likes of his good friend Ninedust or his master
Subhuti when the time came for their Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
need for thanks. This is just like candy to me; the only thing it is
good for is the taste. It’s only useful to you Daolords.” Daoist
Towerdawn’s attitude towards Ning had clearly improved quite a bit.
“Come, let me take you to the Daomerge Firecloud Flower.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
eyes lit up. He immediately led Flamewing, Azurefiend, and Whitethaw
to follow Daoist Towerdawn and the armored Sourcewalker in quickly
delving deep underground.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
depths of the Icewind Sea were filled with frozen tunnels. Daoist
Towerdawn quickly led Ning’s group before a spacetime formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
realm of mine has many tempests within it, causing spacetime to be
unstable. Even I am unable to warp through spacetime,” Daoist
Towerdawn said. “That’s why I spent quite a bit of effort in
setting up all these formations to stabilize spacetime in certain
areas. I was able to create a total of eight stable spacetime tunnels
that allow me to travel to various parts of the Icewind Sea quite
quickly.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Prior
to this, we were forced to slowly fly normally,” Azurefiend said
with a laugh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Haha,
when cultivators see us they are usually terrified and will flee
immediately,” Daoist Towerdawn laughed. “Very few are unafraid of
us. Come, let us enter the formation.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
The formation stabilized spacetime, creating a stable spacetime
tunnel that allowed Ning’s group to be quickly transported to a
different part of the Icewind Sea. Soon, Daoist Towerdawn led them to
the location which held the Daomerge Firecloud Flower.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Deep
within the earth, there was a freezing pool of water that glowed with
azure light. At the very center of the pool was a flower that was
slowly swaying. The flower had yet to bloom, but it was already
tinged with a pink color. It had three leaves, and all of them were a
fiery red color and seemed to be kissed by flames.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
right there is the Daomerge Firecloud Flower.” Daoist Towerdawn
pointed as he spoke: “Once the Daomerge Firecloud Flower blooms,
it’ll be truly magnificent.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
this Daomerge Firecloud Flower is located underground?” Ning was
rather startled. “Daoist Towerdawn, is it really true that there
are no other Daomerge Firecloud Flowers in the Icewind Sea?” The
one which Realmslord Windgrace has spoken of was located in a valley.
But of course, that was a long, long time ago; that flower had long
ago bloomed and been harvested. Still, Ning felt that there should be
others above ground as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daomerge
Firecloud Flowers are very unique, and only a place as unique as the
Icewind Sea can give birth to them. More importantly, the Icewind Sea
can only give birth to one at a time.” Daoist Towerdawn laughed.
“Sometimes, it’ll bloom underground; other times, it’ll bloom
on mountain peaks or halfway up a mountain. It can bloom anywhere in
the Icewind Sea, but only one can ever exist at any point in time!
This is my territory, and I know it quite well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
true, there’s only one at any point in time,” the armored
Sourcewalker agreed. “And it causes quite a disturbance when it
blooms. There’s no way we’d miss the telltale signs of it. My big
brother is often roaming the outside world, but I always reside here
in the Icewind Sea. I’ve seen hundreds of Daomerge Firecloud
Flowers bloom, and each time the process is the same.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. Even if they had been able to sneak in undetected, they
wouldn’t have been able to find the flower even after scouring the
entire surface of the Icewind Sea. As for the underground area? The
frozen underground tunnels were all incredibly winding and complex;
it’d be even harder to find the flower down here, and their chances
of being discovered would increase dramatically.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
seems that them being discovered early on and being forced into
battle against Daolord Towerdawn was actually a good thing. It
ensured they didn’t waste too much time, at least!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It
only has a bud and stem; it’ll be tens of thousands of chaos cycles
before it blooms.” Daoist Towerdawn looked at Ning. “Will you set
up a formation, or shall I do it for you?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Allow
me.” Ning immediately stepped forward.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Your
formations are stronger than mine, and you are more detail-oriented
as well.” Daoist Towerdawn smiled merrily as he watched from
nearby. He normally always had an icy look on his face, but today he
was in an exceptionally good mood. This Sithe weapon which had
puzzled and frustrated him for countless aeons had finally been
unsealed! He had already bound it in secret and now knew how it was
used. With this weapon at his disposal, he was now significantly more
powerful than he had been in the past, and his status amongst his
friends and peers would probably rise a bit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
carefully and attentively set up a temporal acceleration formation
around the entire freezing pool. Although Daoist Towerdawn had stated
that the maximum was 1000x temporal acceleration, Ning only gradually
and carefully increased the temporal acceleration rate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">100x…
300x… 500x…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
was afraid that he might disturb the Daomerge Firecloud Flower’s
growth patterns, but in the end Daoist Towerdawn was right; Ning was
able to upgrade the temporal acceleration all the way to 1000x
without any instability at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Whew.”
Ning let out a sigh of relief. The Daomerge Firecloud Flower was at
hand. For now, he could think of nothing else he needed for his
preparations. As far as external sources of support went, he had the
Autarch’s stone dais, the Stonefire Pearl, and a Daomerge Firecloud
Flower. It could be said that his preparations were perfect.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
temporarily took up residence in the Icewind Sea. Daoist Towerdawn
and his brother welcomed him warmly, and eventually Ning learned that
the armored Sourcewalker’s Daoist title was ‘Fireflame’. The
Sourcewalker had clearly chose to live in a place like the Icewind
Sea, and yet chose ‘Fireflame’ as his title. Ning really didn’t
know whether to laugh or to cry.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
ended up spending more than fifty chaos cycles in the Icewind Sea!
This was an extremely long period of time for Ning. His Primaltwin
continued to remain within the Azureflower Estate, maintaining a 100x
rate of temporal acceleration atop the Autarch’s stone dais as he
meditated on one technique after another, wasting not even a single
moment of time. He spent a total of over 5000 accelerated chaos
cycles in training.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, given Ning’s mastery over spacetime, formations, karma, and
his Omega Sword Dao, it was quite easy for him to study other
techniques. Even the most difficult of Daos, the Dao of Numerancy,
Ning managed to learn after spending less than half the time he had
needed for the Dao of Karma. This was because the Dao of Formations
and the Dao of Karma both had many links to the Dao of Numerancy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, there were many Daos which overlapped with each other in
important ways. For example, the Dao of Ice and the Dao of Water!
‘Ice’ was considered part of the Dao of Water, but the Dao of Ice
was a purer extension of it which would allow one to walk farther
along this path.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">One
Dao after another… Ning reached the Archon level in many of them,
allowing him to gain many new insights as to how the vast Chaosverse
functioned. However, as he suspected, he was unable to gain even a
single new insight into his Omega Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
was no technique, no cultivation path, no insights which would be of
use to him in his Omega Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
am making no progress whatsoever. All I can do is throw everything
into the Daomerge,” Ning mused.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
many years he spent in the Icewind Sea served to temper his heart,
making his Daoheart even purer than before. All other thoughts had
fled from him; his only thoughts were of the Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning,
Daoist Towerdawn, the Flamewing God, and the others had all assembled
deep underground next to the flaming pool.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Almost.
It’s going to bloom at any moment.” Daoist Towerdawn and Daoist
Fireflame, the two Sourcewalkers, watched with looks of expectation
in their eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
stared intently at the flower in the middle of the pool. It was in
the process of budding. Compared to before, the amount of marvelous
energy gathering inside it had grown markedly more dense, almost as
though it was about to explode at any moment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Suddenly, without any preamble, the flower bloomed. Flaming energy
swirled out around the surrounding area, forming a beautiful flaming
flower.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Flaming
clouds circled the area, ensconced by leaves. The flower had bloomed,
releasing its beauty unto the world for all to see.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Firecloud Flower.” Ning murmured softly, “The Daomerge Firecloud
Flower.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hurry
up and harvest it, Darknorth!” Daoist Towerdawn said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
immediately stepped forwards and dispelled his formation, then sent
his Immortal energy towards the flower. It easily covered the entire
Firecloud Flower and then pulled it out by the roots. At the same
time, Ning caused a jade box to manifest in front of him. The jade
box opened, and Ning placed the flower into the box while setting up
a temporal deceleration formation over it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
flow of time continued to slow. Once it reached the rate of a
millionth of the normal rate of time, Ning realized that the amount
of energy it took to maintain the formation suddenly skyrocketed to
the point where even he couldn’t endure it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
try to force it,” Daoist Towerdawn said. “Once the Daomerge
Firecloud Flower blooms, it has to be used within a thousand years.
Otherwise, its marvelous energies will completely evaporate. You can
cause time to slow down around it, but its energies will naturally
try to resist. That’s why it’s impossible for you to completely
freeze time around it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded in understanding. It was impossible for anyone to completely
stop the Daomerge Firecloud Flower’s energies from dissipating. If
one could simply stop time around it, then it would be easy to
harvest and then store Daomerge Firecloud Flowers for Daolords to
use. However, at most one would be able to slow down time to a
millionth the normal rate; in other words, at absolute most the
flower could be preserved for roughly a billion years. No major
power, no matter how mighty, would be able to accumulate a large
supply of Daomerge Firecloud Flowers.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
enough. I’ll have enough time to bring it back to my homeland.”
Ning smiled as he looked at Daoist Towerdawn. “Brother Towerdawn,
I’ve bothered you quite a bit in recent days. It is time for us to
leave.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Daomerge is the greatest obstacle you cultivators must face. You must
be careful. If you succeed, we’ll be able to meet again in the
future,” Daoist Towerdawn said.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_038__Daom"></A>
Chapter 38: The Night Before the Daomerge</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Back
down on the vast ice continent, Daoist Towerdawn and Daoist Fireflame
stared with heads raised as the realmship rapidly advanced into the
great tempest high up in the skies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Big
brother, do you think he will succeed in the Daomerge?” Daoist
Fireflame asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
trains in one of the legendary Omega Daos. His Daomerge will be very
difficult.” Daoist Towerdawn shook his head. During the many chaos
cycles Ji Ning had spent in the Icewind Sea, the two had naturally
discussed the Dao with each other. “He is the only Daolord friend I
have ever made. I hope he succeeds in his Daomerge.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
group spent more than a hundred million years in slowly flying
through the tempest layer, then began to hasten back to his homeland.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Daomerge Firecloud Flower was the most important treasure Ning had
acquired in the Icewind Sea. However, he had also acquired fifteen
Incense Spirit-Fruits on top of that!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Flamedragon Realmverse. Vastheaven Territory. Vastheaven Palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
A realmship passed through the barriers protecting the palace, then
descended upon the Darknorth Estate. Usually, the only people in the
Darknorth Estate were Su Youji and Pillsaint. Ning’s disciples
generally didn’t dare to come disturb them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ji
Ning.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.”
Emperor Solesky, Su Youji, and Pillsaint all came out to greet him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
and the others flew out of the realmship. Ning stored the realmship
away, then turned and smiled. “Big brother. Youji. Pillsaint.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
succeeded?” Emperor Solesky asked expectantly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
found the Daomerge Firecloud Flower,” Ning said. “I’m planning
to spend the next year preparing for it. I’ll also remake the
formations and barriers protecting Vastheaven Palace! After that, I
plan to initiate the Daomerge.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Daomerge?” Solesky, Su Youji, and Pillsaint were all shocked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
you are going to attempt the Daomerge this soon?” Su Youji said
frantically, “Master, you aren’t even close to your lifespan
limits yet. There’s no need for you to rush! You can wait another
hundred thousand chaos cycles before attempting the Daomerge.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
you don’t realize is that the Firecloud Daomerge Flower must be
used within a thousand years of harvesting it,” Ning said. “More
importantly… even if I delayed for a while longer, it wouldn’t be
of any benefit to me in the Daomerge.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
were literally no improvements he could make. He couldn’t even get
a hint of a new insight with regards to the Omega Sword Dao. Waiting
would be a pure waste of time. In addition, Ning knew just how
difficult the Daomerge for the Omega Sword Dao would be. He had to be
completely decisive and resolute in facing it; he couldn’t show the
slightest bit of cowardice. His only chance was in charging through
remorselessly and then succeeding!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
you…” Su Youji’s eyes were filled with concern. “Be careful.”
She had wanted to attempt the Daomerge alongside Ning, but she
herself had just recently become a Daolord of the Fourth Step. Her
Dao wasn’t all that strong, and as a result she hadn’t even
reached the Verge of the Daomerge yet. Pillsaint was also a Daolord
of the Fourth Step, but he also needed a great deal of time to
prepare for it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry.” Ning looked at Su Youji. “Youji, let me know when you are
planning to engage in the Daomerge. I’ll have a present waiting for
you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
could sense who truly cared about him. This was even more true now
that he had reached such great heights in the Dao of Karma. Of the
three present (Solesky, Pillsaint, Su Youji), without a doubt Su
Youji cared about Ning the most, and the karmic lines binding the two
of them were extremely deep. She probably wouldn’t even hesitate to
sacrifice her own life to protect him, and so Ning naturally felt
closer to Su Youji.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ji
Ning, should we tell Hegemon Brightshore and the others that you are
attempting the Daomerge?” Solesky asked. “All three Hegemons have
requested me to inform them in advance if you are planning to engage
in the Daomerge.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No
need to tell them.” Ning shook his head. “I don’t want to cause
too much of a fuss.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Fine.
It’ll be as you choose.” Solesky nodded. Solesky knew that there
were two reasons why Hegemon Brightshore and the others wished to be
notified of Ning’s Daomerge attempt. The first reason was because
Realmslord Windgrace had requested it. The second was because they
wanted a chance to prepare themselves! Once a Daolord failed his
Daomerge, his truesoul would begin to disintegrate, but this was a
fairly slow process. The more powerful a truesoul was, the more time
would be needed before it fully disintegrated.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
must be remembered that even World God Northrest’s truesoul managed
to survive for nearly a chaos cycle before disintegrating. Given
Ning’s current level of insight, even if his truesoul did
disintegrate it would probably be able to last for an extremely long
period of time. Given that he was guaranteed to die and given how
much time he had, who knew what he might do? Would he cause any
trouble?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Many
Samsara Daolords who failed the Daomerge would lose themselves and do
as they pleased, doing some things which they normally would never
dare to do. Some would become so crazy that they would massacre
people in great numbers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
must be remembered that Ning had the Flamewing God on his side. The
more powerful a Daolord was, the more terrifying that Daolord could
be when he went crazy. If Ning failed the Daomerge and truly became a
demonic figure, then led the Flamewing God on a rampage… who could
possibly stop him?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“All
I wish for during my Daomerge is peace and quiet,” Ning said
calmly. “I know exactly what Realmslord Windgrace is attempting, as
well as the ‘Lonely King’ of the Icepeak Army who has been slowly
biding his time. However… I shall be the one to decide who I will
give Flamewing to, if I give it to anyone at all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
knew that both were waiting for him to fail his Daomerge and then
die! In truth, in his heart, Ning wasn’t willing to actually force
Flamewing to serve someone else in the event that he failed his
Daomerge and died. He wanted for Flamewing to be able to make a
choice for itself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“We’ll
wait and see.” Ning had made some decisions regarding this long
ago. If he failed his Daomerge and began to die, he would become an
object of terror to others. If he succeeded? The results would go
without saying.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
don’t need to worry about any of that. I only need to do one thing…
complete the Daomerge!” Ning was filled with a terrifying degree of
focus on the Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had mastered many different Daos during the chaos cycles he had spent
in the Icewind Sea, including the Dao of Numerancy. He had also spent
a great deal of time further perfecting the Dao of Formations for the
sake of the Three Realms and Vastheaven Palace. He had studied many
formations from both the Sithe as well as the cultivator
civilizations, then used them as references in order to perfect a
terrifying complicated grand formation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
grand formation was formed by a total of fifty-two separate
formations. Ning was preparing to set it up in both Vastheaven Palace
as well as the Three Realms. This grand formation was incredibly
profound; most likely, even a Hegemon who had reached that level via
the Dao of Formations would not find it easy to reach this formation.
This was because this was a formation that combined the essences of
many ancient grandmasters; Ning was just setting them up in
accordance with their wisdom, then using his own insights to merge
all fifty-two of them together.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">These
two different schools of formations were like Yin and Yang, merging
together to form a whole. Even a Hegemon of the Dao of Formations who
wished to technically solve and then breach it would find it to be
quite difficult; most likely, he would need an extremely long period
of time before succeeding.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for using raw force to overpower it? Ning had so many treasures that
he was certainly using only the finest energy sources for these
formations. These tremendously powerful energy sources, when matched
with these mighty formations, would ensure that not even ten Hegemons
working together would be able to shake this formation. Ning himself
was at the Hegemonic level of power, and so he knew just how strong
this formation was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
Ning wasn’t confident in his formation being able to stand up to
Realmslord Windgrace’s legendary ‘Blacksun’ weapon. The
Blacksun was able to easily connect two extremely distant places
together and was also able to unleash attacks of incredible power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
location and existence of the Three Realms has always been a secret.
Everyone who knows of it has long ago sworn a lifeblood oath not to
divulge its location,” Ning mused. “If I fail the Daomerge, I’ll
do my best to leave behind something else for the Three Realms.
However, there’s a limit to what I can do. The rest will be up to
future generations.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
felt quite calm and relaxed about this. He had seen both great joy
and great sorrow. If he failed the Daomerge, he would die. The future
of the Three Realms would indeed be up to the cultivators of the
Three Realms themselves.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
flowed on, one day after another. Ning established formations in both
Vastheaven Palace and the Three Realms, with the materials and energy
sources he used being equivalent in value to the networths of three
Hegemons! To Ning, however, these things weren’t really all that
important.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
atmosphere within the Darknorth Estate in Vastheaven Palace was
extremely quiet and peaceful. Su Youji, Pillsaint, Hegemon
Azurefiend, and even the normally-rambunctious Flamewing were all
exceptionally quiet. All of them knew that Ji Ning was going to
attempt the Daomerge the following day.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Tomorrow…”
Ning raised his head to stare into the night sky. “Flamewing.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.”
The chubby Flamewing immediately walked over.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Tomorrow,
I shall attempt the Daomerge. If anything happens or if anyone comes
to interrupt me, take me into your estate-world treasure,” Ning
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Understood.”
Flamewing immediately said, “Don’t worry. I’ll eat anyone who
tries to cause trouble.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
smiled. This was nothing more than a backup plan. In truth, it was
his Primaltwin which would be the most important part of his
Daomerge, as it was in the Azureflower Estate and would be completely
safe. It also had the Autarch’s stone dais and the Stonefire Pearl;
that meant its chances at the Daomerge would be the highest. Ning had
even sent over the Daomerge Firecloud Flower to his Primaltwin. Since
his Primaltwin and his true body were all part of one whole, they
would both engage in the Daomerge together. Thus, if anyone came to
bother Ning’s true body it actually wouldn’t make much of a
difference.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Alright.”
Ning stared into the night sky, his heart feeling exceptionally at
peace. After his experiences in the Icewind Sea as well as the year
he had spent quietly preparing formations, he had focused his entire
Dao-heart upon the Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly,
a certain desire flashed through his heart; before he began the
Daomerge, he wanted to take a look at the Three Realms. He decided to
follow through on this desire.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
going on a small trip. No need for you to follow me,” Ning said. He
then took a single step forwards and vanished without a trace.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_039__Daom"></A>
Chapter 39: Seclusion</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ji
Ning arrived at the Three Realms by himself. Given his mastery over
the Dao of Karma and the Dao of Numerancy, it was virtually
impossible for anyone to see him if he did not wish to be seen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Three Realms.” The white-robed Ning sat there within the void in
the lotus position, staring off into the distant emptiness of the
primordial chaos. Long, long ago, the original ‘Three Realms’ had
been located here. However, the ‘new’ Three Realms had been
destroyed and reborn numerous times by now as a complete chaosworld.
It was never again divided into the Celestial Realm, Mortal Realm,
and Netherworld Kingdom, or the three thousand major worlds and
trillion minor worlds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
sat there in the lotus position, staring silently into the void. His
spirit, however, was pulsing rapidly. He felt as though he could see
the Three Realms of old. Countless scenes flashed through his mind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
thoughts turned to how the Netherworld Kingdom had suffered an attack
from the Seamless Alliance, resulting in Ning being reborn into the
world without having drunk from Granny Meng’s soup. He had been
born into the Ji clan…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
had been born to his father Ji Yichuan and his mother Yuchi Snow. He
had then become apprenticed to the Black-White College, met his first
master Immortal Diancai, befriended Mu Northson, then met Ninelotus
and Yu Wei.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ninelotus
was a straightforward person who dared to choose the person she loved
for herself, but she was also a person who was extremely decisive.
The problems with the Youngflame clan had resulted in them
separating, while Yu Wei had always silently supported him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">During
the Conclave of Immortal Destiny, Lu Dongbin and the Xia Emperor,
along with countless other Immortals and Fiendgods, all watched as
Ning and Yu Wei finally ended up being together.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Alas,
shortly afterwards Ning had been taken to the Tristar Crescent Abode
of Mount Innerheart, where he had entered the tutelage of Patriarch
Subhuti. By the time they next met, the Seamless Alliance and the
Nuwa Alliance had already launched a furious war against each other…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yu
Wei.” Ning continued to reminisce on the past. He truly did feel
great sorrow and pity for his departed wife.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Those
days, Ning had roamed and dominated the Three Realms. During the
Endwar, he had personally reversed the entire outcome of the war,
then departed the Three Realms to continue his adventures elsewhere.
He had now reached such heights within the vast Chaosverse that even
Hegemons felt dread towards him. Not only had he taken on a Hegemonic
retainer, he had even tamed a Chaos Primordial and had Hegemonic
power as a Samsara Daolord.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Given
all of this, Ning could truly be described as a dazzling figure. He
was far more dazzling than Emperor Heartsword or even Hegemon
Brightshore had ever been!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
his wife? Her destiny had been far more calamitous and pitiful.
During her previous life, she had been born into a minor grasslands
tribe. Calamity had descended upon that tribe, resulting in her
suffering endless torments which had transformed her into a female
asura-demon. She had lived a hellish existence, with the Godking
secretly manipulating her from afar. Although she was reborn as an
Immortal in her next life, her soul had remained under the Godking’s
control. She had been his pain, and as a result her heart had been
filled with such worry and fear that she initially had been afraid to
even confess her love to Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the end, Ning had come to her. Yu Wei had decided that she would
rather accept her soul being shattered than bring harm to him, and so
the two had ended up together.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Alas,
the Godking had continued to threaten and coerce her. Yu Wei knew
that she would eventually be exposed, and so she had a child with
Ning. Soon after that child had been born, Yu Wei had been consigned
to the hells and eventually had her truesoul extinguished.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Her
life had been a calamitous, miserable one. The only bright spot in
her life had been the time she had spent with Ning and her giving
birth to a daughter for him. Unfortunately, that moment of happiness
had been a brief one.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
spent that night seated by himself within the emptiness of space,
quietly thinking back to days past. His thoughts were chiefly of the
time he had spent with his wife, Yu Wei.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
a powerful cultivator, he was able to remember every single one of
his previous memories with perfect clarity. Not even the passage of
time could dim them in the slightest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
didn’t feel too many complicated or mixed emotions. All he felt was
a tinge of heartache for his wife.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning rose to his feet, then turned to stare at the enormous flaming
ball off in the distance. This was the Solar Star, and its light
illuminated Ning’s face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Senior
apprentice-sister… I have already come this far on my path of
cultivation. Today, I shall begin my Daomerge. This shall be my last
gambit. Wait for me. One way or another, we will be together again,”
Ning murmured softly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
Dao-heart, the entirety of his soul and truesoul… all of it was
waiting in peak condition. The night he had just spent in solitary,
silent reflection had caused them all to reach the greatest apex
possible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiiip.
Ning tore through spacetime and took a single step forwards,
disappearing from the Three Realms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Dawn.
Vastheaven Palace. The Darknorth Estate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Solesky, Hegemon Azurefiend, the Flamewing God, Su Youji, Pillsaint,
and Whitethaw were all up. None of them had rested the previous
night. All of them were waiting, and the more they waited the more
nervous and impatient they became. All sorts of mixed emotions filled
their hearts, as all of them knew what the Daomerge represented for
any Daolord.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Ning appeared out of thin air, manifesting within the Darknorth
Estate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ji
Ning.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth.”
All of them rose to greet him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
swept them with his gaze, then revealed a smile: “All of you came?
What’s with all the long faces? It’s like I already failed the
Daomerge!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master,
you’ll definitely succeed in the Daomerge!” Flamewing was rather
teary-eyed. Of the people present, it had the least amount of control
over its emotions. It emotionally relied on Ning much like how a
child would rely upon a parent. It hurriedly said, “Master, you are
much more powerful than any and every Daolord I’ve ever
encountered, and more of a genius than any of those Hegemons. An
Omega Sword Dao is nothing to you. You’ll definitely succeed!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Flamewing.”
Ning walked over, patting Flamewing on the head. When he had first
tamed Flamewing, his only thought had been to acquire a powerful
servant. However, as time had passed and as the two got to know each
other over the course of many chaos cycles, Ning had realized how
implicitly the beast trusted him. Flamewing truly was like a child
and was incapable of complex schemes. After so much time, Ning felt a
deep sense of affection for Flamewing… and as a result, he felt a
degree of revulsion towards Realmslord Windgrace and the Lonely King
for harboring designs on Flamewing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
you must succeed in the Daomerge! I swore an oath to follow you for a
thousand chaos cycles. It has only been a hundred! We’re not even
close to being done with each other.” Hegemon Azurefiend’s
wizened old face smiled, causing even more wrinkles to appear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Don’t
worry. Once the thousand chaos cycles are over, you’ll probably be
begging and crying for the chance to continue following me,” Ning
said with a laugh. “When the time comes, I’ll have to think long
and hard on whether or not I want you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
turned to look at Emperor Solesky, Su Youji, Pillsaint, and
Whitethaw. He smiled once more. “Alright, no need to waste time on
words. I’m going to go into seclusion and initiate the Daomerge,”
Ning said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“You
are much more formidable than me. You’ll definitely succeed,”
Emperor Solesky said immediately.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master…”
Su Youji said hurriedly, “I want you to be by my side when I
attempt my own Daomerge in the future.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
nodded. He then patted Pillsaint and Protector Whitethaw on their
shoulders, then turned and entered his estate. Pillsaint didn’t
know what to say, while Whitethaw just watched silently. Although he
was just a golem, he was sentient and extremely intelligent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
of them watched as Ning’s figure disappeared past the great gates
of the estate. Rumble! The gates to the estate swung shut, sealing it
completely.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Flamewing
transformed back into its true form, that of an enormous, flaming,
winged ursine: the ‘Flamewing God’. It lay down in front of the
estate, continuously sweeping the area with an icy cold look in its
eyes. Clearly, it had chosen to immediately carry out Ning’s order
to protect the estate! Starting from this moment, it wouldn’t
permit anyone to disturb Ning’s Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Youji,
relax a little. Being nervous isn’t going to help Master at all,”
Pillsaint said consolingly. “It’ll all be up to him now.
Supposedly, a Daomerge can last for a total of nine years.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes.
It’ll all be up to Master now.” Su Youji sat down in the lotus
position, closing her eyes and taking up a silent vigil.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Solesky,
Whitethaw, and Azurefiend all began to wait as well. To them, waiting
for nine years was an extremely short period of time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the estate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-robed Ning was seated in the lotus position atop a golden
altar. This magic altar was something which Ning had poured all of
his efforts into after researching the Autarch’s stone dais to the
best of his ability. It was all thanks to Ning’s mastery of the Dao
of Formations that he was able to emulate the stone dais as much as
he had, and he had paid a fortune in treasures as well. Despite his
efforts, success in the Daomerge would still primarily be up to his
Primaltwin.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
Primaltwin had the original stone dais, the Stonefire Pearl, and even
the Daomerge Firecloud Flower. It was far better resourced than
Ning’s true body, but of course Ning did his best to outfit his
true body as well. That way, his chances at the Daomerge might be
slightly improved. He had given his true body some valuable
spirit-pills, as well as the Stone Censer of Reunion. Perhaps his
true body was only going to be 0.1% as effective as his Primaltwin,
but every little bit helped.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">But
of course, once the Daomerge actually began the insights and
experiences shared by the two sides would be identical. The two were
two parts of a whole, and their souls, truesouls, and memories were
all as one. As far as the Daomerge was concerned, there was no
difference between a true body and a Primaltwin.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
he succeeded in the Daomerge, his true body and his Primaltwin would
both gain eternity at the same time. If he failed, his truesoul would
begin to crumble.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-robed Ning sat there atop his altar, while the black-robed
Primaltwin Ning sat upon the Autarch’s stone dais in the distant
Azureflower Estate. As for Ning’s two avatars, they went into
silent seclusion as well. An avatar contained part of the truesoul
and godsense as well; if the Daomerge failed, the godsense within the
avatars would quickly begin to crumble, causing the avatars to
perish. However, since the true body and the Primaltwin both had
complete souls and truesouls, they were able to ensure that the
process of decay was dramatically lessened.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
it begin,” the white-robed Ning and the black-robed Ning both said
at the same time.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_040__Daom"></A>
Chapter 40: The Daomerge Begins</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the Azureflower Estate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
elderly white-haired spirit of the estate watched silently, feeling
both worried but hopeful: “I hope this kid can succeed. If he can
succeed in the Daomerge with the Omega Sword Dao, he will have
achieved something which no one has ever done before. Perhaps
Master’s final wishes will then be completed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Autarch’s wishes were simply too hard to achieve. After becoming an
Autarch, Awakener had reached a level of tremendous insight and
understanding, and he had many treasures aiding him. He had been
alive for unfathomably more times longer than Ji Ning had, and he had
reached incredible heights in his mastery of the Nine Chaos Seals.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
were a total of ninety-nine layers to the Heart of Eternity!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Even
after having returned from the Icewind Sea, Ning had only been able
to solve the first twenty-two layers of the Heart. He was far, far
away from being able to completely solve it! In truth, the spirit of
the estate also knew how unlikely it was that Ning would succeed,
because even the other dazzling geniuses who had come before Ning had
fallen far short of the mark of completing Autarch Awakener’s
wishes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Daomerge Firecloud Flower.” The black-robed Ning waved his hand,
causing a jade box to appear before the stone dais. The jade box
opened on its own, followed by a perfect Daomerge Firecloud Flower
that was still attached to its roots and leaves to fly out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
the Daomerge begin!” The black-robed Ning closed his eyes. Over in
Vastheaven Palace, the white-robed Ning in Vastheaven Palace
swallowed his own spirit-pills, activated the incense from the Stone
Censer of Reunion, and then closed his eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
began to visualize the inside of his divine body, formed from a total
of 108,000 godgems. Each godgem contained his divine power, his soul,
his truesoul, and more. They also contained Ning’s insights into
his Omega Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
visualized the Dao-tree within his Jindan chaos region. The towering
Dao-tree’s branches and leaves were the material representations of
Ning’s insights. Countless insights began to resonate through his
mind and soul.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">What
he needed to do was to gather together all of these insights, then
transform them all and cause his Dao-tree to give birth to a
beautiful Flower of Eternity! His divine body would then transform to
become a truly eternal body. If he became an Eternal Emperor, every
single one of his godgems would transform into a Worldheart, even if
his truesoul was somehow extinguished. The godgems would forever give
birth to new chaosworlds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Flower of Eternity… an eternal body…” Ning exerted his will.
Boom! Every single godgem in his body began to tremble. The godgems,
previously coalesced with his fourth-step Daolord energies, began to
disassemble and then advance to a completely new level of existence!
The towering Dao-tree within his body was shaking as well, as all of
the insights represented by those branches and leaves began to gather
together.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
someone was standing nearby, that person would quickly discover that
the white-robed Ning and the black-robed Ning were both beginning to
glow with blurry sword-light. Countless streaks of sword-light
emanated from Ning with such power as to cause even Hegemons to
shudder. This was the light of the Dao! Or to be precise, this was
the light of the Omega Sword Dao, and its power was covering him and
protecting him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Every
single Daolord would emanate the light of the Dao when they began the
Daomerge. This would be the most dazzling moment of their life, and
it was only in this state that the Daomerge would even be possible.
This was also the state one needed to be in order for the Daomerge
Firecloud Flower to unleash its true potential.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Arise.”
The black-robed Ning opened his eyes, staring at the Daomerge
Firecloud Flower within the jade box.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
blurry sword-light emanating from Ning’s entire body illuminated
the Daomerge Firecloud Flower, causing it to levitate into the air.
Guided by Ning’s will, the flower began to be surrounded by clouds
of fire that gathered together into a half-translucent humanoid
figure directly above the flower. This figure looked identical to
Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
incarnation! The incarnation formed by the Daomerge Firecloud
Flower.” Ning immediately took control over the flow of time,
having the incarnation complete a simulated Daomerge as quickly as
possible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
a Daolord like Ninedust used the Daomerge Firecloud Flower, a total
of nine incarnations would be formed. In other words, one would have
nine chances to simulate a Daomerge! If one took control over the
flow of time and accelerated time for the incarnations, these nine
simulated Daomerges would at most take perhaps two or so hours, at
which point the Daolord could begin the true Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
hope this incarnation can last long enough to attempt a complete
Daomerge.” Ning felt hopeful. “Let’s begin.” The incarnation
immediately initiated a simulated Daomerge, with a towering Dao-tree
appearing within its body. The reason why it didn’t form a complete
divine body was because Ning wanted to conserve power; there was a
limit to how much energy the Daomerge Firecloud Flower held within
it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
passed, one day after another. The incarnation continued to carefully
carry out the Daomerge, with the Omega Sword Dao insights embodied by
the Dao-tree all slowly gathering together. Finally, a series of
thick trunks began to emerge from the very center of the Dao-tree.
These trunks began to manifest a total of two new leaves. One of the
two leaves emanated an incredibly profound and abstruse aura, while
the other emanated an aura that was incredibly titanic and vast.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Between
these two leaves, an unremarkable little flower bud began to emerge
as well. The flower bud began to slowly grow larger and larger…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
far, so good. My path is the correct one. This is just how it should
be.” Ning felt a tremendous sense of confidence in himself and how
things were progressing. The Autarch’s stone dais and the Stonefire
Pearl helped ensured that he was in absolute peak condition for this
Daomerge, and he was in a prajna-like state of epiphany. All sorts of
scattered insights were rapidly coming together to form a perfect
whole, with no flaws that could be discerned whatsoever.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">One
year. Two years. Three years. By now, the flower was so large that it
could no longer grow any further. All of Ning’s insights into the
Omega Sword Dao, as well as the other scattered insights he had
gained, had been infused into the flower bud.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Time
to let it bloom.” Ning knew that the blooming process was the most
dangerous part of the Daomerge. Many, many Daolords had attempted to
make the Flower of Eternity bloom, only to see it wither halfway
through.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly,
his incarnation began to tremble.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Ning’s face tightened slightly. Only now did he turn his attention
to the Daomerge Firecloud Flower. He realized that the flaming clouds
around it had almost all vanished. As the final cloud was depleted,
the materialized incarnation suddenly vanished as well. As a result,
the simulated Daomerge came to an end as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Its
over? The energies were all used up?” Although Ning was briefly
startled, he quickly regained his equanimity. “Omega Daos truly are
the hardest of Daos. I wasn’t even given a chance to attempt to
cause the Flower of Eternity to bloom via a simulated Daomerge,”
Ning mused. The Daomerge Firecloud Flower had enough power to allow a
Daolord who had fused multiple Supreme Daos to simulate the Daomerge
nine times, but he hadn’t even been able to do it a single time!
This had at most been half of a simulated Daomerge… and strictly
speaking, it was the simpler first half. Even if Ning hadn’t had a
Daomerge Firecloud Flower, Ning wouldn’t have made any mistakes
during the first part.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“However…
it still helped me save three years of time.” Ning didn’t let
himself feel dispirited. Saving three years of time meant that his
chances at succeeding in the Daomerge had increased considerably.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“And
so… let the true Daomerge begin!” Thanks to the wonders of
temporal acceleration, the three years of time which the simulated
Daomerge had taken had, in reality, been nothing more than a few
minutes for Ning’s true body and Primaltwin.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-robed Ning and the black-robed Ning simultaneously began to
speed up the Daomerge process. Whoosh! The transformation process of
the godgems began to speed up rapidly, advancing in the blink of an
eye.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">As
for the Dao-tree in his body, it began to give birth to a new trunk
upon which two leaves grew. A flower bud quickly appeared and began
to grow larger, and it quickly reached its maximum size in just a few
seconds. Now, it was ready to bloom whenever Ning chose.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let
it bloom…” Ning knew just how the Daomerge worked. The Flower of
Eternity was safe when it was merely a bud. Once the initial blooming
process began, it was extremely easy for cultivators to make
mistakes… and a single mistake would result in a failure in the
blooming process, causing the flower to wither away! That would
represent the Daomerge having failed. The truesoul would immediately
begin to crumble.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
the initial blooming process was successful, the flower would slowly
bloom more and more. This middle part would be comparatively safer,
and the Flower of Eternity would grow more and more beautiful. When
it reached its most dazzlingly beautiful form, it would gain true
eternity for itself! This final part of the blooming process was the
most difficult part of the Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had met Daolord Laya in the Starflow River. When Daolord Laya had
failed the Daomerge, he had failed during the initial blooming
process; in other words, the Flower of Eternity hadn’t been able to
bloom at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, the blooming represented the process by which Daolords crossed
beyond that final threshold to become Eternal Emperors! That moment
when the Flower of Eternity reached maximum beauty was the moment in
which both it and the Dao stabilized. This represented success, with
the Daolord having become an Eternal Emperor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoooosh.
The petals slowly began to extend up the stem of the Flower of
Eternity, laboriously seeking to reach out and bloom. As for Ning
himself, he began the process of leaping into a new level of
existence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!!!
The Dao-light surrounding both the white-robed Ning in Vastheaven
Palace and the black-robed Azureflower Estate began to dramatically
increase in intensity. The countless streaks of sword-light began to
skyrocket in power, instantly ascending beyond Hegemony. In just the
blink of an eye, it actually surpassed even the Otherverse Lord level
of power!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
terrifying aura of power instantly swept through all that sought to
contain it. The formations around Vastheaven Palace were completely
incapable of containing this terrifying aura, a supreme aura of power
that vastly surpassed that of Hegemons and even Otherverse Lords.
This was the most terrifying aura generated by the Dao of the Sword
which had ever appeared in the Chaosverse… the aura of an Eternal
Omega Sword Dao!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Solesky, Su Youji, Pillsaint, Azurefiend, Whitethaw, and everyone
else all felt so terrified by this aura that their hearts trembled.
It was as though every single cell in their bodies were screaming in
fear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Even
the Flamewing God felt a sense of fear when this mighty aura swept
past it!</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_041__Daom"></A>
Chapter 41: The Critical Moment</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Within
the Azureflower Estate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
The black-robed Ji Ning was seated in the lotus position. Suddenly,
the sword-light coming from his body dramatically increased in
luminosity and power! The might of his aura spread out in every
direction, causing even the elderly white-haired spirit of the estate
who was watching nearby to feel a tinge of fear. The spirit couldn’t
help but lower his head and hunch over. This was an intrinsic fear
that came from the very core of his being. In truth, estate-spirits
could be considered a special type of lifeform.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Such
power…” the white-haired elder tamped down his fear and struggled
to raise his head to look at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
black-robed Ning was emanating countless streams of sword-light that
were filled with an aura of utter dominance and exaltedness. The only
time the long-lived white-haired elder had ever seen anyone like this
had been when he had served his almighty master, Autarch Awakener.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Omega Daos live up to their reputation. If he succeeds in the
Daomerge, perhaps the only people who will be a match for him in the
entire Chaosverse shall be the Autarchs,” the white-haired elder
mused silently.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Once
an Omega Dao became eternal, how powerful would it become? No one
knew. This was because no one thus far had ever been able to
accomplish such a thing. The vast Chaosverse had given birth to
numerous Autarchs, but it had never given birth to an Emperor of an
Omega Dao!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Hegemons and Otherverse Lords, no matter how talented, were at most
only at the Hegemonic level of insight. Beyond that was the level of
Autarchy! However, one who made an Omega Dao eternal would surpass
all Hegemons in terms of profundity of insight into the Dao!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Only
two beings can surpass Hegemony. The first are the Autarchs; the
second would be an Omega Eternal Emperor.” The white-haired elder
stared rather eagerly at the black-robed Ning, who continued to glow
with that aura of infinitely awesome light. “Darknorth, there has
never been an Eternal Omega Dao before! If you succeed, all of
Master’s efforts would’ve been worth it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Azureflower Estate had been the Autarch’s personal, private
training grounds. It was filled with barriers and restrictions of
such might that it naturally was able to block out all auras,
including that of Ning’s Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Vastheaven
Palace, however, was completely incapable of the same. The
white-robed Ning within the Darknorth Estate of the Vastheaven Palace
was also emanating blinding amounts of sword-light, and the power
from his aura surged straight out of Vastheaven Palace and reached
out to spread across the entire Vastheaven Everworld. In fact, the
ripples spread out into the vast void outside as well. However, the
farther the ripples spread, the fainter and harder-to-detect the
ripples became. They quickly spread out to cover the entire
Flamedragon Realmverse and then spread out into the endless Great
Dark as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What’s
going on?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
is this sense of awe and pressure?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
countless living beings within Vastheaven Palace, from the mortals
and animals to the Eternal Emperors, all felt a sense of terror
stemming from the very fiber of their being.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">None
of these living beings were injured, but in this instant the entire
everworld fell completely silent. All of them instinctively knelt
down towards the direction from whence this aura came, almost as if
they were prostrating themselves and displaying submission towards an
emperor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
aura was the aura of an Eternal Omega Sword Dao! No one would dare to
stand against this terrifying aura.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Such
power! Such might! This aura is far more powerful than mine. Not even
the Sithe Exalts were this powerful!” Flamewing was able to
instinctively judge the power of this aura. There had never been an
Emperor who reached that level via an Eternal Omega Dao. Someone who
did would be more powerful than Otherverse Lords, Sourcewalkers, and
even Sithe Exalts! Only the unfathomably powerful Autarchs would be
on this level of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
this is the power of the Eternal Omega Sword Dao?” Emperor Solesky,
Azurefiend, and the others all felt completely stunned. This level of
power was far beyond the Hegemonic level of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
A dimensional tear appeared at the very margins of the Vastheaven
Everworld, followed by a snowy-robed, white-bearded old man
appearing. This was Hegemon Brightshore. A heartbeat later two more
tears appeared. A man with long green hair and a green beard emerged
from the first, while a dazzlingly beautiful scepter-wielding woman
appeared from the second. They were Hegemon Windrain and Hegemon
Netherlily.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Riiiiip.
Another dimensional tear appeared off in the distance, followed by
five figures emerging. The first was a golden humanoid figure, while
the other four were all onyx humanoid figures. This was Lord Wulf of
the Icepeak Army and four of his Black Emperors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Such
power.” Everyone’s gazes were focused towards the distant
Vastheaven Palace. Vastheaven Palace was the source of this
incredible, exalted aura. Simply looking at Vastheaven Palace caused
them to all feel a sense of tremendous pressure! If Ning himself
appeared, staring at him would cause them all to feel a sense of
terror. This was something you would innately feel when you
encountered someone who was at a higher level of existence than you.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
this is the power which comes from an Omega Dao which has gained
eternity?” Hegemon Brightshore murmured softly, “This aura is
utterly terrifying. I’ve never sensed anything as terrifying as
this.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth’s ‘Flower of Eternity’ has probably already begun to
bloom,” Hegemon Windrain said. “If he can succeed in making it
fully bloom, he’ll gain true eternity.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Will
he be dazzling for an instant, or dazzling for all eternity? The
answer will come soon,” Hegemon Netherlily said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
had witnessed many Daolords undergone the Daomerge and thus they
understood the process. The aura of the Eternal Omega Sword Dao which
they could all sense wasn’t being consciously produced by Ning;
rather, it was something which naturally manifested as the Daomerge
began. Only if he succeeded in the Daomerge and truly gained a
complete Eternal Omega Sword Dao would he gain control over that
terrifying level of power! If he failed? Everything would disappear
like mist, and his brief moment of brilliance would amount to nothing
more than a testament to how powerful an Eternal Omega Sword Dao
truly was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“He
has begun the Daomerge.” Lord Wulf stared from afar, a look of
dread in his eyes. “How terrifying. If he succeeds in the Daomerge,
not even the Lonely King would stand any chance against him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
no way something as unearthly powerful as this can exist,” one of
his Black Emperor subordinates said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Agreed.
If he succeeds in the Daomerge, he’ll probably be invincible unless
an Autarch intervenes,” Lord Wulf murmured softly. “But if he
fails… that’ll be when he becomes truly troublesome. No one can
guess what a Daolord who has failed the Daomerge would do. More
importantly, the Lonely King also will be competing against
Realmslord Windgrace. The struggle over the Flamewing God will
probably be the greatest battle which our Icepeak Army has ever
engaged in…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Although
the Icepeak Army had taken part in numerous great wars, it had never
faced off against an opponent of Realmslord Windgrace’s caliber. In
addition, there was a third party to this conflict… Ji Ning and the
Flamewing God who served him. Lord Wulf spoke the truth when he
described this conflict as the ‘greatest battle’ the Icepeak Army
would have ever engaged in.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daolord
Darknorth won’t go crazy, right?” The four Black Emperors were
rather nervous. They had all witnessed the Flamewing God’s power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Who
knows what a Daolord who has failed the Daomerge might do?” Lord
Wulf stared at the distant Vastheaven Palace. “However… we must
give it our best shot, no matter how dangerous it is! There’s no
way Realmslord Windgrace or our Lonely King would give up a chance to
control the Flamewing God. They’ll throw every resource they have
into it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Flamewing God was more valuable than all the combined value of all
the treasures Realmslord Windgrace and the Lonely King possessed.
There was a limit to how powerful a Sithe war machine could be, after
all… and the greater the power, the greater the cost of activating
it. Each time Realmslord Windgrace wished to use the Blacksun to fire
off an attack, he had to pay an enormous price. But Flamewing? It had
a virtually indestructible body and could fight without rest. The
Flamewing God was more valuable than the entire Icepeak Army.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">However,
only the likes of the Lonely King and Realmslord Windgrace were
actually interested in trying to take control over Flamewing. The
ordinary soldiers and generals of the Icepeak Army, along with the
likes of Hegemon Brightshore, simply felt fear! This was because no
one could predict how wide-ranging and destructive such a war would
become. A war on this level could easily result in the deaths of
Hegemons and Black Emperors. Even the likes of Lord Wulf would perish
under the might of a fully-powered Blacksun!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
only ones who stood a good chance at surviving were the Lonely King,
who had numerous Sithe war machines at his disposal, and Realmslord
Windgrace, who had his Blacksun. Everyone else could very well
perish!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Oh,
right. Daolord Darknorth would be safe, as he could hide behind the
Flamewing god. However… if Daolord Darknorth had failed the
Daomerge, he might go crazy and become an even greater threat than
Windgrace or the Lonely King.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Ugh.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
pray that he succeeds in the Daomerge.” In truth, some of the Black
Emperors were silently hoping for Ning’s success. They would be
nothing more than cannon fodder in a battle at this level, after all.
Still… all of them knew in their hearts how unlikely it was that
Ning would succeed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-robed Ning in Vastheaven Palace and the black-robed Ning in the
Azureflower Estate meditated silently as the Flower of Eternity began
to bloom with excruciating slowness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is correct. No errors thus far.” Ning was being incredibly careful.
As soon as the flower had started to bloom, his Eternal Omega Sword
Dao had begun to take form. Everything seemed so perfect and
flawless… but if he made so much as a single mistake, the Flower of
Eternity would instantly begin to wither and his truesoul would begin
to crumble away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
couldn’t afford a single mistake! Thus, Ning proceeded very slowly
with the Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Time
passed on, one day after the other, and more Eternal Emperors
appeared around the Vastheaven Everworld. Ning’s exalted aura had
covered all of the Flamedragon Realmverse and had even stretched out
into the Great Dark. Although the aura grew increasingly weak with
distance, the majority of Eternal Emperors in the Flamedragon
Realmverse were able to sense it. However, realmverses were so far
from each other that the aura spread just a comparatively short
distance into the Great Dark before becoming completely indetectable.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Eh?”
Roughly half a year after the Flower of Eternity began to bloom, the
faces of the white-robed Ning and the black-robed Ning simultaneously
turned pale.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_042__Daom"></A>
Chapter 42: Sword-Heart</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Now
this is a deadly problem.” Ji Ning had just encountered the
greatest obstacle within the Daomerge thus far.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Why
was it that Daolords all wished for the chance to completely simulate
the Daomerge? It was so that they would have sufficient experience
for the real thing. A mistake in the simulated Daomerge could be
fixed in the real one.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Alas,
even the Daomerge Firecloud Flower could only simulate a partial
Daomerge for an Omega Dao. It could only simulate the Daomerge up to
the point where the bud first formed! In other words, the only real
benefit it brought to Ning was that it had saved him three years
worth of time; it hadn’t given him a chance to actually compensate
for any mistakes or errors! And now, as a result, the completely
unprepared Ning now encountered an enormous problem which he had to
resolve.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“If
I wish to succeed in the Daomerge for the Omega Sword Dao, I must
also master the fifteenth stance of the [Heartsword] art!” After
spending half a year slowly blooming his Flower of Eternity, he
immediately realized this problem.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had originally thought that the [Heartsword] art was just a type of
special technique that combined heartforce, divine power, and
Immortal energy. He didn’t believe that it had anything to do with
his Omega Sword Dao… but now that he had actually initiated the
Daomerge, he realized that he was wrong!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
was connected! In fact, it was connected in a very important way!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ordinary
Emperors and even Hegemons didn’t need to worry about techniques
like the [Heartsword] art during their Daomerges, but Ning was
different; his path was that of the Omega Sword Dao!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
[Heartsword] art focuses on training the heart, the heart of the
sword. The more sincere one’s heart is towards the sword, the more
perfectly one can merge heartforce, divine power, and Immortal
energy. I was only able to master the fourteenth stance of the
[Heartforce] art because I realized that Yu Wei would not come back
to life, and thus I came to understand the essence of ‘Remorseless
Unto Death’. I poured everything into the sword without any
remorse… but that isn’t enough. Although a sword-heart like this
is enough to merge divine power, heartforce, and Immortal energy to a
very high degree… it still isn’t enough.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
need a truly perfect and complete sword-heart! Only then can I also
have a perfect, Eternal Omega Sword Dao.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">He
only came to understand this during the Daomerge itself. The many
insights he had gained into the Dao of the Sword would form the
‘body’ of his Eternal Omega Sword Dao, while his perfect
sword-heart would form its ‘soul’. Only then would it be fully
formed! Only then would it become a true and truly terrifying Eternal
Omega Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was why the [Heartsword] art was so marvelous, and why it allowed for
one to merge all types of energy together, resulting in every single
attack increasing explosively in might.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There’s
a limit to how long the Daomerge can take. I have to comprehend the
fifteenth stance of the [Heartsword] art. If I cannot, I’ll
definitely fail the Daomerge.” When Ning came to understand this,
his face instantly turned pale. There wasn’t enough time! The
fifteenth stance of the [Heartsword] art was incredibly difficult.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, the [Heartsword] art was just a sword-focused energy-combining
technique which Emperor Heartsword had created. There had been other
major powers in the vast Chaosverse who had done the same. Ning
didn’t really need the technique itself; what he needed to do was
to truly perfect his sword-heart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
One technique after another flickered through Ning’s mind. These
were the various similar techniques which had been created by the
cultivator civilizations as well as the Sithe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“What
should I do? How should I make the breakthrough to the next level?”
Although the state he was in during the Daomerge allowed
breakthroughs to come much more easily, he still wasn’t able to
find the key to the fifteenth stance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Wrong.
Wrong. Wrong! The [Heartsword] art and the other techniques all came
as a result of the unique hearts and minds produced by the
experiences these various major powers had.” Ning’s eyes suddenly
lit up. “In the end, they reached perfection… but they each
walked their own paths! Every single cultivator will have different
mental and spiritual experiences. If you try to force yourself to
emulate their paths, you might be able to reach an extremely high
level but you’ll never reach perfection.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
is why, despite the passage of so many chaos cycles, there has been
no one save Emperor Heartsword who was able to master the fifteenth
stance of the [Heartsword] art. That’s because one has to find
one’s own sword-heart in order to reach this stance!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
prajna-state Ning was currently in was an extraordinary one, and he
was able to quickly identify where the problem lay.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the early stages, the [Heartsword] art might’ve allowed him to walk
faster along his path, but the farther along the path Ning went, the
more of an obstacle the [Heartsword] art became. Thus, he had to
discard it… because it represented Emperor Heartsword’s
sword-heart!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Then
what of my own sword-heart?” Ning began to reminisce about all the
experiences he had undergone through countless years of cultivation,
as well as the many times he had trained in the sword.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slowly…
Ning began to understand.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">One
day. Two days. Three days. One month. Two months. One year. Two
years…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Daomerge allowed for a Daolord to enter the most incredible and
marvelous meditative state known to cultivators. This wasn’t the
first time Ning had thought back to his memories and his life, but
now that he was in the middle of the Daomerge the insights he gained
were naturally different.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Yes…
long, long ago, I once lived a life that was without worries and
carefree. That was back when my mother and father were teaching me.
In the West Prefecture City of the Ji clan, I trained with them in
sword-arts. I was so happy back then. I simply loved sword-arts; that
was all there was to it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“When
did it all change? All kinds of different competing desires arose in
my heart and in my cultivation of the sword. I sought to train in the
sword to take revenge for my parents, to become famous in the Grand
Xia, to kill the Godking and take my revenge, to revive Yu Wei… I
entrusted all of my hopes to the sword, wishing to use it to make all
of my hopes real. In doing so, my sword-heart actually became
impure.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Even
when I reached the stage of ‘Remorseless Unto Death’, my
remorselessness stemmed from my emotions and my love of Yu Wei, not
for the love of the sword itself. But…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“In
truth, I really do love the sword as well.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
he didn’t love the Dao of the Sword from the very depths of his
being, there was no way he could’ve embarked upon the path of the
Omega Sword Dao and reached his current heights. However, all of the
many hopes and fears he had entrusted to the sword had resulted in
his sword-heart becoming impure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
suddenly thought of something which Autarch Titanos had told him:
“Foolish child… sometimes, you have to learn when to let go. On
the path of cultivation, excessive obsession can sometimes result in
self-destruction.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had suddenly awoken to the truth. It was a true moment of epiphany!
After spending three years of the Daomerge going through his many
memories, he felt as though he had revisited his entire life… and
as a result, he had truly awoken.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Even
if I cast aside everything, including all of my hopes and fears, I
would still love the sword. I love it simply because I love it;
there’s no need for any other reason. The Dao of the Sword is a
vast and boundless one which allows me to experience many new things.
Of course I love it. Why wouldn’t I?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Both
the white-robed Ning and the black-robed Ning opened their eyes to
stare forwards.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
front of each of them, a stream of sword-light manifested. The
sword-light flew out in a beautiful, natural, and transcendent way.
There were no strong emotions attached to it, no grief, no sorrow, no
madness… it simply flew forward, illuminating everything around it
with its brilliance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“One
Sword, One World.” Ning smiled. He knew that his sword-heart had
reached the level of true perfection. In fact, he now suspected that
Emperor Heartsword himself must have mastered the ‘One Sword, One
World’ stance during the Daomerge as well. For those who had chosen
a weaker Sword Dao, simply possessing a perfect sword-heart would
allow for one to succeed in the Daomerge, even if one’s Dao of the
Sword was flawed!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Emperor
Heartsword’s Sword Dao wasn’t a particularly impressive one, but
he had a perfect sword-heart and as a result had succeeded in the
Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
now had a perfect sword-heart as well… but he was attempting to
master an Eternal Omega Sword Dao. A perfect sword-heart was just one
component!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“My
sword-heart has been perfected.” Ning immediately continued to the
next stage of his Daomerge, causing the Flower of Eternity to
continue its blooming once more. Now that he had a perfect
sword-heart, the Flower of Eternity seemed to have gained a spirit,
and it rustled in his soul much like a true flower would in the
outside world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“It’s
nearly been nine years.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“The
Daomerge can at most last for nine years. Daolord Darknorth’s
Daomerge must be coming to an end soon.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
wonder if he will succeed or fail.” Within the Vastheaven
Everworld, the Hegemons and the Icepeak Army were all waiting. The
other Eternal Emperors, such as Daoist Bluestone, Emperor Goldisle,
and Emperor Blackcloud were all waiting nervously as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
had indeed been nearly nine years since Ning had unleashed that wave
of terrifying presence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Perhaps
the Daomerge time limit for Omega Daos is longer than normal?”
Hegemon Netherlily suggested curiously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Who
knows?” Hegemon Brightshore shook his head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Let’s
just wait. We’ll see a result soon,” Hegemon Windrain said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
of the Hegemons and Emperors were waiting, as were Hegemon
Azurefiend, Flamewing, Emperor Solesky, Su Youji, Pillsaint, and
Ning’s disciples and fellow apprentices within Vastheaven Palace.
All of them were extremely nervous.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
almost out of time.” The white-robed Ning in Vastheaven Palace and
the black-robed Ning in the Azureflower Estate both knew that they
only had nine years for the Daomerge. The Daomerge Firecloud Flower
had saved them three years of time, but they had wasted three more in
perfecting the Dao-heart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Flower of Eternity slowly continued to bloom. There could be no
mistakes at all right now.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Time
for the final push.” Ning could sense the growth of the Flower of
Eternity within the Dao-tree in his body, and could also sense how
his godgems had reconfigured themselves. It was time to take the
final step.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
his heart, he already had a complete structure for his Eternal Omega
Sword Dao. Whether or not it was the correct one could only be
ascertained through actually using it in the Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“There
are no mistakes. Such a perfect Dao has to be worthy of eternity.”
Ning was filled with confidence, but since he hadn’t had the chance
to simulate a Daomerge he had to be absolutely correct in order to
succeed. The slightest of errors would result in failure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I’m
out of time. There’s no way to stop the Daomerge. Time for the
final step!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
willed it, and with a rumble his Flower of Eternity went into full
bloom, revealing dazzling amounts of radiance. The godgems in his
body instantly went into a brand new configuration as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Would
the result be eternity? Or a withering?</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Top_of_Book_38_Chapter_043__Daom"></A>
Chapter 43: The Curtain Falls</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Flower of Eternity bloomed with incandescent light, striving to
achieve eternity… but then, its light began to slowly shudder. The
transformed and reconfigured godgems also sought to stabilize, but
they slowly began to tremble as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
awesome aura of the Eternal Omega Sword Dao emanating from Ji Ning’s
body suddenly began to decay, with Ning’s own life aura weakening
as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“No!
I was too hasty!” In the final instant that his Flower of Eternity
fully bloomed, Ning immediately understood where the error lay in his
Eternal Omega Sword Dao</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">If
he had been given a chance to simulate the Daomerge, he would’ve
been able to actually test out some of the assumptions regarding his
Dao and discover its flaws. But he hadn’t had that chance, and so
he had to forge ahead without it!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Samsara
Daolords took a total of four steps, and each step represented them
treading the line between life and death! However, these four steps
were all fairly short steps. They only led the Daolord to rise to a
slightly higher level each time, which was why almost all of the
truly talented Daolords were able to reach the fourth step. However,
the Daomerge represented an enormous chasm!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Even
when ordinary Daolords succeeded in the Daomerge, their power would
rise by two full levels. As for supreme Daolords like Ninedust or
Winesage, they’d immediately become Hegemons. Those slightly weaker
would still reach the Archon level of power.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning’s
Omega Sword Dao would have an even more incredible result. The
mysteries of the Sword Dao alone would result in him improving by two
full levels of power, but he also needed to infuse it with a perfect
sword-heart. In other words, advancing from the fourth-step Daolord
Omega Sword Dao to an Eternal Omega Sword Dao would result in an
increase of more than three full levels of power!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was an enormous step he had to take, and there was no chance at all
to test it out in advance! Even though Ning’s preparations had been
quite plentiful, in the end he had still made a tiny mistake.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“This
must be the true Eternal Omega Sword Dao.” Ning opened his eyes. In
front of him was a faint sheen of sword-light. It looked very
ordinary, with nothing special about it at all. It seemed to have no
aura, no presence… nothing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Rumble…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Unfathomably
far away from the Flamedragon Realmverse, there existed a place. This
place was where the prime essences of the entire Chaosverse were
located, including the prime essence of the Dao of the Sword.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
this is the prime essence of the Dao of the Sword?” Ning’s mind
could clearly and distinctly sense it from afar… and it was
identical in nature to the Eternal Omega Sword Dao he had just
understood.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly,
a surge of invisible power swept out and surrounded Ning’s
consciousness. This power was vast and overwhelming but also as
gentle as a mother’s embrace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
instantly understood. This surge of power was the power of the prime
essences of the Chaosverse. The power was embracing his mind and…
comforting him. It was as though the Chaosverse itself felt a sense
of regret and sympathy towards this cultivator.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“So
I am the only one who has ever comprehended an Eternal Omega Dao?”
Ning understood what the Chaosverse was whispering to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">There
had been others who had embarked upon the path of the Omega Dao, but
all of them had failed during the Daomerge! The vast majority of the
failures didn’t even have a technique like the [Heartsword] art
available to them. Much like Ning, they had only realized how
stringent the requirements for their Dao-hearts were during the
actual Daomerge itself. Most of them had failed due to this.
Occasionally, there were a few incredibly talented Daolords who did
in fact have perfect Dao-hearts, but in the end there were quite a
few errors in the Eternal Omega Dao they devised. Even though they
eventually realized what their mistakes were, there was no way for
them to discover what the right answer was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
had the Autarch’s stone dais, the Stonefire Pearl, the Daomerge
Firecloud Flower, and other external sources of support. He also had
a perfect sword-heart and was at a level of talent that was every bit
the equal of anyone who had come before him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the end, he had still failed the Daomerge… but immediately
afterwards, he had instantly realized what the true Eternal Omega
Sword Dao was. Alas, it was too late! He was now in control of and
the master of the Eternal Omega Sword Dao, but he had already failed
his Daomerge. Each person would only have one chance at the Daomerge.
If you failed it, you failed it. Even the prime essences of the
Chaosverse couldn’t help but sigh on his behalf. Alas, there was
nothing they could do; all they could do was function in the way
their nature instrinsically demanded. Everything they did was simply
an expression of their intrinsic nature, and in truth they weren’t
fully ‘sentient’ by the normal definition of the word.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
they could do was feel and express an innate sense of sorrow and
sympathy for this poor soul.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
Flower of Eternity withered away, its petals crumbling apart and
falling.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">It
had been just a single tiny mistake, but that mistake was still
enough to cause everything to crumble. There was no way for it to
gain eternity.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Divine
power and Immortal energy could be instantly recovered; they didn’t
count for much. The truly lethal aspect of failing the Daomerge was
the dissipation of the soul and truesoul. There was no way at all to
halt or reverse the crumbling of a truesoul. No one was capable of it
whatsoever. Not even Autarchs were able to do this!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-robed Ning within Vastheaven Palace and the black-robed
Primaltwin in the Azureflower Estate were both filled with Ning’s
truesoul. Their failure in the Daomerge caused the truesoul to begin
to crumble. Ning’s soul and truesoul had become incredibly powerful
over his countless years of cultivation, and the Nine Chaos Seals
technique had further strengthened it to the Archon level… but it
was of no use.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Hairline
fractures had already appeared throughout every part of Ning’s
truesoul.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Crack!
A tiny, crystalline piece of truesoul broke free. This fragment was
translucent and dazzlingly beautiful, but as it floated away it
gradually disappeared into nothingness, returning to the prime
essences of the Chaosverse. Those who had their truesouls destroyed
in a chaosworld would see their soul fragments be reclaimed by the
prime essences of the Chaosverse. Those who failed the Daomerge would
see their truesouls slowly and naturally fragment apart, also to be
reclaimed by the Chaosverse. When the final pieces of truesoul were
gone, they would die.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
could do nothing but watch as they slowly died. This was a very cruel
end, and there were some Daolords who would be driven mad as a
result.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
aura of life disappeared from both of Ning’s avatars, and the
truesoul within Ning’s main body and Primaltwin both began to
crumble…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
arose from the altar. Even before the Daomerge had began, he had
already prepared himself for the possibility of failure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“For
one who has found the Dao in the morning, death in the evening is
nothing. I may have failed, but my failure has allowed me to find the
true Eternal Omega Sword Dao. Compared to many other cultivators, I’m
quite lucky. Nothing in the universe will go exactly as one hopes.”
Ning’s gaze was distant. He murmured, “Yu Wei… sorry. I still
failed in the end…”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
didn’t care too much that he had failed the Daomerge and would
perish. Given how long he had cultivated for, why would he fear
death? As for his family, he had already spent an extremely long
period of time by the side of his parents and his daughter. The only
one he felt a debt towards was his wife, Yu Wei.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“I
thought that I was invincible, that I could do anything and
everything. But in the end, there was a limit to what I could
accomplish. My road has come to an end.” Ning waved his hand,
causing a black jade stone to appear before him. This jade stone had
already been cut to be roughly as tall as Ning himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
stretched out his right hand, gently stroking the surface of the
jade. Sword-light appeared from the tips of his fingers, and as it
swept past the jade, tiny bits of jade dust flew everywhere.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Slowly,
the figure of a black-robed maiden became formed from the jade stone.
Her features truly were dazzlingly beautiful, and her aura was quite
extraordinary.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
hint of a smile appeared around Ning’s lips. His wife, Yu Wei,
truly had been a dazzling and beautiful person. She had been the most
beautiful member of the Black-White College.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh.
Whoosh. Whoosh. Ning’s fingers continued to flicker across the jade
stone, causing the sculpture to become more and more distinct. The
jade Yu Wei’s hair seemed to flutter, and her eyes stared lovingly
at Ning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Suddenly,
Ning came to a halt and stepped back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
white-robed Ning and the black-robed Yu Wei stared at each other,
their gazes meeting in the air. It was almost as though she was still
alive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Moments
later, Ning regained his composure. With but a thought, he caused the
sculpture of the black-robed Yu Wei to fly towards him while
shrinking to become palm-sized. As it flew towards Ning’s chest, a
string suddenly appeared out of nowhere and pierced through it. It
hung inside Ning’s clothes like a necklace, pressed against his
bosom.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Ning
gently stroked his chest. “Yu Wei… accompany me on the final
steps of my journey.” Ning then waved his hand, causing all six
Northbow swords to appear before him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Quintessences,
arise!” With but a thought, Ning transformed the quintessences
within his six Lifeblood weapons, upgrading them from the fourth-step
Daolord-level Omega Sword Dao to the Eternal Omega Sword Dao.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Boom!
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! The six Northbow swords all emitted a
keening sound as sword-light flared around them, revealing a
terrifying sharpness. The light circulated across them, revealing
that each and every one of them was changing and evolving from inside
out. They immediately skyrocketed to the Universe treasure level! A
good while later, the light completely vanished from them. Their
power was now so reserved that they were like ordinary pieces of
wood… but in truth, they had already become the deadliest weapons
in all the Chaosverse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">This
was because the quintessence cores within them had been created by
the Eternal Omega Sword Dao, something which had never existed
before. The Dao of the Sword was a Dao meant for battle and
slaughter. In terms of killing power, these six swords had already
vastly outstripped all other Universe treasures.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Whoosh!
Whoosh! Whoosh! All six swords flew back into the sheath on Ning’s
back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">Vastheaven
Palace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“That
aura of might is weakening.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“How
can this be?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“But…”
Emperor Solesky, Hegemon Azurefiend, the Flamewing God, Pillsaint,
and the others were all shocked. Su Youji’s face was completely
ashen and devoid of all color.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Master.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Senior
apprentice-brother.” Ning’s students and ‘fellow disciples’
were all frantic as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
the air outside Vastheaven Palace were Hegemon Brightshore, Hegemon
Windrain, Hegemon Netherlily, Lord Wulf, the Black Emperors, Daoist
Bluestone, Emperor Goldisle, and the other Eternal Emperors. Some
sighed. Some shook their heads. Some smiled with delight. Some had
ugly looks on their faces.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">All
of them had their own thoughts and considerations… but all of them
knew that Daolord Darknorth had just failed the Daomerge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">They
had seen far too many Daolords attempt the Daomerge. If a Daolord
succeeded, there was no way his aura would plummet like that. In
addition, they would also sense an aura of true eternity about that
cultivator.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Darknorth,
a dazzling and peerless Daolord, has come to an end just like that.”
Hegemon Brightshore shook his head and sighed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Daomerges
for Omega Daos are simply too difficult,” Hegemon Windrain said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Go
ahead and report it to Realmslord Windgrace,” Hegemon Netherlily
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">The
three of them had long ago received orders from Realmslord Windgrace
to monitor the situation, and so they all began to send word back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Hurry
up and inform his Majesty that Daolord Darknorth has already failed
the Daomerge.” The distant Lord Wulf could already foresee the
grand war that was about to erupt, but he didn’t dare to delay in
the slightest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">A
bearded, disheveled-looking old man walked out of a courtyard. He
raised his head to stare into the void, his eyes filled with light.
“Daolord Darknorth… he was such an incredibly talented figure,
but he still failed. The war against the Lonely King shall come
next.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">……</P>

large group of onyx humanoids were clustered together within a
realmship. Alongside them were two golden humanoids who were standing
to each side of a silver throne… and a third golden humanoid
dressed in silver robes who was seated on that throne.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">His
gaze was as cold as ice, and the blood-red diamond in his forehead
was beginning to change.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">In
truth, this man had long ago led the entire Icepeak Army to a place
within the Great Dark that was extremely close to the Flamedragon
Realmverse. He had been silently waiting for the signal, as he knew
that if he was to fight against Realmslord Windgrace he couldn’t
afford to get there late.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Your
Majesty, Lord Wulf sends word. Daolord Darknorth has failed the
Daomerge!” a gray-robed Emperor said respectfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“As
expected, he failed.” The Lonely King rested his arms on the
armrests of his throne, then said softly, “Windgrace… let’s see
if you win or if I win.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">“Head
out!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">BOOM!
The realmship tore through spacetime and immediately began to warp
towards the Flamedragon Realmverse.</P>
