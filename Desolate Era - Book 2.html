Chapter 1 - Entering the City
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In a connected area
surrounded by large, tall fences. These fences were six meters tall
and linked together tightly. Beast swarms definitely wouldn’t be
able to charge inside past them. Within the massive wooden fences,
there were stone houses, wooden houses, and large numbers of fur-clad
men, women, children, and elderly people living their lives here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a very
ordinary tribe with several thousand tribesmen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My child was
captured within these few dozen kilometers!” The black-robed man
walked within a mountain forest, heading towards the massive tribal
gate. “And this is the tribe nearest the place he was taken from.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Halt.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Halt.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main gate to the
tribe was shut, and on each side there were two archer towers. Each
archer tower had five powerful, beast-clad warriors within. All of
them had their bows drawn and nocked, and they aimed at the distant,
black-clothed man who was drawing near.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Outsider, state your
intentions.” A warrior atop the archer tower said angrily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed man
glanced at him sideways, as though looking at an ant. His footsteps
didn’t stop, and he continued towards the gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ten warriors on the
archer tower all grew angry…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill him!”
Instantly, ten greatbows shot out at the same time! Beng! Beng! Beng!
One arrow after another screamed through the air at the black-clothed
man, each of them containing enough force to shatter boulders or make
large trees collapse. But when these ten arrows drew near the
black-clothed men, they all went, zizizi….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The shafts of the
arrows cracked, then disintegrated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The man continued to
walk forward.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” The ten
warriors on the archer tower were alarmed, and one of them grabbed
his oxhorn and gave it a mighty blow!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wu, wu, wu!” The
deep sound from the horn was powerful and penetrative. It quickly
spread to the entire tribe, and the men, women, children, and elders
of the tribe all grabbed their weapons while assembling. In order to
survive in this world…men, women, children, and elders all had to
act as battle-hardened warriors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the tribesmen
assembled and began to roar and charge towards the door….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That incomparably thick
black ironwood gate suddenly exploded, transforming into countless
pieces of splinters that flew away. Every single splinter was more
terrifying than the arrows of the tribe’s archers, and in the blink
of an eye, dozens of warriors located close to the door all died or
were maimed. Blood stained the ground, but the warriors weren’t
afraid at all. Instead, they charged forward with even more furious
howls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hold!” A shout
rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A white haired old man
dressed in beast fur transformed into a blur as he charged towards
the empty ground in front of the door.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enraged tribal
warriors came to a halt as they looked at the white-haired old man
who wore a grey beast pelt. This old man was the leader of the tribe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mighty hero, might I
ask, what can our Goldblade Tribe do to assist you?” The
white-haired old man bowed respectfully. Someone capable of
shattering their gate just through releasing his internal energy was,
without a question, a Xiantian lifeform, and Xiantian lifeforms, even
amongst the local hegemon, the Ji clan, were people with extremely
exalted statuses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At this moment, the
black-clothed man leisurely strolled in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I ask you.” The
black-clothed man looked at the white-haired elder. “Have there
been any serpent monsters in the area recently?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Serpent monsters?”
The white-haired old man paused, then hurriedly nodded. “There are.
Recently, a serpent monster appeared, and many small tribes were
devastated by it. The week following that, the tribes sent the news
to the Ji clan…and the Ji clan sent their black armored riders to
resolve with that calamitous snake monster.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-clothed man’s
narrow eyes flashed with cold light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So it was indeed the Ji
clan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ji clan was a
powerful organization in this area. Even an ancient monster like him
didn’t want to go bother it. He had previously guessed that it must
have been the Ji clan which had captured his son Redtip, and now it
seemed this was indeed the case.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Killed or captured?”
The black-clothed man continued to ask.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Taken alive.” The
white-haired old man said. “The Ji clan sent their black armored
riders, who captured the snake monster alive, then went back. Most
likely, it is currently in West Prefecture City!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“West Prefecture
City?” The black-clothed man’s eyes had a hint of fire hidden
within them. The fire of rage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">West Prefecture City,
to Diremonsters, was the most dangerous place possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That was where the
experts of the Ji clan of the Western Prefecture gathered!
Diremonsters didn’t dare go there. If his child was there…the
chance of him being able to rescue his child and bring him back was
very, very low.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Human.” The
black-clothed man looked at the white-haired elder. His voice was
cold. “Do you know who I am?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the white-haired
elder heard himself be addressed as ‘human’, his face instantly
changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Monster!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And it was a terrifying
Diremonster who could take human form!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huhuhu…” The
temperature suddenly dropped, and a vast layer of frost began to
appear. Even plumes of snow began to drift down. The terrifying low
temperature began to spread, and the surrounding tribal warriors
quickly were frozen into ice, then shattered into small pieces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, leave!” The
white-haired old man’s hair and eyebrows had a layer of ice form
over them, and the tribesmen behind him roared, “A Diremonster!
Flee, flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the tribesmen
gritted their teeth, enduring their pain and rage as they began to
flee. Many other tribal warriors shouted heroically as they charged
towards the black-clothed man like maddened demons, but when they got
near him…the layer of frost on their bodies grew thicker, and then
they quickly turned into ice statues.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old man’s
internal energy was valiantly fighting. He howled out stutteringly,
“You dare provoke the mighty Ji clan?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Provoke?” The
black-clothed man’s pitch-black long hair fluttered in the air. His
eyes flashed with a scarlet red light. “The snake monster was my
child, my most beloved child. I’m not only going to provoke them,
I’m also going to break into the West Prefecture City!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Roaaaar!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A world-shaking furious
howl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-clothed man
transformed into a coiled serpent, an enormous black serpent which
howevered in mid-air. The enormous scaled wings of the coiled serpent
fully extended, like a massive net which blocked the sun off from the
tribesmen. The tribesmen who had scattered in each direction raised
their head and saw this terrifying sight, and all of them were filled
with utter terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s Serpentwing!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s the
Diremonster of Serpentwing Lake!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not a single tribal
warrior now had the thought of fighting back. Ever since they were
born, they had heard the ancient legends of the ‘Diremonster of
Serpentwing Lake’. They knew how terrifying Serpentwing was. There
was no way their Goldblade Clan could fight against this sort of
terrifying Diremonster!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you must
die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous
Serpentwing enveloped the area below with its massive wings,
bloodlust in its scarlet red eyes. It suddenly opened its massive maw
and breathed. Huuuuuu. An endless, freezing black wind arose, so
strong that even a layer of the ground was stripped off, and some
stone houses collapsed. The large amount of black wind quickly
surrounded the entire area for nearly ten kilometers around.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cough, cough.” The
tribesmen all held their throats, their bodies quickly turning pitch
black.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” A woman held
her child, tears running down her face like a river.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Diremonster, the Ji
clan will definitely avenge us!” A powerful warrior who had reached
the peak of power in internal energy stopped his own breathing, but
the poisonous gas stilled penetrated through his skin. In the last
moment of his life, all he could do was let out this bitter shout.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The territory of the
Goldblade Tribe turned into a desolate, silent wasteland. Not a hint
of life or sound. All of the tribesmen of the Goldblade Tribe had
been turned to ice statues, shattered into pieces, or poisoned to
death. The entire area for ten kilometers around…had turned into a
charnel house. Even poisonous bug-type creatures had been poisoned to
death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous
Serpentwing gently flapped its wings as it stared below. After
sensing that all life was gone, it casually flew away at high speed,
disappearing into the sky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Night descended. A cold
wind blew drearily. The distant, massive West Prefecture City
stretched off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swoosh!” A black
shadow easily flashed past the walls, avoiding the patrolling black
armored riders and stealthily entering the city.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My child, where are
you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-clothed man
began to search within West Prefecture City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the first time
the Diremonster, Serpentwing, had entered West Prefecture City. After
investigating for a long time, he discovered, to his pain, “Monsters
that are taken alive are all delivered to the inner city. And the
inner city is the place where the Ji clan lives. It is guarded very
tightly. There are many Xiantian lifeforms living there…there is no
way I can sneak in.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sneaking into West
Prefecture City was fairly easy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sneaking into the inner
city?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That was the place
where the clan members of the Ji clan lived. How exceedingly tight
did the security of such a place have to be?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hu!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A moment later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the air above the
West Prefecture City, Serpentwing flew high into the sky while at the
same time, using its natural-born ability to control water, it
quickly created a large amount of fog and clouds with the moisture in
the air. The fog surrounded the nearby area, and he secretly stared
down below from the skies, carefully watching every single place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Past midnight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was by himself in
Dragon Castle. Today was the day for his once every three days cage
battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black armored
riders and some servants of Dragon castle were all extremely
respectful to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s father was the
number one expert of the Ji clan! And Ning himself was extremely
talented, so many people had already begun to believe…Ning would be
the next Prefecture Lord. One could imagine how exalted his status
was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prepare the most
formidable monster.” Ning laughed and called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Recently, we had a
powerful monster delivered here. It was brought to us by Commander
Blindfish. It has the lineage of the Fiendgods.” A one-armed old
man called out loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A monster with
Fiendgod lineage?” Ning revealed a hint of delight on his face.
“Excellent. Today I’ll be able to have a fun fight then. Quick,
arrange for it to be sent to the cage.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The one-armed old man
went to make the arrangements.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dragon Castle was
divided into the cage and the beast tunnels. Naturally, the beast
tunnels was where the monsters lived, all of which were kept in
captivity here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Roaaar!” The
massive red serpent wrapped up in chains, upon seeing the human in
the massive cage outside, let out a deep, angry growl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Keep shouting.”
The one-armed old man sneered coldly. “You ate so many humans.
Today is the day of your death. Go. Open the door, and then release
the chains…let it enter the cage.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The servants who had
been installed here for the purposes of taking care of the monsters
went to make the arrangements.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rumble.” After
opening the gate between the cage and the beast tunnels, a faint,
glimmering light could be seen from afar. The giant red snake
instantly looked over and began to let out a growling sound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Release the chains.”
The one-armed elder ordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clank.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clank.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One chain after another
was released. Feeling the layers of chains on its body quickly
loosen, the giant red snake couldn’t help but begin to wriggle,
making the chains rattle against each other. After the last one was
released…with a clanking sound, the entire chain apparatus fell to
the floor with a loud sound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant red snake
stared coldly at the one-armed elder, and then slithered its way at
high speed out of the tunnel towards the place which had just been
opened to it. It quickly arrived in the cage outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the enormous
cage…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A red-lipped,
white-toothed, fur-clad young man was staring at it from afar. The
giant red snake’s saliva instantly began to drool out. Given the
extensive man-eating experience it had, it had the sudden
knowledge…that this sort of human youngster’s flesh was
definitely the most tender and most delicious of them all.

Chapter 2 - Mercy
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
distant giant red snake and he softly murmured, “The entire body is
blood red, but the scales around the chest are bright silver, and a
pair of red eyes…oh, and it has two claws as well?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Slitherslitherslither…”
The giant red snake slowly began to move. Its enormous serpentine
head raised high as it stared at Ning. Its natural-born arrogance
caused it to hold the human youth in front of it in no regard at all.
According to its experience, those people in the tribes like this
youth were all very weak. Even though this was the lair of the Ji
clan, this sort of youth shouldn’t be that strong.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a light
harrumph.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The air in his chest
came out as he breathed, shaping into two streams of energy that were
visible to the naked eye. His entire body turned slightly red, and a
powerful aura began to emanate from him. The distant giant red snake
was startled. He could suddenly sense this young man in front of him
had a terrifying aura that was no weaker than its own.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Recently, I haven’t
had a lot of practice with the [Raindrop Sutra]. I’ll use you to
train it.” Ning suddenly moved forward by several dozen meters, the
sharp sword in his hand stabbing out at the giant scarlet snake at
lightning speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant scarlet snake
sent its two massive sharp claws at its thorax directly towards Ning
in an arcing slash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shua! Shua! Shua!”
Sword flashing hundreds of times like a fog of light, one stab after
another was delivered towards the giant red snake. The giant red
snake only dodged three sword attacks aimed at its vitals, taking the
rest of the attacks head on. Only a few white spots appeared on its
scales. This caused the giant red snake to unconsciously
underestimate the strength of this young human by a bit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wu…..”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A strange rumble sound.
It was the sound of Ning’s sharp sword slashing through the air,
instantly slashing towards the giant red snake’s chest, suddenly
creating a two meter long massive wound. The scales split open, and
the muscles beneath were torn apart, and fresh red blood instantly
spewed out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Roaaar!” The giant
red snake was instantly shocked. How was it that the youth in front
of him had suddenly become so powerful?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was no longer the
callow youth who had battled against the Howling Moonwolf. His
constant battles against monstrous beasts had given him much
experience. Right now, he was actually only using half of his
strength, but because the [Shadewind Steps] and the [Raindrop Sutra]
all were quite exquisite in the application of force, he still wasn’t
at any disadvantage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First, Ning utilized a
chain of attacks, ‘Drizzling Rain’, but against this giant red
snake, it proved useless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Then, Ning used the
vicious, powerful killing attack, ‘Rain Line’, which was the
technique Ning used to leave that massive, large wound on the giant
red snake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next, Ning used the
penetrating ‘Raindrop Pierces Rocks’ attack.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Following that, Ning
blocked the wild attacks of the giant red snake by using the
technique, ‘Thin Streams Flow Forever’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Raindrop Sutra]
had a total of nine stances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These stances were,
‘Drizzling Rain’, ‘Tempest Curtain’, ‘Thin Streams Flow
Forever’, ‘Watertight’, ‘Rain Line’, ‘Eternally Fresh
Waterflow’, ‘Merciless Waterflow’, and ‘Raindrop Pierces
Rocks’!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some were attack
stances, some were defensive stances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the attack
stances, however, included defensive components. The profoundness of
this technique constantly caused Ning to sigh in amazement and be
mesmerized. After all, he hadn’t even reached the level of
‘expertise’ in this technique, and although his own father,
Yichuan, had reached the level of ‘mastery’ long ago, his father
was still studying the [Raindrop Sutra], because the more one
reflected on the [Raindrop Sutra], the more one realized how
boundless its scope was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This technique,
‘Thin Unending Waterflow’, should be an unrestrained, free-willed
attack.” Under the attacks of this monstrous beast with Fiendgod
lineage, Ning occasionally had some insights with regards to his
sword techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the giant red
snake, by contrast, was growing furious!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It could tell that this
human youth was using it to train in swordplay. Although there were
many wounds on its body already, none of them were lethal. But the
youth in front of him had only suffered a few light wounds…which
instantly healed in the blink of an eye. The youth in front of it was
so terrifying that its heart quailed, while at the same time, it felt
fear that it was going to die at the hands of this human youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But even if it was
going to die, its inborn arrogance and pride wouldn’t allow it to
be toyed with to death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Roaaaaar.” The
giant red snake suddenly let out a wild, earthshaking howl, filled
with rage, unwillingness, and carried with it the knowledge of its
death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The howl split the air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the air above the
inner reaches of the Ji clan, there were many clouds. Within one of
the clouds was the black Winged Snake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Roaaaar.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By the time this howl
made it to the heavens, it was very weak, but Serpentwing was an
extremely sensitive Diremonster. In addition, the roar was the
familiar voice of its child.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is Redtip! My
son!” Serpentwing was instantly certain of this. It had been
searching around the inner city the entire time, and from kilometers
away, its gaze had clearly made out the building known as the Cage.
But because of the fog and because of all the steel chains above the
cage, it simply couldn’t tell what the Cage actually was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But just at that
moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon hearing the sound,
it immediately knew that the sound was coming from that cage area!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There it is!”
Serpentwing immediately charged down, its body still wrapped by
clouds and fogs, shrouding it from view.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the cage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, hearing the
grief-stricken, enraged howl of the giant red snake, knew how the
giant red snake was feeling. Immediately, a sharp sword appeared in
his left hand as well. “Since you beg for death, then die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly
transformed into a tempest and charged at the giant red snake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword light flashed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Thunderflame Sword] -
Thunderflash Flint! Blazing Thunderclap!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Raindrop Sutra] -
Merciless Waterflow! Raindrop Pierces Rocks!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red eyes in the
upraised head of the giant red snake slowly dimmed. There was a deep
hole in its head now, which had pierced straight through its skull.
And then, its massive body collapsed to the ground like a pile of
mud, causing the earth to shake. Fresh blood flowed outwards,
staining the ground in a river of red blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ning looked
at the corpse of the massive red snake, then inspected its wound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was studying how
effective his killing blow had been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blazing Thunderclap
truly is a powerful attack. It actually drilled such a massive hole
into the snake’s chest. It almost split the snake in half.” Ning
nodded as he continued to inspect the damage. “Merciless Waterflow
and Thunderflash Flint can both be described in one word; fast!
Merciless Waterflow is both fast and agilely unpredictable, while
Thunderflash Flint is fast and explosive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Raindrop Pierces
Rocks has good penetrative ability. It was easily able to pierce
through this snake’s skull.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the air above the
cage, a massive creature was descending through the clouds. Compare
to Serpentwing, his child, Redtrip, was nothing more than a tadpole!
Serpentwing’s scarlet eyes could already see through the chains of
the cage to the scene below. It saw the desolate, miserable sight of
the blood-splattered serpent corpse lying on the soft earth, and as
it saw this, it felt a terrible fire suddenly fill its consciousness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My child!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing had gone
totally mad. “Human, pay for my child’s death!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The powerful energy
vibrations coming from above the cage made Ning raise his head to
take a look.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning
immediately saw that hundreds of meters away, within the clouds, an
enormous serpent with barely visible pair of giant wings was staring
at him. The creature was currently charging downwards at him…its
wingspan alone was larger than the entire cage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-eyed snake’s
eyes were filled with boundless killing intent. Ning was shocked, and
he understood…that the creature charging down from above was here
to kill him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good. Flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned his head
and immediately wanted to flee!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But just as he wanted
to flee, he realized that the corridor he had come through had been
shut. Generally speaking, during cage battles, they would always be
shut, to prevent someone from fleeing before the battle was over!
Only after obtaining victory would Ning order people to open the
tunnel…but he just killed the giant red snake moments ago, and
hadn’t had the chance to give the order yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, as he had
started the cage battle, he had forbidden others from watching him.
Generally speaking, only his father watched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all, his true
power was something that had remained a secret all along. For
example, the fact that he used twin swords or that he could use
ordinary swords to kill a peak Houtian level Godbeast…these were
all secrets. The outside world still believed that Ning relied on
sharp precious weapons to slay Godbeasts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shua!” “Shua!”
Ning immediately threw away the two swords in his hands, and
instantly, two more swords appeared; the Darknorth swords!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning exploded forth
with all his power, hacking away at the thick chains above him, while
also calling out frantically at the top of his lungs, “FATHER!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sound rang out, but
the speed of sound was actually slower than the downward charging
speed of Serpentwing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dangdangdang!”
Ning’s Darknorth swords wildly chopped against the steel chain net
up above. In the past, his father, Yichuan had said this: “Given
your strength…if you are to use the power within the [Crimsonbright
Diagram of the Nine Heavens] and use your full strength, you should
be able to break apart the chains. But a web like this formed from
many chains…you will probably need the span of ten breaths before
you are able to break enough chains to escape.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now that Ning had
the Darknorth swords. They were indeed sharp. Dangdangdang…one
chain after another was shattered, but there were simply too many of
them. To break enough to allow him to escape would probably require
the span of one breath.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One breath?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The terrifying creature
charging from above wouldn’t even need a second before arriving!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No time.” Even as
Ning was chopping the steel chains, he immediately understood this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The massive scaled
wings sliced through the air, striking against the chain of webs.
These steel chains, which were incomparably tough for Ning, were
extremely feeble in the face of this attack of a thousand year old
monster. With a series of shattering sounds, countless chains broke
apart and flew everywhere. And then, the scaled wings swept directly
against Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pay with your own
life for my son’s!” Serpentwing’s red eyes stared wildly at
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dodge.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twin swords in his
hands, Ning quickly dodged while at the same time, using the same
technique with both swords; ‘Thin Unending Waterflow’. His sword
flashed, receiving the scaled wing that came from above.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One layer of sword
flash after another intersected, and both swords combined, forming an
endless web of sword light. It was as though multiple layers of silk
were being wrapped around the opponent’s attack, restricting it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He launched ten of
these attacks in a row!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” The massive
scaled wing smashed down upon the twin Darknorth swords, and the
power of this strike caused Ning to instantly feel the bones in his
wrists splitting apart. And then, the blade-like edges of the wing
cleaved down upon the dodging Ning, slashing straight through the
Goldstar Shirt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pu!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fresh blood sprayed
out, and his left arm, still clutching a Darknorth sword, went
flying. Ning’s entire body was sent smashing into the blackwater
iron wall, creating a human-shaped impression into the wall. Ning
vomited out a large mouthful of blood from his lips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hu!” Serpentwing
raised its scaled wings again, preparing to deal yet another cleaving
blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the moment!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The now one-armed Ning
gritted his teeth, then suddenly scurried out like a massive
grasshopper through the broken cage. [Shadewind Steps]. He used this
footwork technique to its absolute limits, flashing out like a streak
of azure light, fleeing outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” A violent
wind attacked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Looking behind him,
Ning saw an enormous black blur sweep towards him. That was the
massive serpent tail of Serpentwing. This whipping attack by
Serpentwing’s tail was even faster and even fiercer than the attack
of his scaled wings! The air it passed through exploded with
terrifying sonic booms, and the tough marble stones of Dragon Castle
began to split apart…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous black tail
was everywhere, surrounding Ning. Given Ning’s speed, there was
simply no way he would be able to dodge this attack at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m finished!”

Chapter 3 - Life and Death
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within his courtyard,
Yichuan was currently wielding a blue longsword, chopping and
piercing against a tree trunk. Chop, pierce, scrape, slice…he only
used these most basic of movements and didn’t even use much force,
and so the tree trunk only had some scratches appear on its surface.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His wife, Snow, held a
bottle of water nearby, watching her man train with a smile on her
face, occasionally sprinkling some water on the nearby flowers and
grass.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrm?” Yichuan and
Snow simultaneously turned to look in the same direction. Both of
them sensed a vibration of energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dragon Castle.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan and Snow
simultaneously leaped onto the rooftop of the building, staring at
the distant Dragon Castle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dragon Castle was built
in a fairly out-of-the-way location in the inner city, at least two
kilometers or so away from where Yichuan and his wife lived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They saw…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the air above Dragon
Castle was the enormous Serpentwing. Serpentwing’s scaled wings
were currently covering the entirety of Dragon Castle, and a
bloodstained youth with only one arm was scurrying out of Dragon
Castle at high speed, while an enormous draconic tail flashed towards
him like lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow’s eyes instantly
turned red. She let out an agonized howl. “Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the distance was
too far.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was no time at
all!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Vermin!” Yichuan
exploded with anger, letting out a sudden, ferocious chop with the
blue sword in his hands. Hua! A brilliant wave of blue light flew out
from his sword. The three hundred meter long wave of blue light was
even slightly larger than Serpentwing itself! It slashed through the
air, chopping directly towards Serpentwing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pengpengpeng!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant tail of
Serpentwing, in the blink of an eye, was struck dozens of times. The
entire Dragon Castle exploded and collapsed, sending large amounts of
rocks flying everywhere. Many of the servants, guards, and members of
the Ji clan who lived around Dragon Castle were injured or wounded,
and their blood splashed everywhere. Even some of the monstrous
beasts inside the beast tunnels were killed by the impact.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as Ning scurried
out of the cage, he was attacked by the massive tail of the serpent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew that in front
of this Winged Snake monstrosity, the Goldstar Shirt of his might as
well have been paper. All he had was a peak Houtian level Fiendgod
body….he probably would be smashed into a pile of pulverized flesh
in an instant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning simply couldn’t
accept this. In this life, he had such a healthy, strong body, had a
pair of doting parents, and had the chance to train to become an
Immortal, to control his own destiny. He had trained for so long…and
everything was just starting. He truly couldn’t accept this!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dodge!” Ning used
the [Shadewind Steps] with all his might.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quick, quicker,
quicker!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hu!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hu!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wind was howling!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hu! Ning’s body was
howling as well!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” The
serpent’s tail came smashing down. It scraped past Ning, then
smashed against the thick marble rocks of Dragon Castle. Instantly,
the entire Dragon Castle had shuddered and large amounts of marble
rock had shattered and been sent flying everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You managed to
dodge?” The red-eyed Serpentwing howled, “You were lucky enough
to dodge once, but do you think you’ll dodge twice?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The serpent tail swung
down at him again!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning was like a
piece of paper, fluttering about in the breeze, as agile as the wind,
as unpredictable as a shadow. The serpent tail once again missed
Ning, smashing against Dragon Castle once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible!”
Serpentwing was now truly enraged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was a Diremonster
who had trained for thousands of years and had reached the late-stage
Xiantian level. It was many times more powerful than those ordinary
early-stage Xiantian Diremonsters. For someone of its power, killing
a youth should be simplicity itself, much like how it has easily
slaughtered those thousands of tribesmen in the Goldblade Tribe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pengpengpeng!
Serpentwing wildly struck everywhere with its tail, and its wings
struck out as well. The entire Dragon Castle was shuddering and on
the verge of collapse, and large amounts of stones were flying
everywhere. Many servants and black armored riders lost their lives…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Diediedie!”
Serpentwing was frantic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A wild cold aura
emanated from him, and the temperature dropped, causing some servants
to immediately freeze to death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black poisonous
mist came out, and the surrounding Houtian level lifeforms all were
poisoned to death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning continued to
dodge time and time again in that massive cloud of dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The cold aura could
freeze to death those peak Houtian Ki Refining warriors, but Ning,
who trained in the Fiendgod Body Refining technique, his body was
more than a hundred times stronger than those Houtian Ki Refiners.
These large-scale cold air and poison gas attacks couldn’t harm him
at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Like the wind. Like
the shadows.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shadewind Steps.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the
Shadewind Steps. The true Shadewind Steps.” Ning totally immersed
himself in it, allowing those strikes from the enormous Serpentwing
to come as they will, allowing the scaled wings to slash at him as
they pleased. He simply followed the natural force of the wind and
borrowed it, and also the force of the wind created by his opponent,
Serpentwing, to dodge agilely time and time again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He moved like a shadow.
Serpentwing couldn’t hit him, no matter how he tried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He moved like the wind.
Ning’s body flickered everywhere with such gentle ease, as though
he were a leaf that was being blown by the gentle wind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One with the world!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This youngster has
actually reached the level of ‘one with the world’? His footwork
is at the ‘one with the world’ level?” The vicious,
otherworldly ancient monster, Serpentwing, was finally certain that
this human youth who had killed his son had actually reached the
level of ‘one with the world’. This was a level which this old
monster hadn’t reached yet, despite having trained for thousands of
years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One with the world!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking,
only Zifu Disciples were at the ‘one with the world’ level, while
some powerful Xiantian lifeforms would also reach the ‘one with the
world’ level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Humans naturally had a
greater potential for insight than monsters!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only the likes of
Godbeasts were on par with humans in terms of understanding.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damnable.” The
ancient monster, Serpentwing, knew that in a short period of time, he
wouldn’t be able to kill this human youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Vermin!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous blue sword
light attacked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ancient monster,
Serpentwing, swung his tail towards that blue sword light, not caring
about it at all. “Yichuan, do you think that your sword light can
harm me from a distance of two kilometers?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dark green blood
splattered everywhere, and wherever the blood splattered, the ground
hissed and bubbled. The marble and the blackwater iron all quickly
dissolved. That enormous, thick tail had been cut so deeply, it was
nearly severed in half.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could it be this
powerful?” Serpentwing was truly frightened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The number one expert
of the Ji clan’s West Prefecture truly was too terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hu!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll let you live
for now!” Serpentwing tossed Ning a furious glare, and then with a
beat of its two wings, flew into the sky at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Vermin!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Serpentwing, you
dare to barge into the Ji clan’s West Prefecture, and you think you
can flee?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From multiple areas in
the inner city, there erupted furious roars, including those of Ji
Lee and Ji Young, as well as dozens of Xiantian lifeforms, all of
whom shouted at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Loan me your Azure
Firebird.” Yichuan transformed into a ray of light, flying onto a
giant blue bird that was in mid-flight, which had a blue fire blazing
on its tail. On the back of this blue bird, there was a woman dressed
in black.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yichuan, I’ll come
with you.” The black-clothed woman said in her hoarse voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan swept the area
below with his gaze. Seeing his son standing within the rubble of
Dragon Castle, he couldn’t help but let out a sigh of relief…but
seeing the bloodstained severed arm of his son, he felt his fury
blaze up once more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hu!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan and the
black-clothed woman, riding the Azure Firebird, tore through the air,
pursuing in the direction of the fleeing Serpentwing. As for the
other Xiantian level people in the West Prefecture, all of them were
roaring with fury. A Diremonster had dared to barge into the inner
city of the Ji clan’s West Prefecture City? This was totally
against all reason!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But humans at the
Xiantian level were not capable of flight yet, and so they could only
watch as Yichuan and his companion flew on the back of the Azure
Firebird in pursuit of Serpentwing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning remained within
that state of being ‘one with the world’. He could sense the
strength of the wind, and he could borrow that strength to become as
carefree as the wind itself. He could even borrow the attacking
strength of the enemy to dodge the enemy’s attacks, as though he
were the enemy’s shadow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A feeble moan caused
Ning to look around him. The entire Dragon Castle had been reduced to
rubble. A large number of servants and black armored riders had died
gruesome deaths, either smashed, frozen, or poisoned to death. The
sight was unbearable to see.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The joy he felt at
having the ‘one with the world’ level of the [Shadewind Steps]
faded away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning ground his teeth.
With a leap, he entered the field of rubble. He began kicking aside
pieces of rock, and quickly found his severed left arm, then
re-absorbed the Darknorth sword his left arm was clutching back into
his kalestone. And then, Ning grabbed his severed left arm with his
right arm, pressing it against the stump. By now, the severed stump
was no longer bleeding any more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Connect.” Ning
connected the severed arm to the stump, and then extended the
Goldstar Shirt to quickly encapsulate his left arm as well, putting
it back into position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even in his previous
life, a severed hand or arm that had only been severed recently could
be reattached.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning currently had the
body of a Fiendgod. A severed arm only needed a few hours to be
regrown, much less a severed arm that was being reattached…Ning
could clearly sense his muscles and flesh rapidly grow back, and his
bones were quickly reaching out and connecting as well. His arm had
already been reattached, but he would still need a little bit longer
before reaching his perfect state.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning!” A somewhat
frantic sound rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised his head
up. He saw an old man who wore a dark red beast fur pelt standing in
the rubble looking down at him. This man was the Prefecture Lord, Ji
Young. Prefecture Lord Young saw that Ning was unharmed, and only
then let out a sigh of relief. “As long as you aren’t hurt. As
long as you aren’t hurt.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning.” An agonized
shout.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t have the
chance to speak with the Prefecture Lord. He hurriedly made his way
out from the debris field, and saw from far away his mother running
towards him, her face covered with bitter tears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother.” Ning
called out repeatedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing her son standing
there, Snow instantly began to shed tears of joy. Ning quickly ran
towards his mother at high speed, then hugged her. Snow hugged her
son back. “Wonderful, wonderful. I was so frightened just now. If
anything had happened to you, I really don’t know what I would’ve
done.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother, I’m fine.”
Ning said repeatedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your arm?” Snow
looked carefully at her son’s left arm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s fine. Look.”
Ning waved his left arm around. The bones and flesh of his left arm
had been totally connected by now, and even the cells had been 80%
regenerated. Most likely, in just a little bit longer, he would be in
perfect condition.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did Snow
completely relax. She knew how powerful her son’s recuperative
ability was, as a Fiendgod Body Refiner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What happened? How
could this Diremonster, Serpentwing, dare to have the temerity to
attack our Ji clan’s Western Manor?” A heroic voice rang out, and
the red-haired viper elder, Ji Lee, came running over, his face
filled with fury. “This vermin is asking to be killed. Also, we
need to immediately investigate why it charged and attacked our Ji
clan’s Western Prefecture City.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is indeed
strange. Doesn’t Serpentwing know that by acting in such a way, it
has fully infuriated the Ji clan of the Western Prefecture?” A
skinny old man with a scar over his forehead said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One Xiantian individual
after another walked over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing the destroyed
Dragon Castle and the large number of corpses and bloodstains, the
dozens of Xiantian individuals had very ugly looks on their faces. As
the administrators of this large expanse of land, it had been a long
time since a Diremonster had dared to attack the West Prefecture.
Every single expert of the Ji clan of the Western Prefecture felt
both fury and shame.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It must die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We absolutely must
kill that Diremonster, Serpentwing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill it!”
</P>

Chapter 4 - Yichuan’s Rage
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flames on the
plumage of the Azure Firebird swirled around it as it flew in the
skies, the desolate winds howling past it as it chased after that
giant scaled and winged serpent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the back of the
Azure Firebird were two figures who were each half-kneeling; Ji
Yichuan, and that black-clothed woman. The black-clothed woman stared
at the rapidly fleeing Serpentwing. “Yichuan, this Serpentwing is a
late-stage Xiantian level Diremonster. It is quite a bit stronger
than my Azure Firebird. Although the Azure Firebird is good at
long-distance flight, it’ll still be hard to catch up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Lady Flower, I’ll
handle this.” Yichuan’s face was as cold as ice. From within his
hands, a silver greatbow suddenly appeared out of nowhere, while in
his left hand was an arrow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bow was fully
drawn. Yichuan stared coldly at the fleeing Serpentwing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swish!” The arrow
suddenly transformed into a ray of light, streaking towards the
fleeing Serpentwing. At such a short range, the terrifying speed at
which Yichuan had launched this arrow, combined with Serpentwing’s
massive body, meant that there was no way it could dodge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of pure
archery skill, Yichuan was perhaps inferior to Blindfish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But most of the men of
the Ji clan were skilled in archery, and this arrow of Yichuan’s…in
terms of speed, was even faster than Blindfish’s!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The arrow struck
Serpentwing’s body, then instantly exploded, creating an enormous,
bloody hole. A massive, bone-exposing wound was revealed on the
serpent’s body, and it seemed as though with just one more arrow,
this serpent would completely explode from the inside. Actually,
Yichuan’s arrow had been aimed at those bony wings. But Serpentwing
knew…once his scaled, bony wings were injured, he wouldn’t be
able to flee. Thus, he had used his own serpentine body to block the
arrow instead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Crackle…” The
flesh on the serpent’s body quickly closed, and blood stopped
flowing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing continued
to flee wildly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yichuan, your Ji
clan killed my son. Can it be that you won’t let me seek revenge?”
Serpentwing shouted backwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Vermin, if you let
yourself die peacefully, I’ll let you die fast. Otherwise, I’ll
make sure you regret it.” Half-kneeling on the back of the Azure
Firebird, Yichuan once more nocked that silver greatbow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing hurriedly
moved to dodge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yet another arrow
blasted against Serpentwing’s body. Serpentwing howled in agony,
and his heart was frantic. “Yichuan is the number one expert of the
Ji clan of the West Prefecture, true, but how can he be this
powerful? Earlier, from the great distance of two kilometers, the
sword flash of Yichuan’s had still been powerful enough to injure
me severely. And now, a single arrow of his can injure me. Even a
peak Xiantian-level Diremonster is only at most able to hold me down;
there’s no way one would be able to demolish me so easily!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing’s courage
had been entirely shattered by that sword flash from earlier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sword flash that
could heavily injure him despite having come from over two kilometers
away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If it was executed at a
closer distance, wouldn’t it have killed him in one blow?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swish!” “Swish!”
“Swish!” Yichuan fired one arrow after another, and Serpentwing
could only grit his teeth and use his body to block it. Fortunately,
his massive body was hundreds of meters long. Although his enormous
body now had over ten massive craters in it, given his powerful life
force, he could still maintain his high speed flight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, the wide expanse
of earth below gave way to a wide lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hu!” Serpentwing
immediately charged downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Serpentwing Lake.”
Yichuan and the black-clothed woman’s faces both changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing Lake was
over a hundred kilometers long. One couldn’t even see the ends of
the lake…and what’s more, it was Serpentwing’s lair.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous
Serpentwing plummeted down from the skies, diving into the lake. A
few large waves arose, but the creature itself had disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Azure
Firebird, it continued to hover in the air above Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yichuan, what should
we do?” The black-clothed woman asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fled?” Yichuan
stood on the back of the Azure Firebird, staring down at the massive
lake. He said coldly, “He thinks that just because he is hiding in
the water that I won’t be able to do anything to him? Lady Flower,
loan me the Azure Firebird for now. I’d like to trouble you, Lady
Flower, to immediately return to the West Prefecture…and have my
spirit-beast, the serpent, come over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The
black-clothed woman nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-clothed woman
transformed into a streak of light, flashing across the surface of
the lake, then disappearing into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the depths of
Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous
Serpentwing lay coiled at the bottom, occasionally licking some of
its enormous wounds with its tongue. His enormous life force and
regenerative force was causing his wounds to quickly grow stronger,
and his flesh was visibly regrowing and extending.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Yichuan.”
Serpentwing’s eyes were filled with disbelief. “How can he be
this powerful? That Ji Lee is the number two expert of the Ji clan of
the West Prefecture. In the past, when we fought against each other,
he only had somewhat of an advantage over me…but most likely, if
this Yichuan is allowed to draw close to me, he would be able to kill
me with one blow of his sword. How can the difference be this great?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Before this,
Serpentwing had been confident in his fleeing abilities. As he viewed
it, he was a late-stage Xiantian-level Diremonster. Even if he ran
into a terrifying peak Xiantian-level creature…he would at most be
at an disadvantage. He would still be able to flee. As long as he
wasn’t attacked by an entire group of Xiantian life forms, he
should be fine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But that sword of
Yichuan’s had scared him silly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Groooowl.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gaaaaaa!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The monsters within
Serpentwing Lake all began to howl fiercely. This sound instantly
caused great shock to Serpentwing, deep within the waters of the
lake. He could understand those monstrous cries.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Diremonster has
come?” Serpentwing was greatly shocked. “Right, one of the
Diremonsters that the Ji clan of the West Prefecture has tamed is a
water-type Diremonster.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some monsters were
avian-types, skilled at flight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Others were
water-types, extremely powerful in the water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some non-water races,
upon entering the water, would see their power drop! For example,
Yichuan…in the water, his speed probably would be less than a tenth
of his usual speed. But in the water, Serpentwing would be even
faster than on land! Even if Yichuan were to use his sword
techniques, with the water blocking him, the power of his techniques
would be much lower as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of course, although the
power of Yichuan’s sword techniques would be greatly reduced, he
could still kill Serpentwing! The problem was that in the water, he
would be completely unable to catch Serpentwing. No matter how
powerful his sword techniques were, it would be of no use.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother Black, go
search and find that Serpentwing.” Yichuan stood on the surface of
the lake, but didn’t sink down at all. “Although he is more
powerful than you, he is badly wounded. In addition, after finding
him, you just need to tie him down for a while and prevent him from
escaping. I will immediately charge over and slay him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Leave it to me.”
The coiled black serpent nodded on the surface of the lake, then
immediately sank its entire body into the depths, beginning to search
within Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those lesser monsters
in the lake all fled in every direction, screaming in terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Azure Firebird.”
Yichuan looked at the Azure Firebird above him. “Stay up there and
keep a lookout. Once Serpentwing flees from the lake, immediately
chase after and kill him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The
Azure Firebird spoke in a soft voice, then rose at a high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan’s face was
grim. Wielding his blue longsword, he paced about on the surface of
the lake as though it were flat land. One step at a time, he walked,
leaving faint ripples on the surface. His cold gaze stared at his
surroundings, as though he could see straight through the lake water
to the depths of the lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji clan’s West
Prefecture.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was dark now, and
the commotion caused by Serpentwing’s attack in the Ji clan’s
West Prefecture had died down as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father.” Ji
Jadewich, his hair parted into dozens of braids, was seated on his
knees. After draining all of the wine in his beast-skull goblet, he
said, “Serpentwing, that Diremonster, has already fled back to his
lair. Serpentwing Lake is extremely large, and so deep that the
bottom cannot be seen. If it makes up its mind to hide, a single
black serpent searching by itself will find it hard to locate him.
Although Yichuan is extremely powerful, it will still be very hard
for him to kill that Serpentwing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lee nodded, but he was
frowning. He hadn’t touched any of the wine or meat in front of
him. Clearly, he was frustrated by something.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father?” Jadewich
looked questioningly at his father.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Frowning, Lee let out a
low sigh. “His sword flash travelled a distance of over two
kilometers, but was still able to heavily wound Serpentwing, a
Diremonster. The power of that sword has essentially surpassed the
limits which a Xiantian lifeform can attain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, do you mean
to say…” Jadewich was shocked. “Zifu Disciple?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lee shook his head.
“Hard to say! If Yichuan had opened his Zifu, the ‘Violet
Palace’, then he should be able to fly about on magic treasures. He
wouldn’t just stand there and watch as that Serpentwing, which
almost slew his son, turn tail and run away. But if he hasn’t
opened his Zifu…the power of his sword attack remains ridiculously
large. Thus, I feel puzzled and unable to understand it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Also!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I saw that Ji Ning
had his arm severed, but in the blink of an eye, by the time the dust
had settled and I rushed over there, Ning was totally fine.” Lee
was frowning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many Xiantian-level
people had seen Ning’s severed arm lying there in the rubble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The son of Ji
Yichuan, Ji Ning, should be training in some sort of Fiendgod Body
Refining.” Jadewich nodded. “In addition, he has already reached
an exceedingly high level, for him to be able to re-connect a severed
arm. Only, I am puzzled…how did Ning manage to survive the attack
of Serpentwing on Dragon Castle?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t understand
either.” Lee sighed. “I suppose he is lucky.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why was Ning able to
survive?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Perhaps it was because
Serpentwing knew who Ning was and thus was afraid to kill him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Perhaps it was because
Ning had powerful lifeforce as a Fiendgod Body Refiner and thus was
luckily able to survive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Perhaps it was because
Ning had some sort of protective treasure given to him by his
parents.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The experts of the Ji
clan of the West Prefecture were all abuzz, guessing wildly over the
reason, but none of them guessed that the merely ten year old Ning
had already reached the level of ‘one with the world’ in terms of
footwork.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was currently in
the middle of his training area, displaying his Shadewind Steps. In
the hundreds of meter wide training field, a blurred form was moving
about at high speed. As it did…Shua! Shua! Shua! Dozens of Ning’s
appeared out of nowhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning.” A voice
rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately came
to a halt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother.” Ning
immediately went over to welcome her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuchi Snow slowly
walked over, filled with joy as she stared at her son. After
suffering from Serpentwing’s attack, during the day, the Ji clan
had prepared a series of cremations and memorial ceremonies for the
deceased black armored riders and clansmen killed during the attack.
At that time, Ning had secretly informed his mother that his footwork
had already reached the ‘one with the world’ level. But of
course, his mother was the only one he told!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At just ten years of
age, he had reached the ‘one with the world’ level of footwork.
Snow had been to many areas of the Grand Xia Dynasty, but she had
almost never seen someone as monstrous as this. Actually, because
Ning had utilized the [Nuwa Painting] visualization technique since
birth, his soul was extremely powerful. In addition, he had
painstakingly trained in the [Shadewind Steps] since he was young,
and thus reached the ‘advanced’ level two years ago. In that
moment where life and death hung in the balance, he had suddenly been
able to sense the world and reached the ‘one with the world’
level. This was nothing more than success naturally arriving when the
conditions were right.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning.” Snow looked
at her son. “Your footwork has reached the ‘one with the world’
level. The next step will be to have your sword techniques also
become ‘one with the world’. Do not slacken off.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, mother.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For footwork to be at
the ‘one with the world’ level meant for the man to become one
with the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But for the sword to be
at the ‘one with the world’ level meant for the man, the sword,
and the world to all become one. Naturally, it was considerably more
difficult.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother.” Ning
asked. “When will Father come back?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your father went to
kill that Diremonster. After killing Serpentwing, he will come home,
of course.” Snow said.

Chapter 5 - The Father of Spring Grass
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The time passed, day
after day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The days slowly grew
colder, but his father still had not returned. The Ji clan of West
Prefecture had long since sent a squad of black armored riders to
surround Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the training
yard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One sword attack after
another howled and flashed through the air. Ning stood there by
himself, training in the [Raindrop Sutra]. At this point, neither
black armored riders nor powerful monstrous beasts…were of any use
to Ning in terms of improving his swordplay. But his father, Yichuan,
had yet to return. Thus, Ning could only train by himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
Autumn Leaf called out softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrm?” Ning looked
at Autumn Leaf, who had a nervous, uncertain look on her face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Frowning, Ning sheathed
his Darknorth swords. “Autumn Leaf, what is it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master…”
Autumn Leaf said in a low voice. “Spring Grass’s father requests
to see you, young master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who?” Ning was
stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spring Grass’s
father.” Autumn Leaf’s voice grew slightly louder. “Her
biological father!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was shocked.
“Spring Grass has a father?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His two personal maids
had been slaves their entire lives. When they were very young, they
were sold to the Ji clan’s West Prefecture.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where is Spring
Grass?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spring Grass didn’t
dare to come see you, young master.” Autumn Leaf said in a low
voice. “I could tell that actually, Spring Grass would rather like
to see her father, but her status…makes her afraid to say it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly
remembered something.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right. Strictly
speaking, Spring Grass and Autumn Leaf were his maidservants, and
their lives were under his control. From the day they were sold as
slaves, they no longer had any contact with their parents. However,
people were not like trees or grass; they had feelings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go and bring Spring
Grass’ father here.” Ning chuckled. “Since he wants to meet me,
then let him meet me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Autumn
Leaf’s face was covered with joy and she immediately ran out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning called towards the
outside of the yard, “Spring Grass, come in.” Outside the
courtyard, a fur-clad female servant was standing there uncertainly.
Hearing the young master’s shout, she had to walk inside. But her
face was filled with nervousness and uncertainty…right now, Spring
Grass felt many complicated emotions. She was excited, happy,
nervous, embarrassed, guilty, and restless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
Spring Grass looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your father is here.
If you want to meet him, you can.” Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…but I was
bought by the Ji clan.” Spring Grass bit her lips.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrm?” Ning frowned
slightly. “Do my words no longer carry weight around here?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood, young
master.” Spring Grass glanced at Ning, her heart filled with
gratitude. Actually, she had long ago sensed that this most brilliant
talent of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture, the youngster who would
one day become Prefecture Lord, didn’t treat her and Autumn Leaf
like most masters treated their servants.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s here.” Ning
looked outside, and immediately saw two figures walking into the
courtyard. The one in front was Autumn Leaf, while the one behind was
a tall, middle-aged man wearing black beast fur. This middle-aged man
had some scars on his face, and his head was lowered, seeming rather
nervous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, he’s
here.” Autumn Leaf said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The scarred man
hurriedly knelt down, pressing his head against the ground and also
his two hands down on the ground in prostration. Extremely
respectful, he said, “Blacktooth pays his respects to the mighty
young master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing this, Spring
Grass’ eyes couldn’t help but turn red.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced at Spring
Grass, then said, “Please rise.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Only now did
the scarred man rise, and as he did, he saw Spring Grass standing by
Ning’s side. Father and daughter’s gazes met, and instantly,
tears began to flow down both their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The scarred man quickly
recovered, hurriedly wiping his tears away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why have you come
here to my place?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The scarred man took a
deep breath. “Blacktooth has come to your place, young master,
because I wish to request that young master redeem my child, ‘Miwa’,
back to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Redeem?” Ning was
surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Redeem?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the years since he
had arrived in this world, he didn’t have many people whom he had
close relationships with, but Spring Grass and Autumn Leaf, in Ning’s
heart, were like big sisters to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father.” Spring
Grass couldn’t help but shout out. It was generally possible to
redeem an ordinary slave by paying a certain price, but what sort of
status did young master Ji have? How could her father possibly redeem
her? If the young master was angered, her father might immediately
lose his life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time, she
fell to her knees with a thudding sound. “Young master, my father
doesn’t understand anything. I beg you, young master, to pardon my
father for his disrespect.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let him speak.”
Ning looked at the scarred man. “If you have anything to say, say
it. If you can convince me, I’ll agree. If you can’t…hmph.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The scarred man’s
heart shook.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He understood exactly
how much power and authority this young man in front of him had. If
this young man wanted his life, it would be simplicity itself to take
it. But since he had chosen to come…he had made mental
preparations!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mighty young
master.” The scarred man said respectfully, “Blacktooth will tell
you everything in my heart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning only looked at
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, Blacktooth, was
once the son of a tribal chief.” The scarred man said slowly.
“Within a mountain forest, the Blacktooth Tribe lived a peaceful
life. We raised animals inside, and I led the mighty warriors of the
tribe to pursue and kill monstrous beasts across the nearby land…and
one day, we discovered in a secluded valley a large amount of
naturally grown millet rice.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The entire tribe was
extremely excited and overjoyed with this discovery. With this supply
of millet, the lives of our tribe would be much improved, and we
would be able to have more tribesmen. However, this news was quickly
discovered by another powerful tribe, the Blood Mosquito Tribe. One
morning at dawn, when the sky was just beginning to brighten and many
tribesmen were still asleep…” The scarred man’s eyes revealed a
hint of bitterness and pain. “They ambushed our clan, slaughtering
many of my tribesmen. Our power was far inferior to the Blood
Mosquito Tribe to begin with, and we were ambushed. The few of us who
were lucky enough to survive had to flee.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I fled with Miwa,
encountering countless perils and dangers on the way before finally
fleeing to the West Prefecture City.” The scarred man’s body was
trembling slightly. “But my dearly beloved daughter and my tribal
brothers had all died. I had to seek revenge, even if I died doing
so. But Miwa was innocent and blameless. I hoped she would continue
to live…so I sold her to the Ji clan. In the Ji clan, she would at
least have a stable life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Spring Grass was
shaking as well, her tears pouring down. “Father, Father…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She could never forget…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Forget those days of
flight. Although she was still young, she would never forget the
sight of her loved ones all dying, one after the other, and all her
friends of the same age dying as well. Never forget her father
desperately fighting to survive one terrible danger after another as
they battled their way to the West Prefecture City. At that time, her
father had only told her, “Miwa, Father needs to go do what must be
done. Miwa, you need to continue to live a good life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, don’t
leave Miwa, Father, Father!” The young Spring Grass had cried
bitterly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The still-young
Blacktooth had ground his teeth and then left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had embarked on the
road to revenge!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hated…” The
scarred man’s body was shaking. “I wanted to get revenge.
Although I was a Ninefang Warrior, to the Blood Mosquito Tribe, I was
nothing at all. After I killed four of my enemies, a red-furred
Diremonster suddenly ambushed the Blood Mosquito Tribe. That bastard
who had led the squad to destroy my homeland was devoured by that
Diremonster in one gulp, and the Blood Mosquito Tribe was destroyed.
The few lucky survivors of the Blood Mosquito Tribe all joined other
tribes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I had no enemies
left.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, who had nothing
at all, did not have any way to redeem Miwa, so I became a travelling
merchant.” The scarred man said. “After one life-and-death
experience after another, I managed to find some of the scattered
survivors of my tribe, and my merchant caravan became more and more
powerful. I gained wealth, and thus alongside the scattered
survivors, I founded a tribe…my own Blacktooth Tribe! And I, I
became the new ‘Blacktooth’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“While becoming a
travelling merchant,” the scarred man looked at Ning, “I had the
chance to chat with a servant of the Ji clan, and learned that Miwa
had become the maidservant of you, young master Ji.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After
re-establishing the Blacktooth Tribe, I had done all that I had to
do. I had done right by my father, and by the past generations of
Blacktooths.” The scarred man looked at Ning. “Therefore, I have
come. I have come to see my child, Miwa, whom I have seen in my
dreams for these ten years. Even if I had to die, I would see Miwa.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Miwa, my child…I
want to be with her. She is the last kin who Blacktooth has.” The
scarred man’s face was covered in tears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Spring Grass’s face
had been covered in tears long ago, and she was bawling loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father.” Spring
Grass ran over, embracing her agonized father.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Miwa.” The scarred
man held his daughter as well. He had been waiting for this day for
so long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf, standing
to one side, couldn’t help but cry as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Ning, he sighed
as he listened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tribesmen had to
fight against the heavens, the earth, and the monsters. Spring Grass’
father, ‘Blacktooth’, was the epitome of this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spring Grass.”
Ning spoke out. “Do you wish to be together with your father?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Spring Grass bit her
lips, unable to control the tears in her eyes. She fell to her knees.
“Young master, please forgive Spring Grass! I truly do wish to be
with my father, I truly do!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mighty young
master.” The scarred man immediately fell to his knees as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at the two
of them, father and daughter. The long time they had spent together
had resulted in him loving Spring Grass and Autumn Leaf like a
younger brother loving a pair of older sisters. He didn’t want
Spring Grass to leave him, but he wanted Spring Grass to be mentally
anguished even less. “Spring Grass, from today onwards, your
liberty is restored to you. You can go with your father.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah!” Spring Grass
and Blacktooth were both stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just like that, he had
agreed?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them, father
and daughter, could be together again?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, mighty
young master. Blacktooth will forever remember your great
benevolence, young master.” Blacktooth, on his knees, thanked him
again and again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Under Ning’s
instructions, Spring Grass had her liberty restored to her. As she
left alongside her father, Spring Grass had called out to him, “Young
master, Spring Grass will forever remember your kindness. Spring
Grass will constantly pray for you to be blessed, young master,
within the Blacktooth tribe. If in the future, young master, you ever
pass by the Blacktooth Tribe, I hope you will be able to come pay a
visit to Spring Grass.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Definitely.” Ning
agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We definitely will
go.” Autumn Leaf was crying as well. She and Spring Grass truly
were like sisters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The days continued to
grow colder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s mentality was
changing as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Spring Grass’
departure, her father’s experiences, Serpentwing’s attack, his
father’s departure to kill the Diremonster, his inability to find
an opponent to train his swordplay with within the Ji clan…all of
these events caused Ning’s mentality to change.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had the feeling that
perhaps the West Prefecture City was too small of a place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He wanted to go
outside, wanted to see the wider world! He wanted to see how the
tribes like the Blacktooth Tribe lived, and what their lives were
like! He wanted to be like his father and go fight one Diremonster
after another…he wanted to go adventure in this area of the world…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, your father is
back.” On this snowy day, Snow called out to her son.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did Ning see
that in the skies above, his father was returning, half-kneeling on
the back of that Azure Firebird.
</P>

Chapter 6 - Ji Ning and Serpentwing
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hall was very
silent, with the thick candles flickering and casting their light
everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s head was
lowered as he devoured the food in front of him, quickly gulping down
all of the meat and wine on the table. Today, they were celebrating
his father’s return, so he actually had the rare chance to drink
some wine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father.” Ning
spoke out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” Ji Yichuan
frowned as he looked at his son.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could sense that
his father wasn’t in a very good mood, because this attempt to kill
Serpentwing had resulted in failure. To kill a late-stage water-type
Xiantian level Diremonster which was hiding in the depths of a lake
was simply too difficult. If the Ji clan of the West Prefecture truly
wanted to directly slaughter Serpentwing, they could if they paid a
large price for it, but clearly, the Ji clan of the West Prefecture
wasn’t willing to pay that price. For the sake of their pride and
honor, the Ji clan of the West Prefecture had already wiped out the
other creatures in Serpentwing Lake, then stationed soldiers all
around Serpentwing Lake, as well as numerous Xiantian lifeforms,
forcing Serpentwing to be afraid to leave Serpentwing Lake. This
would be a long battle. Once Serpentwing became the slightest bit
incautious, the Ji clan of the West Prefecture’s Xiantian lifeforms
would immediately slaughter him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to go out and
adventure.” Ning spoke.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adventure?”
Yichuan frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuchi Snow said
hurriedly, “Ning, you were just ambushed by Serpentwing. You should
know how terrifying Diremonsters are. Outside the Western
Prefecture…there are many Diremonsters lying in wait in the high
mountains and the deep lakes. To go adventuring outside…you are
still too young. Wait a few more years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In the West
Prefecture, I no longer have anyone whom I can train myself against.”
Ning shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan snapped coldly,
“How old are you? Wait until you are at least sixteen before going
out and adventuring.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But Father!” Ning
said urgently, “I’ve been in the Western Prefecture since I was a
child. I’ve always stayed in this small little area of the Western
Prefecture. I want to see the countless tribes in the greater world.
I want to be like Father, to go out and adventure, to experience
danger, to go fight with those Diremonsters and kill them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Diremonsters? Just
based on your little bit of power…” Yichuan shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s the problem
with my strength?” Ning said hurriedly. “Even under Serpentwing’s
full strength attacks, I was still able to survive. What’s the
problem with my strength?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan was startled,
and seemed to have suddenly thought of something. “Right. I haven’t
had the chance to ask you. How did you survive Serpentwing’s
attack?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Snow
laughed. “Yichuan, you’ve been dealing with Serpentwing this
entire time and hadn’t had the chance to come back, so we haven’t
had the chance to tell you. Our son, in that moment of life-and-death
when being attacked by Serpentwing, has reached the ‘one with the
world’ level of footwork. Relying on his ‘one with the world’
level of footwork, he was able to escape Serpentwing’s attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One with the world?”
Yichuan stared at Ning in astonishment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At merely ten years
old, he had reached the level of ‘one with the world’ in
footwork?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Receive three sword
blows from me.” With a sudden flip of his hands, Yichuan made three
hazy sword-shadows suddenly appear and surround Ning, attacking as
fast as lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been kneeling
down at the dinner table. Now, he suddenly dodged aside gracefully,
moving past those three hazy sword-shadows as gracefully as the wind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you think?”
Ning said proudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You really have
reached it.” Yichuan stared at his son in amazement. “One with
the world. Your footwork has reached the ‘one with the world’
level. Then your swordplay…isn’t too off from reaching the ‘one
with the world’ level as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan looked as his
son, his heart swelling with excitement as he quickly pondered. His
son, Ning, had such a high level of talent. In the area around
Swallow Mountain, he was definitely an extremely rare, monster of a
talent. Such incredible talent couldn’t be treated as a normal
person was! Given Ning’s rapid rate of improvement, there truly was
nothing left in West Prefecture City which would prove useful for him
in training.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you want to go
out and adventure, that isn’t completely out of the question.”
Yichuan looked at his son. “But you need to accomplish a
requirement of mine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yichuan!” Snow was
a bit frantic, but Yichuan stretched his hand out, stopping her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father, speak.”
Ning was full of excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan nodded. “The
Ceremony of the Golden Sword is hosted once every four years. It is a
ceremony which all youths under the age of sixteen will participate
in. I want you to seize the golden sword during this year’s
Ceremony of the Golden Sword! As long as you are able to seize the
golden sword, I will permit you to go out adventuring.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Golden sword?”
Ning’s eyes lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had known long ago
about the agreement that if he could seize the golden sword, he would
become the next Prefecture Lord. And during these recent years of
training…his father had also spoken to him about this matter of
‘seizing the golden sword to become the Prefecture Lord’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seizing the golden
sword is very easy.” Ning looked at Yichuan suspiciously. “Father,
I only need to use perhaps a tenth of my full strength to seize the
golden sword. This isn’t much of a test for me. Can it be that
Father, you truly care so much about the Prefecture Lord position?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His father’s heart
was totally set on the Immortal Path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning naturally also had
the same desire to step on the Immortal Path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prefecture Lord
position?” Yichuan shook his head. “You are the son of Ji
Yichuan, my greatest pride. I trust that you will be able to go even
farther than me…the position of Prefecture Lord of the Ji clan of
the West Prefecture will only be a constraint on you. You will
definitely spread your wings and fly higher.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was confused.
“Then Father, why do you wish me to go seize the golden sword?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“First, to let Ji Lee
know that he can stop dreaming.” Yichuan said. “The second
reason, you will discover after you seize the golden sword. So long
as you can seize the golden sword, I will permit you to go out and
adventure. But if you are unable to seize it, then be a good child
and stay in the Western Prefecture City.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
grinned widely.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Snow, on the
other hand, was frantic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough, you can go
back and get some rest now.” Yichuan said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately jumped
up and returned to his room, overjoyed. In the main hall, Yichuan
began to explain the reason for his actions to his wife, Snow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The next morning. Dawn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While Ning was eating
with his parents, Snow instructed him, “After seizing the golden
sword, I won’t block you from going adventuring either, but you
have to bring followers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Followers?” Ning
said hurriedly. “But I’m going out to adventure. What’s the
point of bringing a big group of followers?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You only need to
bring two people.” Snow laughed. “The first is Autumn Leaf. She
is familiar with your habits and can cater to your needs. The other
servant would be Mowu. Mowu used to be a Ninefang Warrior of the
black armored riders, and then he followed your father for a long
time. He is extremely loyal. Although he isn’t as strong as you, he
has abundant experience in adventuring in the wilds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning pondered for a
while, then nodded. “Fine, I’ll bring them. I can’t bring any
others though.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, you
are going to leave the Western Prefecture to go adventuring? And you
are going to bring me along with you?” Autumn Leaf was extremely
excited. Ever since she was brought into the Ji clan of the West
Prefecture, she had not had a chance to leave the city for a long,
long time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t just stand
there, silly. Hurry up and get all the records on the Diremonsters in
the area around Swallow Mountain from the library. Also get the
records on the various tribes, and the maps as well. Move them all
here.” Ning was feeling very intrepid as he instructed Autumn Leaf,
“I need to get a good understanding and prepare a rough path of
adventuring for myself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, young master.”
Autumn Leaf all but flew out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf was Ning’s
personal maidservant, and thus ever since she was young, she had been
taught extremely good Ki Refining techniques, and thus was close to
the peak of the Houtian level. For someone of her status, the
personal maidservant of Ji Ning, she naturally would also be taught
special techniques as well, permitting her, at a critical juncture,
to sacrifice her life for the sake of her master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Coming.” Autumn
Leaf came back, carrying a high stack of books. With a thudding
sound, she set them down on the ground. This huge stack of books had
to be several hundred pounds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hurriedly began to
flip through them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One legendary
Diremonster after another…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did Ning truly
realize exactly how many Diremonsters lay hidden within the high
mountains and the deep lakes. It was because Diremonsters were both
abundant and very hard to deal with. Thus, the Diremonsters and the
local hegemons such as the Ji clan actually had an unspoken
understanding. Diremonsters usually wouldn’t wildly slaughter
humans on a wide scale, while the Ji clan and the other hegemons
wouldn’t go all out to slaughter the Diremonsters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both sides would stay
their hands, maintaining their superficial calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although some tribes
would often be slaughtered and some Diremonsters would be killed…it
was all within a manageable degree! There was an invisible line which
neither the Ji clan and the other local hegemons, nor the
Diremonsters, wished to cross. Once that line was crossed, then a
true storm of blood would occur.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blacktooth Tribe.”
Ning pointed at the map. “This is the newest map of the territory
of our Ji clan of the West Prefecture, and the Blacktooth Tribe is a
newly erected, small tribe. It should be Spring Grass’ father’s
tribe. It is right here, just a thousand kilometers away from us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, young
master, we have to go pay a visit to the Blacktooth Tribe and see
Spring Grass.” Autumn Leaf said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course we’d
have to go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “But we
have to make an adventure of it. First we go here, then here, then
here, and…here!” Ning pointed at one dangerous area after
another, marked with black colors on the map.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those are all places
where Diremonsters are hiding.” Autumn Leaf cried out in shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning’s
eyes were shining. “I’m going to go kill some Diremonsters! Don’t
worry, the Diremonsters I’ve picked out are all early Xiantian
level ones. They are much weaker than Serpentwing. I’ll fight them
all, one after the other…until the time comes when I break through
and become a Xiantian lifeform myself. After I become a Xiantian
lifeform, it will be time to go to Serpentwing Lake.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf said
frantically, “Young master, Serpentwing is a late Xiantian level
Diremonster.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have confidence.”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The number one Fiendgod
Body Refining method, the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine
Heavens], had boundless strength. Right now, despite only being at
the third stage, he could already equal an ordinary early Xiantian
level Ki Refiner!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once he broke through
to the fourth stage, he would be on par with a late Xiantian level Ki
Refiner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if he fought
Serpentwing head on, he would be on par. But in terms of
enlightenment, he was far superior to Serpentwing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Diremonster.
Serpentwing.” Ning’s eyes flashed with a hint of wildness. He
couldn’t forget the scene of how Serpentwing had suddenly attacked
him. “This time, when I go out and adventure, my final goal is you.
I hope you won’t die before I reach you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ji clan of the West
Prefecture made preparations to welcome the arrival of the
quadrennial Ceremony of the Golden Sword. The promising youths which
the countless tribes had been preparing were all filled with
eagerness, and they registered for it, one after the other. They
wanted to defeat one opponent after another at the ceremony and
become dazzling, glorious personages. They wanted to let their names
spread throughout the countless tribes!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This time, after the
Ceremony of the Golden Sword, I am going to go back to the tribe. I
am definitely going to make it into the top eight, so that I will be
able to learn the techniques for training to reach the Xiantian
level. That way, in my lifetime, I’ll have the chance of becoming a
Xiantian lifeform!” A youngster with pitch black skin, carrying a
single blade on his back and dressed in ragged beast furs, with two
leather shoes on his feet that had been almost worn through.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The name of
Tigerhowl shall definitely spread throughout all of the tribes of
this land!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am the strongest!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is my final
chance to obtain a training manual for Immortal magic.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the youths of the
tribes were filled with their own desires, and they went to register
for the Ceremony of the Golden Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a holy
ceremony.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A holy ceremony for
countless tribal youths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire area under
the dominion of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture and all of the
young talents living in that area were going to participate in it.
They desired to become famous, to obtain a profound Ki Refining
technique from this Ceremony of the Golden Sword, or some other
powerful techniques. These would become the powerful, awe-inspiring
abilities they would rely on in the future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What? Ji Ning is
participating in the Ceremony of the Golden Sword?” Ji Lee, who had
just received this news, stared, and the scarlet viper looped in his
ear also spoke. “He’s only ten years old. He absolutely could
wait another four years to participate in the Ceremony of the Golden
Sword. Why is he participating now?”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_7___One_Against_Seven"></A>
Chapter 7 - One Against Seven?
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Jadewich sat in his
usual spot, nursing a beastskull goblet. “Perhaps Ji Yichuan wants
to let his son have an early try. After all, even if he fails, four
years later, Ji Ning can try again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They have two
chances, but I can’t fail even once.” Ji Lee revealed a hint of a
smile on his face. “Fortunately, back then, I took in my adoptive
son, Grizzly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immediately, Lee said
to a nearby servant, “Have Grizzly come and see me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, master.” The
barefoot female servant bowed, then quickly left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon afterwards, a tall
young man wearing golden furs came striding in. This youngster had a
very fierce aura. His face was covered with golden fur, and his eyes
also had a faint gold look to them, unlike ordinary people. At all
times, he carried a pitch black straight saber on his back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He strode in, and as he
did…he seemed like a skinny, golden grizzly bear. Although he was
only thirteen, he was even slightly taller than Lee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father.” Grizzly
called out respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grizzly.” Lee
looked at his adopted son, nodding in satisfaction. “The Ceremony
of the Golden Sword is held once every four years. I will arrange for
you to be registered in this year’s Ceremony of the Golden Sword. I
only have one request: Seize the golden sword!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Grizzly’s
voice was deep and thick.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Lee nodded
with satisfaction. Of the many adoptive sons he had taken in, only a
very few had made him satisfied, and amongst them, Grizzly was the
one he was the most satisfied with. Lee had total confidence in
Grizzly’s abilities to prevent Ning from seizing the golden sword
in this year’s ceremony.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lee spoke again. “This
time, the one you need to be careful of is the only son of Ji Yichuan
- Ji Ning! Although he hasn’t experienced any real life-and-death
battles yet, he has still trained in the highest class techniques of
our Ji clan. Although the techniques I taught you are also top-class,
compared to his, they are still slightly inferior.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Grizzly nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He understood. He was,
after all, just an adopted son. But Ji Ning? He was the only son of
the Raindrop Sword, Ji Yichuan, and also the heir presumptive of the
position of Prefecture Lord. The difference in status between the two
was simply too great. Ning could easily obtain the ultimate
techniques of the Ji clan, but he, an adopted child, couldn’t
possibly be permitted to learn the most powerful techniques of a
clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition, Ning
just reached the level of ‘one with the sword’ this year.” Lee
looked at his adoptive son. “Don’t be over-confident.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I, your son, will
definitely be victorious.” Grizzly growled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ceremony of the
Golden Sword began!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Large numbers of tribal
youths were at the bottom, fighting against each other wildly. One
youth after another was cast out, with the stronger ones left behind.
After a full month of battles, finally, the most powerful eight
youths were selected. Or, to be more precise…seven youths were
selected. There was another person who was automatically registered
as one of the final eight, without having to undergo any
competitions. Ji Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, the only son
of the Raindrop Sword, Ji Yichuan! The most talented youngster of the
Ji clan of the West Prefecture.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to what the
Ji clan of the West Prefecture said to the outsiders, Ji Ning was so
powerful that he didn’t need to enter the competition at all. He
could directly be included in the top eight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anger?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Injust?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrmph. On the last
day, when he encounters the other seven experts, this Ji Ning will
definitely be utterly thrashed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He really will stoop
to nothing!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He brings shame to
the Ji clan!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the tribal
youths muttered secretly amongst themselves. Only a very, very few of
the tribal youths had heard the news that Ji Ning had already reached
the level of ‘one with the sword’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huahuahua….” The
battle flag flapped loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The desolate, cold wind
extinguished the furious flames in the hearts of many, because today
would be the final day of the Ceremony of the Golden Sword!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the center of the
wide training fields, there was an enormous dueling platform, with
eight tribal youths standing below it. One of them was the beast fur
clad Ning. Outside was a large number of black armored riders who
surrounded the dueling platform protectively, preventing any of the
tens of thousands of tribal youths and citizens of the West
Prefecture City who had come to watch the battles from drawing any
closer to the dueling area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Xiantian
lifeforms have come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tens of thousands
of spectators gathered here all became very excited. The Ceremony of
the Golden Sword had proceeded for so long now, and usually, there
weren’t so many spectators. But today was special! Because today
was the final day of the Ceremony of the Golden Sword, and the final
eight competitors would, in the final contest, determine who was the
most powerful and who would seize the golden sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the last day of the
Ceremony of the Golden Sword, many legendary Xiantian lifeforms would
also come and watch!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That person riding
the long-necked monstrous beast, that’s the Heavenly Firehammer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The one riding that
white tiger is the number one archer of our Ji clan of the West
Prefecture!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That…that’s the
Fire God, Ji Lee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look, Raindrop
sword! Over there, the one with a big, snow-white dog next to him is
the Raindrop Sword, Ji Yichuan! The big snow-white dog next to him is
a Xiantian lifeform, the ‘Whitewater Hound’!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Prefecture Lord!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Prefecture Lord,
Ji Young, has appeared as well!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why are there so
many Xiantian lifeforms present? There’s too many of them!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So many Xiantian
lifeforms!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Utter insanity. Utter
pandemonium.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ceremony of the
Golden Sword was only held once every four years, after all.
Generally speaking, only a few Xiantian lifeforms would come watch,
but today, many legendary figures had come, such as the mysterious,
rarely seen number one expert of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture,
the Raindrop Sword, Ji Yichuan. Or the man as wild and as arrogant as
a Fire God, Ji Lee!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ten overseers had
all come, not a single one of them missing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because this
wasn’t just a Ceremony of the Golden Sword. More importantly…this
was a test and skirmish which would determine who the next Prefecture
Lord would be! As long as Ning was able to seize the golden sword,
then he would be the next Prefecture Lord. Since this event involved
something as important as who the next Prefecture Lord would be,
almost all of the Xiantian lifeforms in the Ji clan of the West
Prefecture naturally came to witness it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Today is the final
day of the Ceremony of the Golden Sword.” A cold voice rang out
from a woman with long hair that gleamed with blue light who stood on
the dueling platform. “Now, let the eight youths ascend the
platform.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua!
Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eight shadows leapt
onto the dueling platform in succession.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced at them
and found that virtually all the seven other opponents were staring
at him. Clearly, all seven of them felt disdain for him being allowed
to directly be placed amongst the final eight without having to
advance through the many tiers of battle like they had.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you think I
wanted it to be like this?” Ning pursed his lips. It had totally
been the decision of Prefecture Lord Young for him to be designated
as one of the eight. “However, these seven fellows really are tall.
Even the shortest of them, a woman, is at least 1.7 meters, slightly
taller than me…ugh, and this big, stupid fellow is probably 2.3
meters tall.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they were
‘youths’, all of them were very accomplished in their training,
and most were almost sixteen. Only Ning was just ten years old.
Naturally, he was the shortest of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The eight of you
will fight each other, one at a time. The loser will leave, and the
winner will remain, until four remain. And then, you will duel until
only two remain, then finally, the strongest will be chosen.” The
long haired woman said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the other
seven youths were listening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Halt!” A cold
voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The spectating tribal
youths and citizens of Ji clan of the West Prefecture all turned
towards the sound of the voice. Even the long haired woman turned and
frowned. She was a Xiantian level expert of the Ji clan of the West
Prefecture, and she had only come to officiate today because it was
the final day. Who was causing such a ruckus at a time like this? She
turned her head and saw…that the speaker was a callous-looking man
dressed in white fur.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The long haired woman
trembled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Raindrop Sword,
Ji Yichuan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Raindrop Sword.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Raindrop Sword
looks like a giant iceberg, just standing there. I feel my heart
growing cold just looking at him.” The tens of thousands of
spectators had excited looks in their eyes. All of the Xiantian
experts present were like Fiendgods to them, but Ji Yichuan was the
most dazzling expert in these lands, a legendary figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan sat there and
said coldly, “The final day of the Ceremony of the Golden Sword is
for selecting the most powerful of the eight finalists to be the one
to seize the golden sword. As I see it…let Ji Ning fight the other
seven!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One against seven?”
The long haired woman was stunned. “But…but…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One against seven?
The other seven are all highly talented youngsters.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A scene of utter shock.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the Prefecture
Lord, Ji Young, seated next to Yichuan, was amazed. As for the old
man with the viper, Ji Lee, who sat on the other side of Ji Young, he
immediately laughed loudly. “Wonderful. One against seven. Ji Ning
is the most talented youngster in our Ji clan of the West Prefecture.
Even if he loses, this would be a form of training for him. But
Yichuan…if your son loses his battle against the seven of them,
then what?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If he loses, then he
admits defeat, and has nothing to do with the golden sword!”
Yichuan said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Lee nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Young looked at
Yichuan curiously, then spoke out. “Let it be as Yichuan has said.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Prefecture
Lord.” The long haired woman, seeing the situation, nodded. The two
most powerful factions in the Ji clan of the West Prefecture had both
agreed. Naturally, she had nothing to say about it. All she could do
was inwardly sigh that the Raindrop Sword, Ji Yichuan, was perhaps
too arrogant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The eight of you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The long haired woman
looked at the eight youths. “Come here and select your weapons.
After choosing your weapons…wait for my order. Once I give the
order, it will be Ji Ning fighting against the seventh of you. If Ji
Ning loses, or if the seven of you lose…then this combat will come
to an end.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hua.” With a wave
of her hand, the long haired woman made a large number of weapons
appear out of nowhere onto the dueling platform. There were all types
of weapons. Only, none of them were sharpened!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Choose.” The long
haired woman said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the other
seven youths all strode forward, quickly choosing their weapons. Ning
chose a sturdy black longsword that weighed roughly fifty pounds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tens of thousands
of spectators below were all engaged in conversation. Many of them
were only now seeing the ‘Raindrop Sword’, Ji Yichuan, for the
first time. They felt as though Yichuan was like a piece of ancient,
glacial ice, so cold that their hearts trembled. “Ji Yichuan is
perhaps too arrogant and exacting, and he even treats his son the
same way. One against seven? Even if Ji Ning’s true power is beyond
that of the other seven, how can he possibly beat all seven of them
at once?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s truly
insane.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hear that Ji Ning
is only ten years old, but his father has already ordered him to come
here and attend the Ceremony of the Golden Sword, and even wants him
to fight one on seven. Poor fellow.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many of the spectators
now began to feel sympathy for Ning. After all, Ning was the smallest
and shortest of the eight youths on the dueling platform, and the
youngest one as well. In addition, Ning was so handsome…this
slender, handsome youngster had a father who was so legendarily cold
and severe. One could imagine how strictly this youngster’s father
usually governed him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you done
choosing?” The long haired woman looked at the eight youths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seven of the youths
were standing on one side of the dueling platform. They had their
weapons ready, be it a sickle, a spear, a straight saber, or a sword.
All of them stared at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the opposite side of
the platform stood Ning, all by himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wielded a sword in
his hands, staring calmly at them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since you’ve made
your choices…” The long haired woman waved her hand, reclaiming
the heap of blunt weapons that were on the side while saying, “Then
you can begin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as her words came
out…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!
The seven figures on the other side of the platform moved over at
high speed, simultaneously charging at Ning, who stood on the other
side.

Chapter 8 - Ji Ning’s Sword
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seven figures attacked
from seven different directions, pouncing towards Ji Ning en masse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they had not
previously been prepared for a ‘seven against one’ battle, all of
them were the most talented youths in the vast area under the control
of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture. Even if they were somewhat
unhappy towards this young master of the Ji clan, they didn’t dare
to be the slightest bit contemptuous. As though by prior agreement,
they all chosen to attack at full force!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there, not
moving at all, waiting for the seven blurs to reach him. And when
they did, he moved!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hu….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As those weapons all
flashed towards him, Ning moved like a gust of wind, demonstrating
extreme accuracy and precision in terms of control, positioning,
speed, and power…easily dodging and moving through the combined
attacks of the seven talented youths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He dodged?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How is that
possible?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven youths all
halted, their eyes filled with disbelief. Just then, Ning actually
hadn’t even used his weapons. Just relying on footwork alone, he
was able to easily dodge past their combined attacks. This sort of
terrifying footwork…demonstrated that so long as Ning was focused,
the seven of them combined wouldn’t be able to even touch Ning’s
clothes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So fast.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just like a gust of
wind.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He lives up to being
the son of the Raindrop Sword. Too formidable. So fast that I
couldn’t even clearly see him; all I saw was a blur.” The tens of
thousands of spectators all grew excited. In this area, all the
people began to train in childhood, so they all were experienced, and
yet even most of them were only able to see a blur. One could imagine
how fast Ning had moved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning halted, standing
on the other side of the dueling platform.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seven opponents were
unable to force me to use my sword. Their footwork is inferior to
mine.” Ning swept the seven opponents with his gaze. Just now,
during that brief moment of time, he had already assessed the
footwork level these seven opponents were at. “Two of them are at
the ‘advanced’ level. One is that scimitar wielding youth, while
the other is the golden-furred beast. It seems the earlier reports
were in error.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although his father was
arrogant, Ning himself had sent people to collect details regarding
these seven opponents. He only knew that the scimitar wielding youth
had reached the advanced level of footwork. He didn’t imagine that
this golden-furred beast had also reached such a high level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But their footwork
is still a bit weaker than mine.” Ning revealed a small smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had, after all,
already reached the ‘one with the world’ level of footwork. Even
though on this dueling platform, he would only utilize ‘advanced’
level footwork, his footwork was clearly more perfected. In addition,
he trained in an extremely advanced [Shadewind Steps] type of
footwork, allowing him to naturally seize an advantage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tie him down.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t give him the
chance to utilize his footwork.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All together.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven youths once
more charged forth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning slowly walked
towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In an instant, the
seven youths and Ning once again collided. Swords and sabers flashed
in the air, but Ning still moved as though he was taking a casual
stroll. The longsword in his hands became like a whip, with all of
his force being transmitted to the tip of the sword as he then
viciously struck out. In order to reduce the amount of casualties as
much as possible during the Ceremony of the Golden Sword, all of the
weapons were blunt, and thus were more suited to chopping, sweeping,
and whipping type attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fast!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword was so
fast as to make one’s heart shudder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gracefully walked
out from the combined attacks of the seven, while at the same time,
making seven lightning-fast whip-like attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five figures were sent
flying backwards by the whip-strikes, flying over thirty meters
before falling down onto the ground. All of them struggled to their
feet, covered with dust. A few couldn’t help but hold their chests,
coughing out a hint of blood. Some had cuts on their faces, and their
faces were filled with disbelief. This was because just then, they
clearly had seen Ning attack with his sword, and they had tried to
block it, but none of them had been able to touch Ning’s sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They hadn’t even been
able to touch it! Ning had sent them flying!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One with the sword!”
The five talented youths instantly knew what sort of level this young
master Ji had reached in swordplay, and understood how great the gap
was between them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only three youths were
left on the dueling platform.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Black sword in hand,
Ning looked at the nearby scimitar wielding youth and the
golden-furred beast. He nodded to himself. “I struck once against
each of them, but these two were able to touch my sword. That
scimitar wielding youth is very fast with his blade strikes, but he
hasn’t reached the ‘advanced’ level yet. That golden-furred
beast…has actually reached the advanced level of ‘one with the
saber’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master Ji,
remember…my name is Grizzly! Ji Grizzly!” The golden-furred
bestial man stared at Ji Ning. “The one who is going to defeat you
is me, Grizzly!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The scimitar wielding
youth’s face changed slightly. “So I am not the strongest one
after all in these many tribes. There are actually two who are
stronger than me. Even this Grizzly has already reached the ‘one
with the saber’ level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had been training
painstakingly for many years in the martial pavilion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew that he was
born into a low status and wouldn’t be able to obtain the ultimate
saber techniques, and thus he gave up focusing on any complicated
saber techniques, and instead focused on making his saber ‘fast’!
His saber…had to be fast enough. The faster the better. He pursued
the fastest possible attacks, combining them with his ‘advanced’
footwork…if he used his saber, he definitely would be able to
defeat the other youths.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now he discovered
to his amazement that it wasn’t just this son of the Raindrop
Sword, Ji Yichuan, who was stronger than him. The virtually unknown
golden-furred fellow next to him was stronger than him as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” The
scimitar wielding youth suddenly growled. “I know you are stronger
than me, but I want you to take three saber blows from me! Just take
these three saber blows of mine alone…as for you, Grizzly, don’t
interfere.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Grizzly stood there
disdainfully, a cold smile on his face. This scimitar wielding youth
was far weaker than him, and what’s more, Ning’s footwork was
simply too formidable, and there was no way to successfully do a
combined attack on him anyhow. So he might as well let this scimitar
wielding youth seek his own humiliation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, as though
thinking about something, glanced at the scimitar wielding youth. He
had the feeling that this scimitar wielding youth’s words had some
special belief hidden within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hua!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The scimitar wielding
youth charged forward like a blur, howling. His eyes were as vicious
as that of a wolf’s, and as he drew near Ning, his scimitar came
out! The scimitar gleamed brilliantly, and the very first saber-blow
was directed towards Ning’s neck. Logically speaking, since the
scimitar was blunt, this sort of slashing technique wasn’t very
suitable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But clearly, this
scimitar wielding youth wanted to demonstrate his strongest, ultimate
attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Retreat.” Ning
moved like the wind, taking a step back, allowing the scimitar to
howl past his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chi!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, with the flip
of his hand, the scimitar wielding youth launched another attack, and
this saber-blow was even faster, slashing towards Ning’s neck from
the opposite direction. With leap, Ning still managed to dodge, but
he even he felt it was a bit difficult. If he continued to use
‘advanced’ level footwork and the opponent’s scimitar moved any
faster, Ning would have to use his sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swish!” The
flashing blade suddenly left his hand, moving even faster, arriving
close to Ning’s eyes in an instant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third saber-blow -
The flying saber!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The flying saber was
spinning in the air, and borrowed the speed from those two earlier
attacks, allowing this final flying saber attack to reach an even
more incredible speed. Not hesitating at all, Ning attacked with his
sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clang.” The
scimitar and the sword intersected, and the scimitar immediately was
sent flying away, landing back into the hands of the scimitar
wielding youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The scimitar wielding
youth nodded. “I lose.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then with a leap,
he jumped down from the dueling platform. The scimitar wielding youth
knew…that this Ji Ning and himself simply weren’t on the same
level at all. Even aside from the fact that Ji Ning trained in the
ultimate sword techniques of the Ji clan, the simple fact that he had
reached the ‘one with the sword’ level made it impossible for the
youth to do anything to Ji Ning. He was already very satisfied with
being given the chance to show off his most powerful attacks on this
dueling platform.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Recruit that
scimitar wielding youth into the Ji clan!” The distant, spectating
Ji Young said to one of his personal servants standing behind him.
“He has the potential to reach the Xiantian level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yes, master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dueling platform
only had Ning and Grizzly left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Grizzly’s eyes
flashed with golden light, staring from afar at Ning, while at the
same time, his entire body began to glow with a faint gold light as
well, and a powerful aura began to emit from him. This caused the
distant Ning’s eyes to narrow. “This Grizzly is also a Fiendgod
Body Refiner? It seems he’s reached quite a high level as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.” Grizzly
growled. “I admit that your footwork is superior to mine! But
today, we must determine who the strongest person is, and you won’t
be able to acquire the golden sword just by fleeing! You must fight
me head on, but unfortunately, if you fight me head out, you aren’t
a match for me at all. You will definitely lose!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Black sword in hand,
Ning looked calmly at his opponent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From Grizzly’s
ferocious aura, Ning could predict that this Grizzly had definitely
gone through life-and-death battles. With his sabercraft having
reached the ‘one with the saber’ level, and that layer of golden
life demonstrating that he had trained in a powerful type of Fiendgod
Body Refining technique, if Ning’s guess was correct, this Grizzly
should have trained in the [Eternal Mysteries of the Yellow Earth].
After all, he had reviewed all of the nineteen books on Fiendgod Body
Refining which the Ji clan’s five prefectures had.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This person called
Grizzly has encountered many life-and-death battles, and is a
Fiendgod Body Refiner who has reached the ‘one with the saber’
level. But he doesn’t have any reputation at all.” Ning secretly
mused. “He definitely wasn’t born in the tribes. He should belong
to the Ji clan…nine out of ten says that he is someone whom the
viperous Ji Lee cultivated and intentionally kept hidden.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Afraid?” Grizzly,
saber in hand, stared like a hungry tiger at Ning. He didn’t make
any movement to go attack Ning of his own volition.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, wielding his
black sword, began to walk forward in a very calm, natural way, as
though taking a stroll in his own home. If he had encountered Grizzly
before suffering from Serpentwing’s attack, Ning would perhaps be a
bit more trouble, but in the months which had passed since suffering
from Serpentwing’s attack, the swordplay of Ning, who had reached
the ‘one with the world’ level in footwork, had increased
dramatically as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To reach the ‘one
with the world’ level in footwork, one needed to spend time
training. The same was true for reaching the ‘one with the world’
level in swordplay. Although Ning had yet to reach the ‘one with
the world’ level in swordplay, Ning’s swordplay was no longer
what it had been mere months ago. He didn’t even need to utilize
the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] in order to easily
defeat this Grizzly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword suddenly
moved!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hu!” The sword was
as graceful as the rain, descending in an instant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Beautiful to behold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When a killing sword
technique could transform into a beautiful sight, it showed that the
wielder had already reached an extremely deep level of skill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break apart!”
Grizzly roared as he wielded his saber, which flashed with the
thickness of blood as one enormous saber-flash after another flew
towards Ning. In the blink of an eye, it was though Hell had
descended…those enormous flashes of saber-light were the punishing
blades of hell, causing one to feel hopeless and as though they
deserved to stand there and die beneath those saber flashes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bloodhell Saber?”
Ning’s sword swept out like a gentle sprinkling of rain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His flashing sword
flowed together into one stream like rainwater which drizzled down,
ensnaring Grizzly. No matter how wild and explosive Grizzly’s
Bloodhell Saber techniques were, that drizzling flow of water
continued to ensnare it, making it lose its wild, explosive aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Grizzly felt as though
he had suddenly become trapped in a prison of water. There was water
everywhere, wildly ensnaring him. He clearly possessed boundless
strength, but he wasn’t able to utilize it against the water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Break!” Grizzly’s
saberplay was incomparably wild. Even though he was constantly being
ensnared, he still didn’t hesitate one bit, only growing even more
ferocious.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your saberplay is
indeed strong.” Ning said gently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An opponent of this
level wasn’t a threat to him at all. Only, the fact that this
Grizzly’s saberplay was developed in life-and-death battles was a
source of interest to Ning, which was why Ning was willing to
exchange ten blows with him to accumulate some experience. Ning knew
very well…that compared to some of the elder experts of the clan,
what he lacked the most was sufficient experience.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hua.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black longsword in
Ning’s hands suddenly thrust forward in a straight attack, and
instantly, it seemed as though the entire world grew silent. The
hazily glowing sword seemed to have transformed into a single drop of
rain. This raindrop pierced past the saber, and as it did, the saber
shattered. The raindrop then smashed against Grizzly’s chest, like
a raindrop falling against a stone. Pa! The faint sound of bones
splintering could be heard as Grizzly was sent flying several dozen
meters, smashing viciously against the floor beneath the dueling
platform, causing a small crater in the earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Raindrop Sword -
Raindrop Pierces Rocks!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh.” Grizzly
clutched his chest, spewing out a mouthful of fresh blood.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He lowered his head to
look at his chest. The fur of the Xiantian-level beast which he wore
had split open, and his chest had caved in, his bones broken. And
this was with Ning using a very ordinary, blunt black longsword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tens of thousands
of spectators watching the training area all fell silent…and then,
there was an earth-shaking commotion. They were all in awe. This
truly was the son of the Raindrop Sword, Ji Yichuan. No wonder the
Raindrop Sword had dared to be so wildly arrogant as to have his son
fight seven others…this seemingly handsome, inexperienced young
master Ji was simply too terrifying, to easily be able to dominate
these seven opponents.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” The
Prefecture Lord, Ji Young, let out a loud, carefree laugh,
incomparably happy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He won.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His lineage had won. Ji
Ning had seized the golden sword, and would become the next
Prefecture Lord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Raindrop Pierces
Rocks! The advanced level in swordplay!” Sitting next to him, Ji
Lee suddenly clenched his right hand, and the stone armrest his hand
was resting on was shattered and cracked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second brother.”
Prefecture Lord Young turned to look at his second brother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lee looked at the
Prefecture Lord, his senior brother. His face changing, he said in a
low voice, “Advanced swordplay…he’s only ten, but his swordplay
is already ‘advanced’, and he has reached the level of
‘expertise’ in the [Raindrop Sutra], one of the five major sword
techniques of the Ji clan! He is even more of a monster than his
father. Senior brother, first your lineage produced Ji Yichuan, and
now, your lineage produced a Ji Ning. Heaven has shown it does not
favor me. I have lost, and I have nothing more to say!

Chapter 9 - The Traceless Talisman
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prefecture Lord Ji
Young spoke out, “Second brother, listen to me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother.” Ji
Lee closed his eyes, and then opened them and growled fiercely, “No
need to say anything else. From today onwards, Ji Ning is the heir to
the Prefecture Lord position of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture.
I, Ji Lee, will definitely be prepared to come when he calls, and
will be faithful and loyal as I go out and do battle on behalf of the
Ji clan of the West Prefecture. I will not be the slightest bit
rebellious. I thoroughly admire and submit to Ji Ning. But you…I
simply do not admire and submit to you at all!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lee hurriedly turned
and left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father.” Ji
Jadewich, seated next to him, called out, hurriedly following after
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young watched quietly
as Lee left, but he had a hint of a smile on his face. He knew very
well that his second brother, Ji Lee, had a fierce temper. Lee was an
extremely combative man. He would submit to those who were powerful,
but he would never do so to one who was weak! Ever since they were
young, in terms of power, he, Young, had been inferior to his second
brother. Naturally, Lee had never submitted to him. But Lee had once
said…if Ji Yichuan were to become Prefecture Lord, he wouldn’t
voice a single word of complaint.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now that Ning had
showed that he was even more of a monster than his father Yichuan,
and had in such an awe-inspiring manner defeated seven opponents to
seize the golden sword, Lee naturally admired and submitted to him in
the same manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he submitted, he
submitted!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he didn’t submit,
he didn’t submit!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He, Ji Lee, had never
admired or submitted to his big brother, Ji Young.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sunset.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Snowfall Palace of
the Ji clan of the West Prefecture had put on a feast. The settling
of the identity of the next Prefecture Lord was an event of enormous
importance to the Ji clan of the West Prefecture. After Young stepped
down, Ning would assume his position and also become one of the
overseers. As for Young, being both a Xiantian lifeform and the
previous Prefecture Lord, he would also become an overseer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ji clan of the West
Prefecture had in total ten major overseers. Any affairs which had a
major impact on the destiny of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture
were all decided together by the ten overseers. Once Ning assumed his
position, the weakest of the current ten overseers would have to step
down! The structure of power would completely change. One could
foresee how much power would be gained by the current, principal
lineage.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wu Sa, Wu Sa Ya!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the center of the
palace, more than thirty barefoot and half-naked fur-clad young women
were dancing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the area behind the
two rows on each side of the palace, there were musicians playing
instruments such as drums, pipes, ocarinas, and other such
instruments. The sound of the musical instruments were occasionally
somber while occasionally lively, reverberating throughout the
palace. Within this palace, the most powerful people within the Ji
clan of the West Prefecture were currently clustered together,
toasting each other and laughing loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, as the heir
apparent to the Prefecture Lord position, had his own seat as well.
In front of him, there was a table that was filled with all sorts of
delicious food.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huahuahua…” A
fur-clad young lady was standing to the side, holding a large urn of
wine. Seeing that Ning’s beastskull cup was empty, she hurriedly
filled it. The urn of wine weighed dozens of pounds, but the young
fur-clad lady didn’t spill a single drop of wine as she poured.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It truly has its own
unique charm.” Watching, Ji Ning shook his head dizzily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was more than one
person seated next to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Yichuan was
naturally seated on his knees in the middle of the table, with Yuchi
Snow by his side, while a large, snow-white dog was on his other
side. It was the Godbeast, ‘Whitewater Hound’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The people qualified to
have their own individual seats here in the Snowfall Palace were all
people of extremely high status in the Ji clan of the West
Prefecture. Even Ning’s mother, Snow, had to be brought in her
capacity as the wife of Yichuan, as she herself wouldn’t have
otherwise been qualified to have her own seat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the Xiantian
lifeforms had brought either their family or the spirit-beasts they
had tamed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, it was nightfall,
and the musicians and dancers all depart, and even the female
servants and attendants were dismissed as well. It was the time to
talk about some major affairs. If they were talking about extremely
important, secret matters, even spirit-beasts and family members
would have to leave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone.”
Prefecture Lord Young laughed. “Today, the Ceremony of the Golden
Sword was concluded. Ning, at the age of ten, defeated seven
combatants by himself and seized the golden sword. Naturally, he has
become the next heir to the position of Prefecture Lord. However,
Ning is still young…it’s best to have him wait a while longer and
gain more experience before taking the Prefecture Lord position. As I
see it, let’s wait until he is twenty. What do you think,
everyone?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Agreed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning’s talent is
no lower than Yichuan’s. He is very suitable for being selected as
the next Prefecture Lord.” Another overseer nodded. Not even a
single objection was raised, including from those on Ji Lee’s side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan, seated off to
the side, revealed a rare smile. “Prefecture Lord.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yichuan, what is
it?” Young looked towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wish to ask for an
item for my son.” Yichuan said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Young was puzzled.
“What item?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Traceless
Talisman!” Yichuan said solemnly. As soon as his words came out,
the entire hall fell silent. Many of the Xiantian-level people stared
at each other in surprise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Traceless
Talisman?” Young frowned as he looked at Ning, then asked, “Ning,
you want the Traceless Talisman?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sitting there holding
his wine-filled beastskull goblet, Ning was startled. Glancing at his
father, he nodded. “Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan said, “Ning
is the next Prefecture Lord. He should be able to request this
Traceless Talisman, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Young
nodded, and then took a deep breath. With a flip of his hand, a
strange jade talisman, glittering with jade light, appeared in his
palm. This jade talisman was covered with complicated diagrams and
illegible words, and it emanated strange, faint waves of energy which
caused the area around it to seemingly distort. With a toss, Young
tossed the item directly to Yichuan. “Yichuan, this Traceless
Talisman is one of the guardian treasures of our Ji clan of the West
Prefecture. It must not be used carelessly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan nodded. “I
understand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Late night. On the road
back from Snowfall Palace, Ning and his parents, as well as the
Whitewater Hound, were walking together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father. Mother.”
Ning said, puzzled. “What is the Traceless Talisman. What do you
want it for, Father?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snow laughed as she
looked at her son. “This is the reason why your father said he
would only permit you to leave if you participated in the Ceremony of
the Golden Sword and seized the golden sword. Because only after
seizing the golden sword and settling the question of your position
as heir to the Prefecture Lord position would you be able to acquire
one of the guardian treasures, the ‘Traceless Talisman’.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan said with a
cold face, “The Traceless Talisman is an extremely valuable
talisman. Three hundred years ago, one of the ancestors of our Ji
clan of the West Prefecture, thanks to good luck, managed to acquire
it. Back then, he acquired three of them, but he used up two of
them…and now only this last one is remaining, and it has become the
guardian treasure of our prefecture.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What use does it
have?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan laughed. “As
long as you utilize the ‘Traceless Talisman’, you can instantly
travel to any place within ten thousand kilometers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” Ning was
shocked. Instantly travel to any location within ten thousand
kilometers?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A talisman like this
is something you can’t even purchase if you wanted to, and our
ancestor was only able to acquire it through luck.” Yichuan sighed.
“To our Ji clan, obtaining a treasure of this level…is our
absolute good fortune. You are the next Prefecture Lord, and thus I
used that to acquire this ‘Traceless Talisman’ without anyone
being able to object.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After speaking, with a
flip of his hand, Yichuan withdrew a jade shortsword that was
gleaming with a bloody light, handing it to Ning. “This jade sword
was only completed after being immersed in my blood for a long time.
No matter how distant you are, I will be able to sense the location
of this jade sword. This time, when you go out adventuring, keep it
within you at all times. Remember, as soon as you meet any danger,
immediately break this jade sword. When you break the jade sword, I
will immediately know, and I will immediately use the ‘Traceless
Talisman’ to instantly teleport to you and save your life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah!” Ning
instantly understood the reason why his father needed this Traceless
Talisman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan barked at him,
“On this adventuring trip, you are not permitted to go too far from
the West Prefecture City. This Traceless Talisman has a maximum range
of only ten thousand kilometers. Through sensing the location of the
jade sword, I’ll know how far away you are. If I sense that you
have moved more than ten thousand kilometers away from the West
Prefecture City, I will immediately head towards you, capture you,
bring you back, and imprison you in the underground prison for three
years!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning rubbed his eyes.
Imprisoned for three years in the underground prison? The forever
dark underground prison, where the sunlight never shone, was the
place where felons and those who were to be executed were held by the
Ji clan of the West Prefecture.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your son will
definitely remember.” Ning hurriedly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ten thousand
kilometers?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">More than enough. After
all, the area which the Ji clan of the West Prefecture controlled was
only a few thousand kilometers. If he kept heading west, he would
enter the territory of one of the other local hegemons.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son.” Snow
asked with concern. “When do you plan to head out and go
adventuring?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll make some
quick preparations first.” Ning nodded. “Three days from now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three days passed in
the blink of an eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dawn. The sky was
barely lit. Within Ning’s room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son, take
these with you.” With a wave of Snow’s hand, atop Ning’s bed,
two large sets of beast fur clothing as well as some other
miscellaneous items appeared out of nowhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother.” Ning
couldn’t help but say. “I’ve already prepared everything.
Clothing, food, tools.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yichuan snapped coldly,
“If we tell you to take it, then take it. Your mother personally
stitched every single one of these items with her own hands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart shook.
He couldn’t help but glance at his mother. Yuchi Snow’s gaze
remained on her son, and Ning could clearly sense the boundless,
infinite love within his mother’s gaze…ever since he was young,
his mother had taken care of him in every way possible. It was like
he was everything to her. For him to go adventuring, his mother most
likely was truly frightened for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the saying goes,
‘When the son travels far, his mother worries at home.’ What’s
more, this time he was going out to adventure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father.” Ning had
a serious thought. He hurriedly asked, “This time, when I go out,
will Ji Lee secretly…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He will not.”
Yichuan said coldly. “The reason why our Ji clan has been able to
remain in existence in this part of the world for so long is because
of our internal unity. We absolute forbid infighting. Anyone who
violates this would suffer the pursuit and slaughter of all five
prefectures of the Ji clan! In addition, I understand Lee’s
personality very well. He just doesn’t want to submit to Prefecture
Lord Young, but in his heart, he still holds the matters of the Ji
clan in the highest regard. In addition, his arrogance is bred into
his bones. He disdains doing such things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded as though
he had understood something.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry about
Ji Lee.” Yichuan barked. “What you need to worry more about are
those Diremonsters. Diremonsters all possess different innate powers
and also have different tactics. Even the Xiantian level experts of
the Ji clan of the West Prefecture will often die, much less you, who
have not even reached the Xiantian level!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t say such
things.” Snow said hurriedly. “Our son is about to go out
adventuring. Say something more pleasant. Ning, son, Mother has one
more thing to give you.” As she spoke, a golden book appeared in
her hands. The pages seemed made from gold leaf, and on top of the
book there were four ancient-looking words: [Wind Wing Evasion
Technique].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is a set of
footwork techniques, and this is also the most precious Immortal
training manual which Mother has. Wait until you become a Xiantian
lifeform before reading it.” Snow instructed. “Also, you are not
permitted to teach it to any other member of the Ji clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Shadewind Steps]
which his mother had taught him was something which only his mother
knew! This was because even the Ji clan didn’t possess that
footwork technique, so his mother had instructed him…that he was
forbidden from teaching the [Shadewind Steps] to the other members of
the Ji clan. This [Windwing Evasion] technique was also possessed by
his mother alone, and thus she was forbidding him from teaching it to
other members of the Ji clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. You can
head out now.” Yichuan spoke. “If you are going to leave, then
leave. Be straightforward about it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father. Mother. I’m
leaving now.” Ning looked at his parents.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, with a turn
of his head, he left. Outside, Mowu and his female maidservant,
Autumn Leaf, were waiting for him.
</P>

Chapter 10 - Eastmount Marsh
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the mountain forest
outside the West Prefecture City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning, Mowu, and his
maidservant Autumn Leaf were each seated on a black ferobeast. This
beast was shaped like a leopard, and its body was covered with faint
leopard-type patterns. It had a single horn on its head. This was an
extremely ferocious type of beast. It could clamber up mountains like
flat land, and was extremely fast. It was an excellent mount, but of
course, it was a bit inferior to a tamed monstrous beast.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given Ning’s status,
he was being quite low-key in riding this sort of mount.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“West Prefecture
City.” Ning turned and looked back, staring at the distant,
enormous city. He had lived there ever since he was young.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go!” Ning
shouted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a kick to the
waist of the mounted beast, the mounted beast immediately leapt
forward at a gallop, while Autumn Leaf and Mowu hurriedly rode their
own black ferobeasts behind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Winter left. Spring
came.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On a grassy area within
a mountain village, there were dozens of fur-clad men moving forward
happily, half of them carrying burdens on shoulder poles.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Dala!” A
clearly inexperienced, spear-wielding youngster called out excitedly,
“Before this, you never let us visit Eastmount Marsh, and you said
that Eastmount Marsh was extremely dangerous. But this time…we
encountered no danger at all, and we managed to catch so many fish.
It will be enough for our tribe to eat for a long time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A heroic, bear-like
figure next to him laughed, “Ah Yi, you brought us good luck. This
time to Eastmount Marsh, not a single tribesman died. This is very
rare. However, don’t underestimate Eastmount Marsh. Eastmount Marsh
is one of the places in this area with the most Diremonsters within
an area of ten thousand square kilometers. But of course, the fish in
Eastmount Marsh are boundless in number as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah Yi, this is the
first time you’ve gone fishing with us. After a few more trips,
you’ll know how dangerous it is. When we go back, you need to
exercise more and refine your ki. Only when you are strong will you
be able to live a longer life.” A one-armed man next to them
laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah Yi isn’t a
child anymore. This time, when we go back, we need to find a woman
for Ah Yi. Let’s get some good furs and go to one of the
neighboring tribes to exchange them for a fertile woman with big
buttocks.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get a few more
women, so they can birth a few more childrens.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The older men were all
teasing this youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just at this time, from
the brambles and bushes nearby, a monstrous beast with black fur was
lying in wait. Its fur was extremely smooth, and the contours of its
body were sleek and soft. It seemed like a panther of some sort. A
faint hint of green could be seen in its eyes, and its body was
nearly seven meters long. Its furry mane was extremely tough, and it
was shaped like a ring of circular spikes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was waiting. Waiting
for an opportunity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry about
that. I’ll find one for myself.” Ah Yi was a bit embarrassed, and
his face was turning red. He hastily called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, he’s shy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The older men laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Roaaaar!” A black
blur suddenly pounced over, pouncing directly towards the closest
tribesman, a man who was holding a carrying pole.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Monster!” The
other tribesmen hurriedly roared in anger, and the spears in their
hands thrust out. They had painstakingly trained since their youth,
and had been refining their internal energy for dozens of years, and
now possessed great strength. “Bang!” The enormous black blur’s
claws easily swept aside the spears, knocking them to one side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The surrounding
tribesmen all roared with anger, thrusting out with their spears as
well. As a small tribe, they didn’t possess any profound Immortal
techniques, making spear and polearm type weapons extremely popular
amongst them. So long as they trained a few simple movements every
day, after a few dozen years, their power would still be
extraordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hua!” Stepping on
the polearms, the enormous black blur easily leapt up and pounced
towards the center of the group of tribesmen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These tribesmen often
went to Eastmount Marsh to fish, and thus they selected a fairly safe
return path, one which rarely encountered monstrous beasts. But
caution was bred into their bones, and so the tribesmen with the
carrying poles were all in the center, while the powerful tribal
warriors with weapons at the ready were on the outer perimeter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A monster!” The
one-armed man called out hurriedly. “Careful.” As he spoke, he
brandished his single blade, pouncing towards the massive black blur.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Monster, die!” The
most powerful of the tribal warriors, the bear-like, ‘Uncle Dala’,
also brandished his long greataxe as he threw himself towards the
black blur.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby tribesmen
were all going crazy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them knew how
powerful Bi’an Tigers were. Just then, six powerful warriors had
surrounded and attacked this Bi’an Tiger, but it had easily stepped
on their weapons and jumped into their center, causing them all to
understand…that this was most likely an extremely terrifying
monstrous beast that had already reached the peak of the Houtian
level. Today, it was possible that several of them would die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grrrrrrrrrr.” The
Bi’an Tiger roared angrily. Unlike before, where it moved quickly,
this time it stayed where it was, attacking wildly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The one-armed man was
sent flying backwards by the collision, while Uncle Dala continued to
chop downwards with his greataxe while roaring wildly. The Bi’an
Tiger had also noticed that this greataxe wielding human was the most
dangerous of the group, and so he didn’t pay any attention to the
other tribal warriors, using his sharp claws to smash directly
against the greataxe, causing its trajectory to be altered. However,
the greataxe still landed on the flank of the Bi’an Tiger, chopping
out a massive wound. Only, the Bi’an Tiger’s muscles around its
flank tightened, and very little blood flowed out. The main problem
was that the greataxe hadn’t landed a deep enough blow. At the same
time the Bi’an Tiger batted the greataxe aside, roaring, the Bi’an
Tiger opened its massive maw and bit down towards Uncle Dala.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Dala.” The
somewhat stupefied youngster, Ah Yi, was stunned and called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dala!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dala!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The surrounding
tribesmen were all worried as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shua!” Something
flashed past like a glittering meteor from afar, instantly
penetrating the Bi’an Tiger’s skull, then flying out from the
other side before penetrating into a giant tree…and then shot out
from the other side of the tree as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grrr…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Uncle Dala fell to the
ground, with the massive body of the Bi’an Tiger on top of him,
blood covering Uncle Dala’s face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Dala.” The
youngster, Ah Yi, immediately ran over. He was at the verge of tears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m fine.” That
powerful tribesman pushed the Bi’an Tiger off, then stood up while
rubbing his face, finding that it was covered with blood. “This
isn’t my blood. It is the Bi’an Tiger’s blood.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The one armed man
walked over and took a glance as well, first looking at the corpse of
the Bi’an Tiger, and then at the nearby tree. His pupils
contracted, and he whispered, “For an arrow to pierce through the
rock-hard skull of the Bi’an Tiger, and then through the black
arrowwood tree…that’s simply terrifying. In addition, the Bi’an
Tiger suffered the arrow in mid-leap. This archery skill…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Definitely a godly
archer.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A godly archer shot
this arrow.” All of the tribesmen stared at the corpse of the Bi’an
Tiger, then looked afar into the general direction from which the
arrow had come from and where the godly archer must be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua! Hua! Hua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Three figures drew from
deep within the mountain forests. The tribesmen watched carefully…and
soon, they were able to see them clearly. Three people, riding
extremely handsome black ferobeasts. The black ferobeasts moved
through the mountain slopes as though they were travelling on flat
land, and quickly arrived before the tribesmen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uh….” Seeing the
three people in front of them, all the tribesmen were awestruck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were riding
handsome black ferobeasts, and wore extremely meticulous, beautifully
made beast fur clothes. The person in front was a seemingly very
young and handsome young man, while by his side was an extremely
beautiful girl. The men could swear to themselves…that they
couldn’t find such a girl as beautiful as this one in their entire
tribe. Although she was dressed in warrior’s clothes, it couldn’t
hide her beauty. As for the man on the other side of the youngster,
he emitted a fierce, ferocious aura, causing the hearts of these
tribesmen to quail.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hu.” The older man
leapt down from his black ferobeast, walking over to the tall, thick
black arrowwood tree, snatching out the arrow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.” The
man walked next to the youngster, respectfully offering him the
arrow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning accepted it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they had
prepared many arrows for this adventuring expedition, if they
abandoned every arrow they shot out, they probably would run out of
arrows soon. These were all extremely good arrows…they could be
used multiple times.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Honored young
master.” The one-armed tribesman went forward, respectfully bowing.
“Thank you for acting to save us. Might I ask if there is some way
in which our Metalstone Tribe can serve you, young master?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other tribesmen
didn’t dare to make a sound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Someone who brought a
maidservant and a manservant while adventuring…this clearly was no
ordinary person. And in addition, he had been referred to as ‘young
master’ earlier. Someone who was respectfully addressed as ‘young
master’ was generally the son of a tribal chief of a major tribe
with tens of thousands of tribesmen. Clearly, this youngster should
belong to an extremely large tribe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are you familiar
with Eastmount Marsh?” Ning, riding on the black ferobeast, asked
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tribesmen looked at
each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why was this young
master going to Eastmount Marsh? He definitely couldn’t be going
there for fishing like they had, right? It would definitely be very
dangerous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am.” The
powerful, dark-skinned Uncle Dala strode forward. “I have been
fishing in Eastmount Marsh for dozens of years now, and am very
familiar with this place. Young master, if you wish to go to
Eastmount Marsh, I can lead the way for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent.” Ning,
mounted on the black ferobeast, laughed ,and then with a flip of his
hand, tossed over a ‘beasthead’ of gold. “Come with me, then.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Accepting the beasthead
of gold, Uncle Dala’s eyes instantly lit up. This beasthead of
gold, weighing exactly ten pounds, would be more than enough for his
child to live off of for the rest of his life. He immediately gave it
to the nearby one armed man. “Help me take it back and give it to
my eldest son. If I die, then help me take care of my three little
kids.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The one
armed man nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Report your name.”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Honored young
master, you can address me as Dala!” Uncle Dala said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dala, mount on her
black ferobeast.” Ning pointed to Autumn Leaf’s mount. “Autumn
Leaf, you come sit with me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, young master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf leapt down,
then immediately mounted Ning’s black ferobeast, then held her arms
around Ning’s waist. She had served Ning since he was born, and
they were as close to each other as real siblings. In addition, as
Ning’s personal maidservant, it was essentially determined long ago
that she was Ning’s woman, and thus there were no taboos between
them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Uncle Dala, holding his
breath, carefully mounted the black ferobeast. He had never ridden on
such a fine mount before.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning ordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
rode the black ferobeasts, quickly disappearing into the mountain
forests.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Saber.” The
youngster, Ah Yi, asked frantically. “Uncle Dala is going to take
them to the Eastmount Marsh. Will it be dangerous?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The one-armed man
nodded. “They aren’t like us. That youngsters is definitely the
son of a leader of a large tribe, and has received the finest
instruction since he was young. That arrow was probably loosed by
him. He has most likely come to Eastmount Marsh for a rite-of-passage
adventure! He has to kill a certain number of monstrous beasts, but
Eastmount Marsh is too large and too complicated an area. Just
relying on a simple map isn’t sufficient, so they asked for Uncle
Dalat to help lead the way.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Rites-of-passage?
But that youngster isn’t an adult yet.” Ah Yi said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Some people look
older than their age, others look younger.” The one armed man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, right now,
Ning was just eleven years old, although he was already 1.7 meters
tall, the same height he was in his past life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But that young
master was very benevolent.” The one armed man sighed. “Just
then, when the Bi’an Tiger ambushed us, if that young master hadn’t
intervened…several of us probably would have died, and the first to
die would have been your Uncle Dala! Having had his life saved, your
Uncle Dala would go guide them, even if it cost him his life. In
addition, the young master gave him a beasthead of gold. Ten pounds!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry, hurry,
hurry.” The one armed man suddenly shouted. “Butcher that Bi’an
Tiger’s corpse and take it back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One after another
pulled out their knives and hatchets, quickly butchering the Bi’an
Tiger’s corpse, and then they continued on their return trip.

Chapter 11 - Entering the Marsh
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s squad, mounted
on the three black ferobeasts, charged through the borders of the
mountain forest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look.” Uncle Dala
pointed in front. “Eastmount Marsh is up ahead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eastmount Marsh.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared off into
the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous, endless
lake stretched far into the distance, flashing with the beautiful
light of the spring sun. At one glance, one could see flying beasts
diving down and snatching up fish, or some tails of enormous aquatic
creatures wriggling amongst the reeds. Occasionally, a massive head
would be seen. This was the world of monsters!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eastmount Marsh.”
Ning murmured. “We’re finally here.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eastmount Marsh was
located between the territory of the Ji clan and the Ironwood clan.
The Ironwood clan was a hegemonic power on par with the Ji clan, but
it was the Ji clan’s enemy!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eastmount Marsh was
over a thousand kilometers wide, and was on par in size with a
‘province’ in his previous life. Such an enormous lake…naturally
had countless monstrous beasts here. The monstrous beasts which the
Ji clan knew about numbered up to twelve!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since leaving the
Ji clan of the West Prefecture and adventuring ,Ning had wanted to go
fight with a few Xiantian level Diremonsters, but Diremonsters were
all hidden within the deep lakes and tall mountains. How could they
be so easily found? In the past, he had spent nearly an entire month
searching an area without any success. Furious, Ning immediately
changed their path and headed straight to Eastmount Marsh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are many
monsters in Eastmount Marsh, and many of them are early Xiantian
level. I refuse to believe I won’t encounter a single one.” Ning
was like a newborn calf who didn’t know the meaning of fear.
However, he didn’t dare to be too incautious either, because many
clansmen of the Ji clan had died here in Eastmount Marsh, such as his
grandfather, who had died here at Eastmount Marsh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mowu. Autumn Leaf.”
Ning leapt off the back of his black ferobeast and instructed,
“Eastmount Marsh is too risky a place, and there is danger
everywhere. In addition, the black ferobeasts are of no use in the
water. The two of you, take these three black ferobeasts and head to
the Metalstone Tribe. Wait for me at the Metalstone Tribe!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mowu and Autumn Leaf
glanced at each other. They could only reply respectfully, “Yes,
young master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dala.” Ning looked
at the swarthy, big man. “You and I will make a trip to this lake.
Help me get used to the general areas around here, and then you can
go back and rest at the Metalstone Tribe as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, young master.”
Uncle Dala said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately headed
forward, and Uncle Dala, hefting his greataxe, followed behind.
Autumn Leaf and Mowu watched as their young master entered the
distant Eastmount Marsh. Although they were nervous, there was
nothing they could do. One of them was a maidservant, while the other
was nothing more than a person assigned to teach the young master his
abundant mountaineering experience. Their power was far inferior to
Ning’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vast lake was
filled with myriad beautiful scenes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Within this great
lake, there are places with islands of firmer terrain and grasses as
well.” Uncle Dala laughed. “In fact, there are even some small
villages. But of course, most of the muddy areas, if you step into
them, you’ll sink into the marsh…and in addition, there is of
course the immeasurably deep lake itself. Within the marsh, it is
difficult to move about, and if you aren’t careful, you’ll sink
into it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was right next to
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Metalstone Tribe
has lived in a village near the marsh for centuries now, and often
come here to fish. We know exactly where which roads are passable and
which aren’t.” Uncle Dala was very confident.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pa! Pa!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Striding through the
mud, Ning followed this tribal warrior through Eastmount Marsh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look.” A beastskin
parchment appeared out of nowhere in Ning’s hands. “This is the
map of Eastmount Lake. Lead me to these circled areas.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah!” Uncle Dala
was terrified. “These…these are all places where Diremonsters are
hiding. These are the most dangerous places. We don’t dare go near
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You don’t need to
go near them.” Ning shook his head. “Just lead me there, and tell
me from afar how to go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Uncle Dala’s forehead
was covered in sweat. He nodded. “Alright. I’ll lead you, young
master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eastmount Marsh was
simply too vast. It was indeed quite slow for them to move through it
relying on their legs alone. In addition, this was Ning’s first
time coming here, and the various meandering pathways stretched for
thousands of kilometers. Fortunately, the experienced Uncle Dala
guided him to one hidden pathway after another, allowing them to
easily navigate this marsh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
over a month passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had carried food
and beverages within his kalestone, and in addition, they could roast
the meat of some monstrous beasts. Whenever they went to sleep, they
would just find a random patch of dry land or grass. Ning wasn’t in
a hurry to go challenge those hidden Diremonsters. First, he wanted
to locate them. Afterwards, he would travel by himself and relying on
his ‘one with the world’ level of footwork to easily walk atop
the surface of the lake water. He would be able to traverse a
thousand kilometers in but a single day.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the last
place.” Uncle Dala pointed from afar at a distant place, where the
luxurious growth of aquatic plants, at least three meters high, waved
in the wind. “Right there, where the aquatic plants are growing, is
the lair of a Greater Beast. Supposedly, this is an extremely,
extremely large rhinoceros, an aquatic rhinoceros the size of a small
mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. Let’s go
back. After returning to the Metalstone Tribe, I will definitely
reward you heavily.” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master, you’ve
given me enough.” Uncle Dala said hastily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This seemingly delicate
youngster was actually terrifyingly powerful. During their month in
Eastmount Marsh, they had been attacked by quite a few monstrous
beasts, but all of them died to but a single blow of the youngster’s
sword! Ning didn’t care about the corpses of the monstrous beasts
either, but Uncle Dala’s heart ached every time. This was monstrous
beast flesh. If they sold it, the tribe would be in a much better
situation, but he couldn’t carry it all back, so all he could do
was to carve out a few choice parts and take them with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrm?” Ning and
Uncle Dala both suddenly stared into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From afar, there was a
squad of troops, with quite a few figures within.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep in the marsh,
there were solid areas, muddy areas, and even hilly areas, along with
a large mountain. That mountain was known as the East Mountain, which
was why this marsh was known as Eastmount Marsh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Off in the distance, a
squad of apparently several hundred soldiers could be seen clustered
in on a hill. Suddenly, ten figures ran over at rapid speed towards
Ning and Uncle Dala.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, let’s
leave.” Uncle Dala was so frightened that he immediately turned
tail and ran.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of those ten men
was wearing blue metal armor, and with a howl, he leapt forward at an
astonishing speed, blocking off Uncle Dala’s escape path.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The two of you.”
The blue armored man stared at them coldly, pausing only briefly to
glance at the exquisite beast fur clothes on Ning’s body, before
continuing disdainfully, “Come with us!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What do you want
with us?” Uncle Dala, seeing the man’s armor, immediately bowed
and said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other nine walked
over as well, all of them dressed in armor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up. If we tell
you to follow us, then follow us. Otherwise, you die here!” These
armor-clad guards all stared coldly while hefting their weapons,
clearly very skilled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Uncle Dala looked at
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s take a look
for now.” Ning was actually quite calm. These armored guards were
clearly no ordinary people, but to him, they were like nothing more
than wild chickens facing a ravenous dog. But why did the armored
guards want them to follow? If it wasn’t necessary, Ning didn’t
want to so casually slaughter others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Move.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Under the watchful
gazes of the ten armored guards, Ning and Uncle Dala headed towards
the hill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was some grass on
the hill, and there were currently hundreds of people there. Most of
them were lying there with their hands and feet bound, while roughly
a hundred armored guards were in a perimeter around them, while there
was a stone seat in the center. On the stone seat, there was a bulky,
muscled man, at least six and a half feet tall, wearing thick armor
and with a dominating gaze.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared in surprise
at the tall armored man who sat in the middle. The ‘demonstone’
in Ning’s pocket was currently radiating heat. Clearly, it had
sensed the presence of a nearby monster. At the same time, Ning could
vaguely feel that the massive armored man escorted by the many guards
had an extraordinary aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s a
Diremonster.” Ning hurriedly inspecting everyone carefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only humans were
nearby. A monster which could take human form was, without question,
a Diremonster!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had brought many
objects with him on this journey, and a demonstone was one of them.
Demonstones…were a type of special natural rock. Once they sensed
the aura of a monster, they would emanate light and heat. Some cities
that were even larger than West Prefecture City would have ‘Monster
Revealing Mirrors’ installed on the city gates, which were formed
from multiple demonstones. So long as a monster drew near, the
Monster Revealing Mirror would immediately radiate light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Humans had a human
aura, while monsters naturally had their own monstrous auras. This
was a type of life aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dala!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle Dala!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, several
voices rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Uncle Dala
both turned their heads and saw that amongst the bound people, there
were ten of them calling towards the two of them. This caused Uncle
Dala to immediately have a distressed look on his face. “Black
Tiger, why have you been bound here?” Those ten or so people
belonged to his tribe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dala, why are you
here? That giant person is a Diremonster. He’s going to eat us
all.” One of the bound tribesmen called out frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Diremonster?”
Uncle Dala was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared back at
that massive man in heavy armor, seated in the center of that ring of
armored guards. Taking a careful glance, he saw that the giant man
had a hint of blood at the corner of his lips, and he was currently
smacking them in a satisfied manner. This caused Ning’s heart to
immediately become filled with an urge to kill. “So the Diremonster
which my demonstone sensed is him! Eastmount Marsh has a total of
twelve Diremonsters. I wonder which one he is.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shut your mouth.”
An armored guard walked over and kicked that bound man, kicking him
wildly and repeatedly. “All of you, shut your mouths.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are harming your
fellow humans for the sake of a Diremonster, and you want us to shut
our mouths?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And you are the
venerable Blue Guards of the Ironwood clan. You really are a disgrace
to the Ironwood clan!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kick away, kick as
much as you like, kick us all to death.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The people being kicked
shouted wildly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop it!” The
massive, heavily armored man seated on the stone bench rumbled. His
voice was very deep, as though coming from a bullhorn. “If you kick
them to death, then I’ll eat you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The armored guard
glanced at the heavily armored giant, and then unhappily stepped
back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aquatic Rhino King!”
A bald armored guard growled, “We have already helped you capture
over five hundred people. Our comrades have spread out everywhere to
capture people, and have already done our part. Give our young master
back to us, and our Ironwood clan will act as though this never
happened. Otherwise, if the situation escalates, Aquatic Rhino
King…you should know that you are unable to bear the fury of our
Ironwood clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Watching from a
distance under escort from two armored guards, Ning’s eyes lit up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aquatic Rhino King?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was only a single
Aquatic Rhinoceros amongst the twelve Diremonsters of Eastmount
Marsh. It was an early Xiantian level Diremonster!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Early Xiantian
level?” Ning’s eyes were filled with a killing intent. “I’ve
searched a long, long time for a Diremonster of this level of power.
This really is a case of ‘searching far and wide to no avail, but
then discovering it all of a sudden’.”
</P>

Chapter 12 - A Slaughter Begins
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Aquatic Rhino King,
seated on his stone chair, glanced at the bald armored guard.
Reaching out with his enormous hand, he grabbed a nearby bound youth,
placing the youth down on his thigh. The youth, on the thigh of the
Aquatic Rhino King, was like a tiny doll, without any ability to
resist at all. The youth screamed in pain, “He told you to go
capture people, so do so. All you need to do is capture a thousand
people. Oh mighty Aquatic Rhino King, the two we just captured, plus
the nineteen you ate earlier, means that I have already ordered my
subordinates to capture five hundred and eighty three humans for you
already.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry.”
The voice of the Aquatic Rhino King was still very low and very
thick. “I, the Aquatic Rhino King, will do what I promise. After
you catch a thousand people, I will definitely spare you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Baldy!” The
Aquatic Rhino King stared with his massive eyes at the bald armored
guard. “Don’t try to use the Ironwood clan’s name to try and
scare me. Here in the Eastmount Marsh, every year, how many disciples
of the Ironwood clan and the Ji clan die? You came to adventure in
Eastmount Marsh. If you die, you die! Even if this soft-skinned,
tender-fleshed ‘young master’ of your Ironwood clan really has an
extremely high status, if I were to kill you all, most likely it
would be a long time before the Ironwood clan found out that you were
all dead, and wouldn’t be able to find out who the killer was!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Blue Guards could
only grit their teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Aquatic Rhino King
laughed, and with a wave of his hand, tossed the bound ‘young
master’ of the Ironwood clan to the ground again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you, go out
and capture more people. Go capture more, quickly. Go capture more of
these lowly peasants.” Lying on the ground, the Ironwood clan’s
‘young master’ was roaring angrily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But young master.”
The bald armored guard said frantically, “We’ve already captured
virtually all of the hunters and fishers here in Eastmount Marsh.
Even if there were any more here…there would only be a very few.
It’s going to be very hard to reach four hundred.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The young master of the
Ironwood clan, lying on the ground, howled fiercely, “Then find a
tribe. Any who resist, slaughter them all. Bring the rest back here.
You should be able to find a few hundred people in a tribe, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Massacre a tribe?”
The bald armored guard was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What are you afraid
of?” The Ironwood clan’s ‘young master’ roared, “If you are
afraid, then go to the territory of the Ji clan! Go massacre a clan
in the Ji clan’s territory. Kill any who resist and bring the
others back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bald armored guard
clenched his teeth. “Yes!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If it was a case of the
two major sides engaging in battle, or an order from their master in
ordinary circumstances, they wouldn’t hesitate at all to kill. But
they were now serving a Diremonster to kill and torture other
humans…this caused the valiant armored guards to feel incomparable
shame.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha…” The
Aquatic Rhino King laughed loudly, his voice like thunder. “Good,
good, good. After you round up a thousand humans, I’ll definitely
spare you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Boom!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Aquatic Rhino King
rubbed his rumbling stomach, licking his lips. “Just ate a man. Now
I’m hungry again! Who should I eat?” The Aquatic Rhino King cast
his gaze towards the others, and instantly, the people who were tied
up all had changed looks on their face. Many people’s eyes were
filled with fear.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had personally
witnessed this Diremonster eat someone alive earlier. They weren’t
afraid of death, but to be eaten one bite at a time was a sort of
hell!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Um?” The Aquatic
Rhino King’s gaze landed on the distant Ning, and his eyes lit up.
“Um, that human youth’s skin is so delicate and so clean. He
seems very young. His flesh definitely will be delicious. Quick,
someone, go bring him to me.” As he spoke, he began to drool.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
Uncle Dala looked frantically towards Ning. There were ten Blue
Guards next to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Move it.” A Blue
Guard grabbed at Ning’s beast fur clothes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned his head
and glanced at the Blue Guard. With a movement of his right hand, he
sent his right palm chopping towards the chest of the Blue Guard.
Bang…a low sound rang out, and the Blue Guard was sent flying far
away into the air. His eyes were bulging and round, and his mouth was
hanging wide open. His face was red. Bang! Fresh blood spewed out
from his shattered organs. He fell into the watery marsh over a
hundred meters away, and as he did, he kicked up a splash of water,
then sank down, not moving at all. Clearly, he was dead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“To willingly serve
as the fangs and claws for a Diremonster and harm those of your own
race…you deserve death!” A cold voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Utter silence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The five hundred plus
people who were tied up on the hill, as well as the hundred plus Blue
Guards, and even that seated Diremonster, the Aquatic Rhino King, all
turned to look at the seemingly fragile youngster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A single palm sent
someone flying over a hundred meters?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wonderful!” The
Aquatic Rhino King was the first to react, and he actually became
excited. He naturally was very happy to witness humans killing each
other, and he immediately shouted, “Aren’t you going to fight
him? He just killed one of your people! Quick, fight!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!” The other
Blue Guards instantly saw red, and all of them transformed into cruel
blurs as they pounced towards him. The youngster in front of them had
just killed one of their comrades. When their comrade had died to
that palm just now, the only thing that could be said was that they
were unable to react in time. In addition, this youngster probably
trained in some sort of Fiendgod Body Refining technique. He just had
a bit of strength, that was all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In a life and death
battle, what mattered was the sword and saber techniques which one
had refined and trained in. Even if one was much physically weaker,
one’s sword would still be able to pierce through an opponent’s
skull!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hu! Hu! Hu! Twenty Blue
Guards attacked in unison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a wave of his
hand, Ning pushed the nearby Uncle Dala, who went flying. Dala
somersaulted in a midair, then landed on the ground, completely
uninjured. Uncle Dala looked frantically at the twenty Blue Guards
charging towards Ning. “Young master, be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, run.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young man, quick,
run!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The bound prisoners all
grew frantic as well, and they began to call out, staring at the
youngster with worry. They knew how powerful these Blue Guards
were…these Blue Guards were highly experienced Ninefang Warriors
who were extremely skilled at group attacks. These were elite
soldiers of the Ironwood clan. Only a Xiantian level lifeform would
be able to survive the attack of twenty of these Blue Guards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Faced with the
attacking Blue Guards, Ning suddenly transformed into a gust of wind,
the carefree wind which went where it pleased. When the Blue Guards
chopped and stabbed at them with their sabers, spears, and sharp
swords, Ning leisurely stepped past, easily making his way past their
combined attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hu!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A series of palm
slapping sounds in a row. Even as Ning made his way past the attacks
of the twenty Blue Guards, he slapped out with his palms, each strike
coming from his wrist and striking onto the faces of the Blue Guards.
Each palm strike of Ning’s carried ten thousand pounds of force,
and sent these Blue Guards flying. No one was able to block Ning’s
palm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hu!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s body came to a
halt. All twenty of the Blue Guards had been knocked flying to the
side, all of their heads and necks crooked and twisted, blood flowing
from their mouths, noses, and ears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them dead!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good heavens!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…but…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hundreds of bound
people and the Blue Guards of the Ironwood clan…even the
Diremonster was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…you…” The
young master of the Ironwood clan who was lying there bound on the
floor was both furious and frantic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are the Blue
Guards of the Ironwood clan.” The other Blue Guards had very ugly
looks on their faces. They were furious, but didn’t dare to make a
move.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said with cold
calm, “To willingly serve as the claws and fangs of a Diremonster
is a crime that deserves death.” The Ironwood clan and the Ji clan
were enemies to begin with, and these dead enemies had even been
willing to serve as the claws of a Diremonster!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sharp sword appeared
out of nowhere into Ning’s hands. His feet moved, and then sword
light began to flash…in the blink of an eye, nine of the Blue
Guards held their throats, gurgling a few times, before collapsing,
blood flowing from the wound in their necks. In terms of footwork or
swordplay, this youngster was extremely fast, causing the other Blue
Guards to be terrified.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Earlier, Ning had
already been terrifying without even using his sword. But now, he
began to wield his sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, run.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aquatic Rhino King,
save us!” The Blue Guards were completely frantic. This youngster
who had appeared out of nowhere was clearly about to massacre them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Aquatic Rhino King
just sat there, laughing loudly. “All I said was that if you seized
a thousand humans, I’d spare you. I never said I’d save you from
others. Kill, kill, kill.” The Aquatic Rhino King wasn’t worried
at all. To him, a Diremonster, these humans in front of him were
nothing more than humans. This was nothing more than internal warfare
amongst humans.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chi! Chi! Chi!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blood was flying
everywhere, and one Blue Guard after another fell down lifelessly.
The Blue Guards all fled in every which way in terror. They were
truly frightened now. Their swordplay and saberplay, against this
youngster, clearly weren’t enough to even withstand a single blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, run.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hu….moving at extreme
speed with the sound of the wind, multiple blurry forms of Ning
appeared out of nowhere. Every single Blue Guard fell where they
stood. Some had been stabbed through the heart, others had their
throats cut. Blood stained the ground. The Blue Guards lay collapsed
on the ground, scattered throughout the area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every single Blue Guard
had died!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrm?” The Aquatic
Rhino King, previously just enjoying the show, suddenly stood up, his
face changed. The last, full-strength attack which Ning had employed
had pushed his speed to the utmost limit, generating dozens of blurry
images. This had truly stunned the Aquatic Rhino King. Before this,
he hadn’t considered this youngster as a potential opponent. But
now, he began to feel a bit wary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So strong.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They deserved to
die.” The bound people all felt extremely excited. They hadn’t
expected this youth to be as powerful as this. Could it be that this
powerful youth was so powerful…that he was going to kill this
terrifying Diremonster?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Sword light flashing, the ten or so people around Ning instantly
found their binds had been cut through.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Human youth.” The
Aquatic Rhino King transformed into a black blur, charging towards
Ning and smashing down at him with a massive fist that was covered
with a thick layer of ice. “They are my food.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clang.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning struck out with
his Darknorth sword, stabbing straight towards that massive fist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BANG!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was as though a
mountain had collapsed. Ning flew back a hundred meters, and the
layer of ice on the fist of the Aquatic Rhino King also exploded, and
even half the arm of the monster had exploded. The watching tribesmen
all revealed looks of joy and expectation on their faces. Had the
Diremonster’s arm been destroyed?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Excellent.” The
Aquatic Rhino King growled. “You are worthy of me using my real
form.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Aquatic Rhino King
suddenly transformed into a huge, watery fog, and then the enormous
fog of water suddenly coalesced at high speed, transforming into a
hill-sized, thirty meters tall massive monster. This was an enormous
Aquatic Rhinoceros. It was covered with an extremely thick blue hide,
and was seventy meters long. It truly was like a small mountain. The
energy emitting from its nostrils caused the ground to be covered
with a layer of thick ice, and the nearby tribesmen were instantly
frozen into ice statues. At this time, Uncle Dala was still rapidly
rescuing the other members of his clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, leave.” The
distant Ning transformed into a stream of light, travelling atop the
water. In but an instant, he scurried over, and as his sword flashed,
the ropes binding the dozens of men were instantly cut apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why aren’t you
leaving?” Ning roared angrily, and then turned to stare at the
giant monster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These people quickly
grabbed the weapons lying on the ground, cut open the ropes on the
people next to them, and then in the blink of an eye, the four
hundred lucky survivors quickly fled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fleeing? I’m going
to freeze you and slowly enjoy eating you.” The Aquatic Rhino King
stared around him. Instantly, a cold aura began to radiate forth, and
the temperature rapidly began to lower. A layer of ice and frost
began to spread out, and instantly, some people were turned into ice
statues. Only the fastest runners and the likes of Uncle Dala, who
had fled long ago, managed to survive.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am the Ironwood
clan’s…” The young master of the Ironwood clan was still
shouting fiercely, but halfway through his words, he turned into an
ice statue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the blink of an eye,
the area within thirty meters of the Aquatic Rhino King had turned
into a graveyard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only Ning and the
Aquatic Rhino King remained, staring at each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From off in the
distance, Uncle Dala and the dozens of lucky survivors still felt the
aftertaste of terror. A young man near Uncle Dala said with concern,
“Uncle Dala, will that young fellow survive?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He will, he will.”
Uncle Dala said with his mouth, but in his heart, he didn’t feel
too confident either. Would that youngster with astonishing strength
and swordplay be able to defeat the vicious, ferocious Diremonster?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why haven’t you
left yet!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Ning roared
in anger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once the battle began,
this distance of a three hundred meters, to the likes of Ning or the
Aquatic Rhino King, would be nothing at all. He wouldn’t be able to
help save them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Uncle
Dala gritted his teeth, then led his tribesmen to flee. As for those
of other tribes, they had fled long ago. They had been utterly
frightened.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 13 - Ji Ning Battles the Diremonster
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Freezing ice covered
the area. Frozen corpses stood there like ice statues, whether on the
ground, lying down, or standing up. There was no longer any hint of
life in them. These six hundred corpses, especially those of the five
hundred innocents, filled Ning’s heart with an even stronger desire
to kill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Human youth.” The
Aquatic Rhino’s four legs seemed like massive pillars, pawing at
the ground as it stared at Ning. “You have angered me. Those were
meant to be my food.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ice covered Ning,
and there was even a layer of frost on his fur clothes. But Ning’s
clothes rippled slightly, instantly breaking apart that layer of
frost. Still, a large amount of ice continued to accumulate…all
Ning could do was constantly break it apart and sent it flying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your swordplay and
footwork are both quite impressive, but you are still only at the
Houtian level. Whereas I, I am a mighty Xiantian lifeform.” The
Aquatic Rhino rumbled in deep throated laughter. “Since a few dozen
ordinary humans fled, you’ll have to be the compensatory prize. The
flesh of a powerful human youth is even more attractive to me than
that of a thousand ordinary humans.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I haven’t killed a
Xiantian lifeform yet.” Covered with frost, Ning stared at the
Aquatic Rhino, his voice ice cold. “Thus, I have an unquenchable
urge to kill a Xiantian lifeform! Aquatic Rhino King, as the first
Xiantian lifeform to die to me, you should feel proud! I will chop
off your flesh and personally sample it, and I’ll also let my
parents and clansmen taste your flesh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s left hand
suddenly was also grasping a precious sword, and he was now wielding
a Darknorth sword in each hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Twin swords? So it
seems your swordplay is just average. In this area around Swallow
Mountain, there isn’t a single person who uses twin swords who had
good sword techniques!” The Aquatic Rhino stared at Ning with its
enormous eyes, and then casually stamped on the ground, causing the
entire area to shake. And then, like a mountain, it came crashing
towards him. “Die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A massive hoof, so
large that several men would be needed to wrap their arms around it
in a circle, came crashing down from up high, stamping down towards
Ning. The air itself exploded with a desolate, ear-piercing boom, and
a blast of energy gouged multiple holes in the ground. Long before
this hoof actually touched Ning, Ning knew how powerful it was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swoosh!” Ning
first drew out a sword, which dimly flashed like a faint light of
water which cut at the enormous hoof in a thin line. After just
barely penetrating into the hoof’s skin, it was no longer able to
penetrate any further. Ning immediately moved like a gust of wind and
retreated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The earth shuddered,
and an enormous crater many meters in size appeared, while Ning
himself had already dodged more than thirty meters away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You won’t be able
to escape.” The Aquatic Rhino bellowed as it charged towards Ning.
Although it seemed to be clumsy, due to its massive size, it
travelled a huge distance with every step. Its enormous hooves
created massive crater-like hoof-prints in the ground with each
pounding step, and soon, it chased Ning all the way into a mountain
forest not too far from the hill.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This forest was only a
few square kilometers in size.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These trees won’t
be able to impede me at all.” The Aquatic Rhino bellowed, charging
through them. In front of the mountain-like Aquatic Rhino, these
large trees were like blades of grass being stepped on and moved
through by ordinary people.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He lives up to the
reputation of being an Aquatic Rhino. His physical strength is much
greater than that of an ordinary Diremonster’s.” Ning said to
himself. “And its skin is very thick. Just relying on my internal
ki energy and ‘one with the world’ swordplay, I’m unable to
even break through its skin. It seems I’ll have to rely on Fiendgod
Body Refining.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, with a leap,
suddenly was standing atop the crown of a tall, large tree. Standing
on the tree’s leaves, he didn’t sink down at all, staring down
into the matching gaze of the Aquatic Rhino.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?” The Aquatic
Rhino suddenly came to a halt. He sensed that there was a change to
this human youngster’s aura, and in terms of the strength of that
aura, it was only very slightly weaker than the Aquatic Rhino’s
own. “Fiendgod Body Refining?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning’s
skin was beginning to turn red. The power of the Sun and the Moon had
begun to totally fill his body, and his strength instantly rose to
the maximum limits.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he could break
through and reach the Xiantian lifeform level, the divine power in
his body would even be able to appear outside his body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, you are but a
Houtian lifeform. Even if you train in an Fiendgod Body Refining, you
are far inferior to me.” The Aquatic Rhino charged forward
ferociously, smashing through trees in its wake, and the trees it
smashed through all went ‘pengpengpeng’ as they collapsed, not
able to slow it down at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrmph.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Standing on the crown
of the tree, Ning stared down coldly at the charging Aquatic Rhino,
two swords in his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Aquatic Rhino was
physically enormous. Only a freakishly powerful Diremonster such as
Serpentwing would be able to fight against it head on. But, as an
expert swordsman, Ning would not do such a thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At that moment of
impact, Ning used his ‘one with the world’ level ‘Shadewind
Steps’ to their utmost limits, and in but a single sudden movement,
he dodged the Aquatic Rhino’s charge. Compared to Ning…the
Aquatic Rhino was simply far less agile. While dodging from the
Aquatic Rhino, the Darknorth sword in Ning’s hand sliced down
towards the Aquatic Rhino’s flank.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sword flashed like
a thin line, translucent, gem-like line of light…as though it were
a line created by a large number of waterdrops. The line came
slashing through the Aquatic Rhino’s flank!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Raindrop Sutra] - Rain
Line!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">‘Advanced’ level
swordplay!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Like the earlier attack
he had used to block the Aquatic Rhino’s stomp, this attack also
was one which activated on the power of nature. However, last time,
Ning had only used his internal ki energy as the foundation for the
attack, while this time…the Solar and Lunar energy in Ning’s body
exploded. Using the Fiendgod Body Refining strength as his foundation
meant that the power of this attack instantly increased by more than
a hundred times!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huala!” The tough
hide of the Aquatic Rhino, under the sharp slash of the precious
weapon, ‘Darknorth sword’, had an enormous wound chopped straight
through it. Fresh blood burst forth as though from a dam. Bang! An
enormous amount of blood exploded everywhere, and shattered
intestines could faintly be seen as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning landed on the
ground and turned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Aquatic Rhino,
which had been charging at high speed, had come to a sudden halt
while simultaneously letting out a roar of both pain and rage. His
muscles and flesh were quivering, and the enormous, ripped wound in
his body was rapidly beginning to shrink, but Ning’s sword attack
had been simply too vicious and the wound created had been too large.
Even despite trying hard to suppress the blood from flowing out and
to close the wound, blood still dripped out. It no longer seemed as
boastful as it had been earlier.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aquatic Rhino King,
the day of your death has come.” Ning transformed into a shadow,
flying at high speed towards the Aquatic Rhino.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Howl!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Aquatic Rhino let
out a fierce howl, and then began to charge madly…to the opposite
direction. It was fleeing!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fleeing!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is going to run
away, just like that?” Ning was astonished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But he quickly
understood. His father had previously told him that Diremonsters were
extremely crafty. Once they sensed any danger to their well-being,
they would immediately flee. Clearly, this Aquatic Rhino had already
discovered that its hide, which it was so proud of…could be broken
through by a slice from this youngster. This meant that one of its
greatest defenses was now useless!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s footwork and
agility far surpassed the Aquatic Rhino. After all, even the
Diremonster, Serpentwing, hadn’t been able to do anything to him
for a period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Aquatic Rhino had
always relied on its thick hide. It had thought that the youngster in
front of it couldn’t hurt it, while all it had to do was keep
charging. If it were to even graze the youngster, the youngster would
instantly be injured heavily or even die. But now, it discovered that
in but an single sword blow, the youngster had split his chest
open…how could this be allowed to continue?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Flee.” The Aquatic
Rhino fled wildly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My thick hide is
hard to split open even for those other Diremonsters. How could that
human youth’s sword be so powerful?” The Aquatic Rhino was
utterly frightened, not knowing what to do.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How could he flee?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, when utilizing
his ‘one with the world’ footwork, was only slightly slower than
Serpentwing. He was far superior to the Aquatic Rhino.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shua! Shua! Shua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had already caught
up to the Aquatic Rhino.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I serve the Azure
Skysnake King. You can’t kill me!” The Aquatic Rhino galloped
wildly while bellowing loudly, and then it also let out a desolate
scream, “King! Save me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“King! Save me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The low, fierce scream
travelled a very long distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s incomparably
agile body suddenly charged forward, while the twin swords in his
hands suddenly, simultaneously stabbed upwards. For a moment, Ning’s
entire body transformed into a dazzling-to-behold line of fire light,
and with utter ruthlessness, he stabbed upwards at the Aquatic
Rhino’s neck position. With a ‘Chi’ sound, the Aquatic Rhino’s
skull was broken through. A burst of fire rose over thirty meters
into the air before solidifying into a human form. It was the
fur-clad Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh…” The
Aquatic Rhino’s eyes were bulging and round. It hadn’t thought
that its glorious, brash life would have suddenly come to an end at
the hands of this human youth. As a Xiantian lifeform Diremonster,
although it possessed strong life force and wouldn’t die even if
stabbed in the heart, Ning had selected its true weak point! Forget
about the Aquatic Rhino; even if a Xiantian-level Fiendgod Body
Refiner had been stabbed in the head, he would also die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The massive corpse of
the Aquatic Rhino collapsed to the ground, crushing many trees
beneath it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The ‘Moth Flies
Into the Flame’ - It really does live up to its reputation as the
most powerful attack of the [Thunderflame Sword].” Ning landed
gracefully from mid-air, not a single hint of blood staining his
body. “By now, even the three major killing blows of the
[Thunderflame Sword] have been trained to the point of the ‘advanced’
level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Raindrop Sutra]
had nine techniques in total, and Ning was already at the ‘advanced’
level for all of them, able to summon the power of nature.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Thunderflame
Sword] was a bit harder, especially that last blow, ‘Moth Flies
Into the Flame’. Ning had never been able to truly grasp it to the
point of reaching the ‘advanced’ level, but just then, that
Diremonster, the Aquatic Rhino, had tried to charge into the nearby
marsh waters. If it had made it into the marsh waters, Ning wouldn’t
have been able to do anything to it. In order to instantly kill such
a powerful Diremonster with such strong life force…ordinary
techniques wouldn’t have been enough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had been frantic,
and naturally thought of the the ‘Moth Flies Into the Flame’
attack. Utilizing nature’s energy, he had pierced straight through
the extremely thick skull of the Aquatic Rhino, like a moth throwing
itself into a fire!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Diremonster.” Ning
looked at the mountain-like corpse of the Aquatic Rhino. He couldn’t
help but reveal a hint of excitement in his eyes. “This is the very
first Xiantian level Diremonster I have ever killed. But before
dying, didn’t he say something about being the subordinate of some
‘Azure Skysnake King’? Hrm, best that I leave quickly and not
allow anything out of the ordinary to occur.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning instantly appeared
next to the Aquatic Rhino’s corpse. His sword flashing, he quickly
chopped open the thick skin of the Aquatic Rhino. The skin of the
dead Aquatic Rhino was now clearly much weaker than before…in but a
few seconds, Ning retrieved from the Aquatic Rhino’s corpse a
black, palm-sized object that faintly emanated a fragrant scent. This
was the most precious item contained within the Aquatic Rhino’s
body; the bezoar. It was often described as a miraculous antidote to
poisons. The value of this Aquatic Rhino’s bezoar alone would be
enough to acquire an ordinary magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Time to leave.”
Holding the monstrous rhino’s bezoar, Ning instantly moved like a
gust of wind, flying away at high speed while occasionally landing
and taking a few steps on the surface of the water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Half-flying,
half-walking on the waves, he fled for more than three kilometers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Huahuahua…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, the water in
front of him suddenly began to vibrate, and an enormous whirlpool
appeared.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 14 - The Godbeast, ‘Azure Skysnake’
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?” Ji Ning,
staring in front of him, couldn’t help but come to a halt. “Could
it be that this Azure Skysnake King is really about to appear?” Not
taking the time to consider anything else, Ning immediately turned
and dashed across the surface of water towards a different direction,
desiring to flee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hua….”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An incomparably
beautiful, enormous serpent head emerged from the surface of the
lake, covered with jade green scales.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Staring at the enormous
serpent head of the Azure Skysnake King which had emerged, Ning’s
face grew solemn. “I’m in trouble now. I didn’t expect the
Azure Skysnake King to be this fast! With my ‘one with the world’
footwork, I can escape the attacks of many Diremonsters. In Eastmount
Marsh, there’s only a few Diremonsters that pose a threat to me,
but the Azure Skysnake King is one of them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“On my very first
trip to Eastmount Marsh, I encountered it!” Ning’s brain quickly
flashed through the information regarding the Azure Skysnake King
which he had read, back in the West Prefecture.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Skysnake King
was a Godbeast known as the Azure Skysnake! According to the records
of the Ji clan, the last time they investigated it, it possessed the
power of an early Xiantian lifeform! But although it was only an
early Xiantian lifeform, due to it possessing the lineage of the
Fiendgods, its power was actually comparable to that of the
Diremonster, Serpentwing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Skysnake King
was famous for its agility! In other aspects, it was perhaps a bit
inferior to Serpentwing, but in terms of agility, it was superior to
Serpentwing! In addition, the Azure Skysnake’s venom possessed
extremely potent, hallucinatory qualities. If it landed a bite on its
target, generally speaking, even Diremonsters would be affected by
hallucinations!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My strongest
attribute, my agility, is countered by it.” Ning was worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this sort of life
and death battle, agility was even more important than strength and
speed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example, the
strength of the Aquatic Rhino King was far superior to that of Ning!
Its defense was far superior to Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But in Ning’s eyes,
the Aquatic Rhino King was nothing more than a stupid, clumsy idiot.
He was able to effortlessly circle around the Aquatic Rhino King and
then kill it. It wanted to ram into Ning, but it couldn’t. But what
this Azure Skysnake King was most skilled at was agility!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huahuahua…” From
afar, the surface of the lake was beginning to slowly reveal an
enormous serpentine scaled body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Skysnake King
raised its serpentine head high, staring towards Ning, its eyes
filled with confusion. It let out a few low growling sounds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?” Ning
frowned, looking back at the Azure Skysnake King. What was this Snake
King saying? He couldn’t understand. The Azure Skysnake King was a
Godbeast…and at the early Xiantian level, wasn’t able to
transform, nor was it able to speak in the human tongue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A human form suddenly
rose from the water to stand next to the Azure Skysnake King. A thin,
white-robed man appeared, staring towards Ning. He shouted, “My
King asks you, were you the one who killed the Aquatic Rhino?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I say I didn’t,
would you believe me?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In this area, aside
from you, there are no other humans at all. Who could have done it
besides you?” The tall and thin white-robed man laughed coldly. “In
addition, you are able to run atop the water, showing that you have
reached the ‘one with the world’ level!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, the Azure
Skysnake King let out a few more growls, and the white-robed man
changed the subject. “However, in the area around the Aquatic
Rhino’s body, there are no Xiantian energy ripple remnants. Could
it be that you are not yet a Xiantian lifeform?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I answer you,
will you let me go?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could that be
possible?” The white robed man laughed coldly. “You killed one of
the King’s subordinates, the Aquatic Rhino. If we so casually let
you leave, what would become of the King’s prestige?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned and
shouted back, “If that’s the case, then enough chitchat. If you
want to fight, then fight. If you don’t want to fight, then I’m
leaving.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Skysnake King
stared at Ning with its enormous serpentine head, filled with
questions. The little human child in front of it…it wasn’t afraid
of him, naturally. But the area around the Aquatic Rhino was simply
too bizarre. There clearly wasn’t any Xiantian energy ripples in
the area, but why did the Aquatic Rhino die? Could someone who wasn’t
at the Xiantian level kill a Diremonster?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrmph.” Ning
immediately began to run atop the water, transforming into a gust of
wind, fleeing at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he had come
out to adventure, he knew his own limits. If he went to engage in
battle against Diremonsters that were too powerful, he was asking for
death! Ning had never intended to do battle against the Azure
Skysnake King…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hua…” The Azure
Skysnake King swam across the surface of the lake, transforming into
a silver tidal wave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In an instant, an
enormous serpentine head appeared in front of Ning yet again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He really is faster
than me.” Ning came to a sudden halt, his eyes blazing with
wildness. “It seems this fight cannot be avoided. If that’s the
case, then let’s fight!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In Eastmount Marsh,
the only one faster than my King is that ancient monster, the Snow
Toad! Do you know of the Ancient Snow Toad? That is the most powerful
Diremonster of the entire Eastmount Marsh. It can freeze and kill you
with but a single cold breath!” The white-robed man was walking
atop the water, each step causing the water to ripple slightly, his
movements not nearly as agile and graceful as Ning’s. “It is best
that you simply accept your death before my King…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned, then
transformed into a streak of light, charging towards that tall, thin,
white-robed man. “Monster, you sure are noisy. Eat a sword from
me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A cold light flashed
towards the man. The white-robed man was so frightened that he
immediately dove into the water with a splash. He served under the
Azure Skysnake King, and in terms of power, he was actually a bit
weaker than even the Aquatic Rhino King. How could he dare to fight
with this human youth?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Groooowl.” The
Azure Skysnake King suddenly let out an angry roar.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning turned his head to
look at him, not afraid at all. Since he wasn’t going to be able to
flee, Ning naturally wiped the hesitation and fear away from his
heart, leaving only a blazing heat. The heat of battle! Only by
fighting an opponent’s whose strength totally surpassed his own
would the blood in his entire body truly begin to boil!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua…suddenly, an
enormous green scaled tail emerged from the lake at high speed,
sweeping towards Ning at incomparably high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So fast!” Ning’s
entire body was turning faintly red. Clearly, the Solar and Lunar
energies in his body had been raised to their limits. At the same
time, his feet began to move in accordance with the Shadewind Steps,
and he wielded his twin Darknorth swords in his hands, one of which
was flashing with blue light on its edge; poison! The Darknorth
swords composed of three swords and a sheath. Two of the swords were
normal, but one of them had been coated by Ning with poison.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact, even a small
part of the arrows he had brought were treated with poison! After
all, while adventuring and engaging in life-and-death battles, the
ultimate goal was to kill the opponent! Naturally, any means of
accomplishing this would be acceptable. When battling with the likes
of the Aquatic Rhino King, Ning didn’t bother with poison, but this
Azure Skysnake King was simply too dangerous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With one hand, he
executed ‘Thin Streams Flow Forever’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the other hand, he
executed ‘Rain Line’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both Darknorth swords
moved, instantly drawing forth the power of the natural world.
Huahuahua…a visible, thin, and long stream of water was currently
arcing towards the serpentine tail in an attack. This stream of water
was incomparably tough, and it wildly wrapped around the tail,
causing the power and speed of that tail to slow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time, drops
of water had solidified into a thin line, and that thin line chopped
directly towards that enormous serpentine body!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Bang!” Ning was
blasted backwards at high speed by the force of the collision, and
water splashed everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huala!” Green,
emerald-like blood came flying out of a large wound on the serpentine
body, but quickly, the flow of blood slowed and the wound shrank. The
blood, however, had a faint black color as well, but moments later,
it returned to an emerald color. Clearly, the poison on the Darknorth
swords didn’t pose much of a threat to the Azure Skysnake King,
which was venomous by nature.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning rose high into the
sky, leaping off the surface of the water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Skysnake King
coiled up its enormous body, staring at the distant human youth. This
human youth had actually wounded it in a single exchange.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous body of
the Azure Skysnake King began to shrink at high speed. Previously, it
had been even larger than Serpentwing, but in a few seconds, it
transformed to a size of only ten meters long, and its serpentine
body was now only as thick as a person’s thighs. At the same time,
this jade-green Azure Skysnake continued to stare at Ning, emitted a
‘Hisssssss’ sound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.” Ning’s
face grew even more solemn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Skysnake King
was a Godbeast. It could increase or decrease its size, and was
famous for its agility. When it shrank its size, that was when it was
the most fearsome!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A violet pill suddenly
appeared in Ning’s hand out of nowhere, and he immediately tossed
it in his mouth. This was an antivenom spiritual pill. It was one of
multiple different types of antivenoms which Ning had prepared for
this adventuring expedition for when he encountered Diremonsters.
This one was particularly effective against hallucinatory toxins and
venoms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wielded his twin
blades, staring death at the Azure Skysnake King.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Skysnake
King’s serpentine head swayed slightly in a confident manner. It
seemed like an experienced hunter, searching for Ning’s weaknesses.
While swaying, it also slowly began to move closer to Ning, but Ning,
striding on water, took one step back after another, maintaining the
distance between them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swish!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, the Azure
Skysnake King transformed into a flash of emerald lightning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It charged at Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s eyes
flashed with a fierce light. The Darknorth sword in his right hand
suddenly transformed into a flash, chopping ray of light as his speed
increased to its maximum. This was one of the three killing strokes
of the [Thunderflame Sword], ‘Thunderflint Flash’. This technique
relied on a single word; ‘Quick’! It could be described as the
fastest sword attack Ning was capable of, and he used it now to deal
with this sudden pounce of the Azure Skysnake King!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shua! Shua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In but an instant, the
Azure Skysnake King changed direction twelve times, transforming into
a magical, illusory shadow which passed through the Darknorth sword
in Ning’s right hand, and even used its serpentine body, now
greatly reduced in size but clearly much more powerful, to strike at
the Darknorth sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning’s left hand,
also wielding a Darknorth sword, transformed into circles of spinning
water as he put on display the most defensively powerful stance of
the [Raindrop Sutra], ‘Watertight’!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clang!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The serpentine head and
the edge of the Darknorth sword collided, and the Azure Skysnake King
couldn’t help but have its trajectory slightly altered to one side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two of them passed
each other!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Pa!” In that
instant when they moved past each other, a terrifying shadow suddenly
emerged from the water, striking towards Ning. Ning, unable to block
in time, was struck heavily on the chest with a ‘Bang!’
sound…Ning couldn’t help but immediately vomit out a mouthful of
blood, his face turning red as he was sent flying across the surface
of the lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Huahua…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Skysnake King
swam at high speed through the waters of the lake, pouncing towards
Ning’s position.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those whip-strikes
of that tail are too fast. Much faster than the tail strikes of that
old monster Serpentwing.” Ning, in mid-air, flipped around and
gracefully landed on the surface of the lake. He couldn’t help but
clutch his chest. He could faintly sense that his bones were broken,
but the powerful regenerative energies of the Fiendgod Body Refining
method was quickly restoring them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kakaka…the two
shattered ribs in his chest quickly were repaired.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But his strength is
quite a bit lower than Serpentwing’s.” Ning stared at his chest.
Only his fur clothes had been ripped apart. With the added protection
of the Goldstar Shirt, his body hadn’t been injured too badly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swish!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Skysnake King
once more shot towards him as fast as lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So very fast!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come.” Ning wildly
wielded his twin swords in an effort to defend. The Azure Skysnake
King moved its head as if to bite, moved its body as if to coil
around him, and also used its serpentine tail to strike at him. Its
entire body was a weapon, and it coiled around Ning, wildly
attacking. In this sort of extremely close quarters combat, often, a
single second would allow numerous blows to be exchanged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s [Raindrop
Sutra] and [Thunderflame Sword] had both reached the ‘advanced’
stage, but he had yet to reach the ‘one with the world’ level of
swordplay!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If his swordplay was at
the ‘one with the world’ level, every ordinary pierce, thrust,
scrape…any attack would be able to call on the natural power of the
world. Only then was one’s level of swordplay truly at the ‘one
with the world’ level. Because Ning had yet to reach this level,
thus in this sort of high-speed combat, some of the postures and
movements of his attacks were no longer carrying the power of the
world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon losing the natural
power of the world, the power of his swordplay decreased noticeably.
This was an enormous flaw, one which Ning was relying on his twin
swords to make up for, but still, in the end…if one only defended,
one would be defeated!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chi!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Skysnake
King’s serpentine head bit viciously at Ning’s calf, and its
sharp, venomous fangs pierced straight through the fur clothes and
the Goldstar Shirt, the venom in its fangs instantly transmitting
into Ning’s body. A powerful, numbing, intoxicating sensation
quickly spread from Ning’s calf to the rest of his body, and Ning
hurriedly swallowed the antivenom spiritual pill which he had been
holding under his tongue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” Ning struck
out with the Darknorth swords in both hands, both of them
simultaneously executing the ‘Moth Flies into the Flame’ of the
[Thunderflame Sword]. The two swords instantly seemed to have
transformed into two scorching lines of fire, piercing down directly
towards the head of the Azure Skysnake King which was latched onto
his calf!

Chapter 15 - One With the World
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-robed skinny
man stealthily popped out of the water, staring at the distant battle
between the Azure Skysnake and the human youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That human youth is
truly formidable.” The white-robed man couldn’t help but let out
a soft sigh of amazement. “He’s actually able to force the King
to shrink in size to fight him. In terms of power, even I am inferior
to that human youth…it seems in the future, when I encounter human
youths, I need to be more careful. Still, it looks like that human
youth is about to die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After he dies, I
need to go have a taste of that youth’s flesh. Such a powerful
human youth…I haven’t seen another like him in the three hundred
years I have spent training.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How unfortunate for
him.” The white robed man shook his head as he watched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most of Ji Ning’s
beast fur clothes had been ripped to tatters, and blood was dribbling
down his chest. His hair-bindings had been shattered, and his hair
was now loose and unbound. But he still wielded those two Darknorth
swords with hands that were as stable as ever, and his eyes were
still very bright, as though fires were burning in them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Desire!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A desire to achieve
victory. Even though he was currently at a disadvantage and was being
wounded repeatedly, Ning had never even thought of giving up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So what if you
trained in a Fiendgod Body Refining method?” The white robed man
snickered. “He’s still only at the Houtian level. Injured
repeatedly, then healing repeatedly. Each recovery will take up a
large amount of his energy! After the energy in his body is
depleted…then, utterly exhausted, he will no longer be able to
fight back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could all but see
the astonishingly talented youth collapse, and then be dismembered
and eaten by the Diremonsters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How sad. A heroic
figure who would have doubtlessly become legendary throughout this
area is going to die, right here.” The white robed man watched, not
wanting to miss a thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white robed man’s
face changed slightly. “Why is his swordplay…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Skysnake King
was simply too strong. After having shrunk in size, the body of the
Azure Skysnake King became even tougher, like an iron whip. It had
also become even more agile and even fiercer! In terms of strength,
defense, speed, it was superior to Ning…Ning’s only advantage was
that the pair of Darknorth swords he wielded in his hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Skysnake
King’s pressuring attacks had caused Ning to enter an empty mental
realm where nothing existed except the next attack! He didn’t have
any other thoughts, other than thoughts of battle!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kill!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kill!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Skysnake King
in front of him was like a nightmare. Its striking attacks was even
faster than Ning’s ‘Thunderflint Flash’! Its coiling body was
even more elastic than Ning’s ‘Thin Streams Flow Forever’
attack! Its whip-like tail struck against Ning, causing him to lose
his breath, but fortunately, his two Darknorth swords were able to
complement each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If one sword couldn’t
take it, then the second sword would join in!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clang!” “Clang!”
“Clang!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At first, he was
constantly being wounded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, because he had
a Fiendgod Body and had eaten an antivenom spiritual pill, the venom
of the Azure Skysnake King, despite causing a bit of numbness, didn’t
have any effect on his ability to perform in battle. As for
bloodloss…Ning cared about that even less!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Skysnake King
seemed to find it harder and harder to break through the defenses of
the Darknorth swords. It was growing harder for him to wound Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huahuahua…” The
swords flashed everywhere, summoning the power of the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Skysnake King
transformed into an emerald ray of light, swirling around Ning,
attacking him wildly time and time again, but that perfect, mastered
swordplay which carried with it the power of the world had created an
utterly unbroken defense…one sword attack flashed after another,
flowing like quicksilver, revealing no cracks at all, causing each of
the Azure Skysnake King’s attacks to be fruitless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrm?” Ning
suddenly found that he was able to think again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Earlier, the Azure
Skysnake King had simply put him under too much pressure, forcing him
to totally concentrate on defense and on this battle. But now, that
pressure had decreased, and he could spare a little bit of time to
think. And when he did, Ning discovered that under the pressure of
the Azure Skysnake King’s attacks, his swordplay had become
perfected, with each sword blow that he delivered having not a single
flaw at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My swordplay…”
Ning’s face slowly was covered with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahahaha!!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning suddenly laughed
loudly, laughed joyfully. “I broke through, hahaha! Azure Skysnake
King, thank you for helping me make this breakthrough. I’ve finally
reached the level of becoming ‘one with the world’ in swordplay.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One with the world!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After having
experienced these two major, bloody battles, especially with the
amount of pressure which the Azure Skysnake King had placed him
under, Ning had finally taken the final step and reached the level of
being ‘one with the world’ in swordplay! Actually, Ning had
already reached the end of the ‘advanced’ level in both sets of
sword techniques he knew, and had already been very close to breaking
through. All he needed was a bit of good luck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he had stayed in the
West Prefecture City and slowly trained on his own through constant
repetition, he probably would’ve needed a few more years to break
through.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hisssss!” A low,
growling hiss. The Azure Skysnake King had been enraged. The arrogant
beast hadn’t expected that the youth he was hunting would suddenly
have improved.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s the point
of being angry?” Ning ran atop the surface of the water. “I no
longer fear you now!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hisssssssssssss.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hissing with fury, the
Azure Skysnake King pounced wildly towards Ning, moving with even
greater ferocity, no longer paying attention to its own defense.
Previously, as the Azure Skysnake King had the advantage, it didn’t
pay too much attention to receiving wounds, but now, the Azure
Skysnake King had decided that even at the cost of being wounded, it
would still kill this arrogant, belittling human.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, you liddle
widdle snakey!” Ning wielded Darknorth swords in his two hands. At
this moment, he felt as though being able to display his swordplay
was a sort of enjoyment, something which was graceful and elegant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He delivered one sword
stroke after another, each one perfect and flawless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the simplest of
chops and stabs were utterly unbreakable and immaculate!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our fight comes to
an end here for today, Azure Skysnake King. This time, thank you so
very much for helping me break through.” Ning laughed loudly as he
began to run away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of the Darknorth
swords in his hands were currently executing the ‘Watertight’
stance of the [Raindrop Sutra]. He wasn’t striving to land any
blows, only to be able to defend himself, causing the Azure Skysnake
King to be utterly unable to do anything to Ji Ning…and in the
blink of an eye, Ning fled far away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long time later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grrrrrrr.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Skysnake King
swam back. All it could do was raise its head towards the sky and
roar in dissatisfaction. Over the course of its life, it had met
multiple Xiantian level humans who had reached the ‘one with the
world’ level, but it had still beaten the snot out of those
humans…but that youngster with the twin swords he had just faced
used those two swords as though they were wielded by two separate
people who were perfectly linked in their thoughts. Indeed, the
threat posed by those twin swords was ten times greater than normal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No matter what sort of
disadvantage Ning had been put into, and even if one of his swords
had been forced out of position and no longer at the pseudo ‘one
with the world’ level granted by his sword techniques, the other
sword would still maintain the ‘one with the world’ level,
causing his actual battle ability to be no lower than that of a
single-weapon expert at the ‘one with the world’ level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had truly reached
the ‘one with the world’ level, and his power had exploded. Even
facing against a Xiantian Godbeast, he was still able to flee easily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He ran as fast as the
wind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahahaha…” Ning
was extremely delighted. He ran as he pleased atop the surface of the
water, moving through Eastmount Marsh before entering the mountain
forests. After running a long time, Ning leapt atop a large tree.
Passing by the crown of the tree, with another leap, he sent himself
floating gracefully several dozen more meters before landing by atop
a cliff. With only a few more bounds, he ended up at the peak of this
little mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sitting down on the
mountain peak, he leisurely withdrew a bottle of fruit wine from his
kalestone, then raised his head and poured it into his mouth. And
then, Ning happily shouted, “Enjoyable! Today was so enjoyable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had battle against
two Diremonsters, and had executed the Aquatic Rhino King! The other,
more powerful Diremonster, the ‘Azure Skysnake King’, was indeed
extremely powerful. Under the pressure of its attacks, Ning’s
swordplay had suddenly broken through and reached the ‘one with the
world’ level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“One with the world!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
but feel self-satisfied. “Although the Xiantian level experts of
West Prefecture City can use magic treasures, in terms of skill
level, I imagine most of them are inferior to me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only, I don’t know
what level Father is at, exactly. Even before going out and
adventuring, Father had become acknowledged as the number one expert
of the Ji clan of the West Prefecture, and had reached the ‘one
with the world’ level long ago. Afterwards, he had gone adventuring
for nearly ten years and met my mother…and then ever since then, he
had been living peacefully at the West Prefecture City. Nobody knows
how strong he has become!” Ning pondered this question. “But
previously, when that Diremonster, Serpentwing, had attacked, that
sword blow Father sent out from far away…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That sword blow had
truly been terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My father’s skill
level should still be stronger than mine.” Ning shook his head.
“Enough of that. I’m not even at the Xiantian level yet.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiantian lifeforms
possessed extraordinary power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even Ki Refiners at
that level would be able to use all sorts of magic treasures, seals,
and formations. As for Fiendgod Body Refiners…they had all sorts of
incredible transformations available to them, and they would truly be
able to be described as Fiendgods. After all, during the ancient
Fiendgod Era, those Fiendgods were all born at the Xiantian level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The technique I am
training in is acclaimed as the most powerful Fiendgod Body Refining
technique. Not a single member of the Ji clan, in its entire history,
has ever successfully reached the Xiantian level in it.” Ning was
worried about this. “So how should I break through, exactly?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Crimsonbright
Diagram of the Nine Heavens] was simply too difficult!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Actually, Ning’s
natural gifts, such as his utterly pure body, as clean as a
newborn’s, and the [Nuwa Painting] visualization technique, caused
the power of his already mighty soul to increase every day! It was
extremely beneficial to him in body training, causing his rate of
improvement to be extremely rapid. If he had been training in an
ordinary Fiendgod Body Refining method, he would have broken through
to the Xiantian level long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By contrast, in terms
of Ki Refining, Ning’s talent was a bit weaker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because he had been
injured while he was in the womb, his meridian system had been
damaged. At that time, when his father, Ji Yichuan, and Prefecture
Lord Ji Young had investigated the quality of the meridians in his
body, they had found that it was very average. The vast majority of
Xiantian lifeforms relied on Ki Refining to traverse the Path of
Immortals. Fiendgod Body Refining was even more difficult. None of
them had expected that although Ning’s Ki Refining talent was
rather poor, he would have such a monstrous aptitude for Body
Refining.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Crimsonbright
Diagram of the Nine Heavens] has notes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to ‘merge
Yin and Yang, fuse fire and water’. The power of the Moon and the
power of the Sun must combine into a whole, transforming into the
‘Crimsonbright’ divine power.” Ning pondered this. “But how
would one cause fire and water to fuse? How would one cause the power
of the Moon and the Sun to combine into a whole?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All Ning knew was that
fire and water didn’t mix! How, then, could fire and water be
fused?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an extremely
difficult step.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to reach the
Xiantian level!” Ning suddenly rose to his feet. Standing at the
mountain peak, his eyes were filled with desire. “The Xiantian
level, in the distant Heaven Realm, is nothing more than a starting
point! To the ancient Fiendgods, the Xiantian level is nothing more
than the level they were at when they were first born! If I can’t
even break through to the Xiantian level, how can I possibly talk
about being able to control my own destiny?”

Chapter 16 - The Fur Collectors
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The exquisitely cut and
stitched beast furs were very form fitting, causing Autumn Leaf to
seem rather heroic and valiant. She stood there in the area outside
the Metalstone Tribe, staring off into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her figure had
attracted the attention and the gazes of this rustic tribe’s
youths. Ever since Autumn Leaf had arrived at the Metalstone Tribe,
there had been no question that she had become the most beautiful
girl here…one youngster after another did their best to find
opportunities to show off their strength and valor in front of her,
but not a single one had been able to attract her interest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Miss Autumn Leaf is
waiting for her young master, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. I hear that
Uncle Dala, upon returning, said that her young master is extremely
powerful. Over a hundred Blue Guards of the Ironwood clan were all
killed by that young master in the blink of an eye!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only a powerful
young master like that would be worthy of someone as beautiful as
Miss Autumn Leaf.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s a pity that
he encountered a Diremonster! Most likely, that powerful young master
won’t be able to survive his encounter with the Diremonster. When
angered, Diremonsters can cause the entire area to change. That one
had immediately killed a large group of people by freezing them to
death. Uncle Dala and the others were only lucky enough to survive
because they fled quickly. If that young master were to die, Miss
Autumn Leaf would have to find another person to marry!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The youths of the tribe
all watched from their position by the gate while speaking quietly
amongst themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As far as they
considered, a girl like Autumn Leaf was like one of the legendary
goddesses…compare to Autumn Leaf, the other girls of their tribe
were as far beneath her as the earth was beneath the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf stood
there, staring into the distant mountain forest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She was waiting.
Waiting for the most important man in her life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Autumn Leaf.” A
powerfully built figure strode out from the tribe. It was the other
servant, Mowu. Mowu urged her, “Go back and get some rest. Once the
young master arrives, the guards at the gate of the tribe will
definitely see him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.” Autumn Leaf
shook her head gently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mowu looked at Autumn
Leaf, and then he sat down as well on a nearby, chopped-through tree
trunk. His forehead was furrowed in worry as well. After Uncle Dala
had returned, he had found out that Ji Ning had begun battling with
the ‘Aquatic Rhino King’, a Diremonster. As to what the results
of that battle were, no one knew. Although in his heart, of course he
still hoped that his young master would return, his rational mind was
telling him…the young master probably had met with misfortune!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because Uncle
Dala and the others had spent roughly two days on the journey back
from Eastmount Marsh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Given young master
Ning’s speed, if he was still alive, he probably would have made
his way to the Metalstone Tribe under half a day. Logically speaking,
he should have reached the Metalstone Tribe before Uncle Dala and the
others had arrived! But Uncle Dala and the others had been back for
more than two days, but Ning had yet to return.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If the young master
is dead…Autumn Leaf and I will most likely have to die as well.”
Mowu said quietly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If their master died,
how could the servants continue to live?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Local hegemons such as
the Ji clan had very strict internal regulations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?” Mowu
suddenly blinked. From afar, he faintly saw an indistinct, yet
familiar figure…the young master’s figure!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master!”
Autumn Leaf had already begun to rush over there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Miss Autumn Leaf is
running over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Look, there seems to
be someone coming from that side. Could that be the young master
which Miss Autumn Leaf has been waiting for?” The youths standing
guard at the gate whispered to each other, while some of them also
immediately began to run inside the tribe to inform the other
tribesmen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf watched as
the fur-clad, smiling young man walked over. The past two days, she
had been constantly repressing her own fear, her nervousness, her
wild thoughts…and now, all these various emotions caused her to
suddenly begin to shed tears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
Autumn Leaf looked at Ning. “I, I…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hey, I’m back.”
With his astonishing eyesight Ning noticed that from afar, in the
middle of the tribe, Uncle Dala and the one-armed man were currently
walking in their direction. He couldn’t help but laugh, “So Dala
made it back already. Was he the one who told you that I was battling
with the Aquatic Rhino King? Just because I didn’t come back for a
few days, you were frightened this badly?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf did her
best to hold back further tears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was just an
Aquatic Rhino King. To your young master, it’s barely worth
mentioning.” Ning winked at her, seemingly in extremely high
spirits.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf breathed
out in astonishment, “Young master, you killed the Diremonster?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yep.” Ning nodded
delightedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wow, a Diremonster.
Young master, you killed a Diremonster.” Autumn Leaf was extremely
excited. “Young master, you are only eleven years old, but you
killed a Diremonster. This…this…” As a personal maidservant,
Autumn Leaf’s life centered around Ning. As she always revolved
around him, to her, Ning was like her most important family member.
Naturally, Autumn Leaf was truly excited to learn that Ji Ning was
now capable of killing Diremonsters.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning hurriedly
lowered his voice. “Don’t spread the news.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, right.”
Autumn Leaf nodded hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, let’s go
take a look at the Metalstone Tribe.” Ning said. The past few days,
Ning had been in the mountain forests, pondering the results of the
past two day’s battles. He had also come to realize some mistakes
he had made in the previous battles. After careful pondering and
consideration of the two sword techniques he had used, he had
actually improved quite a bit further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning led Autumn Leaf
towards the gate of the Metalstone Tribe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Uncle Dala and a group
of tribesmen were there, and they went up to welcome him. Leading the
tribesmen was a balding old man with white hair. The balding old man
walked over and bowed repeatedly with respect. “I, Tyson of the
Metalstone Tribe, would like to thank you, mighty young master, for
having repeatedly saved the lives of the tribesmen of my Metalstone
Tribe. All the clansmen of the Metalstone Tribe feel boundless
gratitude for you…and we’ve been waiting for your return.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled and nodded.
“I’ll stay with your Metalstone Tribe for a period of time. As
for ‘rescued’, all I did was help out in passing. Also…for now,
I don’t want to be disturbed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood,
understood.” The balding old man nodded repeatedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Dala.” Ning looked
over.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The tall, powerful,
bear-like Uncle Dala hurriedly stepped forward, seemingly very
excited. “Young master, when I saw that you returned, I…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s alright.”
Ning laughed. “You helped me for a month in Eastmount Marsh. I told
you that when I returned to the Metalstone Tribe, I would definitely
reward you heavily. Take this.” As he spoke, within his hands,
three ‘beastheads’ of gold appeared. He tossed it over, each
beasthead weighing ten pounds. This bear-like Uncle Dala instantly
was stupefied.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, he hurriedly
caught them all, while the surrounding tribesmen all stared at him
with envy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
looked at Mowu and Autumn Leaf, then headed straight into the
Metalstone Tribe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could easily have
given an even more valuable gift, but to a small tribe like the
Metalstone Tribe, which had barely a thousand people, truly valuable
treasures might cause a disaster instead!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">——————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Metalstone
Tribe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
Autumn Leaf poured some fruit wine for Ning, then offered him some
fruit and some delicacies. “Mowu and I have been in this tribe for
a month now. Not soon after arriving, we got in touch with our Ji
clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While adventuring,
every month he had to reach out to and contact the scattered troops
of the Ji clan of the Western Prefecture who were stationed in
various places throughout the area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There is a letter
from the West Prefecture City.” Autumn Leaf withdrew a scroll from
her sleeves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning accepted it. He
rolled the yellow parchment open, and as he did, he couldn’t help
but reveal a smile. This was a letter his mother had personally
written to him! The letter didn’t contain too much; it mainly just
consisted of some words of concern. But having just experienced a
life-and-death battle, the nagging of his mother actually filled
Ning’s heart with a sense of warmth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Enough, Autumn Leaf.
It looks as though it’s been many days since you had a good rest.
Go get some rest.” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not tired.”
Autumn Leaf hurriedly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Ning ordered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf hurriedly
lowered her head, obediently going back to her own room to get some
rest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time moved on. Every
ten days or so, he would make a trip to Eastmount Marsh. Most of the
time, though, Ning remained within the Metalstone Tribe, practicing
his sword techniques. In the blink of an eye, over a month had
passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was currently
seated on the eaves of his house, holding a bamboo reed that was
filled with fine fruit wine. “Although West Prefecture City is
large, it isn’t as comfortable as these small tribes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Resting at sundown,
heading out at sunrise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Metalstone Tribe
showed great solidarity. Everyone helped each other, and they all
treated each other like brothers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, quick,
quick.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, go back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, bundle
everything up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, the formerly
peaceful tribe instantly became a chaotic bedlam of activity. This
caused Ning, who was drinking wine leisurely on the top of his
building, to grow confused. He immediately leapt down from the
building, then grabbed one of the running youths. “You.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.” The
youth, seeing that it was Ning who grabbed him, immediately greeted
him respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
Ning asked. “Why did the tribe suddenly turn so chaotic? Weren’t
you training in spear-fighting just now? Why did you stop?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The people of the
Blackmount Tribe are coming!” The youth hurriedly said. “The
people of Blackmount Tribe have come to collect furs from us. We need
to hide some of the finer furs which the tribe has, as otherwise, if
the Blackmount Tribe discovers them, they’ll take them for their
own. That would be terrible. Young master, I need to get back
immediately…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, understanding,
nodded. “Go ahead.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf was
watching this from in front of the building as well. She spoke out,
“The Blackmount Tribe is an extremely large tribe with tens of
thousands of tribesmen. Each year, these smaller tribes will have to
offer them some tribute.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Ning
frowned. “This land belongs to the Ji clan! Only my Ji clan has the
right to levy taxes. If the Blackmount Tribe is forcing the nearby,
smaller tribes to pay them tribute, isn’t that the same as levying
a tax?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ji clan levied and
collected taxes from every singlet tribe within its borders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the same time, the
Ji clan itself was a subject of the Grand Xia Dynasty, and so most of
the tax they collected had to be delivered to the Grand Xia Dynasty!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In principle, yes.”
Autumn Leaf shook her head. “But how would these smaller tribes
dare to refuse? If they were to refuse, the Blackmount Tribe is
completely capable of utterly destroying them, then selling off the
captives as slaves.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a long
sigh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because there were too
many tribes, there was no way for the Ji clan to manage all of the
internecine squabbles between the tribes, so they usually left them
to their own devices. Not just the Ji clan…even the Grand Xia
Dynasty, who ruled over an enormous, boundless expanse of territory,
had to govern in a loose fashion. Wasn’t the Ji clan and the
Ironwood clan also in a state of war, viewing each other as deadly
enemies? If one’s territory was too large, it became hard to
govern!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They are coming.”
Autumn Leaf said. “The Blackmount Tribe’s tribesmen are coming.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked over as
well. He saw that from afar, a group of half-armored, pelt-clad
tribesmen were currently strutting around in the area, looking around
as if they were in territory which belonged to them. The leader of
the Metalstone Tribe, Uncle Dala, and the others were all by their
sides, obediently following them, not daring to disobey them at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The leader of this
Blackmount squad, Braveshell, was currently viewing this little tribe
with satisfaction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Braveshell
glanced at the nearby Metalstone tribesmen. Seeing the frightened,
supplicatory looks on their faces, he couldn’t help but feel even
more delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even within the
Blackmount Tribe, he was a high level, central figure. In a small
tribe like this Metalstone Tribe…he could act as he wished! If he
was angered, this entire tribe would probably be finished. The
hundred guards he had brought with him could probably destroy this
sort of small tribe all by themselves. In this sort of small tribe,
he had absolute authority.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?” Braveshell
suddenly saw that not too far away, there was a young man and a girl
standing together. Braveshell’s eyes instantly lit up. The guards
by his side, looking along with him, couldn’t help but hold their
breaths as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Beautiful.
Mesmerizing.” Braveshell was instantly stunned, and then his heart
was instantly overwhelmed with powerful lust and desire. He
definitely had to seize this beautiful girl and make her his personal
maidservant. Every day, he would definitely ‘bestow his affections’
on her! Just thinking about it made Braveshell feel the blood pumping
through his entire body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…”
Laughing loudly, Braveshell walked directly towards the young man and
the girl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning frowned slightly
as he looked at this tall man walking towards him, who was wearing
some exquisitely crafted ornaments. The tall men swept Ning and
Autumn Leaf with a gaze, as though he were a high ranking tribesman
inspecting some goods. In particular, he didn’t disguise the greedy
look in his eyes when he was staring at Autumn Leaf. “Your fur
clothes were cut and stitched so exquisitely. Did you make it
yourself, miss? Your handiwork is quite fine. The fur clothes of the
youngster next to you is stitched and cut very nicely as well. Is he
your little brother?”

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impudent!” Autumn
Leaf’s voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Braveshell raised his
jaw slightly. “Impudent? This tiny little Metalstone Tribe…I can
do what I wish to it, much less ‘impudent’. I’ll tell you the
truth. I’ve taken a fancy to you. Follow me obediently. The last
time I took a fancy to a girl, that girl was quite stubborn. She
preferred to commit suicide than follow me, so I wiped out her entire
family, and sold off her entire clan as slaves! For your little
brother here, and your clansmen, you need to make a good decision!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tribesfolk were
straightforward individuals. They weren’t very calculating, but at
the same time, they were very bloodthirsty. Most of them didn’t
fear death, especially beautiful girls like the one in front of him
right now. They were definitely the shining jewels of their tribes,
and generally they were all very prideful. It was quite common for
such beautiful girls to rather commit suicide than to submit to
others, once their pride took hold of them. Braveshell didn’t want
to see this happen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Venerable Lord
Braveshell.” The balding elder, Tyson, hurriedly urged him, “These
three do not belong to my Metalstone Tribe. There come from a very
large tribe!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A large tribe?”
Braveshell’s eyebrows twitched. “No wonder. I was just wondering
how a place like your Metalstone Tribe could produce such a graceful
young lady. Miss, tell me what tribe you belong to.” As he spoke,
he moved two steps forward, wanting to stroke Autumn Leaf’s face.
Autumn Leaf directly delivered a lightning-fast kick to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This heavy kick was
powered by rage, and it struck heavily upon Braveshell’s chest. Not
only did it shatter the ornaments covering his chest, it also sent
Braveshell falling back over his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impudent!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clang!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Blackmount guards
instantly shouted in anger, and some of them even drew their blades.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Braveshell quickly
climbed up. He wiped away a hint of blood from the corner of his
mouth, then reached out to stop his guards. All his guards knew
exactly how vicious and diabolical Braveshell could be, for him to
have become a high level, core member of a tribe as large as the
Blackmount tribe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s all over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This young miss is
going to suffer a terrible fate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The guards all
understood that when Braveshell was clearly furious but temporarily
suppressed his anger, it only represented…that Braveshell was truly
livid! He was currently considering how to vent his fury!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Braveshell was on his
feet now. His eyes were narrowed, staring at the three like a
poisonous viper. He slowly said, “That kick was rather heavy. Can
you let me know where the three of you have come from, exactly? Is it
a large tribe, or is it the mighty Ji clan?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Take a good look.”
Mowu stepped forward coldly, revealing with a flip of his hand an
emblem.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The emblem had a single
word on it: Ji!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many of the faces of
the surrounding guards changed. They all looked at their leader,
Braveshell, whose face had turned ashen. He hurriedly bowed in
terror, “I didn’t expect that I would accidentally offend you.
Please pardon me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mowu’s eyes contained
a hint of pity in them, because he knew how much his young master
hated evildoers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autumn Leaf also
glanced coldly at Braveshell. Ever since Braveshell said that he had
once destroyed a small tribe for the sake of seizing a girl, and sold
off all the tribesmen as slaves, Autumn Leaf had felt utter revulsion
for him. Because she herself had been sold off after her tribe had
been destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning simply looked
at Braveshell. In an instant, he had already determined that he would
punish Braveshell with death!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Braveshell had
destroyed an entire tribe for no cause? When Ning thought of how the
women and children in that tribe had died miserable deaths or had
been sold, Ning’s heart was filled with boundless rage! Although
this area contained many hidden evildoers, and Ning couldn’t
possibly stop them all, when he encountered them, he could never
suppress the fury he felt!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…”
Braveshell, whose face had been ashen, suddenly cracked his lips and
laughed, laughed brightly. “It seems the three of you already have
a killing intention. I really don’t know if I should call you
stupid or arrogant!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Ning frowned
slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Braveshell continued to
laugh. “So what if you are of the Ji clan? How many youngsters of
the Five Prefectures of the Ji clan go out adventuring as part of
their coming-of-age, and how many of them have died! How could the Ji
clan possibly discover…if their clansmen were killed by monstrous
beasts, or by other tribesmen?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if you have a
high status, in this place, you are nothing more than three people.
Thus, even if you want to kill me, you should hide it in your
hearts…as the books say, ‘distant water cannot quench a nearby
drought’. No matter what your status is, no one will be able to
save you.” Braveshell sighed. “I still remember how three years
ago, I once enjoyed a young girl of the Ji clan. Her skin was truly
fine. My servants all enjoyed her as well, and afterwards, we fed her
to the beasts who ate her clean!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you understand
now?” Braveshell’s eyes were shining. “Status doesn’t
represent power. At least in this place, I am the one who determines
your life and death!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Braveshell raised his
head and said in a loud voice. “Make your move. Kill the two men,
spare the woman! After I enjoy her first, each of you will have your
chance!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wooo!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, let’s do
it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Braveshell’s guards
all drew out their blades and swords, valiantly charging forward. The
high level military leaders of large tribes trusted their own
servants and slaves the most. Whether it was Ji Lee or Ji Yichuan,
they all had their own trusted servants and slaves, who would
definitely obey them without question.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Under Braveshell’s
orders, these guards, who were born into his servitude, all dared to
charge forward and kill!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How dare you!”
Suddenly, a voice rang out like spring thunder, exploding in the
skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the skies above,
there was someone standing atop an enormous flying bird. That person
drew out his longsword and brandished it downwards. In but a second,
sword energy criss-crossed everywhere…one ray of sword energy after
another rained down, and each blow of sword energy pierced through a
guard, easily chopping their bodies apart, sending fresh blood
spewing everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Aaaaah!”
“Nooooooo!” “Aaaaah!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All sorts of miserable
cries rang out, but soon, everything became silent again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The hundred-plus
servant guards, who had been shouting savagely, all collapsed on the
ground. Some had large holes in their chest, while others had been
chopped apart. Blood stained the ground. All of them had died
miserable deaths! But not a single one of the utterly terrified
tribesmen of the Metalstone Tribe had been struck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…but…but…”
Braveshell had thought that everything was under his control, but
now, his face turned ashen. He stood there numbly, staring at his
dead servants, and then at the man standing on the giant bird in
mid-air. He stuttered, “Xian…Xiantian…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The people of the
Metalstone Tribe all raised their heads. Some were dumbfounded,
others were awestruck, while some of the girls in particular just
stared unblinkingly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Autumn Leaf, and
Mowu all raised their head to take a look as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The man jumped down
from his mid-air position on the back of the giant bird, landing on
the ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.” The
man bowed slightly as he said to Ning, demonstrating his respect for
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This scene caused all
the members of the Metalstone Tribe, as well as Braveshell, feel
stunned. Because just then, those lines of energy attacks represented
that this person was a Xiantian lifeform! A Xiantian lifeform, in any
tribe, no matter how large, was definitely a person of the highest
status. Even in the Ji clan, they were high level, core members!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Generally speaking, the
adventuring youths of the Ji clan who encountered Xiantian lifeforms
all had to pay their respects first. But this Xiantian lifeform was
actually paying his respects to this youngster?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Spare me.”
Braveshell threw himself forward, kneeling in front of Ning, begging,
“Mighty young master, those words that I said earlier were all wild
ravings. I’ve never done such a thing! In addition, once, when I
was collecting furs from some small tribes, I acquired a special
treasure. It definitely is a magic treasure! As to what type of magic
treasure it is, I don’t understand either…as long as you are
willing to spare me, young master, I am willing to give this magic
treasure…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Before he even finished
speaking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hu.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Braveshell suddenly
threw himself towards Ning, his right hand forming a claw, wanting to
rip out Ning’s throat. At such a close range…generally speaking,
even late stage Houtian experts would find it hard to dodge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hrmph.” With a
casual wave of his hand, despite striking out later, Ning’s hand
slapped down onto Braveshell’s skull before Braveshell finished his
attack. Braveshell’s body trembled, and then blood began pouring
out of his nose and his ears, and his body weakly tumbled to the
ground.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s a sly one.”
Ning said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This Braveshell really
was both crafty and vicious, venomous and diabolical, daring to do
anything. Even though he knew that his chance of of dealing with the
Xiantian level person was low, he immediately made the decision to
first use the magic treasure to try and attract Ning’s interest…and
then try to capture Ning. As long as he could take Ning hostage, he
would have a chance at life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unfortunately…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was someone who
could kill even Diremonsters with ease.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So him and those
guards were all on the same side.” The Xiantian level man said with
a laugh. “Those guards were all half-armored, while this person was
dressed in furs…I hadn’t noticed him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you for your
assistance, elder apprentice-brother.” Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The man in front of him
was one of the nine major disciples which his father, Ji Yichuan, had
trained. His name was Wanfang, and he was an early Xiantian lifeform.
Within the Ji clan of the West Prefecture, his status was fairly
high, but at his current level of power, he wasn’t quite eligible
yet to take command over the black armored riders, while Ning, being
the next Prefecture Lord, had an extremely high status.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you had been the
one to act, young master, things would have gone just as easily.”
Wanfang sheathed his longsword while laughing. “But I came here for
an important reason.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Important reason?”
Ning’s face changed. He kept in touch with the West Prefecture once
a month. The person who had come this time was his own elder
apprentice-brother. One could imagine how important the reason was,
for a Xiantian expert to personally make the journey.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s chat
inside.” Ning said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning glanced at the
still-shocked Metalstone Tribesmen. “Dispose of the corpses. As for
the Blackmount Tribe…in a little while, I’ll ask my elder
apprentice-brother to make a trip to the Blackmount Tribe. You
naturally won’t have anything to worry about.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, young
master!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The balding elder and
the others all hurriedly fell to their knees. Only now did they
understand how exalted Ning’s status truly was. For even a Xiantian
lifeform to greet him with respect…a person like this, even the
chieftain of the Blackmount Tribe would have to kneel before!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Wanfang
quickly entered the stone room, then closed the door.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, clean it up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The people of the
Metalstone Tribe were filled with pumping blood as they looked at the
corpses on the ground. They felt both nervous and excited. Normally,
they had to all but worship the ground on which these terrifying
Blackmount tribesmen walked on, but now, all of them lay here dead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So even you will
have an ending like this.” That cold, one-armed man gave a savage
kick to the corpse of Braveshell, his eyes filled with rage and hate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">———————
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only Ning and Wanfang
were present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder
apprentice-brother, what is the matter?” Ning asked. “Why did you
come here?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Because of the
Diremonster, Serpentwing!” Wanfang’s face was solemn.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 18 - Yin and Yang Twin Energy Formation
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Diremonster,
Serpentwing?” Ji Ning frowned. “What happened? Our Ji clan of the
West Prefecture should have people stationed at Serpentwing Lake,
with multiple Xiantian experts present. Could it be that Serpentwing
has escaped Serpentwing Lake?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wanfang shook his head.
“If he had simply escaped from Serpentwing Lake, that would be a
minor affair! Alas, our Ji clan of the West Prefecture actually ended
up helping out Serpentwing. Our Xiantian experts stationed at
Serpentwing Lake constantly tried to kill him whenever possible,
causing Serpentwing’s every day to be filled with danger. There
were several major battles as well! Under that pressure…Serpentwing
actually reached the peak of the Xiantian level!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! Peak Xiantian
level?!” Ning was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A peak Xiantian level
Diremonster was truly dangerous. Even Eastmount Marsh had only a
single peak Xiantian level Diremonster, that Ancient Snow Toad!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Xiantian level
experts of our Ji clan of the West Prefecture were only able to just
barely survive through relying on their magic treasures. They had to
just watch as Serpentwing disappeared!” Wanfang sighed. “As soon
as he heard this news, Master immediately went in pursuit!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father went in
pursuit?” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wanfang nodded as well.
“But that Serpentwing can both soar in the skies as well as dive
into the seas. His speed is now much faster than before, and as soon
as he enters the deep water, even a Zifu Disciple would find it hard
to kill him. Master understood this as well, and this pursuit of his
ended in failure. Thus, he ordered me to tell you of this affair and
to make sure that you are careful. After all, previously, you killed
his child.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Ning
nodded solemnly. “It seems I need to leave this Metalstone Tribe
now. Serpentwing, hrmph, I didn’t expect he’d survive this long,
much less make a breakthrough!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This sort of old
monster who has been training for thousands of years has accumulated
significant experience. It isn’t strange for him to make a
breakthrough at last.” Wanfang then said, “That’s all there is
to report. My mission is now complete.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning hurriedly advised
him, “Apprentice brother Wanfang, those people you executed earlier
belong to the Blackmount Tribe, located not far from here. Go help me
rap their knuckles a bit!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just leave this sort
of minor task to me.” Wanfang nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That very day, Ning led
Autumn Leaf and Mowu out of the Metalstone Tribe. As to where he was
headed…Ning didn’t inform anyone. Only by acting in such a way
would he make it harder for Serpentwing to find him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">—————————-
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A month after the
Serpentwing Disaster, everything was calm again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Originally, after
Serpentwing broke through to the peak Xiantian level, he charged out
of Serpentwing Lake, beginning to vent his fury upon the area,
causing great harm to the nearby tribes and devouring many humans,
filling countless tribesmen with fear. He boldly went out in search
of Ning, but the news that Ning was adventuring was a secret which
few knew. Given that Ning himself was extremely vigilant as well,
Serpentwing naturally couldn’t find him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After half a month,
Serpentwing encountered Ji Yichuan. Relying on his vastly increased
strength, Serpentwing confidently did battle with him, but he didn’t
expect that once again, he would be badly injured. Still, his flying
speed was much faster than before, and when he fled for his life,
even Yichuan wasn’t able to do anything to him. This battle
resulted in Serpentwing coming to a decision; he never wanted to
fight against Yichuan ever again. If he saw Yichuan, he would
immediately run far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another month later,
Poisondove Ridge stepped in!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Five Prefectures of
the Ji clan negotiated with Poisondove Ridge, and the end result
was…‘The Diremonster, Serpentwing, is forbidden to leave
Serpentwing Lake for a hundred years!’
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed. In the
blink of an eye, summer arrived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Eastmount Marsh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two figures lay hidden
within the aquatic grass. One was a half-red, half-white man with a
vile aura and braided hair, while the other was a muscular man
dressed in black.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The information you
have is correct?” The vile-looking man said softly. “We’ve
waited here for three days now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-clothed man
nodded. “Recently, there is a youngster who often comes to fight
against the Azure Skysnake King. Every ten or fifteen days, they’ll
do battle. In addition, their battles are generally in the area
around here. Don’t worry, Master. When the time comes, the Azure
Skysnake King will definitely emerge from the depths, and once he
enters our formation, he won’t be able to escape!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The vile
man nodded. “For the sake of this day, I have prepared for so long,
and also spent an incredible price in order to acquire this Yin and
Yang Twin Energy Formation. This time, we must capture the Azure
Skysnake King alive and let it become my spirit beast!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once the Azure
Skysnake King enters the formation, its life and death will be
entirely determined by you, Master.” The black clothed man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha…” The
vile man laughed gently. “Right. That youth who often fights
against the Azure Skysnake King, do you know who he is?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve never seen
him.” The black clothed man shook his head. “I know all of the
young geniuses of our Ironwood clan, and he isn’t one of them. It
seems as though this youngster’s sword techniques are based on the
Ji clan’s [Raindrop Sutra].”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji clan?” A fierce
look flashed through the vile man’s eyes. “For him to be able to
fight equally at such a young age with the Azure Skysnake King means
that when he grows up, he’ll most likely become yet another
Yichuan…since that’s the case, then I, Ironwood Zhan, will give
the Ji clan a hand and help them send their genius straight to the
Yellow Springs of Hell.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another half day went
by. It was now sunset, and in the distance, a fur-clad youngster
appeared, walking atop of the waves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, he’s
here!” The black clothed man hurriedly shouted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Zhan turned and looked.
Seeing that Ning was walking on water as though it were flat ground,
his pupils shrank. “One with the world!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He must die.”
Zhan’s heart was now filled with a killing urge. At such a young
age, this person was able to reach the ‘one with the world’
level. Once this terrifying youngster grew up…he would be far more
powerful than even the Raindrop Sword, Ji Yichuan. He might even
become the most powerful figure in the Five Prefectures of the Ji
clan!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Brother An!”
Ironwood Zhan hurriedly instructed. “Afterwards, you go deal with
that youth. Even if you can’t kill him, don’t let him get away.
After I subdue the Azure Skysnake King, I’ll immediately hurry
over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The black
clothed man said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ironwood Zhan stared
grimly into the distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To be able to reach the
‘one with the world’ level as a youth…this sort of monstrous
talent was countless times more talented than him, Ironwood Zhan.
Fortunately, he, Zhan, had been training for over a hundred years.
Relying on his years of accumulated strength, it would still be
simplicity itself for him to slay this little child.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Zhan was hiding within
the aquatic grasses, and had secretly set up a formation in the area
around this location. Neither their auras nor their voices would
penetrate through it. If even their auras couldn’t pass
through…then of course, there was no way to sense them. Ning, thus,
also didn’t sense their presence either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little
snakey-snake.” Ning stood on the surface of the water as he called
out. “Still not coming out?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His voice transmitted
directly into the depths of the water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A moment later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous emerald
serpent erupted forth from the waves, and then its body rapidly
shrank to a length of around ten meters, while its head stared,
swaying, at Ning while emitting a disdainful snort. Actually, over
the course of his multiple battles against Ning, the Azure Skysnake
King had gained some insights as well. The Azure Skysnake King had
the feeling that he too was about to reach the ‘one with the world’
level. Although his battle ability was astonishing, he primarily
relied on his natural gifts. In terms of skill level, he was inferior
to Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sort of utterly
ruthless battles against an opponent, with both using deadly, lethal
blows, was the best way for an individual to improve!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once I also reach
the ‘one with the world’ level, you will definitely die.” The
Azure Skysnake King secretly said to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">‘Haha, c’mere,
little snakey-snake.” Two swords appeared out of nowhere in Ning’s
hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hua!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Azure Skysnake King
flashed towards him like a bolt of green lightning, while Ning went
forward to welcome him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Zhan, hiding in the
distant aquatic grass, felt even more astonished. “His swordplay is
also at the ‘one with the world’ level! And he uses twin swords
to such a perfect degree! It seems he isn’t even a Xiantian
lifeform yet, but he is able to fight head on with a Xiantian level
Godbeast…this sort of talent is absolutely terrifying! He must be
destroyed as soon as possible!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why haven’t they
entered yet?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Almost.” Ironwood
Zhan grew frantic with impatience.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had laid down his
formation in advance. Although the formation took up a large amount
of space, there was some distance between the formation and Ning’s
battle with the Azure Skysnake King.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Almost…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ironwood Zhan’s heart
was frantic, but he had to suppress his impatience. Because he knew
that once he revealed himself…the frightened Azure Skysnake King
would instantly dive into the water, at which point he wouldn’t
have any chance at all to deal with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All he could do was
watch as the distant battle continued.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sometimes, Ning would
be sent flying, while at other times, a wound would appear on the
body of the Azure Skysnake King. The two battled amidst the waves,
with Ning constantly gliding atop the waves, sometimes charging
forward, other times dodging. On multiple occasions, they almost
entered the formation, but the end, they didn’t…this truly was
nerve wracking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swish.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On one exchange of
blows…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They’re in!”
Zhan’s eyes were red. At this moment, Ning and the Azure Skysnake
King had just barely entered the formation. They were at the very
edges of it. But Zhan no longer dared to wait any longer. Perhaps in
the next moment, Ning and the Azure Skysnake King would once more
leave the area of the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Up!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Zhan’s face was
fierce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Huh?” Ning, at the
borders of the formation, suddenly felt a thrill race through his
mind. This was because Ning’s soul was already extremely powerful,
so much so that he could unconsciously sense any deadly dangers
nearby. An invisible terror suddenly filled Ning’s head, and he had
the feeling that if he didn’t move, he might really die!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Retreat!” Ning
glided backwards at maximum speed, and as he did so, he just so
happened to leave the edges of the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">………..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning retreated past
the edges of the formation, he saw that the surface of the water in
front of him suddenly transformed into a scene of chaos. One enormous
white energy wave after another appeared, intersecting with enormous
black energy waves, creating countless ‘nets’ covering the area
in front of him. The power of this enormous formation made Ning’s
heart shake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was something set
up by a late stage Xiantian Ki Refiner, who then suddenly released
all the terrifying power he had previously placed in the surrounding
area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Azure Skysnake
King is within the formation!” Ning’s heart clenched. After
having battled with this old opponent so many times, seeing that the
opponent had fallen into the formation, Ning felt worry for him as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Grooooowl.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A black human figure
suddenly flew into the air, transforming into a black Bi’an Tiger
that was over thirty meters long. The furry mane around its neck was
spread out like an enormous fan, rising up to the heads. Its jade
eyes were filled with savage fury, and it pounced directly towards
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Bi’an Tiger?!”
Ning instantly understood who it was that had set up the massive
formation. “The only Xiantian lifeform who has a Bi’an Tiger as
his spirit-beast is Ironwood Zhan, of the Ironwood clan! A late-stage
Xiantian expert!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gotta go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew very well the
difference in power between the two of them. Ironwood Zhan was
extremely famous, and was legendary for how sinister he was. When he
used his magic treasures, even the Azure Skysnake King was far from
being his match!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Swish!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a black light
shot towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a quick sword
stroke and a ‘clang’ sound, Ning sent the black light flying back
towards that Xiantian level Bi’an Tiger. The Bi’an Tiger roared,
“Child of the Ji clan, today, shall be the day of your death!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Argh!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A sharp, ear-piercing
scream of pain shook the heavens, emanating from within that
formation. Ning couldn’t help but feel his heart shudder as well.
He knew that this was the desolate cry of the Azure Skysnake King.
Despite having fought with Ning for so long, the Azure Skysnake King
had never before let out such a miserable sound. Clearly, it truly
was in dire straits this time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little green snake,
I hope you’ll be able to survive this affair.” Ning could only
silently pray. Not daring to hesitate at all, he immediately began to
flee across the surface of the lake while blocking the furious
attacks of that Xiantian level Bi’an Tiger.
