Chapter 1 - Ji Ning Is Still Alive
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Black-White College
had many mountain peaks, and the estates of the formal disciples were
usually located atop one of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the mountain path of
a nameless mountain peak of the Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The moon hung high in
the sky, and the dreamy moonlight wafted down like gauze upon Ji Ning
and Yu Wei. Ning and Yu Wei were currently holding hands together,
strolling on the mountain path like mortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is nice,” Yu
Wei said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning looked
at Yu Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei smiled as she
glanced at Ning. She had always been as beautiful as an Immortal
fairy, a true peerless beauty. This smile of hers, which came from
the bottom of her heart, caused Ning to instantly feel intoxicated.
Yu Wei said, “In recent years, I haven’t felt at ease for a
single moment. I’ve always been worrying about this or that. I’m
holding your hand, and I feel so calm right now…I don’t feel
worried about anything.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was my rashness.”
Ning felt guilt; last time, he had indeed been too arrogant in acting
against the Youngflame clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s not your
fault, junior apprentice-brother. Who would’ve thought that they
would have a Protocosmic spirit-treasure like the Worldhold Pagoda?
It is far too rare, after all, for Celestial Immortals to be in
possession of such spirit-treasures. Even if they do have one…ones
that can rip through reality and teleport you elsewhere are even
rarer,” Yu Wei said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed. “Enough
about that. Senior apprentice-sister, I haven’t congratulated you
yet about becoming a Celestial Immortal! You were even faster than
me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even after I became
a Celestial Immortal, I’ve still had headaches every day.” Yu Wei
gently kicked aside a little stone that was in her path. The stone
struck a distant tree, causing a bit of snow to fall down from the
trees branches.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s wrong?”
Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve been gone
for more than eighteen years. Stillwater Commandery, however, has
changed dramatically,” Yu Wei said. “For example…the current
Marquis of Stillwater is no longer Northmont Yin; it is Northmont
Blacktiger.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?!” Ning was
puzzled. “Northmont Blacktiger?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the past, Northmont
Blacktiger and Northmont Yin had struggled for the position of
Marquis, and in the end Northmont Yin had won.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even after Ning had
returned and joined into an alliance with Celestial Immortals Unity
and Hunchmont, the Northmont clan of Stillwater hadn’t changed
Northmont Yin’s position. Why was it that during Ning’s
disappearance of eighteen years, Northmont Blacktiger would end up
having taken the position?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Northmont Yin died,”
Yu Wei said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?! Could it be
that Stillwater Commandery was in such a state of chaos that even the
Marquis was assassinated?” Ning was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s even worse
than you think,” Yu Wei said. “Northmont Yin wasn’t
assassinated. He was executed by Celestial Immortal Unity. The reason
why he was executed was because more than half of the high-level
members of the Northmont clan wanted to throw their support to the
Seamless Gate. When they made this recommendation to Celestial
Immortal Unity, all of these traitors, including the ones who had
supported Northmont Yin secret, were wiped out. Not one was spared.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was truly shocked
now. “How could this have happened?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It all started with
Celestial Immortal Hunchmont being kidnapped.” Yu Wei began to
narrate the tale of how she and Celestial Immortal had been ambushed
and trapped, and she even gave him a rough overview of the situation
in the entire Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the peak of the
mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Yu Wei were
seated by a cliff, looking at the night sky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I didn’t imagine
that the Seamless Gate would have become this brash and bold.” Ning
frowned. “Prior to this, the Grand Xia Dynasty had been keeping
them in check, but now…they actually have dared to assassinate this
many Celestial Immortals? Are they really trying to start a war?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t know.”
Yu Wei shook her head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eighteen years ago, the
Grand Xia Dynasty had been calm on the surface, at least; very, very
few Celestial Immortals had perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now, Celestial
Immortals were dying right and left, one after the other! The
Seamless Gate had even dared to carry out actions like kidnapping
Hunchmont to force Unity to surrender; from this, one could see how
bold they had become!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Didn’t they inform
the Xia Emperor?” Ning asked. “Since the Seamless Gate cares
about Celestial Immortal Unity this much…the Xia Emperor wouldn’t
just give up on him that easily, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course we did,”
Yu Wei said. “Just this very day, we received word from the Xia
Emperor. He sent someone to notify us that many Celestial Immortals
throughout the entire Grand Xia Dynasty are being threatened, and
have received final diplomatic notes of warning. Too many are asking
for his support; he’s asking us Celestial Immortals to help each
other out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Xia Emperor is
just going to let things happen, come what may?” Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Unity really
is quite impressive, though; a while ago, the Seamless Gate sent
thirty-six Celestial Immortals to assault him en-masse, but they were
still defeated,” Yu Wei said. “To kill Celestial Immortal Unity
won’t be easy. By contrast, our Black-White College…well, we
aren’t as strong as senior Unity, so we’ve been suffering quite a
bit for it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now understood
what had been worrying Yu Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Black-White College
was standing alongside Unity. When the Seamless Gate went to act
against Unity, they’d probably throw the Black-White College into
the mix as well; after all, the Black-White College had two Celestial
Immortals within their ranks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Killing Celestial
Immortal Unity might be very difficult…but killing the Celestial
Immortals of the Black-White College was much easier by comparison.
Yu Wei and Immortal Diancai were quite ordinary; they had just
recently overcome their tribulations, after all. They were far from
being comparable to Celestial Immortal Unity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But I’m back now,
right?” Ning smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, you haven’t overcome your tribulation.” Yu
Wei actually shook her head. “The Seamless Gate is far too
powerful. We have to be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That very night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within Immortal
Diancai’s estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Ning
looked at Immortal Diancai.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s good that you
are back. It’s good that you are back.” Immortal Diancai looked
at Ning, letting out a long sigh, then smiled. “You unfilial
disciple! When you came back, you didn’t come see me; you went to
go see your Dao-companion first!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Yu Wei was
laughing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t blame me,
Master! I admit to my wrongdoings.” Ning began to laugh as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sit, first! Later,
senior Unity shall arrive,” Immortal Diancai said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short time later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A youth with loose hair
and a gray robe came walking in. Ning, Immortal Diancai, and Yu Wei
all rose to their feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning has
returned.” The gray-robed youth smiled and nodded. “I heard that
you previously killed two mighty Celestial Immortals of the
Youngflame clan. How valiant! You were able to overcome the karmic
sinflames and to return to us; I imagine that anyone who hears about
this would be filled with admiration for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You praise me too
much, senior. I was just a bit luckier than most; otherwise, I
wouldn’t have been able to come back at all,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sit, all of you,”
Celestial Immortal Unity said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four immediately
all sat down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unity looked at Ning.
“I imagine you know everything now, Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I just heard from
them. I didn’t imagine that in the past eighteen years, the Grand
Xia Dynasty would’ve changed this much. The Seamless Gate has
already begun to shed all pretenses of cordiality.” Ning shook his
head. “Celestial Immortal Hunchmont was captured. Alas…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When the storm
comes, who can avoid it?” Unity looked towards Ning. “The
Seamless Gate gave us their final warning, and I’ve naturally made
my own preparations. This entire city of Stillwater has always been
the base for my Northmont clan. One generation after another, we have
set down countless formations in this place. I want to ask your
Black-White College to help me control the formations of Stillwater
City, so that I can focus whole-heartedly on fighting against the
Seamless Gate. There’s no need for the Black-White College to exit
the formation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Today, the Xia
Emperor sent me a messenger. Many are under threat right now, and
he’s unable to assist me, which is why I’ve made this decision. I
wanted to tell Yu Wei and Diancai tomorrow, but since you came back
today, Ji Ning, I came to speak to you all tonight,” Unity said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Yu Wei, and
Diancai all exchanged a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Since you’ve made
the request, senior Unity…our Black-White College will definitely
strive to ensure you are not disappointed by us,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Unity had realized something…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Black-White College
had three mighty experts. Yu Wei and Ji Ning were Dao-companions,
while Immortal Diancai and Ji Ning were master and disciple! In fact,
Ji Ning had once guarded his master during his master’s tribulation
and fought with utter ferocity, while Diancai, in turn, had been
willing to face off against the Youngflame clan even when he had
merely been at the Void-level; from this, one could see how close the
two of them were. Clearly, Ji Ning was capable of influencing both Yu
Wei and Immortal Diancai, which made him the true leader of the
Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After chatting for a
bit longer, Celestial Immortal Unity departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, Yu Wei, and
Immortal Diancai, the three mighty experts of the Black-White
College, were now discussing amongst themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Black-White
College is the weakest side in this fight, regardless of whether we
compare ourselves to Celestial Immortal Unity or the Seamless Gate,”
Immortal Diancai said. “Senior Unity knows that we are in a tough
spot. This is for the best. We shall stay within the formation and
provide support. If even the formation is unable to withstand their
attacks, then we’ll use Greater Teleportation to leave.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei and Ning both
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t say much.
It was true that he had become far more powerful over the course of
eighteen years of nonstop battles, and he was probably even superior
to Celestial Immortal Unity in terms of power! However, given that
the Seamless Gate was a major power that dared to act against the
Grand Xia Dynasty in such a brash, arrogant fashion…they might
suddenly produce a True Immortal or Empyrean God who would wipe Ning
out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, the
Heavenly Treasures Mountain has stationed someone in our Black-White
College,” Immortal Diancai said. “They’ve been waiting for news
of you. Now that you are back…should we let the Heavenly Treasures
Mountain know?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s this?”
Ning was surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Heavenly Treasures
Mountain had actually permanently stationed someone here, waiting for
news regarding him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It seemed as though the
Xia Emperor truly did care quite a bit about his status.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go ahead and tell
them,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His own master,
Patriarch Subhuti, was good friends with Daofather Crimsonbright. The
Xia Emperor had treated him fairly well; there was no need to hide
this from him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Immortal
Diancai nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial capital of
the Grand Xia. The Skylight Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Xia
Emperor was seated facing a white-haired elder. They were playing a
game of stones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Click! The Xia Emperor
frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiamang, if you bare
your fangs too openly, you’ll suffer for it,” the white-haired
elder said with a laugh, then pressed his stone onto the board. “It’s
better for you to take a step back and look at the bigger picture.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor,
however, didn’t pay him any attention.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Click! Click! Click!
The sound of chess stones being pressed onto the board rang out
throughout the hall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You lose.” The
white-haired elder rose to his feet. “Xiamang, spend a little time
and think things over. But of course…you remain a descendant of our
Primordial Imperial Clan. There’s no way you can let yourself be so
casually abused by others. Whether you choose to retreat or to fight,
you need to do it in a beautiful manner. If you do need help, come
find me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Uncle.”
The Xia Emperor rose to his feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The white-haired elder
laughed, then soared into the skies and disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor,
however, continued to frown.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later, a
streak of light flew in; it was Skyfox.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Immortal
Skyfox strode in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” The
Xia Emperor asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning has
returned,” Immortal Skyfox said in a low voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor was
startled. “He came back? Alive?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. He came back
just last night; we received news just this morning,” Immortal
Skyfox said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He managed to make
it back alive? I even went so far as to speak to Venomfreak about
this. Venomfreak said that he had exiled Ji Ning to the Nihilum
Zone.” The Xia Emperor frowned. “The Nihilum Zone of the
Primordial Ruinworld…that truly is a boundless, vast place. The
voidwaves there are incredibly powerful; in order to leave that place
while going against the voidwaves, one has to at least have the power
of a True God or Daofather. It must have been that mysterious
Daofather master of his who intervened. This Daofather seems to care
about his disciples quite a bit; he actually went into the Nihilum
Zone to search for him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then…with regards
to Stillwater Commandery…” Immortal Skyfox said in a whispered
voice.

Chapter 2 - King Yan Comes To Visit!
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor shook
his head. “The entire Grand Xia Dynasty is being shaken by this
storm. More than sixty percent of my 3600 commanderies are requesting
assistance from me! No matter how formidable the Seamless Gate is,
there’s no way they can possibly act against that many marquisdoms
and clans at once. In addition, according to the intelligence I have,
some of those requesting support have actually surrendered to the
Seamless Gate long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate was
indeed formidable; for them to be able to convince more than half of
the high-level members of the Northmont clan to join them was a
testament to their might. Within the Grand Xia Dynasty, there were
indeed quite a few clans who had already joined their side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They’ve already
joined the Seamless Gate, but they still beg me for assistance.”
The Xia Emperor frowned. “Right now…I don’t have a clear
picture of the situation. More than sixty percent of the marquisdoms
are asking for my assistance, but which ones actually need help,
while which ones are faking it?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although the
Northmont clan of Stillwater claims Celestial Immortal Hunchmont was
captured alive…that was a mere capture. Who knows if that is just
part of a plot?” The Xia Emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.”
Immortal Skyfox nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right now, although
there are some clashes, my control over the entire Grand Xia is still
fairly stable.” The Xia Emperor said softly, “The true war has
yet to start. We need to stand firm and not act about in a disorderly
fashion. Even though the Seamless Gate has begun to move…let them.
The more they move, the more of themselves they reveal to me. For
now, let my blade remain in its sheath…because one it comes out, it
will stab them in their weak points! The Seamless Gate wishes to take
away my world of the Grand Xia? Hmph…let’s see if they can force
me to accept it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Skyfox nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still…Ji Ning’s
potential truly is remarkable. Even before undergoing his Celestial
Tribulation, he was able to kill two Celestial Immortals. Despite
having trained for less than a century, he was capable of enduring
karmic sinflames. I imagine that he will soon be undergoing his
tribulation. He…is going to be an important chess piece,” the Xia
Emperor said. “And, based on what my master said…Ji Ning is
definitely on our side.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor viewed
Ning with great importance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all…Ji Ning’s
accomplishments to date had all been simply too unearthly. At the
Void-level, he had slaughtered two Celestial Immortals, then
withstood karmic sinflames. Once a monster like this broke through to
the Celestial Immortal level after overcoming the tribulation…he
would most likely become one of the most supreme Celestial Immortals
right away, perhaps even possessing the combat power of a Pure Yang
True Immortal! Most importantly of all…Ji Ning had an incredible
background. To befriend Ji Ning was equivalent to befriending a
mysterious Daofather. How could the Xia Emperor not view this as
being extremely important?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Go and tell
King Yan that Ji Ning has returned,” the Xia Emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright,” Immortal
Skyfox said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial capital.
King Yan’s Estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Yan had arrived in
a flower garden. He stared at Yuchi Xiyue, seated within a distant
pavilion. He couldn’t help but secretly shake his head. When Ji
Ning had gone to act against the Youngflame clan, he had told Yuchi
Xiyue in advance. Xiyue had been filled with both hope as well as
worry for Ning…but in the end, Ning had been covered by karmic
sinflames and driven out of the world of the Grand Xia. Xiyue had
always paid close attention to information regarding Ning, but no
matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t find out anything regarding
his return from that battle. She had gone to ask King Yan, and thus
learned what had happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since that day she
had learned that Ning’s chances of survival were slim…Xiyue had
never smiled again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little brother…”
Xiyue always felt as though something was missing from her heart. She
was incapable of smiling, now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xiyue.” A voice
rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiyue turned her head,
then hurriedly rose her feet to greet the man. “Grandpa.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me tell you some
good news,” King Yan said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good news?” Xiyue
was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning…has
returned.” King Ya laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Xiyue trembled, then
revealed a look of wild joy and excitement. She hurriedly grabbed
King Yan by the hand. “Grandpa, is this true? My little brother has
really come back? He’s returned from that danger zone? You aren’t
lying to me, are you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. It was the Xia
Emperor who told me…and Ji Ning is currently in the Black-White
College of Stillwater City right now,” King Yan said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s at the
Black-White College?” Xiyue felt more alive than she had in a long
time. She immediately said, “I’m going to Stillwater City right
away!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go together.
I want to see Ji Ning as well,” King Yan said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. Let’s go
right now!” Xiyue didn’t want to wait for even a single moment;
she had to see Ning with her own eyes before she would believe it
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even before the Xia
Emperor had learned of Ji Ning’s return…the marvelously capable
Seamless Gate had learned of it as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A cold wind blew. A
golden-robed Celestial Immortal was standing at the top of a mountain
peak. This golden-robed Celestial Immortal was quite bulky, and in
fact was slightly chubby. He had a stubbly beard, and his eyes shone
like copper. The golden robes he bore looked just like a set of
golden armor. He simply waited there, bored and restless, at the top
of that mountain peak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh. A streak of
light flew towards him from far away, alighting on the mountain peak;
it was Celestial Immortal Arcanum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arcanum,” the
golden-robed envoy said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Envoy.” Celestial
Immortal immediately smiled, not showing any of his customary
arrogance for fear of offending this envoy. “Might I ask why you
wish to speak with our Youngflame clan, Envoy?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Seamless Gate
has never shown your Youngflame clan any malice. We’ve always been
helping you…and now, I’m going to help you again.” The
golden-robed envoy laughed, but even when laughing, his savage,
ferocious face remained terrifying to behold. “A while ago, you had
a rather nasty battle with that Ji Ning, right? In fact, two of your
Celestial Immortals died, and in the end, you used the Worldhold
Pagoda to exile Ji Ning away into the Nihilum Zone of the Primordial
Ruinworld, yes?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, right. That’s
exactly right,” Celestial Immortal Arcanum said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he had a smile
on his face, in his heart Arcanum was cursing loudly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How had this secret
slipped out?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Very, very few people
knew that the Youngflame clan had used the Worldhold Pagoda to deal
with Ji Ning. Only the Xia Emperor and Ji Ning’s friends knew.
However, logically speaking, neither Ji Ning’s friends nor the Xia
Emperor would go tell the Seamless Gate about this…and yet,
somehow, the Seamless Gate had still found out. They had even come to
ask the Youngflame clan about this, at which point the Youngflame
clan had been forced to admit that they had indeed exiled Ji Ning to
the Nihilum Zone of the Primordial Ruinworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, the
Youngflame clan wasn’t worried about this being made public
knowledge. The Nihilum Zone was incredibly vast, after all; even a
True God or Daofather who went there to investigate would have to
spend countless years before completely searching the place. In
addition, True Gods and Daofathers were generally unwilling to spend
much time there; after all, as the saying went, if one often walked
by the riverside, one’s shoes would eventually get wet. If they
stayed in the Nihilum Zone too long, they might run into some
powerful foes from the Primordial Ruinworld.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate
truly seems to be able to penetrate through any seam,” Arcanum
mused silently to himself. “Not even the Heavenly Treasures
Mountain of the Xia Emperor comes close to the Seamless Gate in terms
of intelligence reports.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve come to
notify your Youngflame clan…that your hated foe, Ji Ning, is still
alive. And…he’s already back.” The golden-robed envoy smiled
merrily as he looked at Celestial Immortal Arcanum.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arcanum’s face
instantly changed. “Impossible!!!” He couldn’t help but blurt
out these words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible?” The
golden-robed envoy lifted an eyebrow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We sent him to the
Nihilum Zone of the Primordial Ruinworld! Not even an Empyrean God
could escape from that place; only a True God or Daofather has a
chance! Even if an exalted True God or Daofather was to go search for
him…how could they be so lucky as to find Ji Ning within the
infinitely vast Nihilum Zone in just eighteen short years?” Arcanum
shook his head. “Even if he was apprenticed to a True God or a
Daofather…I refuse to believe a True God or a Daofather would be
willing to commit himself to such a painstaking search, or be able to
find him so quickly. There’s no way Ji Ning could be that lucky!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, I didn’t
believe it either.” The golden-robed envoy shook his head and
sighed. “But alas, Ji Ning is within Stillwater City right now. At
this very moment, he is flirting and cuddling with that Dao-companion
of his, Yu Wei, within the Black-White College.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s at Stillwater
City right now?” Arcanum was now truly stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The
golden-robed envoy nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arcanum had an
extremely ugly look on his face right now, and his thoughts were
jumbled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Ji Ning had returned
alive…then things had completely changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First of all, for him
to return meant that, without question, Ji Ning had a True God or
Daofather standing behind him! When the Youngflame clan had fought
against Ji Ning, they had been worried that Ji Ning had apprenticed
himself to a Daofather, true, but they felt that given the exalted
status of a Daofather, Ji Ning shouldn’t have been so lucky as to
actually have been apprenticed to one. The chances of that having
happened had to be low.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now…it had indeed
been proven to be the case! Ji Ning truly had become the disciple of
a True God or a Daofather!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And secondly!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Youngflame clan
knew exactly how powerful Ji Ning was. A young fellow like him who
hadn’t even undergone his tribulation had been able to slaughter
two mighty Celestial Immortals. Even when battling the eight of them,
he hadn’t been at a disadvantage at all. Given his terrifying
power…once he overcame his tribulation and become a Celestial
Immortal, he could become a calamity for the Youngflame clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And this monster…this
utter monster had a True God or a Daofather backing him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a nightmare!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He…really does
have a True God or a Daofather as his master. And…he’s back.”
Arcanum was completely panicking right now. He knew very well that
this would be a disaster for his Youngflame clan…a disaster which
the Youngflame would not be able to avoid!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If…the Youngflame
clan was to join our Seamless Gate, then we would be willing to help
you deal with Ji Ning,” the golden-robed envoy said with a laugh.
“You might be afraid of the Daofather behind him, but we, the
Seamless Gate, are not. Alright…you can go back now and spend some
time thinking on this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A series of spatial
ripples appeared around the golden-robed envoy. Moments later, he
disappeared into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Arcanum stood there on the mountain peak, an ugly look on his face.
Moments later, he too used a spatial teleport to depart, having
headed back to report this information to the Ancestor of the
Youngflame clan, Immortal Venomfreak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stillwater City. The
Black-White College.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t realize
that both the Seamless Gate and the Youngflame clan had found out
right away about his return. However, even if he did realize that
they knew…Ning wasn’t afraid. To deal with the current Ji Ning
wouldn’t be easy as it was to deal with the Ji Ning of eighteen
years ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, King Yan
and Princess Xiyue have come to visit,” Immortal Jadesea sent
through his divine sense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Princess Xiyue? King
Yan?” Ji Ning, who had been sipping wine alongside Yu Wei, hastily
rose to his feet. Ning had spent the entire night with Yu Wei. The
two had whispered sweet nothings to each other, and also had
discussed may matters. Yu Wei now knew the real relationship between
Ning and Xiyue.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come, let’s go
greet them,” Ning said hurriedly. “Before I went to fight against
the Youngflame clan, I told my cousin about it. I was completely
confident in my chances; I thought that everything was under my
control. And yet…man proposes, Heaven disposes. In the end, I was
exiled for eighteen years. My cousin must have been worrying over me
for all eighteen of these years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“She came to see you
as soon as she learned that you were back. Clearly, she cares about
you immensely,” Yu Wei said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two flew over,
shoulder-to-shoulder, into the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They immediately saw
the distant Immortal Jadesea guiding King Yan and Yuchi Xiyue towards
them. Xiyue stared towards Ning from far away, and upon seeing him
her eyes lit up right away. It was true; her little brother truly had
come back!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother Jadesea, allow me to take care of King Yan and the
princess,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Jadesea knew
that these two had come to see Ji Ning, and so he immediately nodded
and departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Yu Wei led
King Yan and Xiyue down into Yu Wei’s residence. At present, Yu
Wei’s residence didn’t have even a single servant in it; all of
them had been sent to Darknorth Peak. Clearly, Ning and Yu Wei wanted
to be alone and to not be disturbed by anyone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As they landed
together, Xiyue could no longer hold back. “Little brother, you
scared me half to death! If you really died…then I really would be
the only member of the Yuchi clan left.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m not gonna die
that easily,” Ning said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two immediately
began to chat with each other. Yu Wei added in a few words on the
side, but King Yan said almost nothing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the conversation
began to wind down…finally, King Yan spoke out. “Ji Ning, do you
remember the task you handed to me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face instantly
turned slightly red. He hurriedly said, “You’ve found information
regarding my parents and their reincarnations?”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_3___His_Parent_s_Lives"></A>
Chapter 3 - His Parent’s Lives, Past &amp; Present
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Years ago, Ji Ning had
asked King Yan to help him investigate what had happened to his
father, Ji Yichuan, and his mother, Yuchi Snow, after they had been
reincarnated. However, after he made the request Ning had gone off to
battle the Youngflame clan, then been driven into the Nihilum Zone.
Thus, King Yan had never had a chance to tell Ning about what he had
discovered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve found the
information.” King Yan nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wonderful! This
is…this is wonderful!” Ning couldn’t disguise his excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In Ning’s heart…his
father, Ji Yichuan, and his mother, Yuchi Snow, had the most
important position of all. Not even his Dao-companion, Yu Wei, was as
important to him as his parents! In fact, in Ning’s heart, even his
parents from his previous life on Earth were slightly inferior in
status when compared to Ji Yichuan and Yuchi Snow. In his past life
on Earth, his father had always been busy with his careers, after
all; Ning was rarely able to see him. His mother, on the other hand,
had always worked very hard to take care of him, and Ning had firmly
engraved those memories into his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But in this life…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the sake of giving
birth to him, his mother had been willing to sacrifice her own
life-force. For the sake of letting him grow up safely, she hadn’t
even been willing to tell Ning about their feud with Snowdragon
Mountain, or the truth regarding the enemy that had destroyed the
Yuchi clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although his father
looked cold on the outside, the amount of care and love he had felt
for Ji Ning was definitely every bit as much as Yuchi Snow had felt.
He had personally taught Ning to use the sword, and had always worked
to protect him. In fact, it wasn’t until he was no longer capable
of protecting Ning that he had perished to go reunite with Yuchi
Snow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning could never forget
them!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those youthful
days…those had been the happiest days of his life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These are bamboo
scrolls.” King Yan produced a pair of bamboo scrolls within his
hands. “In the Netherworld, we record the information about the
dead in them. All who are judged by the Judges of the Dead will have
records regarding them. This bamboo scroll has a great deal of
information, including information regarding your mother, Yuchi Snow.
This one, in turn, has information regarding your father, Ji
Yichuan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning took a deep breath
before accepting the scrolls.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning sent his divine
sense into the first scroll. Instantly, an enormous amount of
information filled his mind. After Ning had strengthened his
heartforce, his control over his divine sense had strengthened
noticeably as well. Soon, he was able to sort through the sea of
information to find the relevant parts regarding his father, Ji
Yichuan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Yichuan, of the
world of the Grand Xia, Stillwater Commandery, Swallow Mountain. Zifu
Disciple. No karmic sin, no karmic merits. Adjudicated to be reborn
as a human and be reincarnated in the Wusky world, Flowermont
Commandery, Willowriver clan. His name shall be Willowriver Chuan,
and he shall live for 182 years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was no longer a
wide-eyed youth; at Mount Innerheart, he had read some books which
had given a basic introduction to the Three Realms. He understood
what this Judge’s intentions were. Generally speaking, decisions on
where one would be sent to, what one would be named, and how long one
would live for would be automatically made by the Dao of the Heavens.
The Judges of the Dead had to intentionally intervene in order to
change things. This sort of intervention would usually have a minor
impact on one’s karmic merits, and so generally speaking only
someone who had a sufficient degree of status was capable of causing
the likes of the Ten Yama-Kings of Hell or the First Judge of the
Dead to command their subordinates to make a change to one’s fate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Long ago, Judge Cui had
told Ning that changing one’s lifespan was quite a simple task for
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But in truth, the
‘lifespan’ was only applicable to mortals. Once one became an
Immortal cultivator, one would’ve embarked on a path that went
against the will of the Heavens. The Heavens would send down the
Three Calamities and Nine Tribulations, and it would become very
difficult to predict how far one would make it down this path. If one
remained a mere mortal, one might only live for a century or so, but
if one became an Immortal cultivator and became a Zifu Disciple
within twenty or so years…it was possible that one might be killed
soon after becoming a Zifu Disciple, resulting in a lifespan that was
even shorter than that of an ordinary mortal’s!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The decisions of the
Judges of the Netherworld with regard to one’s lifespan were only
meaningful for mortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Wusky world?
Flowermont Commandery, Willowriver clan…Willowriver Chuan?” Ning
quietly memorized this name.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He immediately picked
up the other bamboo scroll, sweeping it with his divine sense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later, he
found the information regarding his mother, Yuchi Snow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yuchi Snow, of the
world of the Grand Xia, Eastisle Commandery, Yuchi clan. Slightly
positive karma. Adjudicated to be reborn as a human and be
reincarnated to the Wusky world, Flowermont Commandery, Eastflow
clan. Her name shall be Eastflow Snow, and she shall live for 200
years.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was delighted by
what he just saw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had both been sent
to the Flowermont Commandery of the Wusky world?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby King Yan
said, “The adjudications of the Judges are usually generated
naturally in accordance with the Dao of the Heavens. Clearly, your
mother and your father have been tied together by karmic love across
many lifetimes, and so the Dao of the Heavens invisibly worked to
place them together once more.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Karmic love across
many lifetimes?” Ning nodded gently, then immediately said, “King
Yan, senior, are you saying that my parents are together once more?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I went and helped
you investigate what happened after they were reincarnated. I made a
trip all the way to the Flowermont Commandery of the Wusky world to
look into this matter, but…your parents have already died. The
information I found is within this book.” King Yan gave Ning a
glance, then a book appeared within his hands that he offered to
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
“Already dead? That means they should be reincarnated again. Why
haven’t they…?” But then, Ning suddenly thought of a
possibility. His face turned ashen, and he immediately accepted the
book and swept it with his divine sense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning clenched at the
book, shaking his head, his eyes filled with shock, anger, and agony.
He didn’t want to accept this result.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His parents had indeed
been linked by karmic love; although they had experienced some
problems in their new life, they had still ended up together.
Together, they had embarked upon the path of Immortal cultivation…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could…how
could this have happened?” Ning shook his head, mumbling as he did,
“Why did these things have to happen to them? Why didn’t they
happen to me instead? Although they embarked on the Immortal path
once more, they were just minor figures. Why did things have to end
so bitterly for them…why…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t believe
it…I don’t believe it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is all a lie.
All a lie!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes began to
turned crazed. The truth was beyond what his mind could accept; he
instinctually refused to believe this, especially when this was
nothing more than information record in a book!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little brother!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother!” Yu Wwei and Princess Xiyue were both worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately said,
“I’m going to go to the miniature Netherworld Kingdom. I’m
going right now! Senior apprentice-sister…although Stillwater City
is in a dangerous situation right now, I have to go right away. If it
really does encounter a crisis, shatter this talisman and I’ll
immediately come back through Greater Teleportation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Yu Wei
immediately nodded. “Let me go with you.” She could sense how
frantic Ning was feeling right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need. I’ll go
alone.” Ning turned to look at the nearby King Yan. “King Yan,
senior, I’m going to go to the miniature Netherworld Kingdom. I
need a temporal inversion to see the scene of the Judge adjudicating
my parents’ fates.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, Ning even
doubted the information he had seen within the bamboo scrolls
regarding the adjudication of his parents. He had to personally see a
temporal inversion, personally see the Judge adjudicate his parents,
before he would believe it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” King Yan
nodded. He still remembered the Xia Emperor’s instructions to him.
The Xia Emperor viewed quite a few people with favor and wanted to
befriend them, but the most important amongst them was this Ji Ning,
even though he hadn’t even undergone his tribulation. King Yan
naturally wouldn’t refuse Ji Ning’s requests.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Ning
didn’t want to wait at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me lead the
way.” King Yan immediately led Ning out, flying away from the
estate, then undergoing a spatial teleport in midair. Both men
immediately vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuchi Xiyue and Yu Wei
raised their heads, watching as Ning and King Yan left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My grandpa actually
didn’t tell me any of this…” Xiyue had a somewhat frantic look
on her face as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope everything is
fine,” Yu Wei said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A gloomy, deathly aura
pervaded this place.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an extremely
large world. Within it, lines of white-robed figures could be seen
walking forward, stretching forth as far as the eye could see. Next
to them were many minotaur demon soldiers and other demon soldiers
who were striking them with lashes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the white-robed
figures glanced curiously out of the corner of their eyes, paying
attention to the two figures who had just appeared in the sky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two figures that
had appeared were Ji Ning and King Yan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This miniature
Netherworld isn’t that different from the real Netherworld Kingdom,
to be honest. There are plenty of deceased spirits here as well,”
King Yan said. Daofather Crimsonbright controlled dozens of major
worlds, after all, as well as countless minor worlds, all of which
came under this miniature Netherworld’s jurisdiction. It made up
for roughly 1% of the entire territory of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning didn’t say a
word. He wasn’t in the mood for chit-chat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Yan, after saying
a few more things, realized Ning wasn’t in the mood. He led Ning
directly to a giant city, within which were numerous buildings and
many demonic soldiers. King Yan quickly arrived at a courtyard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the
courtyard where your mother was sentenced.” King Yan led Ning
straight inside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The demonic soldiers
didn’t dare restrict them from entering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The judge on his
judge’s seat, upon seeing who had entered, was badly shocked. He
was just one of countless judges; there was no way he could possibly
compare with one of the exalted Yama-Kings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your underling
greets you, Yama-King.” The judge hurriedly fell to his knees, and
the surrounding demonic soldiers all knelt down as well. As for the
ghost who was waiting to be sentenced, he was completely terrified.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and
sentence this one,” King Yan instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, yes!” The
judge hurriedly said, “Hurry up and send him to the eighteenth
level of Hell.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two demonic soldiers
immediately dragged the ghost away. The ghost screamed in terror, but
was still pulled out of the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can leave now.
Don’t use this court for anything else today,” King Yan
instructed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Neither the
judges nor the demonic soldiers dared say a thing. Although they had
many tasks to accomplish, there were many other courts in operation;
for one to be paused for a day didn’t mean anything. They gave the
youth behind King Yan a curious glance; they could sense that even
King Yan wanted to ensure that this youth was taken care of.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This youth most likely
had an incredible background! They all obediently retreated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, only Ning and
King Yan were left in the court.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“King Yan, senior, I
haven’t overcome my tribulation to become a Celestial Immortal yet.
I’ll have to trouble you, senior, to use temporal inversion for
me,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A minor matter,”
King Yan said. Although this sort of Immortal technique used up a
considerable amount of his energy, in the long run it didn’t
matter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Yan immediately
used the temporal inversion technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The scene before them
changed. The departed judges and demonic soldiers quickly returned to
the hall, once more beginning to judge the souls of the dead, then
the souls before them…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time continued to flow
backwards, faster and faster. In fact, everything turned into a blur.
Ning and King Yan just stood there within the court, waiting
silently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The images of the
temporal inversion were illusory ones. Even if the figures of the
judges or demonic soldiers touched with them, it wouldn’t make any
difference at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One year. Two years.
Three years…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time continued to flow
backwards at high speed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the day,”
King Yan said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There had been an order
to the procession of souls judged that had been recorded within the
bamboo scroll. It included information on which judge did the
adjudication, when the record was made, and in what order the
decision was made. Thus, King Yan knew exactly which court and
roughly which day the judgement was made.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The reversed flow of
time began to slow down, and the ghosts could be seen clearly once
more.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked carefully
at the ghosts; one of them should’ve been his mother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Yan controlled the
temporal version, making it come to a sudden halt, because a
white-robed woman had just been escorted in by the demonic
soldiers…and it was Ning’s mother, Yuchi Snow!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother.” Ning’s
eyes stung. He actually wanted to throw himself forward to hug her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had been far, far
too long…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ning knew that
these were merely the illusions rendered by a temporal inversion;
these were events that had already happened in the past. These were
nothing more than illusions; there was no way he could possibly touch
his mother.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Faster, faster!”
The two demonic soldiers that brought Yuchi Snow in actually gave her
a shove.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yuchi Snow looked at
her surroundings. Not panicking at all, she immediately knelt down.
“My respects to you, judge.”
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_4___Eastflow_Snow__Willo"></A>
Chapter 4 - Eastflow Snow, Willowriver Chuan
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An aura of light
suddenly appeared within the court, and within the light appeared
many images. There were images of a little girl playing with her
elders, of a young maiden fleeing in terror, of the fully grown Yuchi
Snow staring into Ji Yichuan’s eyes, of her adventures in the
Darknorth Sea, of her birth of Ji Ning, of her teaching Ji Ning
footwork techniques…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One image after
another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Her past life.”
Ning stared at the images.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although a Protocosmic
spirit-treasure had been left behind within this miniature cycle of
reincarnation that allowed one to view the past lives of countless
ghosts, there was no Book of Life and Death. The judge merely gave
the images a glance, then wrote with his pen, “Yuchi Snow, of the
world of the Grand Xia, Eastisle Commandery, Yuchi clan. Slightly
positive karma. Adjudicated to be…” Some thoughts suddenly
appeared in the judge’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adjudicated to be
reborn as a human and be reincarnated to the Wusky world, Flowermont
Commandery, Eastflow clan. Her name shall be Eastflow Snow, and she
shall live for 200 years.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These thoughts had been
naturally generated by the Dao of the Heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once one took on the
position of judge and moved to support the normal functioning of the
Six Paths, it could be said that one had become a part of the Dao of
the Heavens. However, the judges were fully capable of changing these
written decisions…but in doing so, their own karma would be
affected. The more ridiculous the changes were, the more major the
impact would be on their karmic standing. In fact, there were some
judgements that simply couldn’t be written. For example, if this
minor judge was to try to forcibly write that Yuchi Snow’s sentence
was to suffer a thousand years of punishment in the eighteenth level
of Hell, so much sin would accumulate around the judge that he would
probably be immediately deposed from his position, even before he
finished writing the sentence!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…To be reborn as a
human and be reincarnated to the Wusky world, Flowermont Commandery,
Eastflow clan. Her name shall be Eastflow Snow, and she shall live
for 200 years!” This judge naturally followed the will of the Dao
of the Heavens. He wouldn’t make any changes at all for an ordinary
ghost like this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Watching as his mother
was sent off, Ning murmured to himself, “It really was the Eastflow
clan of the Flowermont Commandery of the Wusky world. I wasn’t lied
to.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you wish to also
see Ji Yichuan?” The nearby King Yan asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes. Of course,
yes.” Ning nodded, then said, “King Yan, sorry for the trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No trouble at all.
If I ran into something like this, I’d probably be frantic as well.
Still…unless one becomes a Celestial Immortal, one shall forever
struggle within the cycle of the Six Paths of Reincarnation. If one
is lucky, one might eventually escape, but less than one in a
trillion actually do so. The vast majority shall continue to drown
within the cycle until the day comes when their soul is destroyed.”
King Yan looked at Ning. “You need to accept this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded gently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come. Let’s go to
another court,” King Yan said, leading the way.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yet another court. The
court had been a ceaseless bustle of activity, but it all came to a
sudden halt. The judge and the demonic soldiers were terrified into
hurriedly departing, leaving behind only Ning and King Yan. King Yan
once more used a temporal inversion technique, allowing them to view
the scenes of the past. They watched as Ji Yichuan was sentenced by
the judge.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father.” Ning
looked at the white-robed Ji Yichuan while listening to the words of
the judge. “So he really was sent to the Flowermont Commandery of
the Wusky world.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wish to make a
trip to the Wusky world,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright. I’ll
accompany you on this trip. I imagine that you will want the temporal
inversion technique to be used again; I’ll have to do it for you.”
King Yan nodded, then advised, “But Ji Ning, you have to be
careful. The Wusky world is not like the Grand Xia; its foundations
are not as stable or deep as ours. Thus, the Seamless Gate has been
even more brazen in that world. We can go investigate matters
pertaining to your parents’ reincarnation, but it’s best for you
not to intervene in those struggles.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said softly, “I
understand. King Yan, don’t worry; I’m no longer that stupid,
hot-headed little kid.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” King Yan
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two immediately
left this courtyard, then used a spatial teleport to head straight to
the Wusky world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Wusky world was one
of the dozens of major worlds under Daofather Crimsonbright’s
control. In truth, of the worlds under Daofather Crimsonbright, the
Grand Xia was actually in fairly good shape; there were many that
were in far worse shape than the Grand Xia! For example, the Mount
Stele major world was now almost completely controlled by the
Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Wusky world had
descended into the fires of war, filled with battles by Immortals and
Fiends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is where the
Eastflow clan of the Flowermont Commandery is located.” King Yan
looked down from the night sky towards a city, filled with countless
Diremonsters.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Eastflow clan is
gone?” Ning frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps a few
remnants of them remain somewhere.” King Yan looked downwards.
“Right now, the entire Wusky world is in a state of chaos. Major
clans and sects might be able to fight back, but many smaller,
backwater areas have been utterly massacred. The Seamless Gate
doesn’t care too much about discipline; in fact, they delight in
causing chaos, the more the merrier.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had noticed this as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When humans took
control over a territory, they emphasized order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But the Seamless Gate,
however, encouraged battle and war. It instigated countless problems,
hoping for more chaos!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This city of the
Eastflow clan was broken into by monsters. It is now occupied by
monsters, while the remnants of the Eastflow clan have fled long
ago,” King Yan said. “Let me use the temporal inversion now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Ning
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gave the city
below a single glance. Instantly, invisible ripples of power swept
out from his soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of the many
monsters within the commandery city, as well as a few humans who were
still resisting and fight back against the monsters, all felt their
bodies go soft before they collapsed to the ground. In this
instant…all the humans and monsters within the city were trapped
within a deep slumber.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Temporal inversion.”
King Yan looked downwards as he executed his technique.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Waaaaaaa!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A cry rang out, and an
infant was born.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, let’s call
this daughter of mine…Eastflow Snow.” A tall man spoke out in a
joyful manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eastflow Snow slowly
grew up. She was smart and obedient, learning from her father to
become a Ki Refiner and loving to play around with the other children
of the same age…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just quietly
watched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So similar. She
looks so similar to mother,” Ning murmured silently to himself. In
this life, Eastflow Snow lived a joyful, carefree life. She was
filled with vigor and life, whereas in her past life as Yuchi Snow,
she had always seemed slightly gloomy and quiet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eastflow Snow quickly
grew up. After turning sixteen, she went out adventuring with her
fellow clansmen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While adventuring in
the outside world…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She encountered another
boy, a boy who saved her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who are you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My name is
Willowriver Chuan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sixteen year old
Eastflow Snow had met with the still-boyish Willowriver Chuan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother. Father…”
Ning and King Yan quietly watched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two went out
adventuring together. Willowriver Chuan slowly grew taller; although
he was a few years younger than Snow, he had a tall, muscular frame.
Given that Chuan was also a Fiendgod Body Refiner, he soon grew even
taller than Snow. After adventuring together for two years, the two
naturally began to grow close together, perhaps because they felt an
innate affinity for each other. Chuan and Snow both broke through to
become Xiantian lifeforms while adventuring together! However, Chuan
broke through as both a Fiendgod Body Refiner and a Ki Refiner,
whereas Snow was merely a Ki Refiner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little brother
Chuan, Father has already sent people to summon me; I have to go
back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big sister Snow,
I’ll find you. I’ll make your father allow you to marry me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll wait for
you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll definitely
come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, dear Snow,
you have quite the eye. This Willowriver Chuan was able to become a
Xiantian lifeform; this means that he can be considered a genius of
the Willowriver clan. However…their clan is still a small one. It
can’t compare with our Eastflow clan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daddy!” Snow grew
worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha, I’m just
teasing you! If you like him, then go ahead and be with him; I won’t
stop you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Months later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chuan, don’t be in
such a rush. Father has actually agreed to us already; he’s just
testing you.” Snow had stealthily crept over to the guest building
where Chuan was residing to tell him this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So that’s the
case. I was being too impatient.” Chuan rubbed his head. “Big
sister Snow, since your father isn’t going to stop us…then I’m
going to go back to prepare a betrothal gift. According to clan
rules, I need to prepare a gift of nine ding-cauldrons.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Snow
nodded gently, but she blushed a bit with shyness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…..
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A betrothal gift of
nine ding-cauldrons was quite a pricey one. However…since Chuan had
long ago broken through to the Xiantian level, his status within his
clan was quite high. He soon prepared the gift. Although the Eastflow
clan was far more powerful, they didn’t move to stop this affair.
The two sides soon came to agree on an auspicious day; next spring,
the wedding would occur.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Eastflow
clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept Icebreak,
after these three kids join the Flowermont Immortal School, I’ll
have to trouble you to take care of them. Here are our gifts for you
for taking them on as your disciples; please accept them, Adept.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Teaching and guiding
one’s disciples is only normal; there’s no need for this gift.
I’ve spent quite some time with your Eastflow clan; it’s time for
me to go back. Have those three kids come out; I’ll take them back
to the Flowermont Immortal School.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, Adept.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eastflow clan
leader was being very careful to take good care of this Adept
Icebreak of the Flowermont Immortal School. The Flowermont Immortal
School was the most supreme of the large schools of the Flowermont
Commandery. Supposedly, they even had a Celestial Immortal amongst
their ranks! In addition, the Flowermont Immortal School was very
strict with its disciples; in fact, if any disciples had any sin
around them, they would be expelled! From this, one could tell how
strict their rules were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were naturally
many people who wished to join such a mighty, righteous school.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Adept forgot
this. Please hand this to the Adept.” The Eastflow clan leader
secretly handed the gift to one of the Adept’s followers, who
accepted it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, three youths
appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After you go to the
Immortal School, you’ll have to work hard.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are the shining
stars amongst the younger generation of our Eastflow clan. In the
future, our clan will depend on you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little uncle,
remember to come back to visit me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Second brother, take
care of yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The kinsmen of the
three youths sent them off…and amongst them was Eastflow Snow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Adept
Icebreak glanced over, his gaze suddenly falling upon Eastflow Snow.
He immediately sent mentally, “Eastflow clan leader.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Adept,” the
Eastflow clan leader hurriedly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That white-robed
girl looks nice.” Adept Icebreak sent mentally, “I am in need of
a maidservant, and she looks quite obedient and clever; she’s a
good fit. Help me speak to her; if she is willing to accompany me,
then send her to me. But if she is not willing, then forget it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Icebreak then led
these three early-stage Zifu Disciple youths into his flying ship,
then departed from the Eastflow clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Eastflow clan
leader hesitated a moment, then spoke to Snow’s father about this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clan leader, you are
going to give Snow to Adept Icebreak? We can’t do that; in another
month, she’s going to get married. Can’t you refuse?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can I refuse?
Don’t you know what sort of a person this Adept Icebreak is?
Although he looks like an upright gentleman, in secret he’s very
greedy and very lecherous! It’s precisely because he is greedy that
our Eastflow clan was able to send three of our own into the
Flowermont Immortal School. If we don’t give him Snow…he’ll
probably be embarrassed and angered, which will have a negative
impact on Fuqiang and the others. They are the future of our Eastflow
clan; for the sake of the clan, if we have to sacrifice a little girl
like Snow, then we will do it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But the Willowriver
clan…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Willowriver clan
merely has two Zifu Disciples; how would a clan like that dare to
offend our Eastflow clan? Ignore them. For the sake of the tribe,
even I myself can be sacrificed, much less Snow! I’m just letting
you know in advance; later, I’ll go speak to Snow myself. I trust
that she knows what truly matters. In addition…from this day forth,
you are not to meet with Snow any longer. I’ll handle everything
myself, to ensure that there are no slip-ups.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Clan leader, you…you
are telling me…no…no! I want to see Father, I want to see
Father!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You should know what
truly matters. Come, men, go and lock her up! Tomorrow, I’ll send
her off myself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a vast
wilderness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big sister Snow, why
did you break the message-talisman? What has happened?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I used a Lesser
Teleportation Dao-seal to flee. There’s no time! I want you to give
up everything and leave this place by my side. In fact, we’re going
to leave the entire Flowermont Commandery, but we will be together.
Alright?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Romantic love and
familial love warred with each other. In the end…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Willowriver Chuan had
knelt down, kowtowing towards the direction of his clan. “Father.
Mother. Elder brother and second brother will have to be filial in my
stead. Forgive me for being unfilial! In the future, if I have the
chance, I will return.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That very night,
Willowriver Chuan and Eastflow Snow had left their homeland, eloping.
</P>

Chapter 5 - Truesoul
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning stood there in
the wilderness, watching the scene of Willowriver Chuan and Eastflow
Snow fleeing that had been created by the temporal inversion. His
heart felt heavy…because up until now, everything which had
transpired was identical to events as portrayed within the book King
Yan had given him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go to the
Ninesongs Sword Sect,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Yan knew that
until Ning saw everything in person, he wouldn’t give up hope. The
two immediately teleported forward to the Ninesongs Sword Sect,
located in another commandery.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That year, Chuan and
Snow had carefully, slowly departed in a drifting manner. They spent
a total of eight years before passing out of the vast Flowermont
Commandery and arriving at the Ninesongs Sword Sect. Chuan was very
skilled in the sword to begin with, and because they had encountered
many dangers over the past eight years, he had improved
significantly. His had reached the Zifu Disciple level as a Fiendgod
Body refiner, and so he was able to easily enter the Ninesongs Sword
Sect as a disciple. As for Eastflow Snow, she had entered by his side
as his ‘maidservant’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The second year after
their entry into the Ninesongs Sword Sect. Snow, by relying on a
spirit-pill which Chuan had acquired from the sect, was able to break
through to the Zifu Disciple level. She, too, was accepted as formal
disciple of the Ninesongs Sword Sect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the place
where the Ninesongs Sword Sect used to be.” From his position high
up in the air, King Yan pointed downwards towards a giant pile of
rubble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
rubble, his heart sinking.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The rubble spanned tens
of thousands of kilometers, and there were quite a few monsters in
this area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eastflow
Snow…Willowriver Chuan. According to the intelligence reports that
I collected, they lived here at Waterflow Peak, which should be right
over there.” King Yan quickly flew to a part of the destroyed city.
Waving his hand, he caused the many monsters and Diremonsters there
to all collapse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Temporal inversion.”
King Yan once more caused a temporal inversion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The scene here quickly
began to reverse. Several decades of time were reversed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The scenery here was
now incomparably beautiful. There were beautiful mountains and
rivers. There was dense spiritual energy here, and Immortal
cultivators could be seen everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chuan, you always
let me win.” Snow and Chuan were competing in swordplay, but in the
end, Chuan always ‘lost’ every match.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, it’s that your
sword-arts have improved yet again, Snow,” Chuan said with a laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing this, Ning felt
a warm feeling in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There are three more
years before that calamity,” the nearby King Yan told Ning. He
controlled the flow of time, speeding it up. Snow and Chuan lived
happy lives here at the Ninesongs Sword Sect; they had just joined
the school, after all, and it wasn’t yet time for them to go out
and adventure. Their life here was like life in paradise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon…three years of
time passed within the temporal inversion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a bright,
sunny day. The scenery was as beautiful as ever. In truth, the
Seamless Gate had already infiltrated the Wusky world several years
ago, and the outside world was in a state of chaos. Life within the
Ninesongs Sword Sect, however, remained as peaceful and calm as ever.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Black sword-light
suddenly began to flash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Willowriver Chuan,
wielding twin swords, was currently training in swordplay while
comprehending the Dao. Because he was a Fiendgod Body Refiner, he now
looked even more handsome and valiant than he had in his past life.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby Eastflow
Snow was seated close to him, smiling as she watched. She knew that
in her heart, her man continued to long for his homeland, long for
his Willowriver clan. However…he had always been worried about
Adept Icebreak of the Flowermont Immortal School, and so he continued
to wait and endure. He was extremely hard on himself in training
sword-arts, becoming one of the best amongst the Zifu Disciples of
the Ninesongs Sword Sect. He had long ago reached the level of seeing
a hint into the ‘true meaning of the Dao’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chuan, we’ll
definitely be able to go back together.” Eastflow Snow missed her
father as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A group of black-robed
figures appeared in the sky. There were a total of twenty-seven of
them, and they almost instantly transformed into three giant black
serpents. These three giant black serpents were more than a thousand
kilometers long. Their auras filled the skies, and the entire grand
formation that protected the Ninesongs Sword Sect was instantly
activated, causing light to flare everywhere.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world seemed to
have collapsed. The formation was only able to stay alive for a few
moments, and then it crumbled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s going on?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What happened?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many of the weaker,
ordinary disciples were completely stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chuan, however,
instantly flew to Snow’s side. He hurriedly said, “Snow, let’s…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Halfway through their
words, a ripple of energy swept past this entire mountain. Some the
Zifu Disciples who were struck head-on by the ripple were instantly
reduced to dust, completely unable to fight back. And then, with a
booming sound, the entire mountain peak began to collapse. Countless
rocks began to fall down, and both Chuan and Snow hurriedly flew away
in an attempt to hide.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Seamless Gate, our
Ninesongs Sword Sect has never offended you. Why do you have to
annihilate our school?” Several figures had streaked into the
skies; it was the Loose Immortals, Earth Immortals, and Primal
Daoists of the Ninesongs Sword Sect. They formed together into a
grand formation, each of them furious and frantic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just die in peace!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the three
massive black serpents spoke out in the human tongue…and then, not
bothering to say anything else, they began to fight brashly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The surrounding space
had been completely locked; there was no way to teleport out of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unable to escape, the
Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals of the Ninesongs Sword Sect led
the Primal Daoists to join into a formation. They transformed into a
dazzling, titanic sword that did battle against those three giant
serpents. However, after clashing just a few times, the titanic sword
was completely shattered. More than half of the Loose Immortals,
Earth Immortals, and Primal Daoists of the Ninesongs Sword Sect were
instantly killed, while the others were all heavily wounded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The heavily injured
Ninesongs Sword Sect experts were all wiped out. The giant black
serpents swam about in the skies, utterly destroying the base of the
sect, which stretched out more than tens of thousands of kilometers.
As for the weaker disciples of the Ninesongs Sword Sect, they were
unable to escape and so many of them were butchered without being
able to fight back at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Snow…”
Willowriver Chuan held Eastflow Snow in his arms, no longer running.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Chuan…do you
regret having left with me?” Tears fell down Eastflow Snow’s
face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“These past twelve
years…I’ve truly been very happy. If I had the chance to choose
again, I would still choose to come here with you, Snow.” Chuan
laughed. “We’ll meet again on the road to the Yellow Springs.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Tears
falling down her face, Snow nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A ripple swept out, and
the embracing couple of Willowriver Chuan and Eastflow Snow was
reduced to dust. Their souls, however, were drawn upwards at high
speed by some invisible force. In midair, there was a black gourd
that was frantically drawing in all the nearby souls of the
slaughtered, including the souls of Chuan and Snow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just stood there,
watching silently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby King Yan
said softly, “The Seamless Gate wanted to tame this commandery, but
since they had just arrived, not many joined them. Thus, the Seamless
Gate decided to annihilate some smaller schools, so as to frighten
the others. While killing countless cultivators, they collected the
souls of the slain for usage in forming some evil techniques. If one
had millions, ideally hundreds of millions of cultivator souls, one
could refine a truly powerful and truly terrifying evil magic
treasure, or develop a truly vile divine ability.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning knew this quite
well, of course.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a pity.” King
Yan sighed. “The Seamless Gate is spread throughout the Three
Realms, and the power behind them is unfathomably mighty. Even though
you have a Daofather as your master…you still probably won’t be
able to do anything to them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m very calm
right now,” Ning said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although he looked
calm…in truth, Ning felt an overpowering desire to kill, one
greater than he had ever felt. It was only because he had reached the
third level of heartforce, ‘ruler’, that Ning was able to remain
calm. However…in his heart, Ning now viewed the Seamless Gate as
his most hated of foes. Even the hatred he felt for the Youngflame
clan was less than a hundredth of a hundredth of the hatred he felt
for the Seamless Gate!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The. Seamless.
Gate.” Ning spoke out three words, enunciating each one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby King Yan
suddenly felt his heart shudder for no reason. He could vaguely sense
the killing intent within Ning’s heart…and all he could do was
sigh. The Seamless Gate…it was a power that had swept through the
entire Three Realms. How could it be so easily dealt with?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t act
foolishly, “King Yan said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning murmured softly to
himself, “Even though Father and Mother’s souls have been
shattered…in the future, I’m going to train until I become a True
God or a Daofather. I’ll find their truesouls in the River of
Destiny and bring them back to life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Yan didn’t say
anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of them knew that
the true essence of all living creatures came from their truesoul.
Even if one’s soul was shattered, their truesouls would return to
the mysterious River of Destiny…but it was far too hard to find a
truesoul within it. According to the legends, only Maiden Nuwa, who
had reached Pangu’s level of power, was capable of this. However…if
one became a True God or Daofather then located Maiden Nuwa, they
could ask Maiden Nuwa to intervene.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wish to make a
trip to the Flowermont Immortal School,” Ning said calmly. “I
want to pay a visit to that Adept Icebreak.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go with you.
I’ve already collected a report regarding this ‘Icebreak’,”
King Yan said. “He is now a Primal Daoist. Because the Flowermont
Immortal School has a Celestial Immortal protecting it, it still
exists. That Celestial Immortal is under Daofather Crimsonbright’s
command, and it can be said that the two of us are on friendly terms.
All we have to do is seek out Patriarch Flowermont; he won’t care
about the life of a puny little Primal Daoist. Patriarch Flowermont
can be said to be quite a noble man, righteous and unyielding, which
is why the rules of his school are so strict. However, no matter how
strict the rules are, it’s hard to avoid a few pests from
invading.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand. I
won’t fight with Patriarch Flowermont.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For every grievance,
there is someone responsible for it; for every debt, there is a
debtor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning understood this
principle. The reason why King Yan had said those words was because
he was worried that Ning was going to go fight with the entire
Flowermont Immortal School. It must be understood that Ning had once
fought all of the Celestial Immortals of the Youngflame clan by
himself, eventually killing two of them. Given his power…there was
no way the Flowermont Immortal School would be able to resist him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Flowermont Immortal
School.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the number one
school of the Flowermont Commandery of the Wusky world. The founding
patriarch was Patriarch Flowermont, who remained alive to this very
day. It was due to him that the fame of the Flowermont Immortal
School was spread far and wide.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A series of maids
called out respectfully as the confident, extraordinarily handsome
Adept Icebreak walked past them with a smile. Everyone within the
Flowermont Immortal School knew that Daoist Icebreak was a gentleman;
his only flaw was that he loved beauties! However, he neither stole
them nor seized them from others. For a person to have many maids by
his side wasn’t too major a flaw.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Autumn Water, you
and the rest of the seven, attend me,” Daoist Icebreak said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seven of the maids
immediately assented respectfully. Their hearts, however, were filled
with terror and unease. Outsiders were ignorant of this, but they
knew exactly how savage and cruel Daoist Icebreak was. Some of the
maids that he tortured and ravaged actually died from it! However,
Daoist Icebreak would often send the older maids who were no longer
beautiful back to their own clans and arrange for them to live good
lives. This caused many of the disciples of the Flowermont Immortal
School to praise Adept Icebreak for being a passionate, kind man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! A figure suddenly
descended from the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Icebreak
frowned. Who dared to trespass within his territory? But then…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Headmaster!”
Daoist Icebreak was badly shocked. He hurriedly fell to his knees
with respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Follow me.” The
Headmaster of the Flowermont Immortal School had a cold look on his
face. He grabbed Daoist Icebreak, then dragged him into the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Icebreak was
utterly terrified on the way over…because the Headmaster was
actually dragging him to the legendary residence of the Patriarch.
Patriarch Flowermont was the founding patriarch of the school, a
Celestial Immortal! Daoist Icebreak had never even seen him a single
time. Why did the Patriarch wish to see him? He had never offended
the Patriarch…could it be that he had just been singled out for his
talent and was about to be made a personal disciple of the Patriarch?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon arriving, Daoist
Icebreak saw a yellow-robed man on his knees, quivering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father!” Daoist
Icebreak was shocked to see his father, an Earth Immortal. He had
always relied on his father to support him within the sect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why haven’t you
knelt yet?!” The yellow-robed man roared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Adept Icebreak sank to
his knees with a thud.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moments later, the
courtyard door in front of them creaked open, and three figures
emerged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My two fellow
Daoists…” A black-bearded man spoke with incomparable warmth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did the
kneeling Daoist Icebreak give these three a glance. Although he had
never seen the Patriarch before, there were portraits of the
Patriarch within the school, and so he recognized right away that
this black-bearded elder was Patriarch Flowermont. However…right
now, even their founding Patriarch was treating these two guests with
incomparable respect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who are those two?
Why is the Patriarch behaving so humbly and modestly towards them?”
Daoist Icebreak couldn’t understand it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Flowermont,
however, just gave the kneeling Daoist Icebreak a sideways glance. A
cold look flashed through his eyes; that damned Daoist Icebreak had
actually offended Ji Ning! The Wusky major world was one of Daofather
Crimsonbright’s worlds, which meant Patriarch Flowermont was one of
Daofather Crimsonbright’s Celestial Immortals. Word had long since
spread amongst this group of Celestial Immortals that Ji Ning, all by
himself, had fought against nine Celestial Immortals of the
Youngflame clan, with one of them being Immortal Venomfreak. In the
end, Ji Ning had managed to kill two of them, but he had been exiled
after a plot caused him to be burned by karmic sinflames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This news had instantly
swept the various worlds, causing the many Celestial Immortals and
True Immortals under Daofather Crimsonbright’s command to all feel
admiration for Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had trained for less
than a century, and he was a Void-level in power…but he had fought
against nine Celestial Immortals and killed two of them?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He even managed to
come back after being exiled into a danger zone while being
surrounded by karmic sinflames. A monster like this…his personal
power is far greater than mine, while his background and his
potential is even more astonishing.” Patriarch Flowermont naturally
was enraged that Daoist Icebreak had caused his school to become
enemies with this man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Ji
Ning, I truly feel ashamed that my school has given birth to such a
vile miscreant! I’ve already summoned Daoist Icebreak. You choose
what to do with him! Whether it is to simply kill him or to torture
his soul for millions of years…fellow Daoist Ji Ning, do as you
please!” Patriarch Flowermont said.

Chapter 6 - The Curtains Are Raised
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Icebreak knelt
there. He felt as though freezing icewater had just been poured
across his entire body. He felt extremely cold, and his face had
turned white. Kill him? Torture him? Torment his soul? Daoist
Icebreak repeatedly kowtowed, smashing his forehead against the
ground until blood began to pour from it. He screamed frantically,
“Patriarch, Patriarch! Two seniors! Spare me, spare me! I’ve
definitely never offended this senior, Ji Ning. Someone must have
framed me. Framed me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning just stood
there, staring at the terrified, kneeling Daoist Icebreak. He was
very calm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby King Yan,
however, did speak out. “If I say you deserve to die, then you
deserve to die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Icebreak’s
heart trembled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even a Celestial
Immortal like Patriarch Flowermont was so respectful of these two. If
they wanted to kill him…did they even really need to give a good
excuse?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The yellow-robed man
knelt there by his side. He loved his son, but he didn’t dare to
say a single word. He knew what sort of terrifying situation they
were currently facing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if I have to
die…senior, please tell me what I’ve done, exactly!” Daoist
Icebreak was still frantically trying to find a way to survive. He
suppressed his terror as he raised his head to look towards Ning. He
had to find out what this was all about. Only when he understood the
reason behind this could he explain and argue back. Otherwise, there
was no way for him to even argue about it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In recent
years…you’ve harmed quite a few mortals, haven’t you.” Ning’s
voice was very calm. His eyes were very calm as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daoist Icebreak’s
body shook. He immediately collapsed supinely to the ground, a look
of utter despair on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mortals?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even he himself didn’t
know how many woman had fallen into his hands, then been ravaged to
death by him. Forget about mortals; even quite a few female
cultivators had fallen into his hands. However…he had never left
behind any traces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who…who is this
youth, that even the Patriarch must be wary of? Which mortal was he
connected to? Little Sparrow? Nuan’er? Dongyou?” One figure after
another flashed through Daoist Icebreak’s mind. These were images
of the woman who had suffered under him that he remembered the most
keenly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You harmed so many
that you can’t even guess?” Ning said softly, “Then think it
over, slowly, in Purgatory.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A strange ripple
suddenly reached Daoist Icebreak’s body. Daoist Icebreak’s body
trembled. A look of despair and terror appeared in his eyes…and he
stopped moving. His soul instantly flew out from his body. What Ning
had just done was to hypnotize him, then forcibly rip his soul out of
his body. A black bottle appeared in Ning’s hand which instantly
sucked Daoist Icebreak’s soul into it. Green flames could vaguely
be seen blazing within the bottle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The kneeling,
yellow-robed man stared at the flames in the bottle. His heart
instantly shuddered. “Son…your father didn’t discipline you
well enough.” He understood what his son’s flaws were, and he
often urged his son to do better. Daoist Icebreak was always quite
obedient in front of him…but as soon as he turned his head,
Icebreak would go back to his old ways. All he did was hide it even
better.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, he felt
that since his son focused on mortals, it shouldn’t make much of a
difference, and so he didn’t reprimand his son too strongly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If one often walks
by the riverside, one’s shoes will eventually get wet. He did too
many evil deeds…one might be able to avoid retribution for a time,
but no one can avoid retribution forever.” Only now did the
yellow-robed man truly understand this saying. The righteous laws of
Heaven applied to all men, and the wheel of karma turned without end;
both had their own ways of punishing the wicked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Ji
Ning, this Daoist Icebreak has committed countless vile deeds. The
only reason why this vile miscreant was able to live so long was
because I didn’t maintain a firm enough grip over my disciples.
Daoist Icebreak’s father, ‘Yangfish’, is right here as well.
Without his father’s protection, how would this vile miscreant have
dared to act so boldly? Fellow Daoist Ji Ning, punish him as you see
fit; there’s no need to worry about me!” Patriarch Flowermont
said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A mere Void-level Earth
Immortal truly meant very little to a Celestial Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gave the
yellow-robed man a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Yan had collected
intelligence reports regarding both Daoist Icebreak and his father,
and Ning had read them all. Daoist Icebreak was a hypocrite and a
false gentleman who had done many vile deeds in secret, harming many
people. His father, however, could be considered a righteous man. He
didn’t do evil deeds and was quite an admirable person, and was
also quite talented, which was why he had become a Void-level Earth
Immortal. His only personality flaw was that he doted on his son too
much.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go,” Ning
said to King Yan, then turned to look at Patriarch Flowermont.
“Fellow Daoist Flowermont, we’ve disturbed you long enough. We’ll
go back to the Grand Xia now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sure, sure.”
Patriarch Flowermont smiled. “If you have free time, come and visit
our Wusky world again.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">King Yan expressed his
thanks as well, then he and Ning flew away on a cloud. They left the
Flowermont Immortal School, then used a spatial teleport to leave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After they left,
Patriarch Flowermont’s face sank down as he looked at the
yellow-robed man. “Yangfish, you failed as a father. Your son
nearly caused our school a huge disaster. As the person who shielded
him this entire time, you have to be punished. End your own life and
go reincarnate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The yellow-robed man
trembled. He didn’t dare to argue back; he immediately kowtowed,
then his body imploded. Even his goldlotus primal soul dissipated. A
wind blew past his body…and it completely dissipated, leaving
behind no traces. His soul, escorted by the Dao of the Heavens, was
sent to the minor Netherworld right away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch.” Only
now did the nearby Flowermont Immortal School’s leader speak out.
“Why did you order Yangfish to die? Didn’t senior Ji Ning decide
to spare him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The reason why
fellow Daoist Ji Ning didn’t act against him was because he didn’t
want to act against someone who wasn’t directly responsible.”
Patriarch Flowermont shook his head. “However…what if Yangfish
was to harbor hatred in his heart and, overestimating his abilities,
tried to exact revenge in some form against Ji Ning? That would cause
an utter disaster for our Flowermont Immortal School. In
addition…although fellow Daoist Ji Ning seemed to have left, who
knows if he secretly felt hatred for Yangfish or not? If I didn’t
kill him…fellow Daoist Ji Ning might harbor a grudge! Thus, it is
better to kill him….that way, fellow Daoist Ji Ning wouldn’t hold
a grudge against me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Headmaster now
understood how carefully the Patriarch was behaving. He immediately
asked, “Patriarch, who in the world is this Ji Ning, that you act
so carefully around him? I took a careful look at him earlier, but I
didn’t find any Immortal spirit-qi around him; he shouldn’t be a
Celestial Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Patriarch gave him
a glance. “He is not a Celestial Immortal; he is merely a
Void-level Fiendgod. However, he was able to fight against nine
mighty Celestial Immortals of the Youngflame clan in the world of the
Grand Xia, and he even killed two of them. In addition…he was able
to survive even the descent of karmic sinflames! Despite being merely
at the Void-level, it wouldn’t be hard for him to wipe out our
entire Flowermont Immortal School…and he is the disciple of a
Daofather!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The disciple of a
Daofather?!” The Headmaster had been feeling stunned by Ning’s
power, but upon hearing this, he was truly terrified.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now do you
understand?” Patriarch Flowermont said calmly, “Be it due to his
power, his potential, or his background…I have to be careful around
him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two had teleported
back to the world of the Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world of the Grand
Xia. Stillwater Commandery. The Black-White College. Ji Ning and King
Yan both appeared in the skies above the College. They then flew
towards Yu Wei’s residence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was late in the
afternoon, almost nightfall.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei and Yuchi Xiyue
were waiting for them in the courtyard.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded lightly. He
didn’t feel the slightest bit of joy for having killed Daoist
Icebreak. All he felt in his heart was pain…and an endless amount
of hatred towards the Seamless Gate!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister…prepare some food. I’m going to eat a bit, then
take a rest,” Ning said. “The Seamless Gate already sent their
final diplomatic note; their attacks will come very soon. We need to
make as many preparations as we can.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Yu Wei
could tell that Ning was in a terrible mood, and so she acceded to
his request.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That night, during
dinner. Xiyue did her best to bring up interesting topics so as to
help improve Ning’s mood. Yu Wei did her best to help out as well.
Ning forced out a smile, but his smile caused Xiyue and Yu Wei to
both sigh inside. “The only thing we can do is wait for time to
heal all wounds.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only later that night
did Ning say a few things to Yu Wei, a few words from the bottom of
his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This world is filled
with injustices, and I’m unable to address them all. The countless
cultivators and mortals of the world are all unable to address them
all. The only ones who can change the world…are the likes of my
master, and the other major powers who stand at the very top of the
universe,” Ning said. “Right now, I, Ji Ning, am helpless to
change this world…but after I become a True God or a Daofather,
I’ll have a chance to change things.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to stand at
the peak, to change everything. I want to protect you…protect our
future children….protect the ones I love.” Ning sat there on a
dais, Yu Wei in his arms. “I want to stand at the peak!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want to change
everything!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But first…I have
to be strong enough.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning raised his head to
stare at the crescent moon in the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei looked at Ning.
She could sense a terrifying determination within this youth’s
heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The more ambitions
you have, the more accomplishments you will have.” This was
something that she had once heard. It was within a dark region, where
countless figures had been prostrating themselves, Yu Wei one of
them. The ruler of that black region had spoken these words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this moment, as she
lay next to Ning, Yu Wei understood the true meaning of those words
that had been spoken by that terrifying figure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A powerful heart…would
have the power to change destiny itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perhaps…junior
apprentice-brother truly will become a True God or a Daofather,” Yu
Wei said quietly to herself. “By then…will I still be by his
side? Will I still be accompanying him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the coming days,
Celestial Immortal Unity of Stillwater City, Immortal Diancai, Yu
Wei, and Ji Ning all began to make their preparations. They
familiarized themselves with the formations protecting Stillwater
City. Ning’s Primaltwin completely focused on meditating on the
Dao, searching for the way to apply heartforce to Immortal swords!
Previously, in the Nihilum Zone, Ning had only developed a way to
apply heartforce to his sword-fingers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were a few
differences between using sword-fingers and actual swords.
Still…since both involved sword-arts, Ning was able to grasp the
essence of it right away. However, he needed some time to reach a
perfect level of mastery in it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt eager…because
once his Primaltwin completely mastered the art of applying
heartforce to swords, he would undergo his Celestial Tribulation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fifth World. The
enormous, castle-like city, filled with countless towering edifices.
The most towering edifice was the one where only Empyrean Gods or
True Immortals could enter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within an enormous
palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Scorching flames blazed
in the very center of the palace. Surrounding the center, there were
three massive thrones, with an azure-robed, white-skinned woman
seated in the central throne. To her left sat a fire-robed man, while
to her right sat a skinny, monkey-like elder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Mount Stele
major world has already been occupied. Only a few scattered pockets
of resistance remain.” The azure-robed woman’s voice had a
magnetic, soul-penetrating quality to it. “We can begin to transfer
our forces over and truly begin to act against the world of the Grand
Xia.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The power of the
world of the Grand Xia…Mount Stele can’t begin to compare to it.”
The skinny elder said in a low voice, “Our Bloodcloud Hall has
infiltrated the Grand Xia, and I’ve even personally investigated it
several times. The power of the Grand Xia Dynasty caused even me to
feel shocked! Don’t forget that behind him stands Daofather
Crimsonbright and Daofather Raindragon, as well as the Primordial
Imperial Clan!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The human Imperial
Clan…would they truly initiate a final battle against us for the
sake of one of their branches?” The azure-robed woman shook her
head. “They will not.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But the human
Imperial Clan of the Primordial Era will send reinforcements,” the
skinny elder warned. “Although we’ll be able to send over our
forces from the Mount Stele world and many other places, I keep on
having this feeling…that it is going to be dangerous, very
dangerous. The world of the Grand Xia…this is probably the most
powerful major world under the command of Daofather Crimsonbright.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-robed woman
looked at the fire-robed man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fire-robed man
laughed. “Don’t look at me. My Myriad Demons Cave is only
responsible for manufacturing golems. The question of how to attack
the world of the Grand Xia is the primary responsibility of your
Seamless Gate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Do you think I’m
unaware of how hard it will be for us to deal with the Grand Xia
world?” The azure-robed woman looked sideways at the skinny elder.
“This time…we’ll act against more than half of the commandery
cities of the Grand Xia as a test. This will be our first test, our
first initial clash that comes before the true war. After the test,
after we’ve gathered enough information…the final battle between
our sides will begin.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm. And when do you
plan to move?” The skinny elder asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ten days from now!
We’ll send out two thousand units to attack in unison!” A cold
light flashed through the azure-robed woman’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Hallmaster of
Bloodcloud Hall and the Cavemaster of the Myriad Demons Cave both
turned solemn. They had a feeling of tremendous pressure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were finally going
to act against the world of the Grand Xia, the toughest nut to crack
of them all!

Chapter 7 - The Grand Army Mobilizes
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was a blazing summer
day. The world seemed to have turned into a gigantic furnace; only
late at night did things cool down a bit.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Yu Wei were
standing at the top of a tower within their mountain peak estate.
From this location, they could see nearly half of the entire
Stillwater City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s been half a
year since the Seamless Gate sent out that final note, but they still
have yet to move. We have to wait carefully every day…I wonder how
long they’ll keep us waiting?” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right now,
Stillwater City doesn’t just have Sword Immortal Unity; it also has
you, junior apprentice-brother. You were able to fight back against
nine mighty Celestial Immortals and slay two of them. Now that
eighteen years have gone past, they probably have guessed that your
power has risen yet again. How could the Seamless Gate behave rashly?
They naturally need to make many preparations. To spend half a year
in preparations to fight a Celestial Immortal who nearly has the
power of a Pure Yang True Immortal, and who is supported by a
peerlessly talented monster…it makes sense.” Yu Wei continued,
“In addition, the more time passes…the more powerful their strike
shall most likely be.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “I
understand.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.” Yu Wei looked at Ning, then said solemnly,
“You absolutely must not underestimate the Seamless Gate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha. Senior
apprentice-sister, don’t worry. Last time, I ended up suffering
mightily at the hands of the Youngflame clan. I’ve learned from
that. This time…I definitely won’t be overconfident again.”
Ning smiled. In recent days, Yu Wei had often reminded him to be
careful, to be cautious. It seemed as though the Youngflame clan’s
exile of him to the Void had caused her to fear something similar
would reoccur.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt warmed and
comforted by this sort of concern.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the past half
year, Ning had more than half-mastered the art of applying heartforce
to his Immortal swords. Given a bit more time, he would have fully
mastered it. Given that he was experienced in applying heartforce to
his sword-fingers, his rate of improvement was quite quick. In
addition, Ning also noticed that his rate of improvement in
comprehending the Dao of the Sword had been incredibly fast during
this past half year. Clearly, his comprehension of the first level of
swordforce, which had allowed him to touch upon the innate essence of
the sword, had given him a straight path towards fully understanding
the Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, a streak of
coresense shot out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei’s face changed
slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing this, Ning
glanced at the skies. “Is it your turn to stand guard, senior
apprentice-sister?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Yu Wei
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sword Immortal Unity
truly is cautious; at every moment of every day, he’s using his
coresense to cover the entire Stillwater City. Every day, our three
Celestial Immortals will rotate in this duty, ensuring there is
always perfect coverage.” Ning sighed. “As long as the Seamless
Gate dares to draw close…there will be no way they can hide it from
us at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We are in the light,
while they are in the dark; we naturally must be cautious,” Yu Wei
said. “We are also the weaker side to begin with; if we are
overconfident, we’ll be in true danger.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “They’ve
been preparing for so long. I really wonder what sorts of methods the
Seamless Gate is preparing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When they come, they
will strike as swiftly as the thunder,” Yu Wei said solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gave Yu Wei a
glance. Of the three Celestial Immortals, Yu Wei was the most
pessimistic of the lot. Her attitude had an impact on Ning and the
others, causing them to become even more careful. For example, the
usage of coresense to keep continual oversight over the city; in
truth, this was an extremely tiring thing! Fortunately, their three
Celestial Immortals rotated through this duty, which was why they
were able to maintain this policy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While Ji Ning and the
forces of Stillwater City were waiting carefully, keeping their
coresense spread over the city at all times…on this summer night,
the grand army of the Seamless Gate finally began to make their move.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With that black, foggy
cave.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A group of masked,
golden-robed figures flew out from the cave, then immediately
dispersed into many small squads. They executed a void blink
technique and disappeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A mysterious
teleportation array within a gorge…suddenly flashed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A large group of
masked, golden-robed men immediately appeared within the array. They,
too, separated into many small squads, then quickly teleported away
to various locations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within a region of
rippling fog, two golden-robed figures appeared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In almost the same
instant, two thousand squads had silently arrived at the world of the
Grand Xia. They all dispersed towards their respective targets.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a desolate, wild
region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two golden-robed
figures were standing amidst the grass, message talismans in their
hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Big brother, thank
goodness we joined the Seamless Gate rather than stay with the Xia
Emperor. The Seamless Gate really is far too powerful. Their
headquarters in the Fifth World…good heavens! We’ve seen over a
million Celestial Immortals gathered together in an amazing display
of power, but that represented almost all of the Celestial Immortals
which Daofather Crimsonbright commands. But the Fifth World…heh
heh, it definitely has at least as many Celestial Immortals as
Daofather Crimsonbright does! In fact, when we went to go pay our
respects to the Gatemaster of the Seamless Gate, a True Immortal, he
told us that those largest, most towering of edifices were meant for
Empyrean Gods and True Immortals to reside in. How many Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals does that represent?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, third brother,
don’t be frightened by the words of the Gatemaster. Yes, the power
of the Fifth World is inconceivable…but there were more than a
thousand of those towering edifices. I refuse to believe they have
more than a thousand Empyrean Gods or True Immortals! In addition, I
imagine that the Fifth World has most likely prepared multiple
palaces for everyone at the level of the Gatemaster. Some are used
for resting, some are used for training and meditation, some are used
for receiving guests…and so if you calculate it that way, the
number isn’t that terrifying.” The more heavyset golden-robed
figure said, “However…that Fifth World truly is one of their
headquarters with awesome power. They actually dared to gather so
many forces there…that means they are at least capable of
withstanding a Daofather. Otherwise, the Daofathers would’ve wiped
them out long ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The other
golden-robed man nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If the Fifth World
used its full power against the world of the Grand Xia, they would
probably be able to annihilate it in just a few days. But the Fifth
World needs to assault many major worlds; it is the principal
responsibility of that Gatemaster of the Seamless Gate to assault our
Grand Xia,” the heavyset golden-robed man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Only after we
completely surrendered were we trusted enough to be allowed to go to
the Fifth World,” the skinnier golden-robed figure said. “Now…this
time, the Gatemaster assigned us to deal with the Flamedoor
Commandery, and instructed us to fight with that female Immortal of
the Flamedoor Commandery. However…it’s only meant to be an act, a
mock-fight.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need to even
think about it; she’s probably joined the Seamless Gate as well.
That’s why we are only going to put on a show of fighting her,”
the heavyset golden-robed man said. “What’s true is false; what’s
false is true. Only when the waters are muddied can one fish from
them in secret. So long as Flamedoor Commandery comes under attack,
the Xia Emperor will probably feel much less suspicion towards that
female Immortal of the commandery.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. This time,
we’ve been told that two thousand squads numbering more than ten
thousand people have been sent out. I wonder how many are Celestial
Immortals and how many are Loose Immortals? And how many are joinees
like us, while how many were members of the Seamless Gate to begin
with?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who cares? That’s
not for us to know or worry about.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Still…why
haven’t the talismans shattered yet?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of them were
holding a message talisman. Once the talisman shattered, it meant
that the time had come for them to make their move!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were waiting a few
tens of thousands of kilometers outside of Flamedoor City; they’d
be able to arrive there with a single void blink. They just needed
the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The talismans
shattered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of both
figures instantly changed. No longer in the mood to chat, they
immediately void blinked towards Flamedoor City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Deep within a foggy
region outside Flamedoor City. A total of eighteen figures had
appeared atop the clouds, each of whom were dressed in golden robes.
However, their golden robes were slightly different from ordinary
golden robes. Their golden robes were all covered with various
decorations such as flowers, Godbeasts, clouds, mountains, and other
things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of their auras were
extraordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone, per the
orders of the Gatemaster, I shall lead you all today,” Celestial
Immortal Violetgrass said. “I know that I am lacking in experience,
and so I’d like to ask everyone to be patient with me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little sister
Violetgrass, although you haven’t trained for very long, your
talent is exceptional. You are now amongst the top-tier Celestial
Immortals, comparable to the rest of us; I imagine that in the
future, we’ll be asking you to take care of us!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the response
from the other Celestial Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all knew quite
well that Celestial Immortal Violetgrass was heavily doted upon by
the Gatemaster, and she was also protected by Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven and many other powerful figures. It was guaranteed that
in the future, her status would be higher than theirs.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This time, the
Gatemaster has sent out two thousand squads; this shall be the final
time we test the enemy’s strength in detail, with the true war
against the Grand Xia to begin right afterwards. The purpose of all
this is to get a good sense of any powers or abilities the Grand Xia
is hiding. The mission of almost every squad is to probe the our
foes, with a few squads meant for putting on a show; only very, very
few squads are meant to wipe out the foes!” Celestial Immortal
Violetgrass swept them with her gaze as she said solemnly, “And our
squad…is one of those meant to wipe out our foes!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Celestial Immortal
Unity is too stubborn; there’s no way he’ll bend the neck for
us,” Violetgrass said. “He is incredibly powerful, and he might
break through to the Pure Yang True Immortal level at any moment. His
ability to wait and endure is also incredible; if we just let him do
as he pleases, he’ll most likely become a major impediment to the
Seamless Gate’s subjugation of the Grand Xia. Since we can’t
recruit him…then we have to eliminate him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor wasn’t
sure about the loyalties of many Celestial Immortals; for example, he
couldn’t be sure if even the capture of Celestial Immortal
Hunchmont was part of an act or not. The Seamless Gate, however, knew
everything! They knew that they truly had captured Hunchmont and had
used everything they could think of to force Unity to capitulate…but
alas, all their efforts had failed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“At present,
Stillwater City has Celestial Immortal Unity, Immortal Diancai, the
Rainbowflame Fairy, and Sword Immortal Darknorth, also known as Ji
Ning.” Violetgrass said seriously, “Immortal Diancai and the
Rainbowflame Fairy are fairly weak; they aren’t worth mentioning.
Celestial Immortal Unity and Sword Immortal Darknorth, however, are
no ordinary figures. If Celestial Immortal Unity was by himself,
there would be no need at all for the eighteen of us to join
forces…but now, Sword Immortal Darknorth has emerged.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other seventeen all
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had all received
reports regarding Sword Immortal Darknorth, Ji Ning. Prior to this,
they had been battling across other major worlds. Only after being
gathered here had they received Ji Ning’s intelligence report…and
after reading it, they had been badly shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword Immortal
Darknorth…Ji Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The champion of the
Conclave of Immortal Destiny, a disciple of one of the most supreme
Daofathers of the Three Realms, a practitioner of the [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art], a wielder of astonishing sword-arts, a possesser of
incredible divine abilities, and who had been able to fight nine
Celestial Immortals of the Youngflame clan as a Void-level Earth
Immortal…and kill two of them! Although he had trained for less
than a century, he was able to survive even the descent of karmic
sinflames; he truly was an incomparably astonishing talent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Everyone present is
a supreme Celestial Immortal, and you are all skilled in using the
formation which the Godking created. The eighteen of us are able to
somewhat unleash the power of this formation; it should be enough to
dominate anyone below the Empyrean God or True Immortal level.”
Violetgrass said solemnly, “Everyone already has a copy of the
plan; we must act in accordance with it. We have to be careful, to
tread lightly. If we are overconfident…then Celestial Immortal
Unity and Sword Immortal Darknorth will be able to escape!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Of course.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If the eighteen of
us fail even when fighting together…once word spreads, we would
have no face at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had all reached
Celestial Immortal Infatuation’s level of power; in fact, some were
even slightly stronger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighteen of them
joining forces was a more terrifying prospect than a hundred ordinary
Celestial Immortals joining forces! These were the true elites of the
Seamless Gate; only when the Seamless Gate encountered a truly thorny
foe would it send out these elites.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighteen Celestial
Immortals waited there within the fog, waited for the final order to
come. The two thousand squads had to strike at the same time!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The message talismans
in the hands of the eighteen Celesteial Immortals simultaneously
shattered!
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 8 - Celestial Immortal Unity
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Upon
seeing the message talisman shatter, a cold light flashed through
Celestial Immortal Violetgrass’ eyes. She immediately gave the
order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eighteen figures flew
towards Stillwater City at high speed, riding the clouds. They were
hidden fairly close to Stillwater City to begin with. Once they
reached a distance of three thousand kilometers away from Stillwater
City, their faces all changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Coresense!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Celestial Immortal
from Stillwater City is keeping watch with coresense.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve been
discovered!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighteen Celestial
Immortals all had a bad feeling. They had guessed that Celestial
Immortal Unity would be very cautious, but they had never expected
this! It had been more than half a year since the final note had been
sent…could it be that Celestial Immortal Unity had been maintaining
his coresense watch for all that time?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, even though
Immortal Diancai, the Rainbowflame Fairy, and Celestial Immortal
Unity rotated through this duty, it was still exhausting. Thus, they
didn’t cover too much area with their coresense, just the entirety
of Stillwater City and three thousand kilometers around it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that given how strong Celestial Immortals were, even the weakest of
them would be able to easily stretch their coresense out to a hundred
thousand kilometers. But of course, that could only be maintained for
a short period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although Celestial
Immortal Unity is being quite cautious…that is as we expected,”
Violetgrass sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The other
Celestial Immortals weren’t worried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s attack from
here. No need to advance any further.” Violetgrass gave the order,
and the eighteen Celestial Immortals descended from the skies into
the desolate wilderness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Violetgrass released
her own coresense, reaching out to touch the coresense of the
Celestial Immortal within Stillwater City. Since they had been
discovered, there was no need to hide themselves any further. “Unity,
our Seamless Gate has arrived. Hurry up and surrender!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Stillwater City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate
has arrived!” Yu Wei sent this mental message through coresense.
Instantly, two other figures flew into the skies and towards her at
high speed. One was Celestial Immortal Unity, who flew out from the
Marquis Estate; the other was Immortal Diancai. As for Ji Ning…he
had been with Yu Wei this entire time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire Stillwater
City was merely nine thousand kilometers long, and the Marquis Estate
was fairly close to the Black-White College; they were able to
instantly assemble.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“They came?”
Celestial Immortal Unity landed, his eyes filled with a shocking
desire for battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. They are
three thousand kilometers away from the east gate of Stillwater
City,” Yu Wei said. “Once they saw my coresense, they immediately
landed. They haven’t advanced any further.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Unity laughed, his laughter filled with a savage killing intent.
“Three thousand kilometers? That’s enough! They’ve already
entered the range of our formations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist
Unity,” Immortal Diancai said hurriedly, “The actual city of
Stillwater City was created by the Grand Xia Dynasty; it innately
contains tremendous power, and is also filled with many formations.
If they don’t enter the city proper, there’s no way for us to use
the innate formations that are built into the city; we can only use
the formations which the Northmont clan have laid down. Those
formations are significantly weaker; at most, we’ll be able to slow
them down a bit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s already
enough,” Celestial Immortal Unity said with a laugh. “The
Seamless Gate is very cautious; there’s no way they’d be so
stupid as to rush straight into the city proper. Activate the
formations right now and take control over them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Yu Wei
and Immortal Diancai both nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both of them were
Celestial Immortals; when one used Celestial Immortal-level power to
activate a formation, the strength of the formation would increase
markedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Violetgrass and the other seventeen Celestial Immortals stood there
within the wilderness, quietly staring at that massive city. Although
they were three thousand kilometers away, they could still see it
with the naked eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, the world
itself seemed to change.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although it was
night…an enormous cloud of fire suddenly appeared in the air above
the entire city of Stillwater. Immediately afterwards, the world
itself shook. First, an enormous barrier of light appeared, covering
the entirety of Stillwater City as well as a region of nearly nine
thousand kilometers around it! This grand sealing formation had a
diameter of eighteen thousand kilometers!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A sealing
formation?” Celestial Immortal Violetgrass swept it with a glance;
this grand formation had trapped the nearby mountains, forests, and
wilderness as well. Since they were three thousand kilometers away
from the city, they were naturally included within the formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fog began to billow
out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Space began to distort.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighteen Celestial
Immortals, however, remained quite calm. Violetgrass had seen many
things and had an extraordinary status, while the other seventeen had
engaged in wars of conquest across other major worlds; they had
plenty of experience in these things. They could immediately tell
that this sort of grand formation would at most be able to slow them
down a bit, but wouldn’t be able to have much of an impact. In
truth, it wasn’t too likely that clans like the Northmont clan of
Stillwater could have excessively powerful formations!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no need
for us to take things head-on for now,” Violetgrass sent mentally.
“Given how proud Celestial Immortal Unity is…once he’s trapped
us here, he’ll definitely take the initiative to attack us. If he
truly is so cowardly as to refuse to come out…then we’ll use our
formation to break through his formation with overpowering force.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t worry.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These Celestial
Immortals were neither overconfident nor in a rush.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For the sake of killing
Celestial Immortal Unity, they had made very detailed preparations.
However, at their level…in the end, what mattered the most was
power! Thus, the eighteen which the Seamless Gate had gathered here
today had more than enough power to slay Celestial Immortal Unity and
give him no way to escape.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The walls of Stillwater
City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Whoosh! Four figures descended upon them; Celestial Immortal Unity,
Immortal Diancai, Ji Ning, and Yu Wei. Through their control over the
formation, Ji Ning and the others were able to see through the
bewildering fog and find those eighteen distant Celestial Immortals,
even though those eighteen themselves couldn’t even tell north from
south.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s actually
eighteen of them?” Immortal Diancai was startled. He gave Unity a
glance. “Fellow Daoist Unity, last time you defeated a combined
team of thirty-six Celestial Immortals. This time, even though they
know that my disciple Ji Ning has returned, they actually have only
sent eighteen? It seems as though these eighteen are definitely
extraordinary Celestial Immortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning said, “Fellow
Daoist Unity, the Seamless Gate has come with ill intentions. The two
of us should fight together; I’ll fight in close combat, while you
attack from far away. If we join forces…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need.” Unity
shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Years ago, when Ning
had first met Unity, he had referred to him as ‘senior’. However,
now that Ning was famous for having fought nine Celestial Immortals
head-on and killing two of them, Ning clearly had power comparable to
that of a supreme Celestial Immortal. When also factoring in the fact
that the Black-White College was his principle source of assistance
in dealing with this assault from the Seamless Gate…Unity was
naturally no longer willing to allow Ning and the others to refer to
him as ‘senior’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, in their
hearts, Ning and Immortal Diancai continued to feel great reverence
for this senior of theirs, Unity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need?” Ning was
surprised.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This battle today is
primarily the culmination of my feud with the Seamless Gate,” Unity
said. “Your Black-White College has already helped me by
maintaining a coresense watch for half a year, and you are helping me
right now by maintaining this formation. I already feel very grateful
for all of this. In this battle with the Seamless Gate…there’s no
need for you to intervene! The Seamless Gate has definitely prepared
many techniques to deal with me, and they must feel confident in
their chances. Then if you were to go…I don’t want to sound rude,
but if you go, your chances of death are very high.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai and Yu
Wei both nodded slowly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They knew exactly how
formidable Celestial Immortal Unity was; he was almost as strong as a
Pure Yang True Immortal! To kill someone like this…the Seamless
Gate had to prepare an even more powerful force. If the two of them
went, they truly might die if they weren’t careful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But isn’t that
going to make things even more dangerous for you, fellow Daoist?”
Immortal Diancai asked hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hahaha, they have
their tricks…but so do I!” Unity said confidently, “They’ve
never forced me to the point of going all out before.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai nodded
slowly. Right. Unity had hidden himself away for countless eons, and
almost everyone in the Three Realms had thought him to be dead. How
strong, exactly, had he become over the course of so many years?
Aside from Unity himself, most likely no one else knew.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fellow Daoist Unity,
even a lion fighting against a rabbit should use all his might,”
Ning said hurriedly. “The two of them are Ki Refiners, but I am a
Fiendgod Body Refiner…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need.” Unity
frowned. Upon seeing Ning persevere, he added, “If you go, you’ll
actually slow me down.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning blinked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Friends of the
Black-White College, just watch me butcher them.” Unity immediately
transformed into a streak of white light as he flew far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, the reason
why senior Unity spoke so rudely was because he doesn’t want you to
go,” Immortal Diancai said. “He’s a proud, solitary figure by
nature; we’ve already helped him a lot, and he doesn’t want to
accept our help any further.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand. I’m
not angry at all.” Ning stared off into the distance. “Let’s
watch senior Unity battle the Seamless Gate first. If he really does
fall into a dangerous situation, I can intervene then.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, don’t be rash. Watch first.” Yu Wei stared
off into the distance as well. “Get a sense for exactly how strong
they are. If the Seamless Gate is too powerful…there’s no need
for us to throw our lives away.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand.”
Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Violetgrass and the
other seventeen Celestial Immortals completely ignored the
surrounding fog, as well as the illusory images that appeared around
them. Suddenly…Violetgrass frowned slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Assemble into
formation,” Violetgrass sent mentally. “Baxia.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the eighteen
Celestial Immortals moved into formation. Six floated in the air
while the other twelve remained standing on the ground. At the same
time, they began to use their Immortal energy to manifest black
tattoo lines. The lines quickly intersected, causing black runes to
levitate into the air. Instantly, a blurry light began to cover the
eighteen, slowly solidifying into the form of an enormous black
Dragonturtle. The Dragonturtle lay there on the ground, raising its
head upwards and letting out a ferocious howl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Roaaaaaar!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The draconic roar
echoed throughout the world, causing even the surrounding mist to
somewhat disperse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Baxia the
Dragonturtle, one of the Nine Sons of the Dragon?” A clear voice
rang out as the mist part in front of them. Space solidified, and a
long-haired man appeared standing in the air. He no longer looked as
ordinary and low-key as he usually did; rather, he looked like a
sharp, unsheathed sword that had revealed its fierceness. The
long-haired man roared with laughter, “The Baxia Dragonturtle
Formation, a formation that manifests one of the Primordial
Godbeasts…quite a formidable formation, and one that is suited for
defense. This is the perfect counter for me.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Unity, you still
have a chance to join our Seamless Gate,” Violetgrass said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Unity shook
his head. “As a person…I really hate it when others try to force
me to do something. I’d rather die standing than live kneeling.
Come, then…receive a blow from my sword!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six streaks of
sword-light shot out from Celestial Immortal Unity’s head. As they
flew through the air, the six streaks began to merge together.
Countless runes of light sparkled and flashed as the six Immortal
swords completely fused into a single massive broadsword. The
broadsword flashed with a white light that caused the hearts of those
who saw it to turn cold; this was was the legendary ‘Supreme
Immortal Sword’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Arise.” Unity had
an icy look on his face as he unleashed a sword-art that he had never
before used in battle.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
Bang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, within a
hundred kilometers of this area, five pillars of light appeared and
soared into the skies. These five pillars of light were gold, green,
blue, crimson, and yellow, while above the enormous Supreme Immortal
Sword appeared two enormous clouds, one white and one black. These
two clouds circled and swirled around each other, looking like an
enormous Taiji symbol.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of this
stance was so great that the faces of Violetgrass and the eighteen
Celestial Immortals all changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The intelligence
report never mentioned such a powerful sword-art!” One of the
Celestial Immortals couldn’t help but sent a frantic mental message
to the others.

Chapter 9 - Ji Ning! Ji Ning!
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Baxia
Dragonturtle Formation can definitely defend against it,” Celestial
Immortal Violetgrass sent frantically. “Let’s make our move as
well. Fight back! Kill him!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Celestial Immortal
Unity used his sword-art, the eighteen enemy Celestial Immortals all
activated their own magic treasures as well. They had used the Baxia
Dragonturtle Formation and had pooled their Immortal energy together,
causing their strength to increase. Now, every single one of them was
capable of exploding forth with power comparable to Ji Ning’s, back
before Ji Ning suffered the descent of karmic sinflames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All sorts of colors
began to flash in the skies as many magic treasures and spells shot
out like a meteor shower, slicing through the air and striking
towards Unity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Five Elements
are the foundation, the Taiji serves as the guide…this is my
Supreme Immortal Swordland.” Light flashed in Unity’s eyes, so
dense as to seem almost material. His voice rang out loudly, and the
enormous Supreme Immortal Sword within the skies began to come
crashing downwards. As it pressed downwards…the enormous Taiji
cloud above it, as well as the five pillars of light around it, all
instantly connected to it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enormous sword-world
that was a hundred kilometers in size had been created!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Supreme Immortal
Sword pressed downwards at high speed, and the size of the
sword-world was rapidly shrinking as well, from a hundred kilometers
to ten kilometers, as it clashed against the magic treasures and
spells of those eighteen Celestial Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A series of explosions
could be heard. The Supreme Immortal Swordland trembled, seemingly
growing weaker.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the distant
Unity just pushed a little bit more of his Immortal energy into it.
At the same time, those five roving Five Elements light pillars and
the Taiji clouds once more filled the Supreme Immortal Swordland with
energy, causing its power to once more be restored.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even joining forces,
we still can’t break it? This supreme ability of Celestial Immortal
Unity is actually a sword-world attack on this level. One can’t
even flee from it; it truly is enough to cause one to feel despair.
No wonder he is known as the Supreme Sword Immortal.” The faces of
the eighteen Celestial Immortals changed. Although the power of each
of their magic treasures and spells had increased dramatically, their
attacks were scattered and not unified; there was no way to merge
their attacks together, and so they were all blocked by the Supreme
Immortal Swordland.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Supreme Immortal
Sword continued to press downwards!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire sword-world
continued to rapidly shrink, quickly compressing down to the size of
the enormous Baxia Turtledragon beneath it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighteen Celestial
Immortals frantically poured in more of their own Immortal energy to
further stabilize the Baxia formation; this formation was extremely
suited for defense, and the eighteen entrusted all of their hopes to
it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! An enormous
explosion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Supreme Immortal
Sword had stabbed straight into the shell of the Baxia Turtledragon,
while runes flowed across the shell, striving to defend against the
sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“….Eh?” Unity’s
face changed slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blocked it. Blocked
it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, he’s just a
single Celestial Immortal, after all; no matter how formidable his
abilities are, he’s just ‘close to’ the power of a Pure Yang
True Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Did you really think
it would be so easy to break this Baxia Formation?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighteen Celestial
Immortals instantly felt complete confidence.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Descend.” Unity
waved his finger, once more executing the Supreme Immortal Swordland.
He wanted to launch multiple attacks to break through the enemy’s
defensive formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">…….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other three watched
the battle from far. By using his Supreme Immortal Swordland, Unity
had completely crushed the Seamless Gate’s forces; although the
Seamless Gate’s forces had a strong defensive formation, their
attacks were completely useless against Unity.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Unity is
controlling the entire battle,” Immortal Diancai said with a laugh.
“He truly is far too powerful. His sword not only includes the
Grand Dao of Taiji, it also includes many of the profound mysteries
of the Five Elements. He’s perfectly merged them all together into
this sword-stroke…most likely, not even a real Pure Yang True
Immortal would necessarily have such a powerful technique.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a Celestial
Immortal to have close to a Pure Yang True Immortal’s power
required the Celestial Immortal to be at a very high level of insight
into the Dao, and have techniques that were even more powerful than a
True Immortal’s. This Supreme Immortal Swordland was most likely
the result of a fusion of multiple Grand Daos. Although none of these
Grand Daos were fully mastered, this sort of perfect fusion was no
weaker than a sword-art derived from the complete mastery of a full
Grand Dao.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Quick, look!” The
nearby Yu Wei’s face suddenly changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning’s face
changed as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighteen distant
Celestial Immortals who originally formed into the Baxia Dragonturtle
Formation had all retrieved their various magic treasures. The area
around them began to manifest multiple azure runes. The eighteen
Celestial Immortals gritted their teeth, using their full power as
they generated countless strings of power to cover the entire Baxia
Formation. Soon…from the shell of the Baxia Dragonturtle appeared
the head of an enormous azure serpent. A Turtle-Snake had just been
formed, and its power was clearly tremendous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Turtle-Snake?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Xuanwu!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of Ji Ning,
Yu Wei, Immortal Diancai, and even Celestial Immortal Unity changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Turtle-Snake had an
extremely unique status within the Three Realms. Every single Ki
Refiner, upon reaching the Primal-level, would manifest a Primal
Turtle-Snake soul. As for Xuanwu the Turtle-Snake…he was a truly
powerful figure who had lived since the days of the primordial
Pangu’s World, and who was honored by everyone with the
awe-inspiring title of Grand Emperor. This Turtle-Snake Formation was
unfathomably more profound and complicated than the previous Baxia
Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Baxia Formation
was extremely strong defensively to begin with, while this
Turtle-Snake Formation was built atop the Baxia Formation, using it
as a base and further perfecting it.” Upon seeing the enormous
Turtle-Snake appear, Unity immediately knew what was happening. “This
Turtle-Snake formation…it has the defensive power of the Baxia
Dragonturtle Formation, but also has an incredibly strong attack.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The titanic azure
serpent, previously coiled, suddenly opened its giant, bloody maw.
The body of the azure serpent suddenly increased explosively in size
as its head transformed to become a hundred kilometers long,
seemingly capable of swallowing the universe itself. Unity hurriedly
used his Supreme Immortal Sword to block, but the serpent head seemed
to be illusory, biting down and swallowing Unity within it. Unity
hurriedly controlled the Supreme Immortal Sword to transform back
into six streaks of sword-light that returned to his side, protecting
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But, but…”
Immortal Diancai and Yu Wei were both stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Heaven Swallower?”
Ning frowned. This was an ability which Grand Emperor Xuanwu was born
with…and this Turtle-Snake Formation was actually capable of
replicating it? Clearly, the creator of this formation had perfected
this formation to a level where it was nearly identical to an actual
Turtle-Snake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In our Turtle-Snake
Formation, the turtle focuses on defense while the snake focuses on
attack.” Violetgrass and the rest of her Celestial Immortals were
quite delighted; this Turtle-Snake Formation had just as strong a
defense as the earlier Baxia Formation had. This was indeed quite a
flawless formation with astonishing power. However, it was extremely
hard to execute; these eighteen supreme Celestial Immortals were only
able to just barely set it up with tremendous effort.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unity was completely
trapped within the body of the azure serpent. He once more executed
his Supreme Immortal Swordland from inside the body, but as he did
yet another serpent head appeared, beginning to wildly assault him.
The serpent head would appear and disappear at random in an
unpredictable manner, causing Unity to be an extremely difficult
situation. From the looks of it, he wouldn’t be able to hold on for
too long.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once the
Turtle-Snake Formation appears, it dominates anyone below the
Empyrean God or True Immortal level.” Violetgrass and the others
were all completely confident.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s over.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not even Celestial
Immortal Unity can break this Turtle-Snake Formation, and the attacks
of that azure serpent are unpredictable and unfathomable.” Immortal
Diancai, standing at the walls of Stillwater City, revealed a look of
despair. Yu Wei’s face was ashen as well. Neither of them were in a
position to help. In the face of the power of the Turtle-Snake
Formation…they both knew that they were far too weak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Most likely, only a
true Empyrean God or True Immortal would be able to break this
formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” Ning’s
face changed when he saw this. He could tell that Unity wasn’t
going to be able to hold on for much longer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
executed the [Obscuring Wind of the Nine Heavens] and charged out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning!” Immortal
Diancai’s face instantly changed dramatically. “Ji Ning, don’t
go! STOP!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“JUNIOR
APPRENTICE-BROTHER!” Yu Wei began to panick as well. She hurriedly
moved to use the formation to impact Ning and prevent him from going
out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…all three of
them, Ji Ning, Yu Wei, and Immortal Diancai, were very familiar with
this formation. In fact, each of them had left their own runic
imprints upon the core of the formation; any of the four were capable
of taking control over it! The formation might be able to block
others, but there was no way it could block Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, that formation is too powerful. Not even
Celestial Immortal Unity is a match for it. Don’t be a fool!” Yu
Wei sent frantically with her coresense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciple, as your
master, I order you to come back RIGHT NOW!” Immortal Diancai grew
even more frantic.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two were so frantic
that they flew out from the city walls, chasing after Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although they had faith
in Ning’s power…they had just personally witnessed the utterly
terrifying might of the Turtle-Snake Formation. In terms of defensive
strength, not even the most powerful sword attack of Celestial
Immortal Unity could break it. In terms of offensive strength, that
azure serpent was unfathomable and mysterious in its movements, and
it could even seemingly swallow the heavens themselves. Even Unity
was at the brink of death! If Ji Ning became trapped in the azure
serpent as well…that would mean he, too, would be doomed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh! Ning didn’t
slow down at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, that
Turtle-Snake Formation’s azure serpent is clearly perfect for
binding and restricting the movements of foes. Although your body is
unbreakable as a magic treasure, this formation is a perfect counter
for you. If you go, you’ll die!” Yu Wei frantically flew towards
Ning’s direction, but Ning had the [Obscuring Wind of the Nine
Heavens] divine ability; given his speed, how could Yu Wei possibly
catch up to him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And…by now, Ning had
already reached the Turtle-Snake Formation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eighteen Celestial
Immortals of the Seamless Gate were using their full power to have
the Turtle-Snake Formation kill Unity. Now, however, they saw Ji Ning
flying towards them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He actually dares to
come after seeing the power of our Turtle-Snake Formation?” The
eighteen Celestial Immortals were shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Perfect. We’ll
first use our full power to have the formation kill Unity, and after
Unity dies we will kill Ji Ning! We’ll break them apart one by one,
then kill them all! As for Ji Ning…just let the turtle part of the
formation block his attacks,” Violetgrass sent mentally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The other
seventeen agreed with here.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all…if they had
to simultaneously deal with both Ji Ning and Unity, it would be quite
taxing, even for them. Thus, it was better to first ignore Ji Ning
and focus on killing Unity, then dealing with Ji Ning next. The
defense of the Turtle-Snake Formation was comparable to the Baxia
Formation, so he wouldn’t be an issue anyways.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As Ning appeared, the
fingers of his right hand suddenly formed into sword-fingers. Swish!
His sword-fingers instantly expanded to become more than three
thousand meters long. They were like an enormous sword that filled
the entire sky, and at the tip of the sword-fingers there was a
silvery-white aura. In this instant, Ning activated the Fourth Cycle
of the [Starseizing Hand], and also poured his heartforce into his
sword-fingers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The [Starseizing
Hand]…swordforce…and heartforce. All together!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning!” Yu Wei
and Immortal Diancai, paying attention to nothing else, flew over
towards Ning, panicking as they watched this all happen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The utterly enormous
sword-fingers descended with unfathomable power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only when the
sword-fingers actually slammed against the Turtle-Snake Formation did
the faces of the eighteen Celestial Immortals suddenly change, and
change dramatically at that. However…it was too late. SLASH! The
Turtle-Snake Formation was completely unable to withstand this
terrifying sword-finger attack of Ning’s. It was instantly ripped
apart!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the three thousand
meter long sword-fingers broke through the Turtle-Snake Formation, it
sliced sideways as well. The Celestial Immortals all felt as though
mountains were slamming against them…and in an instant, six
Celestial Immortals died!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…”
Violetgrass and the other surviving Celestial Immortals were stunned.
“Impossible. This Turtle-Snake Formation is invincible against
anyone below the Empyrean God or True Immortal level.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yes. Normally speaking,
this Turtle-Snake Formation they used truly was invincible against
anyone below the Empyrean God or True Immortal level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But Ji Ning…was
different.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he fought against
the Youngflame clan, he was already very close to being at the very
peak of power possible for a Celestial Immortal. Afterwards, in the
Nihilum Zone, had had broken through to the seventeenth stage of the
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens]; this breakthrough in
divine power alone had put him very close to a Pure Yang True
Immortal in terms of combat power, comparable to Celestial Immortal
Unity!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition to
that…Ning’s heartforce had reached the third stage, and he had
gained swordforce as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was now able to
instantly use up a fifteenth of his third-stage heartforce in a
single blow. This represented an utterly astonishing amount of power!
And now, swordforce was added into the mix as well! Ji Ning, who had
already been close to a Pure Yang True Immortal in power, had
instantly leapt past that gap. In terms of attack power, he already
had truly reached the level of an Empyrean God or True Immortal!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that he’s
actually an Empyrean God or a True Immortal?!” Violetgrass and the
others stared in terror at the distant Ji Ning. All of them began to
move to flee, no longer even thinking about fighting back…but Ning
let out a savage roar:
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“THREE HEADS, SIX
ARMS!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That single set of
sword-fingers…had suddenly transformed into six sets of
sword-fingers, slashing through the skies towards them.
</P>

Chapter 10 - Great Danger
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible. There’s
no way he can be an Empyrean God or True Immortal. If he had already
overcome his tribulation…there’s no way he could’ve hidden it
past us, the Seamless Gate!” Violetgrass and the rest of the twelve
surviving Celestial Immortals began to flee in terror. Ji Ning’s
tremendous power was great enough for them to feel that he was an
Empyrean God or a True Immortal…but that didn’t make sense!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It wasn’t possible!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning had the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art] and was capable of masking an Immortal aura,
but he still had to undergo the Celestial Tribulation; there was no
way something like that could’ve escaped the eyes of the Seamless
Gate! In fact…no tribulation of any living creature in the Three
Realms could escape the eyes of the Seamless Gate!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahhh!” A fleeing
Celestial Immortal with a big bushy beard attempted to use a large
gourd to block, but Ning’s sword-finger knocked it flying away,
then executed him. He perished and his Dao came to an end.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could Ji Ning be
this powerful?!” The various Celestial Immortals all let out
agonized cries of grief and rage. Sword-fingers criss-crossed the
skies with annihilating, slaying power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The intelligence
reports were wrong. WRONG!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What the hell?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t believe
this!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These Celestial
Immortals were all elites of the Seamless Gate. They normally only
acted after they were given very accurate intelligence reports; as
the saying went, only when one knew one’s self and one’s foes
could one be the victor in every battle. A major error like this…it
had truly never happened before! At their level, once one made a
single error of this magnitude, the penalty would be one’s life!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning executed [Three
Heads, Six Arms]. His six sword-fingers assaulted six different
Celestial Immortals…but these six strikes only used the
[Starseizing Hand] and swordforce. His seventeenth stage
[Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens] power, combined with the
Fourth Cycle of the [Starseizing Hand], was already comparable to
that of supreme Celestial Immortals. If he added swordforce to it as
well…his power was definitely no longer than that of Celestial
Immortal Unity’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In other words…Ning’s
six sword-fingers were like six Celestial Immortal Unity’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right now, the enemy
formation had already been shattered. They were all fleeing; there
was no need for him to add his heartforce into the mix. Heartforce
was far too tiring, and each full-strength blow from his sword used
up a fifteenth of it. He could only use it for fifteen strikes;
naturally, Ning was going to save it for the most critical moments.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” A cold
light flashed through through Ning’s eyes. He showed no mercy at
all with his killing blows.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His six sword-fingers
instantly slaughtered five of the Celestial Immortals. One of them
had been aimed towards the woman…and this one failed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning glanced
towards the woman in surprise. A thick layer of azure light had
appeared around her body. This azure light was protecting her, having
blocked Ning’s earlier sword-finger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Too powerful. Our
intelligence reports were completely wrong.” Violetgrass was still
terrified. A pair of talismans appeared in her hands, as well as a
Dao-seal. The Dao-seal was a Greater Teleportation Dao-seal…however,
using it would require time. Given Ning’s attack speed, that period
of time would be more than enough for him to launch more than ten
attacks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack! Crack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shattering the
talismans could be done near-instantly. Violetgrass immediately
shattered the two talismans belonging to the two powerful experts
capable of saving her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her status in the
Seamless Gate was extremely special, and she was protected by several
major figures. Aside from the supreme Celestial Immortals such as
Celestial Immortal Blackheaven, there were two True Immortals as
well; the Gatemaster of the Seamless Gate and her brother-in-law,
True Immortal Gaudy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant Fifth
World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within one of the
towering edificies, the Gatemaster of the Seamless Gate, the
Cavemaster of the Myriad Demons Cave, and the Hallmaster of
Bloodcloud Hall were staring at many mirrors that were hanging in
midair. The mirrors had many different images within them; these were
their various gathering spots within the world of the Grand Xia. They
were using Pure Yang treasures to keep watch over the battles in
those areas and also transmit the images back.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many of the images
would often flicker through various locations. There were ten-plus
water mirrors, however, which had stable images within them. This was
because these ten-plus water mirrors were keeping watch over missions
where the goal was to kill the foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Something unexpected
has just happened at Stillwater city.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s Ji Ning!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of three
leaders changed dramatically as they turned to focus on one of the
water mirrors. The water mirror displayed the image of a youth
soaring into the heavens. His sword-finger chopped through the
heavens and broke apart the Turtle-Snake Formation. The cold look on
the youth’s face, that heart-stoppingly sharp aura and pose, and
the sharp silvery-white light at the tip of the sword-fingers all
caused them to shudder in amazement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ning’s
aura is far more terrifying than it was eighteen years ago.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that…swordforce
coming from his sword-fingers?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Can it be that he’s
mastered the Dao of the Sword?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three leaders were
truly rather stunned. They had guessed long ago that Ji Ning, having
survived the descent of the karmic sinflames, would have grown
somewhat more powerful but…in the Nihilum Zone, there was no way to
sense any of the Grand Daos! Logically speaking, Ji Ning shouldn’t
have improved much with regards to the Daos. Given that he had yet to
overcome his tribulation…there should’ve been a limit to how much
he could’ve grown stronger. However, Ji Ning had just slapped their
expectations in the face!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They could never have
guessed that Ji Ning would’ve been able to come up with a way to
apply heartforce, all on his own!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Azurefox, what
should we do?” The Cavemaster of the Myriad Demon Caves and the
Hallmaster of Bloodcloud Hall both looked towards the Gatemaster of
the Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-robed woman
said softly, “The results of that battle have already been
determined. There’s no way to change things. Still…Violetgrass
has True Immortal Gaudy standing behind her. If she’s in any
life-threatening danger, she’ll definitely break the talisman which
Gaudy gave her. I trust that Gaudy will definitely intervene to save
her. If Gaudy goes, that’ll be enough. Right now, the question in
my mind is…what are we supposed to do about this Ji Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning…” The
fire-robed man and the skinny elder both began to frown.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I guessed long ago
that he would eventually become an impediment to our subjugation of
the Grand Xia, but I didn’t expect that he would become so powerful
even prior to overcoming his tribulation. If we wait and let him
overcome his tribulation and become an Empyrean God…that’s not
acceptable!” The azure-robed woman shook her head. “I really
wonder who the hell his master is, for him to produce a monster like
this…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For a peerless monster
like this to be forged, not only did the ‘raw materials’ have to
be superb, the master had to be good as well. They had no idea…that
behind Ji Ning stood the most mysterious Daofather of the Three
Realms, Patriarch Subhuti, as well as the already-deceased Daoist
Threelives, the creator of the [Starseizing Hand], the supreme divine
ability that had shaken the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the saying went, the
master could show the way but the student had to walk the path.
Still…the master showing the way came first! Ning was indeed born
to be a peerless Sword Immortal, but if he didn’t have the
[Starseizing Hand] divine ability, there’s no way he could’ve
become as monstrous as this. If he hadn’t learned [Houyi’s
Archery], he probably wouldn’t have been able to come up with a way
to apply heartforce. He would only be a ‘normal’ but powerful
Sword Immortal. But of course…a good master and a good student made
for a good pair; both were necessary! Several people had the chance
to learn the [Starseizing Hand], and quite a few had learned [Houyi’s
Archery], but how many of them had ever reached Ning’s level?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Inconceivable.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Unity, having dodged a disaster, was stunned by Ji Ning. For a
moment, he had many complicated, strange feelings in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where do you think
you are going?” Unity quickly came back to his senses. Letting out
an angry roar, he immediately controlled his Supreme Immortal Sword
to go slaughter the fleeing Celestial Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei and Immortal
Diancai, who had been chasing after Ning from behind, were both
stunned as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They felt both shock
and joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Shock…because Ji Ning
was this powerful! Too powerful!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Joy…because the more
powerful Ji Ning was, the better!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire situation
had been completely changed. Those eighteen Celestial Immortals had
been dominating Unity, but now they were being chased and
slaughtered.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“KILL!” Ning showed
no mercy whatsoever. Moments ago, he had used a single full-force
sword-finger to wipe out six Celestial Immortals. Just now, he had
killed five more…leaving only seven survivors.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[Three Heads, Six
Arms]! [Starseizing Hand]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Six sword-fingers once
more streaked through the heavens in every direction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die!” Unity also
controlled his Supreme Immortal Sword to chase after and slaughter
the remaining foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The storm has come.
Yesterday, I killed others; today, others shall kill me.” As a
skinny Celestial Immortal’s magic treasure was knocked flying away,
he shut his eyes. The only thing that had been in his eyes was
tranquility. A calamitous storm had swept the entire Three Realms,
and even the likes of Ji Ning, Celestial Immortal Unity, Yu Wei, and
the others had all mentally prepared themselves for death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus…they had to
seize every opportunity that appeared before them. When slaughtering
weak foes, no mercy was to be shown.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kill! Kill! KILL!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One Celestial Immortal
after another died. One of Ning’s six sword-fingers once more
struck towards the fleeing Celestial Immortal Violetgrass.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The azure light
around Violetgrass was actually able to endure the blows, but it was
now clearly shuddering.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…this time,
Ning’s six sword-fingers only managed to slay three Celestial
Immortals. Aside from Violetgrass, two others had managed to survive
as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have to survive. I
have to!” A Celestial Immortal with triangular pupils had a twisted
look on his face and a terrifying look in his eyes. He manifested an
Immortal estate out of nowhere, then disappeared into it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other Celestial
Immortal had also hidden into an Immortal estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Supreme Immortal
Sword slaughtered another Celestial Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only three of the
original eighteen Celestial Immortals were left. They were Celestial
Immortal Violetgrass and the two who had hidden themselves within
their Immortal estates.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Idiots!”
Violetgrass, seeing this, couldn’t help but curse to herself. Their
intelligence reports had stated that one of the two Celestial
Immortals of the Youngflame clan which Ji Ning had slain was
Celestial Immortal Goldclock. As a result, his divine greatclock had
fallen into Ji Ning’s hands. Given that Stillwater City was in a
dangerous situation…as long as Ji Ning wasn’t stupid, he would
have given it to his Dao-companion or his master. That divine
greatclock was capable of suppressing and binding!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister,” Ning roared mentally towards her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Get in here.” Yu
Wei waved her hand, and the divine greatclock flew out. It quickly
expanded in size until it became the size of a small mountain. It
hung there in the skies, and the space at the base of the greatclock
began to twist and distort. The two Immortal estates were immediately
sucked into the greatclock without being able to resist at all…then
the divine greatclock once more shrank down and flew back to Yu Wei’s
hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This divine greatclock
was one of the most important, clan-protecting treasures of the
Youngflame clan. Aside from the Worldhold Pagoda, it was the most
important treasure the entire clan had. However, only Celestial
Immortals were capable of wielding a Pure Yang treasure. Given that
Stillwater City was facing a crisis and that a storm was approaching
the Three Realms, how could Ning have been so selfish as to only
think of himself? He naturally wanted to come up with ways to help
the people he cared about grow more powerful, and so he had given the
divine greatclock to Yu Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those two Celestial
Immortals had hidden themselves within their Immortal estates in the
hopes of buying themselves some time to use Greater Teleportation
Dao-seals. If Ning’s group didn’t have the divine greatclock,
they actually might’ve managed to escape; after all, there was no
way for them to destroy those Immortal estates. Those Immortal
estates were meant to save the lives of those two Celestial Immortals
and were quite sturdy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Ning’s group
DID have that divine greatclock. The Immortal estates themselves were
not capable of resisting such an effect, and so as soon as those two
Celestial Immortals had hidden themselves within their estates, their
estates had been effortlessly sucked into the divine greatclock. The
divine greatclock possessed a completely independent dimension within
it; once one was suppressed inside it, there was no way to escape at
all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was why
Violetgrass had called them fools.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…how could the
two not have realized this? They were already faced with certain
death, and so they had no choice but to make this gamble. Their
gamble was that Ning was a very selfish person who hadn’t been
willing to give the divine greatclock to others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are the last one
left.” Ning’s gaze turned towards Celestial Immortal Violetgrass.
All six of his sword-fingers stabbed through the skies towards
Violetgrass. Although all of this had taken time to describe, the
exchange of attacks had actually happened very quickly, as fast as
lightning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can’t kill
me!!!” Violetgrass was utterly terrified…but how could she
possibly flee faster than the speed of those sword-fingers?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those six sword-fingers
flew through the skies, piercing through space and converging upon
the same point.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“STAY YOUR HAND!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A roar rang out, filled
with the power of Pure Yang-level energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The grand sealing
formation outside was blasted apart, and the enraged roar echoed
within the ears of Ning and the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM
BOOM BOOM!!!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The six sword-fingers
simultaneously struck Celestial Immortal Violetgrass. The azure
barrier was no longer able to endure any longer. It blew apart into
tiny pieces…and under the blows of the six massive sword-fingers,
Violetgrass’s body was instantly reduced to dust. She perished, her
Dao coming to an end!

Chapter 11 - Shooting A True Immortal
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial capital of
the Grand Xia. Within a palace hall inside the Skylight Palace that
glowed with a dull red light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Xia
Emperor was seated atop his throne. Beneath him were a trio of
generals, armored in dazzling golden armor. Their auras were
incredibly powerful, no weaker than the aura of the Xia Emperor
himself; clearly, they were Empyrean Gods or True Immortals! All
three of them sat with backs straight, filled with an aura of
desolation and slaughter. For the Primordial Imperial Clan…it was
quite simple for them to be able to summon and command Empyrean Gods
and True Immortals as they would ordinary soldiers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many images were
projected in midair; these were the battles images that were being
transmitted from many locations. The Xia Emperor had incredible
control over the world of the Grand Xia. Once there were any ripples
at the Celestial Immortal level, he would immediately find out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master
Xiamang, it seems this Seamless Gate really holds our Primordial
Imperial Clan in high regard; they’ve sent two thousand forces to
launch a simple probing attack. There are far too many places with
battles…there’s no way for you to find them all, one by one.”
One of the three, an old man with a fiery red beard, let out a loud
laugh. Flames appeared to be blazing within his eyes as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t have
enough Pure Yang treasures to keep an eye on two thousand different
battles at once,” the black-robed Xia Emperor said with a smile.
There were only a few hundred images in midair; this was his limit
with regards to how many places he could keep watch on at once.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the hundreds of
images, however…was of the battle at Stillwater City!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After all, Stillwater
City had an incredibly powerful figure, Celestial Immortal Unity, and
the monstrously talented Ji Ning, who had an awe-inspiring backer!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What formation are
those eighteen Celestial Immortals setting up? A Turtle-Snake
Formation?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Celestial Immortal
Unity is in danger!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them instantly
noticed what was happening in this battle. After all, part of those
two thousand battles were merely play-fights, while most of the rest
were probing attacks; only a very small number were assassination
attempts. The assassination attempts naturally drew their attention.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The Xia
Emperor’s face sank, but he continued to watch. He gave no orders
for now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The images showed how
Celestial Immortal Unity had become trapped within the Turtle-Snake
Formation. Suddenly…the faces of the Xia Emperor and his three
golden-armored generals all changed, because they saw a youth use a
divine ability to charge forward through the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?” The Xia
Emperor frowned. “Is he crazy?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is this person the
‘Ji Ning’ you’ve been paying attention to, young master
xiamang?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s a bit too
unwise, isn’t he?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three generals all
shook their heads slightly…but suddenly, their facial expressions
stiffened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the images, Ji
Ning’s sword-fingers suddenly expanded to become three thousand
meters long. They lashed through the skies like an enormous divine
sword, chopping down upon the Turtle-Snake Formation. The tough and
incomparably tenacious Turtle-Snake Formation was actually completely
shattered by this terrifying sword-finger attack. Caught completely
off guard, six of the eighteen Celestial Immortals perished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!” The Xia
Emperor jumped to his feet, a look of amazement in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Impossible.” The
three generals had stood up as well. They all stared unblinkingly at
the images.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the images, Ji
Ning had just used [Three Heads, Six Arms] and was chasing after and
massacring the fleeing Celestial Immortals. The Xia Emperor, in front
of these three generals, didn’t feel any need to maintain his
normal aura of dignified majesty. He said incredulously, “What’s
going on? I don’t know if Ji Ning’s Primaltwin has undergone the
tribulation yet, but his true body definitely has not.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If his true body had
succeeded in overcoming the Empyrean Tribulation, he would be an
Empyrean God by now. His divine abilities, spells, and other
abilities would all be far stronger than they are now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He clearly has not
yet overcome his tribulation to become an Empyrean God!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But if he isn’t an
Empyrean God…how could he be this powerful? Is it really possible
for a Void-level Fiendgod to be this powerful?” Countless thoughts
were rummaging through the Xia Emperor’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the three
generals, they were no less stunned than the Xia Emperor was. The
most muscular general actually began to frown. “A Void-level
Fiendgod…even if he learned some of the most supreme divine
abilities of the Three Realms, allowing him to become close to a Pure
Yang True Immortal in power…he should only be roughly equivalent to
Celestial Immortal Unity. How could he be this much more powerful
than Celestial Immortal Unity? The level of power he’s displayed
has completely transcended the gap between the Void-level and
Empyrean Gods.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a monster.”
The Xia Emperor stared at Ning, stared at him as though he was
looking at the most precious treasure that existed in the world. A
look of actual greed was in his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Congratulations,
young master Xiamang.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three generals
simultaneously spoke these words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Xia
Emperor chortled as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed, this was
something worth celebrating!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was born a member of
the Primordial Imperial Clan…and the greatest strength of the clan
was that they were extremely unified. The reason why the Imperial
Clan able to become the imperial clan of the Primordial Era was
precisely because they had a large number of True Gods and Daofathers
within their ranks….but clearly, these True Gods and Daofathers
couldn’t have all been born into the Imperial Clan. Why, then, did
all of them support the Primordial Imperial Clan?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was precisely
because the Primordial Imperial Clan had provided them with nonstop
support prior to them becoming truly powerful. Given that the
Primordial Imperial Clan had been so benevolent towards them…how
could the True Gods and Daofathers not wish to pay back their
kindnesses?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that the more powerful one was, the more one cared about one’s
Dao-heart, and the less willing one would become to feel indebted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If someone had treated
you with great kindness, but you refused to repay it…you would feel
discomfort. This would impact your Dao-heart; in fact, in extremely
dire cases, it could even cause you to go down a path of madness!
Naturally, there was a very small number of True Gods or Daofathers
who walked an extremely vile path; no matter how well you treated
them, they would still kill you without blinking, which wouldn’t
impact their Dao-heart at all. However, these people were quite rare,
after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning?” The Xia
Emperor’s eyes were shining. He now viewed Ning as a monster who
would truly be of benefit to him…and one who hadn’t even
undergone his tribulation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had the feeling…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That so long as Ji Ning
didn’t die, it wouldn’t be hard for him to become an Empyrean God
or True Immortal. In fact, he might even become one of the most
supreme Empyrean Gods or True Immortals! To be able to make someone
like this one of his closest allies…the Xia Emperor felt that this
was utterly wonderful! And of course, if by some great stroke of luck
Ji Ning became a True God or a Daofather, the Xia Emperor would bow
down to thank Heaven and Earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Why was the Xia
Emperor’s status so special? It was because, aside from the fact
that his master was a Daofather, his lifelong friend, his brother…was
Daofather Raindragon!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the end, a master
was just a teacher; he might provide some guidance to the Xia Emperor
and behave benevolently towards him, but if the Xia Emperor truly ran
into trouble, Daofather Crimsonbright might or might not actually
intervene to help him. In fact, even if Daofather Crimsonbright were
to watch the Xia Emperor died, it wouldn’t impact his Dao-heart;
after all, the Daofather had many disciples. In addition, it was his
disciples who owed him, not the other way around.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Daofather Raindragon,
however, was another story. Daofather Raindragon was one of the Xia
Emperor’s lifelong friends, his brother; this was a far closer
relationship!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, the Xia Emperor
was going to do everything he could to help Ji Ning and ensure that
Ji Ning would remember how kindly the Xia Emperor had treated him. In
the future, if the Xia Emperor encountered a crisis and asked Ji Ning
to help…how could Ji Ning possibly just sit back and watch with his
hands clasped behind his back?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a monster. From
the Primordial Era to the present day, this is the greatest monster
I’ve ever seen.” The black-robed Xia Emperor stared at the image
of Ji Ning. Although the Primordial Era had given birth to some true
monsters as well, the Xia Emperor hadn’t personally met them…but
right here and now, a real, living, breathing monster was standing
right in front of him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside Stillwater
City.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Gaudy had
a handsome face. He was famous for being a relaxed, graceful man…but
his face was twisted right now. This was because he had just saw that
little girl Violetgrass, who he had watched grow up, be killed before
his very eyes! As soon as he had sensed Violetgrass shattering her
talisman, he had immediately used Greater Teleportation to come to
this place. He had mastered the Grand Dao of Qiankun long ago, and so
he no longer needed to use Dao-talismans to perform Greater
Teleportation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, since he had
come here from another major world, he wasn’t able to perfectly
sense where Violetgrass was; he was only able to get a general idea
of where she was located.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His Greater
Teleportation had taken him outside Stillwater City. By relying on
his attunement to Qiankun and Space, he instantly found Violetgrass
and understood that she was in danger. He immediately broke apart the
grand sealing formation, but because he wasn’t able to make it
right away, he hurriedly sent a mental message to call for a halt.
Alas…the youth hadn’t hesitated at all. He had used all six arms
of his [Three Heads, Six Arms] technique to launch sword-fingers
attacks at Violetgrass and slay her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little sister
Violetgrass…” True Immortal Gaudy’s control over Qiankun was so
great that it was as though he personally watched it happen. It was
as though he personally watched Violetgrass be transformed into dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Gaudy’s
eyes instantly turned completely bloodshot, and his face began to
twist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of you will
DIE!” True Immortal Gaudy went completely berserk. An enormous
grand seal that was black and white suddenly appeared. This grand
seal was primarily black, while the sides of it were white. The grand
black-white seal appeared out of nowhere, instantly transforming to
be the size of a mountain as it smashed downwards. Although the local
protective formations were strong, True Immortal Gaudy had mastered
the Grand Dao of Qiankun and was skilled in formations. In addition,
he was simply too strong, far more so than his foes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The grand seal
completely smashed through the protective formations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On the other side.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, be
careful!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“An enemy has
arrived!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s broken the
sealing formation; it should be an Empyrean God or a True Immortal.”
Immortal Diancai, Yu Wei, and Unity all sent frantic mental messages.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and leave!”
Ning immediately understood; he had previously controlled the
formation as well, after all. Right as he killed Violetgrass, Ning
manifested a black greatbow in front of him. Stretching his hand out,
Ning grabbed the black greatbow with one hand. Within his other hand,
an arrow appeared, instantly blazing with flames as it did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In midair, Ning
immediately nocked the arrow, drew the Rahu Bow, then filled it with
his divine power. All of his power was cycled through it to converge
onto the arrow, with Ning’s heartforce included into the mix. The
method of applying heartforce through [Houyi’s Archery] was even
superior to Ning’s own self-developed methods; with Ning’s
current level heartforce, he could only sustain seven arrows at most.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">TWANG!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, the world
itself seemed to shake. A dazzling red light instantly tore through
the skies, and as it did so it continuously drew in the surrounding
natural energy of the world. This was the power of [Houyi’s
Archery]; it was a terrifying archery skill that could ravenously
draw in the might of Heaven and Earth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although both [Houyi’s
Archery] and the [Starseizing Hand] were ranked as the top ten divine
abilities to be created after Pangu established the universe…in raw
power, [Houyi’s Archery] surpassed the [Starseizing Hand]!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant black-white
seal came crashing down, smashing through everything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fiery arrow shot
through the skies like a blazing meteor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two collided. The
area around them completely blew apart! The earth below was suddenly
caved in; clearly, this was caused by the shockwave of the collision!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Immortal
Gaudy’s face changed slightly. Very, very few people in the Three
Realms used [Houyi’s Archery]. For example, although there were a
number of people under Patriarch Subhuti who did train in it, their
primary skills lay in other areas; they normally wouldn’t use
[Houyi’s Archery]. Thus, there were very, very few people who were
able to truly able to get a taste for how formidable [Houyi’s
Archery] was. Even Ji Ning had to first reach the third stage of
heartforce and perfect his control over it before he was able to
unleash [Houyi’s Archery] to this level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The collision with the
arrow caused the giant black-white seal to instantly grow slower.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twang! Ning once more
nocked his arrow, drew his bow, and sent off a shot that blazed
through the skies. Once more, this was a full-strength attack. Ning’s
heartforce was depleting at a terrifying pace, but he didn’t dare
allow the enemy’s attack to draw near him. After all, this was an
actual True Immortal. There were very few True Immortals who were
merely at the ‘base’ level of power for a True Immortal; most
were far more powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yet another blazing
comet shot through the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Gaudy
once more sent his giant black-white seal to crash downwards onto
that arrow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Twang! Twang! Twang!
Twang! Twang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five more consecutive
bowshots rang out, the power of the arrows preventing even the
utterly enraged True Immortal Gaudy from immediately catching and
slaughtering Ji Ning and his friends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s see how many
more arrows you have!” True Immortal Gaudy had a terrifying look in
his eyes. He knew that divine archers were generally only able to
launch a very low number of full-power shots. And indeed, after the
seventh arrow shot out, there was a pause. Now…there was nothing to
block the infuriated True Immortal Gaudy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The giant black-white
seal once more began to crush through the opposing formations,
smashing towards Ning and the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The whole reason why
Ning had unleashed those seven shots was to buy time to allow
Immortal Diancai, Yu Wei, and Celestial Immortal Unity to escape.
However…when they attempted to use a Greater Teleportation, they
realized that this region had been completely dimensionally severed
from the surrounding world. There was no way to use any sort of
teleportation here at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“None of you will be
able to escape. All of you will die.” True Immortal Gaudy was
filled with a towering killing intent. His giant black-white seal
once more came smashing downwards through the skies.

Chapter 12 - The Xia Emperor’s Attitude
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Redsnow, this
Pure Yang True Immortal is a master of the Grand Dao of Qiankun; I’d
like to ask the seven of you to help out!” Ji Ning’s Primaltwin
was frantically asking for succor. After learning that Ning was in
danger, Redsnow and the rest of the seven had already left their
world and come to the underwater estate. In truth, they hadn’t
expected that Ning would need to use up their promise so soon.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, when Ning had
shot out seven arrows earlier, he had also used his Void-level energy
to activate a Greater Teleportation Dao-seal; the amount of time he
had bought himself was more than enough to activate it, but alas the
teleport had failed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were many Grand
Daos in the world…but who would’ve thought that he would just so
happen to encounter a foe who had mastered the Grand Dao of Qiankun?
In the face of someone like this, not even Greater Teleportation
would be possible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.” Yu Wei looked towards Ning, worry on her face.
Immortal Diancai and Celestial Immortal Unity were panicking as well,
but there was nothing they could do.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Die.” True
Immortal Gaudy had a savage look on his face, and his eyes were
filled with murder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But right at this
moment…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, your savior
just arrived.” The giant yellow bear’s voice suddenly echoed
within Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the air between Ji
Ning and True Immortal Gaudy, a black tunnel suddenly appeared out of
nowhere. The black tunnel tore straight through space, allowing a man
in black imperial robes to step out of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Xia Emperor?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His Imperial
Majesty?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai, Yu
Wei, and Celestial Immortal Unity all revealed looks of excitement
and delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The man who had stepped
out of the black tunnel was indeed the black-robed Xia Emperor. As
the Xia Emperor walked out, he pointed with a single finger. A golden
streak of light flew out, transforming into a golden dragon that
knocked the giant black-white seal flying. He then gave the
demonically enraged True Immortal Gaudy a cold glance. “Gaudy, you
actually dare to come to my Grand Xia to cause trouble?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning let out a sigh of
relief.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Sorry for bothering
the seven of you just now.” Within the underwater estate, the
black-robed Ning was saluting respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby giant yellow
bear chortled. “Since the Xia Emperor has come out, there’s no
need to trouble the seven of you to intervene.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“…Does this count
as us fulfilling our promise?” The beautiful Empyrean God Snow
Scorpion asked teasingly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, of course not!”
Ning said frantically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Seeing the look on
Ning’s face, the seven Empyrean Gods roared with laughter.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Relax, we’re not
going to quibble with you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…Empyrean God
Redsnow quickly turned solemn. “However, Ji Ning, I have to warn
you; previously, while you were in the Primordial Ruinworld region,
your master, Patriarch Subhuti, didn’t have to worry too much about
personally intervening on your behalf. But now that we are back in
the Three Realms…in the face of such a powerful foe, even Patriarch
Subhuti might have misgivings. In fact, even if he does intervene, he
might not be able to rescue you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand.”
Ning nodded. He naturally understood that in the face of this storm,
even his master was treading on thin ice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In addition…your
master can’t have the [Dream of the Three Realms] active at all
times. Even if you are in danger, he might not know about it,”
Redsnow added.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was true.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His master hadn’t
given Ning a talisman; even if Ning was in a dangerous situation,
there was no way for him to notify his master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We promised to help
you once…but it really will be only once,” Empyrean God Redsnow
said. “Your master, in turn…well, distant waters cannot be used
to put out a nearby fire. Just look; you’ve only been back for a
short while, but you’ve already encountered such a dangerous
situation. You should understand, now…how careful you truly must be
in the face of this storm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded. “Since I
was able to survive and return even after being covered by karmic
sinflames…the Seamless Gate is undoubtedly paying very close
attention to me. They have long ago decided that I am a major foe for
them. In the face of this storm…to tell the truth, I came to
understand something. Since there’s no longer any way for me to
hide my sharpness, then I might as well reveal myself. I’ll make it
so that more experts notice me and feel that I am worthy of their
help!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although the
Seamless Gate is brash, they remain hidden in the darkness; this
means that they still have worries of their own. There are many
experts on the side of my master as well.” Ning laughed, “As long
as enough of us work together, there’s nothing for us to worry
about.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’re finally
using your head.” Redsnow said with a laugh, “If you have enough
helpers, then you won’t even need the seven of us to assist you;
you’ll still be able to survive this storm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Outside the underwater
estate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once the black-robed
Xia Emperor appeared, True Immortal Gaudy grew even angrier.
“Xiamang, are you going to stop me? Are you going to become my
enemy?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“By the looks of it,
you joined the Seamless Gate long ago. Since we are in different
camps…we already are enemies.” The black-robed Xia Emperor said
calmly, “As I see it…you need to f*ck off right now. Get the f*ck
out of my Grand Xia.” Although he held an absolute advantage in
terms of power, the Xia Emperor knew that this foe was a master of
the Grand Dao of Qiankun who possessed many powerful escaping
techniques.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Gaudy
took a deep breath. He didn’t want to make an enemy out of the Xia
Emperor; after all, the Xia Emperor was an astonishing figure with
tremendously powerful backers. The Xia Emperor possessed multiple
powerful Protocosmic spirit-treasures and was extremely famous. Just
now, he, Gaudy, had clearly severed this region from the surrounding
dimension…but the Xia Emperor had forcibly torn through space and
come through anyways. This was an ability that was similar to the
power of the Worldhold Pagoda. To be able to ignore a spatial
severing and forcibly tear a path to this place…clearly, the Xia
Emperor had just used one of his Protocosmic spirit-treasures, the
‘Brightheart Lamp of One Thought’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All I want to do is
kill that youth.” True Immortal Gaudy said coldly, “I can spare
the other three!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor gave
him a glance. “Get the f*ck out of my Grand Xia…IMMEDIATELY.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Was this a joke? The
whole reason he had come here was to protect Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…!” True
Immortal Gaudy was furious. “Xiamang, today, I’m going to see for
myself how powerful the descendants of the Primordial Imperial Clan
like you are!” Instantly, a series of golden chains appeared around
him. A total of nine golden chains appeared in total. One end of the
chains seemed to sink off into the void of space, while the other
wildly swept towards the Xia Emperor in a frenzied assault.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was his true
battle technique, a quiet, stealthy, insidious assault.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for that giant
black-white seal? It was faster to use the seal in attacking, and it
was also more overbearing and dominating. He had wanted to just use
it to smash open the protective formation and instantly crush Ning’s
group.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You dare put on a
show in front of me with techniques like this?” The black-robed Xia
Emperor let out a cold laugh. An enormous snow-white lotus appeared
beneath his feet, blooming in every direction. It completely took
over the surrounding area, blocking the nine insidious golden chains.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Annihilate.” The
Xia Emperor called this word out softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Last time, he had only
unleashed a single golden stream of light. This time, three golden
streams of light emerged, tearing through space and transforming into
three golden roving dragons. These three golden dragons each had
different auras; one of them seemed proud and brash, the second
seemed sinister and cold, while the third seemed kind and gentle, as
though it wasn’t a threat to anyone.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These three golden
auras, each bearing a different aura, caused the distant True
Immortal Gaudy to reveal a look of rage on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“From life to death,
all dreams vanish…everything is nothing but a garish, gaudy show!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Gaudy
coldly barked out these words. Instantly, those nine golden chains
around him began to weave about and dance. Space itself began to
tremble and ripple like water.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hiss….
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three golden
dragons now noticeably found it much harder to fly after entering
that region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The distant
black-robed Xia Emperor’s face turned grim. He waved his hand, and
a small clock appeared. As soon as this little black clock appeared…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Doooooong!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A crisp sound rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Gaudy
immediately vomited out a mouthful of fresh blood. Gritting his
teeth, he said, “Excellent. Excellent. Excellent! Xiamang, since
you are determined to protect this kid, then from this day forward,
we shall be irreconcilable enemies!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Just you?” The Xia
Emperor smirked in a very disdainful manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wait and see. This
brat will die. He definitely will die!” Savage madness was in True
Immortal Gaudy’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Gaudy
immediately used a fleeing technique. It was simply too hard to block
someone who had mastered the Grand Dao of Qiankun from fleeing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the Xia Emperor
was only able to stand there and watch as he fled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, your
Imperial Majesty.” Celestial Immortal Unity, Immortal Diancai, Yu
Wei, and Ji Ning both flew over and hurriedly expressed thanks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor turned.
He glanced at Ning and the other three, then said with a smile, “Good
to see you are unharmed. Just now, I was watching the battle here
through a magic treasure. When I saw Gaudy appear, I had a bad
feeling. I was planning to Greater Teleport here, but who would’ve
thought that he’d actually dimensionally sever this region off from
the surrounding world? There was no way to teleport in at all! I had
to forcibly tear a tunnel through space to come here. Fortunately, I
made it in time. If I was just slightly slower…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and the others
Ning now understood why the Xia Emperor had only managed to make it
here at the last moment. Things had gotten to the point where Ning
had already asked the seven Empyrean Gods to help out!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thankfully…he hadn’t
had to waste that promise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, you have to
be careful,” the Xia Emperor said. “Although I don’t why True
Immortal Gaudy wanted to kill you that badly, I imagine that one of
those Celestial Immortals you killed had a very close relationship
with him. That’s why True Immortal Gaudy, normally so graceful and
refined, went so berserk. If a Pure Yang True Immortal who has
mastered the Grand Dao of Qiankun wishes to kill you…it’s going
to be quite dangerous.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I understand,”
Ning said solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…the storm
is about to hit. Compared to the storm, this level of danger is
nothing.” The Xia Emperor continued, “The incoming tempest is
growing increasingly terrifying. Here is my talisman; if you
encounter any danger, just shatter it. As long as it isn’t a True
God or a Daofather, I’m confident in being able to save you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor, in
terms of power, was slightly weaker than Lu Dongbin…but he had
plenty of protective treasures, and so he would be able to stay alive
even in the face of an assault by a True God or Daofather for a
period of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, your
Imperial Majesty.” Ning immediately accepted the talisman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Make your
preparations.” The Xia Emperor raised his head to look at the sky.
“After this probing period…I imagine the war that is going to
sweep the entire Grand Xia shall finally begin. If you choose to
remain here, you won’t be able to avoid it.” After finishing his
words, the Xia Emperor took a single step forward, disappearing with
a void blink.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at the
talisman in his hand, revealing a slight smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he had thought.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although his earlier
battle against nine Youngflame clan Celestial Immortals had been
fairly impressive, in the eyes of the likes of the Xia Emperor or
Daofather Crimsonbright, he was still nothing more than a fairly
excellent genius of the Three Realms. This time, however, Ning had
truly showed his fierceness. Even in the Primordial Era, he would be
considered a true monster amongst the Void-level elites. Although
this would cause his enemies to be more wary of him, it also made the
Xia Emperor and Daofather Crimsonbright care more about him as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And now, he had the Xia
Emperor’s talisman in his hands, as well as the Xia Emperor’s
promise: “If you encounter any danger, just shatter it. As long as
it isn’t a True God or a Daofather, I’m confident in being able
to save you.” This had clearly spelled out the Xia Emperor’s
attitude towards him. It must be understood that not even Patriarch
Subhuti had ever said something like this to Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fifth World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a towering
palace. The Gatemaster of the Seamless Gate, the Hallmaster of
Bloodcloud Hall, and the Cavemaster of the Myriad Demons Cave were
all present.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“AZUREFOX!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enraged bellow could
be heard as True Immortal Gaudy charged in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gaudy.” The
azure-robed woman looked at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Azurefox, why didn’t
you intervene?! Just a moment…just one extra moment! That’s all I
needed to save little sister Violetgrass!” True Immortal Gaudy was
utterly enraged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-robed woman
just shook her head. “Violetgrass shattered the talismans that you
and I gave her. You’ve mastered the Grand Dao of Qiankun, but I
have not. Even if I did go, I would’ve been slower than you!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Gaudy
paused. Right. In his rage, he had forgotten this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going to kill
that brat.” A terrifying red light was glowing from True Immortal
Gaudy’s eyes as he said with rage, “I want him dead!”
</P>

Chapter 13 - Paying Respects To The Godking
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning killed
Violetgrass. I, too, want him dead.” The azure-robed woman said
calmly from atop her throne, “I’ll arrange for you to have the
chance you need to move against him. By relying on your mastery of
Qiankun, I’m sure you’ll be able to kill Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Did you really think
I’m as stupid as you seem to believe?” True Immortal Gaudy gave
the azure-robed woman cold look. “The Xia Emperor moved to protect
this brat; in fact, he even chose to ignore my threats. He clearly
has made up his mind to protect the brat. This time, you sent many
teams to attack many places throughout the entire world of the Grand
Xia. Although the Xia Emperor has True Immortals and Celestial
Immortals under his command, he had many places to worry about, and
so he wasn’t able to summon too much of his power to deal with me.
But if I were to make another move…his forces wouldn’t have to
worry about defending his various commanderies. They’d probably
join forces to trap me, then kill me!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Seamless Gate knew
all along that the Xia Emperor had other Empyrean Gods or True
Immortals by his side!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Primordial Imperial
Clan alone had sent three of them to follow the Xia Emperor. This was
one of the reasons why the Xia Emperor’s word was absolute law in
the Grand Xia! The likes of Kindwater clan had Empyrean Gods in their
ranks, and as a major clan that existed back in the Primordial Era,
they too had True Gods or Daofathers backing them! And yet, they
still did not dare to struggle with the Xia Emperor for supremacy.
This was why!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even the Youngflame
clan had one of the major clans of the Primordial Era behind them.
However, the Ancestor of the Youngflame clan, ‘Youngflame Freak’,
had fled from his own clan and refused to recognize the connection
between his clan and that primordial clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The supreme clans of
the world of the Grand Xia truly were not easy to deal with. If those
countless clans joined together, not even the Xia Emperor would dare
to try and suppress them all by force. He had to provide order for
and benefits to everybody, sharing the world with them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Xiamang clan
of the Xia Emperor…technically speaking, it was the most powerful
clan in the entire world of the Grand Xia! They would be more than
capable of annihilating a single True Immortal Gaudy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can you possibly
take revenge without taking on some risk?” The azure-robed woman
said, “Can it be that you are giving up on vengeance for
Violetgrass?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A cold light flashed
through True Immortal Gaudy’s eyes. Of course he wanted to kill Ji
Ning!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…everyone
capable of becoming a Pure Yang True Immortal was an extraordinary
figure. None of them were fools.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Violetgrass followed
you this entire time. You are in control of the full power of the
Seamless Gate. It would be much easier for you to kill Ji Ning than
it would be for me,” True Immortal Gaudy said coldly. “If you
really do provide a good opportunity for me to act, I won’t mind
taking it. But I absolutely have no intentions of trading my life for
that brat’s.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After speaking, True
Immortal Gaudy turned and left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only figures left
within the towering hall were the azure-robed woman and the two other
leaders. They all raised their heads, continuing to look at the
battle images being transmitted in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Xia Emperor
really has begun to send out his forces,” the azure-robed woman
laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He naturally isn’t
going to just watch as you kill his people,” the skinny elder said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time continued to pass.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The probing attacks of
the two thousand teams were carried out lightning-fast. They began
this night, and they quickly concluded as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The next day. The
Golden Crow once more rose into the sky. It was as though nothing had
happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, in reality,
the previous night the Seamless Gate had lost a total of sixty-nine
Celestial Immortals and hundreds of Loose Immortals. The world of the
Grand Xia had lost a total of seventy-three Celestial Immortals and
dozens of Loose Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On a superficial level,
the losses were equal. And in truth, this type of initial probing
attack would always result in the attacker sustaining some
casualties.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the biggest
mistake the Seamless Gate made this time…occurred with Ji Ning!
They had completely underestimated Ning’s strength, causing them to
lose eighteen supreme Celestial Immortals. This loss alone, in all
honesty, was worse than all their other losses combined. After all,
there was quite a large difference between an ordinary Celestial
Immortal and a supreme Celestial Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But of course…neither
the Xia Emperor nor the Seamless Gate were too concerned about their
losses from this exchange.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was just a probe,
after all, an initial clash. Both sides suffered only some
superficial losses; neither had sustained an actual injury. Their
most powerful forces hadn’t even moved! Only when the real war
began would they began to battle against each other. When that
happened…Celestial Immortals would be put through a meat grinder,
and even True Immortals and Empyrean Gods would fall if they were not
cautious. This was, after all, the most powerful world under the
command of Daofather Crimsonbright!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within that towering
palace in the Fifth World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The leaders of the
Seamless Gate, the Myriad Demons Cave, and Bloodcloud Hall had
gathered here once more. After finalizing orders to their
subordinates, they turned to the main topic of this meeting…Ji
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“As I see it, Ji Ning
has to die.” The man in the fiery red robes spoke in a booming
voice. “He’s already a source of trouble for us. Once he
overcomes his tribulation and becomes an Empyrean God…he won’t
just be a source of trouble. He might cause our entire campaign
against the Grand Xia to fail.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The skinny elder
sighed. “This person truly is too monstrous a genius, so monstrous
that even I’m a bit frightened by him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I agree that we need
to kill him,” the azure-robed woman said. “This Ji Ning is
protected by the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]; killing him won’t be that
easy. Our only choice is to first suppress and capture him, then come
up with a way to kill him. But while we move to suppress him…I’m
worried that his Daofather master will act.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The faces of the other
two leaders changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Gods,
Daofathers…the true rulers of the Three Realms. In addition,
someone who could teach the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] was definitely
one of the most supreme of Daofathers. The mere thought of such a
figure caused them to shudder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we send Empyrean
Gods and True Immortals to kill him, but they end up being killed by
the Daofather when he saves Ji Ning…we’d end up having ‘lost
both the wife and the soldiers’ 1, the worst of both worlds.” The
azure-robed woman sighed. “This is the most critical moment in our
campaign against the Grand Xia. It’s not wise for us to act on too
large a scale.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Azurefox, what do
you think we should do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other two both
looked at her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In terms of status, the
three were equal. However, generally speaking the ones in charge of
the Seamless Gate were more intelligent, which is why the Gatemaster
was the one chosen for the subjugation of the major worlds, with the
other two acting in a supporting role. If there were any internal
squabbles, a report would be made to the higher-ups!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I think…we should
report to this to the Godking!” The azure-robed woman said
solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Godking?” The
other two hesitated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The red-robed man said
with hesitating, “To bother the Godking for something like this…?
To ask the Godking for help?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although we can kill
Ji Ning if we are willing to pay a high price…the paying of that
price would have an impact on our ability to conduct the war against
the Grand Xia.” The azure-robed woman said, “Our only choice is
to report this to the Godking.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other two didn’t
oppose this proposal. In truth, Azurefox could’ve made the report
on her own; she was just letting them know as a form of respect. That
way, the three would work together in greater harmony; the Myriad
Demons Cave and the Bloodcloud Hall were extremely powerful as well,
after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a silent room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-robed woman
let a stick of incense. Instantly, the fragrance of the incense
filled the entire room. The azure-robed woman slowly closed her eyes,
sinking into a deep slumber.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a dream.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Azurefox appeared
within a vast, dark region. At the center of this region, a massive
throne that was more than thirty thousand meters long hovered in the
air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Godking,” Azurefox
called out reverently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a towering
figure suddenly appeared atop the massive, levitating throne. This
figure was dressed in black robes, but his eyes were like a mist that
was able to commune with one’s very soul. He stared downwards at
Azurefox, and she couldn’t help but shudder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” The
figure atop the massive throne lightly tapped the armrest with a
finger. A booming sound instantly rang out, reverberating throughout
the dark region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Godking, your
subordinate is on the verge of launching the attack against the Grand
Xia. However, a new variable has appeared within the Grand Xia
world…” Azurefox explained respectfully, “This variable will
have a major impact. If your subordinate was to use the power of the
Seamless Gate against it…it might negatively impact our mission of
subjugating the Grand Xia. Thus, I’ve come to ask you, Godking, to
decide for us.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Variable?” The
titanic figure once more tapped the armrest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s Ji Ning,”
Azurefox said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Him?” The towering
figure hesitated momentarily. “He just killed eighteen of your
Celestial Immortals. Mmm…from what happened in that battle, it can
be said that this Ji Ning truly is quite a monster. He’s actually
become so powerful despite being at the Void-level. There’s no way
he could’ve accomplished this just through divine abilities. His
sword-fingers…he hasn’t even mastered the Grand Dao of the
Sword…which means he must have mastered some sort of supremely
powerful energy. Swordforce? From the looks of that battle, he’s
only reached the first stage of swordforce. It must be some other
type of invisible power…heartforce? Taiji-force? Infiniforce?
Spaceforce?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The towering figure
pondered for a moment. “Your warning is a good one. I hadn’t
noticed that such a monster had appeared within the Grand Xia. By the
looks of it…he has at least a 50% chance of overcoming his
tribulation and becoming an Empyrean God! If he becomes an Empyrean
God, he’ll immediately become one of the most supreme of Empyrean
Gods. In fact, if he’s given a little time, he’ll be able to
reach Lu Dongbin’s level. He is indeed a potential source of
trouble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The supreme powers of
the Three Realms had a tacit understanding; if you didn’t
intervene, then I won’t either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an unspoken
agreement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both sides were
preparing…preparing to unleash everything at the critical moment of
the war, to fully suppress and crush their foes! Prior to this, at
most the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals would battle against each
other. The True Gods and the Daofathers would not casually intervene.
Thus…a supremely powerful Empyrean God could have an enormous
impact. In addition, such an Empyrean God would have a good chance of
making yet another breakthrough to become a True God!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…this Ji
Ning’s master is that old bastard, Subhuti. He’s not easy to deal
with,” the towering figure said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Patriarch Subhuti?”
Azurefox cried out in shock. Good heavens…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Patriarch Subhuti?!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although she knew that
Ji Ning had to have a very powerful Daofather behind him, given that
he had been taught the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art]…she had never
imagined that it would be that old freak Subhuti.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not even I can tell
exactly how powerful that old fellow is. During that war that
shattered Pangu’s World, he intervened to save some people, but he
didn’t truly participate. Still…he definitely is one of the
absolute most powerful Daofathers of the Three Realms. And…he has
multiple Daofathers amongst his disciples!” The towering figure
once more gently tapped at the armrest. Dong! Dong! Dong! Slow, deep
thudding sounds echoed throughout the dark region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Azurefox couldn’t
breathe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Multiple Daofathers?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She knew some secrets,
such as the fact that the mysterious ‘senior disciple’ under
Patriarch Subhuti’s command was definitely on the level of a True
God or Daofather. As for the others, she didn’t know about them.
But from what the Godking was saying…Patriarch Subhuti actually had
more than one Daofather under him! Still…even though she had
learned this, she wouldn’t dare to let this information slip. She
was completely devoted to the Godking, while the Godking was
all-knowing…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If she dared to betray
him in any way at all, the Godking would know right away! For
example, that battle against Ji Ning; with but a thought, the Godking
immediately had become aware of what had happened during it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Still…that old
fellow stands on the side of Nuwa!” The towering figure’s misty
gaze seemed to be as deep and vast as the infinite Void. “So we
might as well take this chance to kill one of his disciples and test
his reaction.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Azurefox listened
attentively.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Activate chess
piece…Yu Wei.” The towering figure said, “Have Yu Wei lead Ji
Ning in a Greater Teleport to come straight to the Fifth World. The
Fifth World is one of our major bases, and I’ll personally station
myself within it. In the Fifth World…even if Subhuti comes in
person, there will be nothing he can do.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yu Wei?” Azurefox
was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had quite a few
chess pieces positioned within the world of the Grand Xia. Prior to
this, Yu Wei hadn’t been an important one, but after taking
Patriarch Lu as her master and becoming a Celestial Immortal, she had
immediately become their most important piece. Logically speaking,
she could’ve been used to great effect in the future…but they
were now going to use her against Ji Ning. Clearly, in the eyes of
the Godking…trading Yu Wei for Ji Ning’s life was worth it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes,” Azurefox
said respectfully. She then vanished into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the darkness,
only the massive levitating throne and the towering figure atop it
were left. His left hand continued to gently tap against the armrest
of the throne. “Subhuti…I haven’t actually fought you yet…I’m
really rather looking forward to it…”

Chapter 14 - A Successful Plot
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fifth World. Within
a quiet room, filled with the fragrance of incense. The azure-robed
woman opened her eyes, awakening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Godking is
actually willing to use up the ‘Yu Wei’ chess piece.” Azurefox
mentally sighed to herself. She immediately tried to reach out, only
to frown: “Eh? Yu Wei isn’t sleeping yet?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The various chess
pieces had all been given an order that unless they were in the
middle of a life-and-death situation, they had to sleep at least once
every three days.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only when they were
asleep could these chess pieces be stealthily contacted! This form of
communication was extremely mysterious; not even True Gods or
Daofathers were able to detect it. There was a chance for every other
form of communication to be detected, and upon being detected, the
chess pieces would no longer be able to continue to hide themselves.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not sleeping…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Azurefox pondered for a
moment. “No rush. She has to sleep once within these three days.
Heh…I imagine that there is no way Ji Ning will be able to defend
against a plot by his Dao-companion. If he’s teleported straight to
the Fifth World, he’s dead. And hrm…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Azurefox’s eyes
suddenly lit up! “Before Ji Ning dies…there’s a use for him.”
Azurefox laughed. “Maybe we can use him to ensure that the
Youngflame clan irrevocably throws their support to the Seamless
Gate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That very night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the territory
controlled by the Youngflame clan. Patriarch Arcanum was meeting with
a golden-robed envoy at the peak of a tall, nameless mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Greetings to you,
Envoy.” Celestial Immortal Arcanum was extremely courteous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Give this to your
Ancestor.” The golden-robed envoy handed over a scroll.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is…?”
Arcanum was puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This scroll contains
a scryer recording within it. Once your Ancestor views it, he’ll
understand.” The golden-robed envoy laughed. “Our Seamless Gate
is doing this to help your Youngflame clan. Don’t end up being
wiped out without even knowing what’s going on.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After speaking, the
golden-robed envoy immediately disappeared through teleportation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Arcanum held the
scroll, a frown on his face. After humming for a moment, he
immediately opened it to take a look first. The unfurled scroll
revealed an image; it was indeed a scryer recording. Arcanum filled
it with his Immortal energy, and the images instantly began to move.
It was the scene of the eighteen Celestial Immortals battling
Celestial Immortal Unity, as well as the scene of them being slain by
Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is that…Celestial
Immortal Violetgrass?” Arcanum immediately recognized Violetgrass,
whom he had spoken with before a few times.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Those eighteen
Celestial Immortals are so powerful. They were actually able to
suppress Unity. Unity is going to die.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon seeing Ji Ning
strike, Arcanum was instantly, completely stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Good heavens…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…but…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning was far more
powerful than he had been during their last battle at the Oldjade
mountain range. Most likely, if all of the Celestial Immortals of the
Youngflame clan were to join forces, they still wouldn’t be able to
withstand Ji Ning again. Arcanum knew exactly how deep the feud was
between his clan and Ji Ning. Terrified, he immediately teleported
back in a hurry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the Worldhold
Pagoda.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” The
Youngflame Ancestor emerged from an illusory space, two other
Celestial Immortals following him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ancestor.” The
other four Celestial Immortals within the Worldhold Pagoda were
incomparably respectful to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven Celestial
Immortals of the Youngflame clan were all gathered together here!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ancestor, the
Seamless Gate sent this to us. Take a look.” Arcanum handed over
the scroll, a serious look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless Gate
never comes to our Youngflame clan with good news.” The Youngflame
Ancestor, Immortal Venomfreak, let out a cold laugh. He immediately
unfurled the scroll, then let out a chuckle. “Oh, a scryer
recording. Let me see what they are up to now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He filled it with his
Immortal energy, and instantly the scenes of that battle began to
replay.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eighteen Celestial
Immortals struck out in unison, suppressing Unity. Ji Ning attacked,
True Immortal Gaudy appeared, the Xia Emperor appeared and defeated
Gaudy…everything was included!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At first, Immortal
Venomfreak just watched with a half-smirk on his face, but his face
quickly began to change, becoming increasingly ugly to behold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So things really
have come to this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Venomfreak’s
pupils contracted slightly, his face turning as cold as ice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other six Celestial
Immortals present all looked towards Immortal Venomfreak, awaiting
his orders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I had thought that
the Xia Emperor would only stand behind Ji Ning after he overcame his
tribulation to become an Empyrean God. I didn’t imagine…that even
before becoming an Empyrean God, he would become such a monster. If I
was the Xia Emperor, I would stand behind Ji Ning as well.”
Immortal Venomfreak had a dark look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ancestor, what
should we do?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If Ji Ning comes…we
can’t stop him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ancestor.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all looked towards
their Ancestor, waiting for his orders.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ancestor was
someone who had roamed the world back in the era of Pangu’s World,
after all. Even many Empyrean Gods and True Immortals felt he was a
pain to deal with.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning won’t
launch a war against the Youngflame clan in the immediate future.”
Immortal Venomfreak continued, “That’s because he was hurt from
our last clash. He knows very well that I have many clones, and that
if he isn’t able to wipe them all out, I’ll continue to harass
him, becoming a nightmare for his clan.” Immortal Venomfreak’s
eyes flashed with a savage light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was a sinister,
insidious figure; he always had been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So we’re just
going to ignore this?” Patriarch Deadwood frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You stupid
blockhead,” Immortal Venomfreak snapped, “Didn’t you see how
astonishingly fast Ji Ning grows in power? He’s already so powerful
at the Void-level! I roamed the primordial world and have seen many
things…but I’ve never seen a monster like him before! In the
Primordial Era, only some of the most legendary of monsters might be
comparable to him. A monster like him…if he continues to grow like
this, he’ll definitely be given incredible power within the
Crimsonbright League. In the end, in the future, even I might be
unable to escape his reach…and once I die, the annihilation of the
Youngflame clan will be set in stone. We won’t even have a chance
to fight back.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Infatuation and the others all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me think about
this. Let me think.” Immortal Venomfreak’s eyes narrowed. “I
really didn’t expect it to come to this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was a very cautious
man. It was precisely because he was cautious, insidious, and crafty
that he had been able to survive for so long despite having offended
so many.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The other six Celestial
Immortals all waited quietly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Make the
arrangements right away for all the mortals of our Youngflame clan to
be moved into the world within the Worldhold Pagoda.” Suddenly,
Immortal Venomfreak began to give orders. “Trees die when uprooted,
but people can survive. If push comes to shove…we flee!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His greatest strength
had always been fleeing!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Evacuate all of
them?” The six Celestial Immortals were amazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“All of them.”
Immortal Venomfreak immediately ordered, “You have to be fast, as
fast as possible. I want you to complete this within the time needed
to boil a kettle of tea. If you don’t have enough time…it’s
fine if you end up missing or discarding some of the mortals.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The six
Celestial Immortals all assented hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Worldhold Pagoda
was a Protocosmic spirit-treasure with an entire world within it.
Although it wasn’t as vast as the major world within Ning’s
Starseizing Manor, it wasn’t small either. It would be easy to
contain thirty billion people within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Immortals
gave the orders, and the Loose Immortals handled things personally.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although all those who
had lived in the Oldjade mountain range had been wiped out, after Ji
Ning had been exiled to the Nihilum Zone, the Youngflame clan had
moved billions of more clansmen back to Oldjade.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Loose Immortals
moved with incredible speed. The Youngflame clan had nearly a
thousand Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals under their command, and
they all moved in unison. Within the time needed to boil a kettle of
tea, they really did evacuate all of the clansmen from their three
headquarters, moving them into the Worldhold Pagoda.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven Celestial
Immortals of the Worldhold Pagoda stared at the vast land outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was their fiefdom.
They had fought for this land, had bled for it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go. We’ll
have greater fiefs in the future, and our Youngflame clan will only
grow stronger.” Immortal Venomfreak flew out of the tower. Waving
his hand, he collected the Worldhold Pagoda, then disappeared into
thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That very night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial capital of
the Grand Xia. The Skylight Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Imperial
Majesty, Immortal Venomfreak asks for an audience,” a white-faced
elder said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor lifted
an eyebrow, a pensive look in his eyes. He then said, “Let him
come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” The
white-faced elder immediately departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He came quite
quickly…it seems the Seamless Gate is once more trying to seduce
him.” The Xia Emperor mused to himself, “When used correctly,
Youngflame Freak is a sharp weapon as well. However…when you harm
others, you harm yourself as well. He goes berserk too easily.” The
Xia Emperor knew very well that madness was bred into the bones of
Immortal Venomfreak; this was why the Xia Emperor had used his clan
and fiefs to tie Immortal Venomfreak down, giving Venomfreak
something to care about and thus a way to use him!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And how, by the look of
it…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Although Immortal
Venomfreak is useful…he can’t compare to Ji Ning.” The Xia
Emperor shook his head. “It seems I’m about to lose one of my
sharp weapons.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An ugly, horned
individual walked in from outside.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Imperial
Majesty.” The horned man was unusually respectful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Venomfreak.” The
Xia Emperor smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The horned man said
respectfully, “The Seamless Gate has been asking me to join them
this entire time, but I never have. Just now, they sent me a scroll
with a scryer recording within it, a recording of Ji Ning battling
and slaying eighteen Celestial Immortals. After seeing it…I
understand that Ji Ning is now extremely powerful. I want to resolve
my differences with him, with the two of us swearing oaths to the Dao
of the Heavens. Can we do this?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Resolve your
differences?” The Xia Emperor shook his head. “When Ji Ning was
weak, he still wanted to fight against you. Now that he is stronger
than you…how could he possibly be willing to accept peace?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Imperial
Majesty…are you going to stand with him?” The horned man said in
a low voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you go to kill
him, I won’t stop you. If he goes to kill you, I won’t stop him
either,” the Xia Emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The horned man laughed
coldly. “How could I possibly go kill him? Your Imperial Majesty…it
seems you’ve already made your choice. I already suspected it
before I came here…but I was holding on to a final strand of hope!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Venomfreak, you are
very intelligent…but I urge you not to join the Seamless Gate. If
you join the Seamless Gate…you will have made an enemy out of not
just myself and Daofather Crimsonbright, but also my entire
Primordial Imperial Clan and many other True Gods and Daofathers.”
The Xia Emperor continued, “You can leave now. I hope that you will
be able to survive this great storm.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m untalented in
other respects, but I’m skilled in survival.” The horned man
chuckled. “By not killing me, your Imperial Majesty, you let me
preserve an extra clone.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And then, chuckling, he
departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor watched
him leave. This clone of Youngflame Freak definitely wasn’t even
carrying a slightly decent treasure on him; he had come prepared to
die. The only reason he had come here today was to lay all his cards
out on the table…but alas, the Xia Emperor stood immovably by the
side of Ji Ning. The Xia Emperor couldn’t even be bothered to try
to lie to him about this, because he knew that Immortal Venomfreak
was so sly and crafty that there was no way to deceive him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seamless
Gate…they truly are seamless in their actions. There is no seam
they won’t penetrate through.” The Xia Emperor shook his head.
“Just like that, they deprived me of one of my sharp weapons.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Quietly, without any
sound or noise, the Youngflame clan vanished from the world of the
Grand Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fifth World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a towering
palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Immortal Venomfreak.
I’ve long heard of your illustrious name.” An azure-robed woman
was seated on her throne within the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Gatemaster of the
Seamless Gate…the countless marquises within the world of the Great
Xia who hear your name all tremble.” The horned man smiled.
Although the Xia Emperor had urged him against this, he knew that to
survive this storm, one had to be on a team. If he didn’t have
one…then he would probably become a target for both sides.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since that was the
case…he might as well join the other side right now, and even
assume a position of importance!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go get some rest,
Immortal Venomfreak. When the time comes for our battle against the
Grand Xia, you will have ample opportunity to display your might,”
the azure-robed woman laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then I’ll await
your orders, Gatemaster.” The horned man rose to his feet, then
smiled and departed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-robed woman
smiled as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She had just acquired a
ferocious general!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hm.” The
azure-robed woman mentally reached out for a moment. “Yu Wei…has
finally fallen asleep.” She immediately headed towards her private
room, planning to meet Yu Wei in her dreams.

</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a private room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-robed woman
lit a stick of incense. She was in a superb mood due to Youngflame
Freak throwing his support to her side, and so it took a while for
her to completely fall asleep.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within her dreams.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a wide, vast
prairie. A black-robed maiden materialized out of nowhere within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh? Why have…”
Yu Wei’s face changed. She immediately understood that she had been
guided to this place. As she swept it with her gaze, she saw the
distant azure-robed woman walking towards her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My respectful
greetings to you, Envoy,” Yu Wei immediately said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yu Wei, long time no
see.” The azure-robed woman smiled. “Your last mission was
completed perfectly. We have another mission for you now.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei’s heart
clenched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Her last mission…had
been the capture of Celestial Immortal Hunchmont. However, it hadn’t
been for her to carry out the actual capturing; all she had to do was
help out a bit to make it happen! That had been quite a simple
mission; Yu Wei had done only a few things, and there was no chance
of her status being revealed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Please instruct me,
Envoy,” Yu Wei said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The mission is
related to your Dao-companion, Ji Ning.” The azure-robed woman
carefully scrutinized Yu Wei for her reaction.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei’s heart
clenched yet again, but she didn’t ask anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Godking
commands,” the azure-robed woman said, “For you to bring Ji Ning
straight to the Fifth World through Greater Teleportation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve never been to
the Fifth World before,” Yu Wei said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Godking has long
ago informed you all of the locations of the three thousand major
worlds. There’s no need for you to teleport to a specific location;
any place within the Fifth World will do,” the azure-robed woman
said. “This will be very simple for you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei was silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She could do this, of
course; the Godking had given her this order, precisely because it
would be very easy for her to accomplish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She wasn’t willing to
do it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if she had to die,
she wouldn’t do it!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What are you going
to do?” Yu Wei asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That isn’t for you
to worry about,” the azure-robed woman snapped. “Does the Godking
need to explain his orders to you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I can’t do it.”
Yu Wei shook her head. Her voice was soft, but it was very resolute.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why can’t you do
it? You are Ji Ning’s Dao-companion; he trusts you absolutely. All
you have to do is say to him, ‘I’m going to take you somewhere;
once you get there, you’ll understand.’ A very simple phrase; Ji
Ning won’t suspect a thing. Lead him in a Greater Teleportation and
go to the Fifth World…and your mission will be completed,” the
azure-robed woman said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei immediately
said, “I’ve become apprenticed to Patriarch Lu. In the future,
I’ll have a chance to infiltrate the very core of the Daoist Path.
If I take Ji Ning to the Fifth World, I’ll be exposed!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once you are
exposed, you won’t have to hide any longer. You can openly and
honorably serve the Godking.” The azure-robed woman’s gaze turned
cold. “You’ve said a few too many things today. On account of the
fact that the target is your Dao-companion, I’ll pardon your
impudence this once, but I will not pardon it a second time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei gritted her
teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He is my
Dao-companion.” Yu Wei looked at the azure-robed woman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I know.” The
azure-robed woman looked back at her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s the most
important person in the world to me.” Yu Wei looked at her
steadily. “More important than even my own life.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-robed woman’s
gaze turned solemn. Frowning, she said, “Are you going to refuse?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei immediately
knelt down, prostrating herself and pressing her forehead down to the
ground with the utmost sincerity. “The Godking gave me a new life,
and I am absolutely devoted to the Godking. He can ask me to destroy
the Black-White College, to kill anyone in the entire world of the
Grand Xia, and I won’t hesitate. But Ji Ning is my Dao-companion. I
won’t harm him, not even if I have to die!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You actually dare to
disobey the commands of the Godking?” The azure-robed woman was
stunned. “You…you’ll be sent into the Infinity Hells, never to
be reborn again!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei just knelt
there, not saying another word.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-robed woman
stared at Yu Wei. “You should know what will happen if you disobey
the Godking. I’ll give you one last chance…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if you ask me a
hundred times, a thousand times…my answer remains the same.” Yu
Wei just knelt there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then…wait to be
brought into the Infinity Hells.” The azure-robed woman waved her
arm, then disappeared into thin air.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Yu Wei were
sleeping together on their bed. Although Immortals had no need for
slumber, it felt nice to sleep every so often, and it could release a
bit of the stress one felt. Even the most powerful of Immortals would
occasionally take a nap, and in fact some Immortals were so relaxed
that they might sleep for ten thousand years each time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly, Yu Wei’s
eyelids twitched slightly. She slowly opened her eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s finally
come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Pain was in Yu Wei’s
eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She had been terrified
of this day coming. She had thought that, upon becoming Patriarch
Lu’s disciple, that she had become more useful and that the Godking
wouldn’t order her to expose herself, allowing her to be together
with Ning for a longer period of time. But now, the Godking’s order
had come, after she had only spent half a year together with Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei gently pressed
her head against Ning’s chest, feeling the warmth coming from
Ning’s body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” Ning
woke up as well. He reached out to put his arm around Yu Wei; he
could sense that she seemed to be feeling quite weak and soft right
now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing. I had a bad
dream,” Yu Wei said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded gently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew that Yu Wei had
a tragic life in her past life, while in this life her parents had
died when she was young. She had most likely dreamt of something
unpleasant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It was just a dream.
Life is just going to get better and better for us.” Ning held Yu
Wei in his arms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. Better and
better.” Yu Wei smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-sister, you seem to be in quite a good mood. You’ve been
smiling all day long.” Ning released his Darknorth swords. His
slaughter of those Celestial Immortals had finally caused his three
Darknorth swords to have absorbed enough baleful auras to become
low-grade Pure Yang treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei put down her
platter of spirit-fruit and smiled. “I’m with you, and there’s
no one to bother us. We’re living in a lover’s paradise right
now; why can’t I smile?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning smiled as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A lover’s paradise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only two people
within this estate were himself and Yu Wei. Immortal Diancai was
quite discrete; he didn’t come bother them unless there was
something important. This was a world that belonged to just the two
of them; to refer to it as a ‘lover’s paradise’ wasn’t too
far off the mark.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, it would be
wonderful if we can always live such a relaxed, happy life. My most
cherished dream is of living a peaceful, calm life with my loved ones
until the end of time.” A hint of nostalgia appeared in Ning’s
eyes. “My father and my mother have both left me. But…I still
have you, senior apprentice-sister.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” Yu Wei
nodded gently. In her heart, however, she silently said to herself:
“Junior apprentice-brother, these might be our final days together.
I want to leave you with the most perfect of memories. I’m going to
smile, to laugh, to be happy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a dark region.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a towering,
thirty thousand meter throne, and a massive black-robed figure seated
upon it. He was gently tapping on his left armrest with his left arm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Below him was Yu Wei,
kneeling. Next to her was the azure-robed woman.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You’ve
disappointed me deeply.” The Godking’s voice echoed within the
entire region of darkness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei didn’t dare to
say a single word in her own defense.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…I know
that you feel very deep emotions towards this Ji Ning.” The Godking
sighed. “This word, ‘love’…there have been countless who have
been driven mad by it, even amongst Immortals and Fiends. I can
forgive you this time, and I will no longer give you any missions
pertaining to Ji Ning…but if you ever disobey me again, then you
shall go burn for all eternity within the Infinity Hells.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Godking.”
Yu Wei revealed an excited look on her face, while the nearby
azure-robed woman revealed a look of astonishment.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei had never
imagined that she was going to survive this disaster. After all, it
was simplicity itself for the Godking to slay her. The Godking had
imprinted her soul with his seal during her past life; with but a
single thought, he could tear her soul out and cast it into the
Infinity Hells. The Infinity Hells was an illusory place of damnation
which the Godking had constructed; souls cast into it would suffer
endless torment which would never come to an end. In fact…with but
a single thought, the Godking could shatter her soul and kill her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And yet, she felt
tremendous gratitude towards the Godking. It was the Godking who had
bestowed new life upon her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go then.” The
Godking waved his hand, and Yu Wei vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Godking.” The
azure-robed woman could no longer stay silent. She had followed the
Godking for far too long; this was completely different from how the
Godking usually did things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if we don’t
give her any missions related to Ji Ning, we can still use her to
unknowingly send him on the road to hell,” the Godking said. “In
addition…this chess piece, Yu Wei, remains very useful to us. I’ll
pardon her impudence, this once.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-robed woman’s
eyes gleamed. “The Godking is wise.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a private room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei opened her eyes,
unable to disguise the excitement within them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, junior apprentice-brother.” Yu Wei immediately
charged out of the still room, running towards the wide courtyard
outside. Within the courtyard, Ning was training with his Darknorth
swords. He wanted to master the Dao of the Sword as quickly as
possible! He could sense that he was on the path to full master of
the Dao; although his mastery of swordforce had only increased his
combat power by a small amount, he was now gaining insight into the
Dao of the Sword at a much faster pace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning turned
around, then laughed, “Senior apprentice-sister, I’m still
training. Is there something you need?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing.” Yu Wei
sat down, just staring at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She quickly recovered
from her state of excitement. She also quickly understood that even
though she didn’t have to act against Ning, she would still have to
carry out other missions against other people. In fact, due to her
connection against Patriarch Lu, she would now be sent to deal with
even more powerful figures. In short…sooner or later, she would
still be revealed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The day that she was
revealed would be the day when she would be forced to leave Ji
Ning…and in fact, might be the day of her death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That day will come,
no matter what…?” After this latest experience, Yu Wei became
even more reluctant to part with him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That very night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Yu Wei were
together in bed, sharing a pillow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.” Yu Wei was in Ning’s arms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm?” Ning looked
at her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s have a
baby,” Yu Wei said suddenly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Have a baby? Why?
The Three Realms are in a state of chaos; how can we possibly take
care of a baby right now?” Ning was startled. He was a Fiendgod,
while Yu Wei was a Celestial Immortal; it was very difficult for
Immortals and Fiendgods to conceive, but much easier for them to
prevent conception. All they had to do was use their elemental energy
or their divine power to prevent it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei looked at him.
“I want one. The Three Realms are in a state of chaos, as you said.
This way, even if one of us ends up dying, we’ll at least have a
child together.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can you say such
things?” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you die, do you
plan to leave me alone in this world?” Yu Wei asked. “You’ve
experienced so many dangerous events lately; I’m honestly terrified
right now. If you were gone…I wouldn’t be able to stay alive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning thought of
how he had been exiled to the Nihilum Zone, his heart turned soft. He
nodded. “Fine. If you want a baby, we’ll have a baby. But I’m a
Fiendgod, while you are a Celestial Immortal; it’s going to be very
hard for us to conceive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We still have to
give it a try,” Yu Wei said earnestly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Theeen…here I
come!” Ning chortled, then gently pulled Yu Wei’s gauzy clothes
off of her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was a dark, dreamy
night. Ning felt as though he was intoxicated by bliss…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whether it was due to
sheer luck or whether it was because someone was looking out for
them…on the third month of their attempts, Yu Wei, a Celestial
Immortal, became pregnant by Ji Ning, a Fiendgod.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After becoming
pregnant, Yu Wei spent every day just sitting there, stroking her
belly, beaming as she watched Ning train with the sword. In truth,
there was no swelling whatsoever in Yu Wei’s belly at this point in
time, but she still liked to stroke her belly…because she was
caressing the child of herself and Ji Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning completely
immersed himself within swordplay, but whenever he paused, he would
turn to beam merrily at Yu Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Every time he did, he
would feel very warm, very happy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It had been so long…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ever since his parents
had passed on…it had been so long since he had felt such warmth.
This was an intoxicating warmth, one which filled him with vigor! In
the future, after his child was born, the two of them would play with
the baby together. Those days would be even more blissful, right?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Ning suddenly
ceased his training.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What is it?” Yu
Wei, was had been eating some spirit-fruit, couldn’t help but pause
and query him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Primaltwin has
perfected its mastery over heartforce.” An excited look was in
Ning’s eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then…are you going
to have your Primaltwin attempt the Celestial Tribulation?” Yu Wei
was stunned.
</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning nodded lightly.
“It should be time to undergo the tribulation. However, prior to
doing so…I want to make a trip back to Swallow Mountain. You can
think of this as a way to calm myself prior to the tribulation.
Honestly, as I see it…in my Celestial Tribulation, I expect the
wind tribulation, fire tribulation, and thunder tribulations to be
comparatively easy to deal with, while the demonheart tribulation
will be the toughest.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had karmic sinflames
covering him, after all; the demonheart tribulation would probably be
truly terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” Yu Wei
was somewhat worried as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Give Master a head’s
up. We’re going back to Swallow Mountain today,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Whatever you say,”
Yu Wei said with a smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That very day, Ning and
Yu Wei returned to Swallow Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swallow Mountain.
Serpentwing Lake. Brightheart Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ah!? Master, you…you
are actually having a baby with Rainbowflame? And you didn’t tell
me?! You didn’t tell me something as important as this?! You’re
breaking my heart! Wowowow!” Little Qing stared at Yu Wei’s
belly, utterly excited. “Master, let your child be my disciple,
alright?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You? Based on what?
Don’t even think about leading that poor child astray.” The
nearby Uncle White chortled merrily while seated. He was actually the
happiest one of them all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An heir!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning had an heir!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If my big brother and
my sister-in-law were still alive…I can’t even imagine how happy
they would be right now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior
apprentice-brother, I insist on being godfather to your child.” Mu
Northson was similarly unable to disguise his joy and eagerness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine. However, as
his godfather, you need to prepare some quality gifts. As a
grandmaster of constructs…you absolutely have to bring out some
particularly nice things.” Ning laughed. Giving his junior
apprentice-brother something to care about was a wonderful thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stop just chatting.
Quick, all of you, sit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The door swung open,
and Autumn Leaf walked in carrying a platter of sumptuous foods.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone was gathered
here together, eating, drinking, and joking around.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart grew
increasingly calm, increasingly peaceful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For some inexplicable
reason, he wanted to come back before his Celestial Tribulation.
Aside from meeting with these familiar faces…he wanted to see
Serpentwing Lake.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A boat was drifting
about on the surface of Serpentwing Lake. Ji Ning lay within it,
sleeping by himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Mist gathered in the
area around him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eventually, Ning sat
up. He stretched out with his hand, gently gliding it through the
water beneath the boat. He said softly, “Father, Mother…when you
were alive, you had always hoped that my name would be known
throughout the world. And now…your child has accomplished it! In
fact, your child’s name is now known even in other major worlds.
And now, in a few days, your child shall undergo the Celestial
Tribulation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your child swears
this…I will definitely become a True God and a Daofather. I’ll
stand at the very peak of the Three Realms…and at that point in
time, I’ll see you again. I’ll tell you all of these things in
person. As for this tribulation…it’s be nothing more a small wave
before the great storm to come.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was as though Ji
Ning was engaging in idle banter with his family members. He just
glided his hand through the water as he spoke. His voice, however,
contained a decisiveness and an ambition that would cause the faces
of those who heard it to change.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A beautiful gorge, with
many palaces built within it, as well as many flowers, trees, and
other forms of vegetation. It was as beautiful as paradise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Two supremely lovely
Immortal maidens who were even more astonishingly beautiful than Yu
Wei were walking through it, shoulder-by-shoulder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of them was dressed
in green, while the other was dressed in gray.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The peerless fairy
maiden dressed in gray sackcloth clothes was walking barefoot. The
gray clothes covering her were completely unable to disguise her
beauty; in fact, they gave her a spiritual aura that it seem as
though she transcended the mortal world. Countles male Immortals and
Fiends would go mad just looking at her. She was the leader of the
Seven Female Immortals of the Hundred Tombs Mountain, ‘Fairy
Deadgrass’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Hundred Tombs
Mountain, a place within the Heaven Realm where spiritual energy
gathered in abundance. In the Primordial Era, it used to be a place
where many of the most powerful deceased Fiendgods would be buried,
which was why it was known as the ‘Hundred Tombs Mountain’.
However, because so many powerful Fiendgods had been buried there,
the place had become even more mysterious. Many flowers and trees had
grown in that place, many of which possessed spiritual qualities. In
fact, some of them spontaneously trained in cultivation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was incredibly
difficult for flowers and plants to train in cultivation; since they
all came from the Hundred Tombs Mountain, they were naturally an
extremely unified group.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After they were able to
take human form, they all appeared as women.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Hundred Tombs
Mountain had many Loose Immortals and Earth Immortals, as well as six
Celestial Immortals and one Pure Yang True Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Of those maidens…Fairy
Deadgrass was the Pure Yang True Immortal! She was originally a blade
of grass that looked dry and withered, but that blade of grass was
incredibly marvelous; no other flowers or types of vegetation were
able to survive at all within a very large region around her. After
taking human form as an Earth Immortal, she had been able to
effortlessly overcome her Celestial Tribulation, becoming the number
one Celestial Immortal of the Hundred Tombs Mountain. She was
extremely reserved, and the more one interacted with her, the more
intoxicated one would feel. In fact, even the Celestial Emperor of
the Three Realms had been smitten by her. He had wanted to sneak in
to court her, but who would’ve thought that upon entering the
Hundred Tombs Mountain, the Celestial Emperor would have been
physically kicked out, a single word echoing throughout the entire
Heaven Realm:
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“SCRAM!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Emperor
had slunk away in disgrace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After that, many in the
Three Realms began to hypothesize that Fairy Deadgrass had to have a
True God or Daofather behind her. However…given that Fairy
Deadgrass was arguably one of the most peerless beauties of the
entire Three Realms, it wasn’t strange for her to have attracted
the attention of a True God or a Daofather.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder sister.” The
green-robed fairy maiden’s eyes glistened with tears. “Little
sister Violetgrass died such a miserable death. She was just a little
girl, but that ‘Ji Ning’ showed her no mercy at all. My husband
went all-out to defend her, and even sent a mental message ordering
him to stop…but Ji Ning still killed little sister Violetgrass.
Elder sister…you have to take revenge for her!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A cold light flashed
through the eyes of Fairy Deadgrass. She said calmly, “We Seven
Female Immortals of the Hundred Tombs Mountain…we aren’t killed
so easily. Who is this Ji Ning, and where does he come from? Your
husband, True Immortal Gaudy, is quite powerful; could it be that
even he was unable to kill him?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Ji Ning is
merely a Void-level Fiendgod; he hasn’t even overcome his
tribulation,” the green-robed woman said. “However, he is
extremely powerful; although he is merely a Void-level Fiendgod, he
was able to block my husband for a period of time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He blocked Gaudy?”
Fairy Deadgrass was startled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a tremendous
difference in power between Celestial Immortals and True Immortals.
To block a True Immortal…only the rarest and most monstrously
talented Celestial Immortals of the Three Realms were capable of such
a thing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“According to what my
husband said, although he wanted to kill Ji Ning very much, Ji Ning’s
power has indeed reached the threshold of Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals,” the green-robed woman said. “In addition, the Xia
Emperor of the Grand Xia insisted on protecting Ji Ning. And…a True
God or Daofather master stands behind Ji Ning! Right; I forgot to
tell you this, but this Ji Ning has trained in the [Eight-Nine Arcane
Art] as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fairy Deadgrass’ body
stiffened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Understood.” Fairy
Deadgrass stood there pensively.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The green-robed fairy
maiden stood next to her, waiting impatiently.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She knew very well that
her elder sister was capable of many things; naturally, she was
hoping that her elder sister would help out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Elder sister?” The
green-robed fairy maiden called out softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Seven Female
Immortals of the Hundred Tombs Mountain…Violetgrass was the
youngest, and she had always followed you. I only met her a few times
after she overcame her tribulation to become a Celestial Immortal.
Although there isn’t much of a relationship between us…no matter
what, she came from our Hundred Tombs Mountain. If memory serves,
after she left you, she went to follow Azurefox, right?” Fairy
Deadgrass said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The
green-robed woman nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll go meet
Azurefox tomorrow,” Fairy Deadgrass said calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were many female
Immortals in the Hundred Tombs Mountain, including a large group of
Earth Immortals and Loose Immortals. Due to the Three Calamities and
Nine Tribulations, most found it hard to live for more than a million
years. Thus, the earliest ones who were born, such as Fairy
Deadgrass, didn’t have much of a connection to the latecomers; they
only had close connections to the others who were also born early on.
Violetgrass was one of the latecomers; she had first followed many
powerful figures, but had actually been lucky enough to ecome a
Celestial Immortal. If it weren’t for that, Fairy Deadgrass
probably wouldn’t even remember who she was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Fifth World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within that towering
palace, the Gatemaster of the Seamless Gate, ‘Azurefox’, was
accompanying her guest, Fairy Deadgrass.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little sister
Deadgrass, I’ve already told you the full details to this story.”
Gatemaster Azurefox shook her head. “To tell you the truth…our
Seamless Gate wants to kill Ji Ning more badly than any of you do. If
he doesn’t die, then he will become a dangerous variable that will
impact our plans to subjugate the Grand Xia. He already has the power
to impact the situation right now, much less in the future when he
grows more powerful. Thus, the earlier we kill him, the better.
However, I haven’t been able to find a good opportunity to do this.
After all, he’s very tough to kill, with the [Eight-Nine Arcane
Art] protecting him. And once we fail in killing him…the Immortals
that we send to deal with him might end up being killed by the figure
standing behind him.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fairy Deadgrass
frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She was an incredibly
proud figure…but there was no way she would blindly rush into
danger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Azurefox.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enraged bellow rang
out, and a long-haired man came storming in with a terrifying look in
his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blackheaven.”
Gatemaster Azurefox and Fairy Deadgrass both watched him enter. He
was one of the marvels amongst the countless Celestial Immortals of
the Three Realms, Celestial Immortal Blackheaven. From the Primordial
Era to the current era, no one had ever been able to determine for
sure exactly how powerful Celestial Immortal Blackheaven was.
However, what they did find out suggested that he was most likely
just as powerful as a supreme Celestial Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…when he engaged
in fights, he often used many strange, heterodox techniques that
caused even Empyrean Gods and True Immortals problems! For example,
when True Immortal Gaudy had gone to kill Ji Ning, Ji Ning had been
able to use his archery to block him. Celestial Immortal Blackheaven,
however…he would’ve been able to rely on his heterodox techniques
to escape. Thus, the Empyrean Gods and True Immortals of the Three
Realms treated him as they would an equal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Violetgrass DIED?!
You, the ‘exalted Gatemaster of the Seamless Gate’…why the hell
didn’t you help take care of her? Do you remember the words you
told me, back then?!” Celestial Immortal Blackheaven was livid. He
would never forget that little girl who had just started to take
human form, and who had followed him around addressing him as ‘old
geezer’. He had always beamed merrily towards that little girl.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I was unable to do
anything. I couldn’t make it in time.” Gatemaster Azurefox shook
her head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” A cold
light flashed through Blackheaven’s eyes. “The Godking has three
hundred Seamless Gates under his command. If you can’t even protect
one of your maids, do you really think you are worthy of being one of
the Gatemasters?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blackheaven, you go
too far!” A dark, cold light flashed through Azurefox’s eyes as
well, and her azure hair began to float upwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I go too far? You’re
the one who went too far by letting Violetgrass die. I taught her
step-by-step, helping her establish her foundation, so that she could
quickly become a Celestial Immortal, and a supreme one at that! I
never imagined that…damn. You letting her take on missions was one
thing, but you actually let her take on such a terrifyingly dangerous
mission?” Blackheaven was truly enraged.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That stupid kid…she
didn’t break the talisman I gave her.” A hint of tears could be
seen in Blackheaven’s eyes, but the tears quickly vanished.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven felt such regret.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had roamed the Three
Realms for his entire life, living in a carefree manner from the
Primordial Era to the present day. He rarely came to truly care for
someone, but he ended up treating that silly little girl who thought
herself to be supremely clever as one of his own children. Who
would’ve thought that they would’ve ended up being parted by
death so soon?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, when
Violetgrass had been at the verge of death, she had thought of
Celestial Immortal Blackheaven.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Long ago, Blackheaven
had pounded his own chest and boasted proudly, “If there’s
anything you need, come find me! I’ll give you three promises to
accomplish three tasks for you. No matter how major the task is, I’ll
be able to accomplish it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Keep bragging, old
geezer. You are just a Celestial Immortal, and you claim to be able
to accomplish anything, no matter how major?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackheaven had just
smiled, not taking her seriously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But he had
forgotten…that when Violetgrass was in a truly dangerous situation,
such as when she had seen how powerful Ji Ning was, how would she
possibly dare to break the talisman he had given her? She was afraid;
afraid that Blackheaven would’ve thrown his life away as well.
Thus, the two talismans she had shattered belonged to True Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Gatemaster
Azurefox’s gaze flashed past Celestial Immortal Blackheaven. She
let out an angry snort, then said, “I made a mistake. I wasn’t
able to protect Violetgrass. This time…I’m not going to quibble
with you over this.” Gatemaster Azurefox was one of the most loyal
followers of the Godking, and so she knew very well that of the
powers on her side, Celestial Immortal Blackheaven, a mere Celestial
Immortal, was behaving in a far too relaxed and unrestricted manner.
This relaxed manner caused Gatemaster Azurefox to feel as though
something was off. This was why she swallowed her anger, unwilling to
truly make an enemy out of Blackheaven right now.
</P>

<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="Chapter_17___Ji_Ning_Requests_An"></A>
Chapter 17 - Ji Ning Requests An Audience
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In all honesty,
Gatemaster Azurefox couldn’t be blamed for this matter. All the
members of the Seamless Gate were risking their lives in their
ventures; when the time came, even the Gatemaster herself would go
into battle! This battle against Celestial Immortal Unity wasn’t
that dangerous a mission either; Violetgrass had only died due to bad
luck. The Three Realms were being rocked by a storm; who would dare
say for certain that one person would definitely survive?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, Gatemaster
Azurefox could tell that Celestial Immortal Blackheaven was truly
enraged, and so she didn’t bother to explain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackheaven was on
their side. Logically speaking, as a Celestial Immortal, he should be
forced to obey the orders that came from his superiors. Only major
powers, those linked to major powers like Fairy Deadgrass, and the
most supreme of Empyrean Gods and True Immortals were able to left
alone to their own devices without being assigned any missions.
Blackheaven, however, was also left alone and unburdened. This was
truly quite strange, and this caused many of their Celestial
Immortals to address him reverently as ‘Exalted Immortal
Blackheaven’. This also caused Gatemaster Azurefox to feel some
nervousness. For an inexplicable reason, she felt as though if she
were to truly go fight against Blackheaven, the results would
be…poor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Blackheaven, don’t
blame Azurefox. She had no idea that Ji Ning was this much of a
monster.” The nearby Fairy Deadgrass sighed. “When I learned that
Violetgrass had died, I immediately rushed over here. I imagine that
you, too, came here for the purpose of getting vengeance for her,
Blackheaven. Azurefox, as the Gatemaster of her Seamless Gate, wants
to kill Ji Ning more than any of us. We all share a common goal, to
kill Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning…of course
we have to kill him,” Blackheaven growled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if only for the
sake of our subjugation of the Grand Xia alone, Ji Ning must die.”
Gatemaster Azurefox hurriedly agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How to kill him?”
Blackheaven asked, “If he could be easily killed, Gaudy would’ve
killed him long ago. He’s currently within the world of the Grand
Xia. That’s the territory of the Xia Emperor. Both of you know
exactly how deep the Xia Emperor’s roots are…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, they didn’t
care as much about the Daofather behind Ji NIng. If they were truly
worried, they wouldn’t even dare to say the word ‘kill’. The
reason why they weren’t afraid was because the Three Realms were
now divided into two major opposing camps. These two camps had come
to a common agreement; the major powers were not to casually
intervene, because if they did, the other side would probably release
even more and even more powerful major powers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Xia Emperor’s
roots go deep. If we don’t go all out against him…there’s no
way we’ll have a chance to kill Ji Ning,” Gatemaster Azurefox
said. “The price of doing that, however, is too great. The best
plan of action right now is to have the marquises of the Grand Xia
assault the Xia Emperor first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was what the
Seamless Gate usually did.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They would recruit some
of the marquises, then use them to assault the other marquises. A
full frontal assault…if the Seamless Gate truly had enough of an
advantage to carry out such an assault, why would they have worked so
furtively all these years? They would’ve forcibly swept through and
conquered the Three Realms long ago. However…clearly, the Seamless
Gate wasn’t that powerful yet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven, Gatemaster Azurefox, and Fairy Deadgrass couldn’t come
up with any ideas for acting against Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as Blackheaven was
about to turn and leave with a belly full of fire…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Eh?” Gatemaster
Azurefox suddenly rose to her feet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Puzzled, Blackheaven
gave her a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fairy Deadgrass was
puzzled as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our chance just
came.” Azurefox revealed a smile as she looked towards Fairy
Deadgrass and Blackheaven. “Our chance to kill Ji Ning just came.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s the
chance?” Fairy Deadgrass was puzzled, while Blackheaven immediately
went to the point.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Azurefox smiled. “I
just received word that Ji Ning is about to undergo his tribulation.
It should be his Primaltwin that is going to undergo the Celestial
Tribulation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tribulation?”
Fairy Deadgrass and Celestial Immortal Blackheaven were both
surprised…and then both revealed looks of delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is indeed a
wonderful opportunity.” Fairy Deadgrass laughed as well. “Once
his tribulation begins, especially when the final demonheart
tribulation begins…since a Primaltwin shares the same memories and
thoughts with the true body, the true body will also be trapped in
the demonheart world. Ji Ning will be at his weakest; he won’t be
able to fight back at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. He’ll be
unable to fight back, and the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art] will be useless
against the demonheart tribulation.” Blackheaven revealed a look of
delight.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-robed woman
felt quite excited for this stroke of luck.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was incredibly hard
to subjugate a major world. One had to remove multiple impediments,
and Ji Ning had become one such impediment that she had to resolve.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That very day, True
Immortal Gaudy, Fairy Deadgrass, Celestial Immortal Blackheaven,
Immortal Venomfreak, and the three leaders of the Seamless Gate, the
Myriad Demons Cave, and Bloodcloud Hall gathered together for a
meeting.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ll primarily be
relying on you this time, Exalted Immortals.” Immortal Venomfreak
had a very humble attitude, and his ingratiating smile caused his
ugly face to look even more savage. “If there’s anything you need
me, Venomfreak, to carry out, just tell me. I’m prepared to give my
life up over there if needed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Life?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The others all
chuckled. Immortal Venomfreak’s ‘life’ was spent cheaply; he
had already died countless times! There was no value in killing his
clones.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll bring six of
my aberrations as well. I’ve been nurturing them since the
Primordial Era, and they are amongst the most powerful of my
children.” Immortal Venomfreak had a delighted look on his face,
and the other Immortals present all nodded and smiled. Immortal
Venomfreak had many clones spread throughout the universe, and was
quite famous within the Three Realms for his abilities in cultivating
venomous bug-aberrations. All of them were thick and muscular, and
could be used in many ways.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“When we go to the
Grand Xia, we are all risking our lives,” Fairy Deadgrass said.
“I’m only going to have one of my incarnations to go.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right. I’ll send
an incarnation as well, and it’ll carry some of my powerful magic
treasures. It should have a tenth of my full power,” True Immortal
Gaudy said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven let out a cold snort.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…even though
he wanted to take revenge for Violetgrass more than anyone else, he
too was merely going to send a clone over. This was because his
specialties lay in his varied, heterodox skills; it didn’t make too
much of a difference whether he sent his true body or if he sent his
clone. However, when True Immortal Gaudy and Fairy Deadgrass sent
over their incarnations, those incarnations would most likely only
have at most a tenth of their full power, no matter how powerful
those clones were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their incarnations and
clones were created through Celestial Immortal techniques; if they
died, it wouldn’t impact their strength that much. Their true
bodies, however, could not die; they would truly perish if their true
bodies were slain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Venomfreak was
different. In truth, he didn’t even really have a ‘true body’;
he had many clones, each of which could be considered his ‘true
body’. Thus, one had to wipe out all of his clones before he would
die; otherwise, if so much as a single clone survived, he would be
able to quickly recover.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Seamless Gate
shall send the clones of two Empyrean Gods as well,” the
azure-robed woman said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our Bloodcloud Hall
will send out a team of Hellsworn,” the skinny elder said with a
smile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I will provide a
construct to that team of Hellsworn,” the fire-robed man said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The addition of these
three organizations had caused the power of this team to increase
significantly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now…the only
question is, where is Ji Ning undergoing his tribulation,”
Blackheaven mused softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If he ends up
running to the Daofather master behind him, there will be nothing we
can do. Otherwise…even if though Xia Emperor is protecting him,
during the tribulation itself Ji Ning will be helpless. We only need
a short period of time to kill him when we attack.” Azurefox said
confidently, “Celestial Immortal Blackheaven’s ‘Yin-Yang Arcane
Ki Bottle’ will be able to kill Ji Ning effortlessly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackheaven nodded.
“I’ll bring the Yin-Yang Arcane Ki Bottle, of course.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The others couldn’t
help but give Blackheaven a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackheaven really did
have far too many treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some were Protocosmic
spirit-treasures, while others were rather unique treasures with
extraordinary powers. Once, Blackheaven had set up a trap that caused
an Empyrean God of the Celestial Court to accidentally become
ensnared within the Yin-Yang Arcane Ki Bottle. He had nearly died
within that battle, and in the end had only survived because their
respective major powers had negotiated, resulting in that Empyrean
God being released.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The imperial capital of
the Grand Xia. The Skylight Palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Imperial Majesty, Ji
Ning requests an audience,” the white-faced elder said
respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning? Let him
enter.” The black-robed Xia Emperor, seated in the lotus position
atop his jade bed, opened his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, a youth entered
the room.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Imperial Majesty.”
Ning saluted respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, why have
you come to speak to me in the middle of the night?” The Xia
Emperor laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning said, “To be
honest, there’s something I would ask of you, your Imperial
Majesty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” The Xia
Emperor listened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nine days from now,
I’m preparing to have my Primaltwin undergo the Celestial
Tribulation,” Ning said. “However…I imagine that the Seamless
Gate has had their sights set on me for quite some time now, and they
seem to have perfect knowledge regarding the location of every
Void-level individual’s tribulation. I believe that no matter how
careful I am, they will still be able to find out where my
tribulation is. During the tribulation, when the demonheart
tribulation begins, even my true body will be unable to fight back. I
will be at my weakest at this period of time, and the Seamless Gate
definitely won’t give up that opportunity. Thus…I’ve come to
ask you to help, your Imperial Majesty.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor
laughed. “Haha, don’t worry about this. Undergoing the Celestial
Tribulation is an important matter; I’ll naturally protect you with
all my might.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In truth, Ning felt
rather resigned. Unless his master, Patriarch Subhuti, actively
reached out to him, there was no way for Ning to contact him, much
less return to the world of the Crescent. If that wasn’t the case,
he would’ve returned to the Crescent world for his tribulation,
which would’ve been much safer. After all, the other major powers
were unable to even locate the Crescent world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Starseizing world
left behind by Daoist Threelives was also very safe, but until he was
acknowledged as the true heir, he wouldn’t be able to enter at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And so, in the end, he
had come to ask the Xia Emperor for help.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the reasons why
Ji Ning had revealed his sharpness last time was for this.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…it
probably won’t be enough for me to guard you during your
tribulation.” The Xia Emperor frowned. “When you undergo your
tribulation, you will be completely defenseless. Although the
Seamless Gate won’t be strong enough to defeat me…they still
might be capable of some other tricks, such as tearing through space
to arrive at your tribulation area, resisting my forces for a short
period of time, then killing you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There were figures
within the Three Realms capable of killing him. For example, magic
treasures that contained and was able to unleash extremely powerful
truefire or truewater would be capable of completely annihilating
him. However…under normal circumstances, he would be able to fight
back; he wouldn’t be so foolish as to allow himself to be trapped
within those treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How about this…I’ll
take you to the ‘seat of awakening’ 1 of my master,” the Xia
Emperor said with a laugh. “You definitely won’t encounter any
problems while undergoing your tribulation at my master’s place.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was both surprised
and delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor’s
master? Daofather Crimsonbright?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he could receive
protection from a Daofather, his tribulation would become far safer.
Having a powerful backer really did make a difference! As for his own
master, Patriarch Subhuti…sheesh. He was the ultimate arbiter of
whether or not his disciples would even be allowed to return to the
Crescent world. By contrast, Daofather Crimsonbright had openly taken
control over dozens of major worlds and countless minor worlds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, it was
precisely because of how secretive he was that Patriarch Subhuti had
become known as the most mysterious Daofather of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But, but…would the
Daofather permit me to enter?” Ning hesitated slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let me report this
matter to my master, first. If his place won’t work, then I’ll
take you to my big brother’s place,” the Xia Emperor laughed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Big brother?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning instantly
thought of the Xia Emperor’s lifelong friend…Daofather
Raindragon! Yet another Daofather!

Chapter 18 - Demonheart
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, your
Imperial Majesty.” Ji Ning was utterly delighted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Xia Emperor nodded.
“The Celestial Tribulation is the greatest, most dangerous
tribulation any Immortal cultivator will face on his path. One cannot
be overconfident in dealing with it. Since you have karmic sinflames
around you, your demonheart tribulation will definitely be quite
extraordinary…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Demonheart…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Last time, when the
karmic sinflames had unleashed three rounds of tribulations upon him,
Ning had realized how terrifying his demonheart tribulation would be.
In truth…he didn’t know for certain if he would be able to
withstand it this time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then I’ll leave
now, your Imperial Majesty,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go. I’ll decide
upon your tribulation area within the next two days,” the Xia
Emperor said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately left.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This trip had been
worth it. The Xia Emperor’s promise of assistance…if a Daofather
truly was going to protect him, then he would have no outside factors
to worry about during his Celestial Tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The day after Ning had
gone to speak to the Xia Emperor. The azure-robed woman had
previously been seating calmly in the lotus position atop her jade
bed. Now, her face changed. She immediately barked, “Hurry up and
invite True Immortal Gaudy, True Immortal Deadgrass, Celestial
Immortal Blackheaven, Celestial Immortal Venomfreak, Empyrean God
Threesuns, and Empyrean God Beastleave. Also invite the leaders of
the Myriad Demons Cave and Bloodcloud Hall.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Alright.” The maid
outside immediately acknowledged the order.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
everyone had arrived within the palace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean God Azurefox,
Empyrean God Threesuns, and Empyrean God Beastleave were of the
Seamless Gate. True Immortal Gaudy and True Immortal Deadgrass were
both Pure Yang True Immortals, while Celestial Immortal Blackheaven
was equivalent to them in status. Immortal Venomfreak had the lowest
status of the group.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Empyrean Gods and True
Immortals were major figures of the Three Realms, after all, and when
they took on masters, their masters were usually Daofathers. In fact,
within the Three Realms, almost all Empyrean Gods or True Immortals
had a Daofather or True God supporting them. Thus, even though Ji
Ning might have a Daofather master, they wouldn’t really care that
much; the only thing causing them some nervousness was the fact that
Ji Ning had trained in the [Eight-Nine Arcane Art].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The situation has
changed.” After everyone arrived, the azure-robed woman spoke out
in a solemn voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What happened?”
They all looked at her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They knew that she must
have invited them all over to discuss matters pertaining to Ji Ning.
The faces of Blackheaven and Venomfreak instantly changed; of the
people present, these two cared about this matter the most.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-robed woman
said solemnly, “I just received word that the location of Ji Ning’s
tribulation has been set.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Where?”
Blackheaven immediately asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He asked the Xia
Emperor to protect him. The Xia Emperor, wanting to be cautious,
didn’t summon his own forces. Instead, he reported this to
Daofather Crimsonbright, asking for Ji Ning to be allowed to undergo
his tribulation at Daofather Crimsonbright’s seat of awakening.
Daofather Crimsonbright has already given the nod and agreed,” the
azure-robed woman said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This news was actually
top-secret. The Xia Emperor hadn’t even told his subordinates about
it, and very few people by the side of Daofather Crimsonbright knew
about it. The Seamless Gate, however, had found out right away. The
accuracy and lethality of their intelligence…it was the best in the
Three Realms! It had reached an utterly terrifying level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the people
present didn’t have any desire to ponder about such matters. All of
them knew exactly how formidable the Seamless Gate’s intelligence
network was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Daofather
Crimsonbright?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If it’s at his
seat of awakening, then we have no chance at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Are we going to have
to invite a major power?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all began to
worry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Forget about their
incarnations and their clones; even if they sent their true bodies in
to violate a Daofather’s seat of awakening…Daofather
Crimsonbright would probably wipe them all out in an instant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no way our
superiors will start a war against Daofather Crimsonbright for Ji
Ning’s sake.” The azure-robed woman shook her head. “Once a
battle starts, the other Daofathers and True Gods will jump in as
well…the end result might be a massive, chaotic war amongst True
Gods and Daofathers. We can’t possibly afford to pay such a price.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” They all
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If a huge storm erupted
due to personal grudges between True Gods and Daofathers, that was
one thing. But if as a result of their report, a huge storm erupted
that claimed the lives of two or three of their Daofathers…they
wouldn’t be able to bear that sort of responsibility.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then what should we
do?” Blackheaven frowned and barked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone was silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the horned
figure that had been silent up till now suddenly laughed. “I have
an idea.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” All of them
looked over to him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Venomfreak
laughed, “Exalted Immortals, all of you should know that when Ji
Ning battled against my Youngflame clan, he was punished with karmic
sinflames.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of their eyes lit
up; they were all intelligent people, and only one word was all it
took for them to sense what Immortal Venomfreak was saying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Due to the karmic
sinflames, when he undergoes his Celestial Tribulation, the power of
the wind, fire, and thunder tribulations will increase significantl,
but those aren’t that important…what really matters is his
demonheart tribulation. That’s when the tribulation shall become
the most astonishing and the most terrifying.” Immortal Venomfreak
laughed. “I already know exactly what sort of a person this Ji Ning
is; he cares deeply about filial piety and loyalty to his loved ones
and friends. He’s willing to die for his loved ones, and he’s
also willing to die for his brothers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” The nearby
fire-robed man nodded. “To save his junior apprentice-brother, this
Ji Ning once launched a major battle within one of the bases of our
Myriad Demons Cave, not worrying about offending us at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His devotion to his
friends is worthy of our admiration; although I, Venomfreak, would
never act like him, I still admire him very much.” Immortal
Venomfreak chortled. “The greatest strength of a person like him is
that his devotion can make his Dao-heart incredibly, terrifyingly
strong. But at the same time, his devotion is also his weak spot;
once it crumbles, then his Dao-heart will also crumble.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now, since Ji Ning
overcame karmic sinflames, it’s not very likely that we will be
able to make the devotion he feels for his loved ones crumble.
However…it’s possible for us to fill his heart with boundless
rage and hate!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill those who he
cares about!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill that ‘Uncle
White’, who he treats as he would a father or a mother! Kill that
obedient little spirit-beast of his, that Azure Skysnake!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill that Autumn
Leaf, who he loves as he would a sister.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His Dao-companion,
Yu Wei.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“His junior
apprentice-brother, Mu Northson.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Kill them all! Ji
Ning will definitely be enraged, and he’ll definitely turn berserk
and go mad!” Immortal Venomfreak’s smile began even more
brilliant. “Although sometimes madness can increase one’s
power…during the demonheart tribulation, going berserk is one of
the greatest taboos. There are very, very few berserk demons who are
capable of overcoming their Celestial Tribulation, unless they truly
have pure Dao-hearts and truly are born demons. However, Ji Ning is
not a demon by nature; there’s no way he can have a pure, demonic
Dao-heart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good idea.” The
azure-robed woman nodded. “However, Yu Wei cannot be killed.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Cannot kill Yu Wei?”
Immortal Venomfreak nodded. “Although killing the others would also
enrage him…Yu Wei is his Dao-companion. Killing her will have the
greatest impact on Ji NIng.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No. Yu Wei is Lu
Dongbin’s disciple. Our target right now is Ji Ning; I don’t want
to pull Lu Dongbin into the mix.” The azure-robed woman swept them
with her gaze. “You should all know that if Lu Dongbin gets
involved…then our branch of the Seamless Gate probably wouldn’t
be able to survive.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone turned solemn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking had a total
of three hundred Seamless Gates under his command. Although their
particular branch was strong, Lu Dongbin himself was incredibly
powerful, and his friends spanned the Three Realms. He was only
friendly terms with more than ten True Gods and Daofathers. One of
them treated Lu Dongbin like a son…and that one was one of the most
supremely powerful leaders of the Daoist Path. If Lu Dongbin got into
the mix…it could indeed cause a tremendous storm. Even if he just
called his friends, such as the Eight Immortals of the High Caves,
that would be enough to wipe out their Seamless Gate.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine. We won’t
touch Yu Wei.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t touch her.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone agreed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Venomfreak
secretly smirked. These people only dared to go after the easy
targets. It seemed as though in the Seamless Gate…only the most
powerful of figures would dare cause trouble for the likes of Lu
Dongbin. These Empyrean Gods and True Immortals present today, at
least, didn’t have the courage to go up against him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Haha, killing the
others is enough. That Uncle White, that Autumn Leaf…they are
family to Ji NIng.” Immortal Venomfreak laughed. “Gatemaster,
when shall we move?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s no time to
waste. Let’s make some quick preparations, then make our move
tomorrow morning and assault Serpentwing Lake.” The azure-robed
woman added, “If Ji Ning is at Serpentwing Lake as well, then let’s
kill him as well. If we can’t kill him, killing those targets will
satisfy our objectives.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on. Soon,
the day ended…and the next day arrived.

Chapter 19 - On Brightheart Island
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was at the cusp of
summer, with spring coming to an end. The morning was rather cool.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swallow Mountain,
Serpentwing Lake, Brightheart Island. Ji Ning walked out of his room
by himself, with Yu Wei still asleep. At the Celestial Immortal
level, one usually did not need to rise early or engage in an austere
lifestyle. What really mattered was understanding the Dao. Once one
reached a sufficiently high level in the Dao, such as mastering of a
Grand Dao, then ki would manifest within the chest, causing one to
immediately become a Pure Yang True Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the mastery of
a Grand Dao was simply far too difficult. Many Celestial Immortals
were trapped in front of the final bottleneck before mastery, unable
to take that last step no matter how they tried.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus, Yu Wei’s life
was quite relaxed; she wouldn’t even get out of bed until the
Golden Crow had risen high into the sky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh. Whoosh.
Whoosh.. As Ning walked towards the waters of the lake, he could make
out the rustling sound of the waves of Serpentwing Lake striking
against the shore. Even when there was no wind, this massive lake
would have three-foot tall waves, and so the sound of the waves
striking striking against the shore was heard quite often.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning held a Darknorth
sword in his hand, resting it over a shoulder as he strode past many
buildings.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many of the servants
and maids of Brightheart Island called out to him as he walked past.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning quickly arrived at
the island’s shore.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snick. Snick. Not too
far away, there was a gray-haired old man who was holding a giant
pair of shears with both hands, trimming away at the flowers and
vegetation. Brightheart Island was kept in pristine condition, like a
true paradise, and the efforts of these gardeners were a crucial
part. Clearly, this old gardener was completely absorbed in his
trimming, as he didn’t even notice that the master of the
Brightheart Island, Ji NIng, had arrived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gave the old
gardener a glance. He chuckled, then began to train with his sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sword-light began to
flash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s sword-arts had
become even more pure. They didn’t seem very dazzling, but they
seemed to carry a thoroughly penetrating power to them. Anyone who
watched would feel as though the tip of the sword was always aimed
straight at their eyes. This sort of sharpness, this sort of
penetrative power…ordinary Immortal cultivators who saw it would
only feel that it was strange. Only when Celestial Immortals saw it
would they understand how truly formidable it was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Slowly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Golden Crow rose
into the skies. The temperature began to rise. It was no longer cool,
and as the rays of the Golden Crow shone down, they brought warmth to
the world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By now, the old
gardener had noticed Ning. However, he didn’t dare to disturb him;
he just sat down to one side, watching with curiosity. As he
watched…he slowly began to feel drowsy, due to how warm and
comfortable it was. Bit by bit, he drifted off into sleep.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A tall, willowy,
white-robed woman walked over; it was Yu Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">She normally always
dressed in black clothes, but ever since she became pregnant, she
would often change into new outfits.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s watch your
daddy train with the sword.” Yu Wei waved her arm, and a
crystalline, jade-like table and chair appeared out of nowhere. With
a second wave, she caused some Immortal nectars and spirit-fruit to
appear. As she sat down, she noticed the old gardener snoozing off in
the distance. She couldn’t help but smile, then turned her head to
watch Ning train with the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The waters of the lake
washed up against the shore repeatedly. The warm morning sun shone
down upon then. The old gardener snoozed contentedly, while her
Dao-companion trained with the sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei stroked her
stomach. What a beautiful scene!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You woke up.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning came to a halt and
walked over to her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are about to go
for your Celestial Tribulation. Of course I had to come watch you
train,” Yu Wei laughed. “How do you feel?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Superb.” Ning
smiled. “My heart feels very peaceful, and my insights into the Dao
of the Sword continue to rise. To be honest…I can sense that I am
very close to the final bottleneck in the Dao of the Sword. In
perhaps another half year or year, I’ll be able to reach that
bottleneck.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It wasn’t too hard to
reach the bottleneck. Breaking through it to gain full mastery of the
Dao of the Sword, however, was incredibly hard. Still…Ning had once
experienced the [Thousand Year Dream], which his master, Patriarch
Subhuti, had provided to him so as to help him get a taste in advance
of what it would be like to have full mastery of the Dao of the
Sword. Given that he also was in control of a hint of a swordforce…he
felt confident that it would be much easier for him to break through
this bottleneck than it was for ordinary Celestial Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, even though it
might be easier, not even Ning knew how long it would be before he
would actually make the breakthrough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only when he mastered
the Dao of the Sword would he have his true body undergo its
tribulation. If he succeeded and became an Empyrean God…then his
life would have truly changed!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But all of it was
dependent upon him mastering the Dao of the Sword.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why don’t you
train for a bit longer? First reach the bottleneck, then have your
Primaltwin undergo the tribulation,” Yu Wei said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My Primaltwin is in
control of heartforce; it’s more than strong enough by now. Even if
I do improve slightly in the Dao of the Sword, it won’t be of that
much help to me,” Ning said. Their words were naturally sealed off
from the surrounding area, preventing anyone else on the island from
listening in.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s words were
correct.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With his full mastery
over his third level heartforce…his natural level of power was
already that of a supreme Celestial Immortal’s.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if a mere Primal
Daoist was somehow so monstrously talented as to be able to take
perfect control over the third stage of heartforce, that Primal
Daoist’s power would also rise to that of a supreme Celestial
Immortal’s. Heartforce was an extremely mysterious form of power;
generally speaking, only Empyrean Gods and True Immortals could
slowly begin to grasp it, while a number of True Gods and Daofathers
had some degree of skill in it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was far too rare,
however, for anyone at the Void-level to have gained insights into
it. As for Primal Daoists doing the same, this had never before
happened!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s Primaltwin was
now in perfect control of his third-stage heartforce; its power had
similarly skyrocketed to the supreme Celestial Immortal level. For a
Ki Refiner…this sort of power was absolutely enough to overcome the
thunder tribulation, while the wind tribulation and fire tribulation
were even less dangerous. Only the most unfathomable tribulation, the
demonheart tribulation, remained a threat.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Insights into the Dao
of the Sword wouldn’t be of much help to fighting the demonheart
tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“And…my
subconscious is whispering to me that the next few days are the best
period of time for undergoing my tribulation,” Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh?” Yu Wei
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as Ning and Yu
Wei, this loving pair of Dao-companions, were chatting together…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the skies above a
location deep within the southern seas of the Grand Xia, a spatial
rift suddenly appeared. An awe-inspiring group flew into the world,
each member of the group possessing powerful auras. The leaders were
True Immortal Gaudy, Fairy Deadgrass, Empyrean God Beastleave, and
Empyrean God Threesuns.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although these were
merely their incarnations or clones, in possession of just a tenth of
their full power, they were still definitely at the Empyrean God or
True Immortal level of power. They were significantly more powerful
than Ji Ning, who could be considered to have just barely reached the
minimum threshold of that level of power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven and Immortal Venomfreak were also present, and behind
them were a group of black-robed figures. Every single black-robed
figure had an astonishing aura that was filled with savagery and
brutality. The first time Immortal Venomfreak had seen this group, he
couldn’t help but feel nervousness. “The Hellsworn of Bloodcloud
Hall…they are legendary Deathsworn who came forth from the Infinity
Hells. What are these ‘Infinity Hells’? The eighteen hells of the
Netherworld shouldn’t be able to produce terrifying figures.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Venomfreak had
just recently joined, after all; there were many secrets which he did
not know, and he didn’t dare to ask too many questions either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’ve arrived at
the Grand Xia.” True Immortal Gaudy said, “Venomfreak, you
weren’t confident in being able to teleport from the Fifth World to
Serpentwing Lake, but now that we are at the Grand Xia, it shouldn’t
be a problem, yes?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes, it will be
easy. Forget about Serpentwing Lake; I can teleport us straight to
Brightheart Island.” Immortal Venomfreak smiled, confidence in his
eyes. “For the sake of killing Ji Ning, I gained a thorough
understanding of Brightheart Island of Serpentwing Lake; I know its
layout intimately.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” True
Immortal Gaudy nodded. “Then use a Greater Teleport.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A blood-red pearl
appeared in the skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Venomfreak
waved his hand again. None of them resisted as they were drawn into
that blood-red pearl. This pearl was merely a Heaven-ranked magic
treasure that contained a holding space within it; the likes of True
Immortal Gaudy and the others could easily destroy it from the inside
and emerge as needed. In addition, they could see what was going on
in the outside world, so they weren’t worry about Immortal
Venomfreak playing any tricks on them. And…if he really did, the
Seamless Gate would never spare him. The Seamless Gate was able to
keep track of everything they were doing, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go.” Pearl
in hand, Immortal Venomfreak immediately used a Greater Teleport.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Serpentwing Lake.
Brightheart Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This place was as
beautiful and paradise-like as ever. Many servants and maids had
already risen from bed and started on a few simple tasks.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Yu Wei were
seated together, drinking some warm wine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Come here and feel
it. Can you feel the movement?” Yu Wei placed Ning’s hand on her
stomach.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning carefully pressed
his palm down, sensing the pulses coming from her belly. The pulses
were very minute, very fine.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These little pulsing
movements caused Ning to feel a very strange, unique feeling in his
heart. This feeling was a powerful, protective urge, the urge an
eagle might feel to protect its chicks. Ning was filled with a desire
to ensure that nothing would happen to this little soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei looked at Ning,
looked at the expressions on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a soundless,
formless spatial ripple…but this ripple, the ripple of Greater
Teleportation, caused more shock and alarm to Ning and Yu Wei than
the collapse of the ground below them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Not good. That’s
Greater Teleportation!” Ning immediately turned around. “I can’t
let them harm senior apprentice-sister.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning had sensed
the pulses, he had immediately understood that even if he had to die,
he would ensure the safety of the two of them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior bear, senior
Redsnow, something bad has just happened.” As Ning turned, he
immediately called out to the seven Empyrean Gods. As he did…he
instantly saw the ugly, horned man who had just appeared far away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Youngflame Freak?”
Ning instantly recognized this man, the Ancestor of the Youngflame
clan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The horned man grinned
savagely, and his hoarse, ear-piercing voice that sounded like a
jagged knife sawing through a table instantly rang out throughout
Brightheart Island. “Ji Ning. What a coincidence!” His power,
filled with a Celestial Immortal’s energy, echoed throughout the
island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Swish! Swish! Swish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A large number of
people suddenly appeared next to Youngflame Freak. The leaders of the
group caused Ning’s eyelids to twitch. He instantly recognized True
Immortal Gaudy; if it hadn’t been for the Xia Emperor, he probably
would’ve been forced to ask senior Redsnow and the others to
intervene. And this time…Gaudy wasn’t alone. Next to him were
three figures whose auras were no weaker than his!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Four Empyrean Gods
or True Immortals?” Ning felt tremendous shock. “Even if I
immediately asked the Xia Emperor for assistance, if he doesn’t
bring enough people, it will probably be very hard for him to stop
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior Redsnow!”
Ning frantically called out to them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seven Empyrean Gods
had been located within the Starseizing world; they only began to
emerge once the giant yellow bear notified them, which naturally
needed a bit of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What a perfect
opportunity. Kill Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fifty-five figures had
emerged within the skies. Celestial Immortal Blackheaven immediately
let out a furious roar, while the eyes of the four leaders became
filled with murderous intents. The wave of murderous intents swept
down towards Ning, causing him to feel a greater sense of danger than
he had ever felt before. He had the feeling that if he tried to fight
back by himself, he would probably die in a single clash!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’M…TRYING…TO
SLEEP!!!!!” An utterly enraged roar suddenly rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The old gardener who
had dozed off nearby suddenly rose to his feet, a frown on his face.
He actually coughed twice as he stared at the fifty-five figures in
midair. “That damned duck that squawked just now had a
horrible-sounding voice! Do you guys want to die?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning and Yu Wei
stared in shock at the old gardener. Only an instant had passed, but
the old gardener had actually slowly risen to his feet, coughed
twice, then said a few things. It was as though time was passing at
completely different speeds for them and the old gardener.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the fifty-five
figures in midair, they were even more stunned and amazed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because they
suddenly realized something…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why can’t we
move?!”
</P>

Chapter 20 - The Four Ancestors Of The River Source
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Gaudy,
Fairy Deadgrass, and the others with them in the air were frozen like
sculptures. They couldn’t even blink, and the Empyrean God energy
or Pure Yang energy in their bodies had been completely frozen,
unable to be activated in the slightest. This sort of feeling, of
absolute paralysis, caused Gaudy and the others to feel amazement in
their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“A Daofather.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It must be a
Daofather.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But, but…there’s
actually a Daofather on Ji Ning’s Brightheart Island?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of them had
imagined that their assault would result in them kicking into a steel
plate like this! Their Greater Teleport had been quite a lucky one;
they had teleport straight to Brightheart Island, and because
Brightheart Island wasn’t that large, they had arrived very close
to Ji Ning! And in fact, even if their teleportation was a bit off,
the formations of Serpentwing Lake would not have been able to resist
the likes of True Immortal Gaudy, who had completely mastered the
Grand Dao of Qiankun.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But now they
realized…they weren’t lucky at all. In fact, their luck was
terrible to the extreme!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior.” Both Ji
Ning and Yu Wei hurriedly called out respectfully to the man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mm.” The old
gardener still hold those gardening shears in his hands as he lazily
sauntered over. Upon hearing both Ning and Yu Wei addressing him
respectfully as ‘senior’, he nodded. “Good, you know how to be
respectful to the elderly.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning and Yu Wei
instantly felt speechless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An exalted
Daofather…had first pretended to be a gardener, and now was putting
on airs as an old man. He had completely destroyed the image which Ji
Ning had of Daofathers in his mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You brats that are
hanging up there in the air.” The old gardener raised his head,
looking at the fifty-five figures frozen in midair. He immediately
said, “You woke this old man up with your yammering. Anything you
want to say before you die?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As soon as he said
these words, True Immortal Gaudy and the others in midair suddenly
felt as though their mouths could now move.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We offended you by
accident, senior,” True Immortal Gaudy said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, please let
us leave,” Fairy Deadgrass said a very soft voice.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The forces of the
Seamless Gate were all behaving in an extremely humble manner.
However, they had quickly recovered from their initial shock. If this
was a Daofather, he probably wouldn’t casually act in a way which
might start a war. The Daofathers on both sides were still holding
back for now; perhaps this Daofather they had run into might mock
them for a bit, but let them live.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As far as they were
concerned, the death of an incarnation or a clone wasn’t too big a
deal; what really mattered was the important treasures they were
carrying. In fact, they had multiple top-grade Pure Yang treasures
with them! This was the reason why their incarnations and clones were
capable of unleashing such tremendous power. Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven had been so enraged that his clone had even brought a
Protocosmic spirit-treasure!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems we’ve
passed through this latest crisis.” Ning and Yu Wei both let out
secret sighs of relief. However…Ning knew very well that the
Seamless Gate was so powerful that not even his master, Patriarch
Subhuti, would casually act against their minor figures. This
Daofather who apparently loved to play games probably wouldn’t act
too recklessly either.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, kid,” the
old gardener suddenly called out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior,” Ning
hurriedly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Tell me, should I
kill these people?” The old gardener smiled merrily at Ning. “If
you say I should, then I’ll kill them. If you say I shouldn’t,
I’ll release them. How’s that?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The fifty-five members
of the Seamless Gate in midair were stunned as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is your
prerogative to decide whether or not to kill them, senior,” Ning
immediately said. He wouldn’t be so truly presumptuous as to
instruct a Daofather in what should be done! If this Daofather was
merely jesting with him but didn’t actually want to start a battle,
and if Ning said the wrong thing…it would be terrible.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems you still
feel a bit suspicious.” The old gardener sighed. “If this old man
felt the urge, I’d even kill Lu Dongbin, the precious little
darling of the Daoist leader, to say nothing of these people!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was shocked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In this instant…the
faces of True Immortal Gaudy, Fairy Deadgrass, Celestial Immortal
Blackheaven, Empyrean God Threesuns, Empyrean God Beastleave, and
Immortal Venomfreak, all still hovering in midair, changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old Man Yuan?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old Man Yuan?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all realized who
this person was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, are you Old
Man Yuan?” True Immortal Gaudy spoke out. In the Three Realms, the
only person who referred to himself as ‘this old man’ and who
would dare to kill even Lu Dongbin was the low-key, mysterious Old
Man Yuan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That I am.” The
old gardener chortled merrily as he looked at them. “Now…are
there any questions in your heart as to whether or not I would dare
kill you?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The forces of the
Seamless Gate were stricken with terror. They were no longer able to
remain calm, but in their hearts they were cursing. Exalted Old Man
Yuan, if you want to kill us, just kill us. Why are you saying so
much to us? It seemed as though the legends regarding this man were
true; Old Man Yuan really was a crazy old man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old Man Yuan?”
Ning revealed a look of surprise as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In turn, Yu Wei had
learned of some of the Daofathers of the Three Realms from Lu
Dongbin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although Ning hadn’t
gone out of his way to investigate all the True Gods and Daofathers
of the Three Realms during his time at Mount Innerheart, the
disciples of the Mount Innerheart League would often chit-chat about
some of the most supreme True Gods and Daofathers when they were
bored. This person, Old Man Yuan, was often mentioned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan was also
one of the True Gods who had been born from the primordial chaos.
However, his comprehension abilities were far superior to Daoist
Threelives, and his status was far higher as well. He had long ago
mastered a Heavenly Dao and become a Daofather of the Great
Firmament! After doing so, his power had reached an utterly
ridiculous level. He belonged to neither the Daoist Path, nor to the
Buddhist Sangha. He had become a power unto himself, and he himself
possessed power overwhelming. He was truly one of the most supreme
Daofathers of the Three Realms, and he had two other Daofathers under
his tutelage! In addition to that…he had three lifelong friends who
were also three incredibly powerful Daofathers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The four of them were
referred to within the Three Realms as the ‘Four Ancestors of the
River Source’ 1. The Four Ancestors of the River Source were
extremely close friends; they always attacked and retreated in
unison. All four of them were incredibly powerful Daofathers, and if
one also factored in their various disciples and friends…they would
be considered an incredibly powerful force of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for Old Man Yuan…he
was the most powerful member of the Four Ancestors of the River
Source. He was their leader!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">How powerful was he,
exactly?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No one knew for
certain. Some said that Old Man Yuan was, logically speaking, weaker
than the two leaders of the Buddhist Sangha and the Daoist Path.
Others said that Old Man Yuan should be comparable to those two
leaders. In short…this was a crazy, yet terrifyingly powerful old
man.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn…” True
Immortal Gaudy and the others felt misery in their hearts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Three Realms were
currently divided into two major alliances.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The likes of Patriarch
Subhuti had long ago chosen an alliance…but the Four Ancestors of
the River Source had remained neutral. In the end, nobody would be
able to avoid getting drawn into the war between these two alliances,
but for now, before battle had truly begun…both sides were actively
courting the Four Ancestors of the River Source. They had to; the
four were simply too powerful. These were not four ordinary
Daofathers; all four of them had been born as True Gods of Primordial
Chaos, and stood at the very top of power amongst Daofathers. Old Man
Yuan, in particular, was one of the utmost supreme major powers of
the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Subhuti dared to
kill these fifty-five, the major powers behind the Seamless Gate
would probably strike back; they were enemies, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But if Old Man Yuan was
the one to kill them…the major powers behind the Seamless Gate
definitely wouldn’t intervene. They had been working so hard to
have the Four Ancestors of the River Source join them; how would they
dare to offend this old man now?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now you should
realize that I wasn’t joking with you, right?” The old gardener
beamed merrily as he looked at Ning. “This old man is going to ask
you again; should I kill them? If you say yes, then I’ll kill
them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning no longer
hesitated at all. He nodded. “You should.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nice.” The old
gardener nodded with satisfaction. “That’s more like it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The paralyzed members
of the Seamless Gate, still hanging up high in the sky, were filled
with terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Begone.” The old
gardener casually tossed out his giant gardening shears, sending it
flying upwards. This was clearly a pair of ordinary gardening shears;
it would probably break apart if one tried to use it to cut an
ordinary rock. And yet, it now went flying towards the midair bodies
of the True Immortals and Empyrean Gods. Even the clones of such
figures would have bodies that were incredibly tough.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snick!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was liking cutting
through paper. The body of an Empyrean God was bisected…and then
his auras vanished. He was deader than dead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Snick! Snick! Snick!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">True Immortal Gaudy,
Fairy Deadgrass, and Immortal Venomfreak were utterly terrified. They
repeatedly called out ‘senior!’, but snick, snick, snick…they
were still cut to death by the gardening shears. In the blink of an
eye, all fifty-five members of the Seamless Gate had been slain.
Although the metal shears had moved quite slowly, no major powers had
appeared to intervene.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s eyes lit up as
he watched.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Wonderful!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those bastards had
actually attacked Ning’s home; it was wonderful to see them killed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oho, although those
little minions of the Seamless Gate only sent their clones and
incarnations over, they brought a few nice things with them. Three
top-grade Pure Yang treasures, and a Protocosmic spirit-treasure.”
The old gardener waved his hand, and the items left behind by the
deceased members of the Seamless Gate flew forward to levitate in the
air before Ji Ning and Yu Wei. “They don’t suit this old man. You
take them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning blinked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei was stunned as
well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Them?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What in the…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After apprenticing
himself to Patriarch Subhuti, Ning had been forced to painstakingly
adventure through the Crescent world. Thanks to tremendous luck and
hard work, he had acquired a single Protocosmic spirit-treasure, the
Rahu Bow…and the bowstring had been broken, at that! This Old Man
Yuan was even more generous than his own master!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What, aren’t you
willing to accept them?” Old Man Yuan stared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am, I am, I am!”
Ning was so frightened, he repeated himself three times. “How would
this junior dare to refuse the gift of a senior?” He immediately
waved his hand, accepting the treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s more like
it. If you are going to do something, just do it; don’t hem and haw
and dawdle about like a girl,” Old Man Yuan said with a laugh.
“I’ve already spent several months living here at your
Brightheart Island.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Several months?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was puzzled. This
gardener had been here for far longer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve just been
possessing this old gardener,” Old Man Yuan said with a merry
chuckle. “I spent months here before you came back to Brightheart
Island, you brat. Mm…I’ve watched you train with the sword
several times now. Your sword-arts aren’t bad, but your control
over heartforce is even better.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Watched him several
times?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aside from this
time…Ning couldn’t recall a time when the old gardener had been
nearby. Oh, right; given Old Man Yuan’s power, he would be easily
able to watch Ning train with the sword, even from a tremendous
distance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Buuuut…” Old Man
Yuan said, puzzled, “Why is it that you seem to be so stupid?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Stupid?” Ning was
puzzled. This was the first time that anyone had called him stupid!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You completely focus
your heartforce into your sword-fingers. Why haven’t you considered
applying it to your legs or the rest of your body? That way, when you
use your evasive divine abilities, your speed would increase
dramatically, right? In the fact of those so-called ‘True
Immortals’ and ‘Empyrean Gods’, your escaping speed would
improve dramatically; you would no longer be forced to just stand
there like an idiot and take them head on,” Old Man Yuan said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shook his head.
“It isn’t that easy to apply heartforce. It took me eighteen
years of painstaking training before I was able to apply it to my
sword-fingers.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The reason it isn’t
easy is because you don’t have a good teacher. Your teacher doesn’t
know a damn thing about heartforce.” Old Man Yuan chortled. “What
do you think of my power?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your power is
incredible, of course, senior!” Ning said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then hurry up and
kowtow to me as your master!” Old Man Yuan puffed his chest up.
</P>

Chapter 21 - Master?
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the towering
palace in the Fifth World.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The three leaders of
the Seamless Gate, Myriad Demons Cave, and Bloodcloud Hall were all
gathered here, along with True Immortal Gaudy, Empyrean God
Beastleave, Empyrean God Threesuns, Fairy Deadgrass, Celestial
Immortal Blackheaven, and Immortal Venomfreak. They had only sent
their clones or incarnations to deal with Ji Ning, but they were
still watching nervously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was because they
had brought powerful treasures, such as Empyrean God constructs and
Protocosmic spirit-treasures.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We reached Swallow
Mountain.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“We’re fairly
lucky; we actually encountered Ji Ning after a single Greater
Teleport.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry up and kill Ji
Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all stared
intently at the mirror in the air. The mirror was displaying images
from what was happening within Brightheart Island. Fairy Deadgrass
was standing close to it, and every so often she would say a few
things. Then, suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What the hell?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-robed woman
and the others all jumped to their feet. They stared intently at the
old gardener holding the gardening shears who had just woken up and
stood up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Who is that?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Our clones and
incarnations can’t even move. We can’t even use our elemental
energy.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s terrifying…he
must be a Daofather. Otherwise, there’s no way he could be this
powerful.” True Immortal Gaudy, Empyrean God Beastleave, and the
others all had ugly looks on their faces.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can there be a
Daofather at Brightheart Island?!?” The azure-robed woman roared
furiously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A short while later,
after the old gardener chatted with Ji Ning for a while, his identity
was revealed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old Man Yuan, of the
Four Ancestors of the River Source?” The azure-robed woman’s face
turned ashen. Everyone present was stunned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ugh. I just lost my
horsetail whisk.” True Immortal Gaudy had an ugly look on his face;
that was a top-grade Pure Yang treasure. Although this wasn’t one
of the treasures he liked the most and used the most, the loss of a
top-grade Pure Yang treasure still caused him some heartache.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t say a thing.
Blackheaven suffered the worst loss this time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all looked towards
Celestial Immortal Blackheaven.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackheaven had lost a
Protocosmic spirit-treasure!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Damn.” Blackheaven
ground his teeth. “Ji Ning managed to escape again.” In truth,
Blackheaven was angrier over having not killed Ji Ning than over his
loss of a Protocosmic spirit-treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s acting now.”
Immortal Venomfreak and the others watched as the mirror showed
images of the giant gardening shears snicking through them. He said
hatefully, “This Old Man Yuan really shows no mercy at all.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If Old Man Yuan
wants to kill you, what can you do?” The fire-robed man shook his
head and snickered, “Forget about clones and incarnations…even if
he wanted to kill your true body, he’d do so without pause.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After the mirror
finished sending images of everyone being ‘snicked’ and killed by
the giant gardening shears, the shears turned towards the sky and
made one final ‘snick’. Instantly, no further images appeared in
the mirror; they were no longer able to watch what was going on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old Man Yuan won’t
let us watch any more,” the azure-robed woman said. “Given his
abilities…he must know that we were watching what was happening
there. The reason why he let us watch him act was because he wanted
to let our superiors, the major powers of the Seamless Gate, realize
that he is going to protect Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Old Man Yuan isn’t
even on our side. Does he really think he can just protect whoever he
wants?” Blackheaven growled, “Right now, we’re trying to court
him, but once the great storm truly erupts, no one will be able to
escape it. He’ll have to make a choice. Ji Ning already has a
Daofather as his master, and an enemy one at that; if Old Man Yuan
chooses to join us, then in the future he’ll become an enemy to Ji
Ning’s master. I refuse to believe he’ll still protect Ji Ning
then! And if he doesn’t join our side…then we can completely
ignore him when we move to kill Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone present
nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“However…the storm
has yet to truly erupt.” The azure-robed woman shook her head. “Old
Man Yuan is still standing to one side and watching. He hasn’t
truly made a choice yet; it’s not appropriate for us to offend Old
Man yuan.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You are
over-thinking things.” Blackheaven let out a snicker. “Do you
think that is something for you to concern yourself with?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The azure-robed woman’s
face sank. Blackheaven was acting far too impudently. Even with so
many others present, he still dared to speak in such a manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alas, Blackheaven
wasn’t under her command, and she still wasn’t sure of his true
power. In addition, the number of treasures he had was completely
bizarre. When he had sent his clone to the Grand Xia, he had carried
two mighty treasures with him; a top-grade Pure Yang treasure known
as the ‘Yin-Yang Arcane Ki Bottle’, and a Protocosmic
spirit-treasure known as the ‘Nineleaf Snowlotus’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s for the
Godking and the other major powers to worry about,” Blackheaven
said coldly. “I trust that the Godking will quickly send an order
as to whether or not we are to kill Ji Ning, so stop worrying your
little head over it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” The
azure-robed woman’s face sank. She no longer said anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackheaven gave the
azure-robed woman a glance, a hint of mockery in his eyes, then
turned and left. He felt tremendous distaste for this Gatemaster of
the Seamless Gate, Azurefox…because Violetgrass had died on her
orders. As for any anger that the Gatemaster might feel towards him?
He didn’t care about it at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world of the Grand
Xia.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t be
bothered to worry about the Seamless Gate right now; it was Old Man
Yuan that he was faced with, and he felt a headache coming.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Take him as his master?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He could tell that
since Old Man Yuan had come to personally inspect him, the old man
had definitely decided that Ning was moldable talent! Today, he had
first asked Ning whether or not he should kill the forces of the
Seamless Gate, and then immediately killed them upon Ning giving the
nod. This caused Ning to feel quite delighted; clearly, Old Man Yuan
wanted Ning to feel positively towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And now, the old man
had gifted him with the many treasures the Seamless Gate’s forces
had left behind; this, too, was to make Ji Ning feel grateful towards
him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next, the old man had
suggested that he work on applying heartforce to his legs or to his
entire body; these words had indeed caused Ning to feel a desire to
learn such a method.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally…he had asked
Ning to accept him as his master.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He’s really put
effort into this.” Ning understood this. “It seems this Old Man
Yuan really does want to take me as his disciple.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is how the
world is. Some people desperately want to become a Daofather’s
disciple, yet never will. When I wanted to become Daofather
Crimsonbright’s disciple, he didn’t find me worthy. Even Master
Subhuti only accepted me as his disciple because he saw that I was
the sole successor to the [Starseizing Hand] of his good friend,
Daoist Threelives and a decent cultivator. Back then, although I was
a genius, I clearly wasn’t that attractive in the eyes of the
Daofathers. Now that my power has increased dramatically, and have
reached the Empyrean God level of power as a Void-level
cultivator…one of the supreme Daofathers of the Three Realms has
come to seek me out on his own accord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If your potential was
truly astonishing, the Daofathers would seek you out on their own
accord.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning now was qualified
for a Daofather to do so.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He truly was an
astonishing piece of unpolished jade!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What should I do?
What exactly should I do?” Ning hesitated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Is he a friend or a
foe of my master, Subhuti? Or do they have no relationship at all?”
This was what Ning was worrying about. “This Old Man Yuan killed
the forces of the Seamless Gate, but the Seamless Gate didn’t even
make a single peep about it; the major powers behind the Seamless
Gate haven’t responded or reacted at all. The Three Realms are
facing a great storm, and there is no way that the major powers
behind the Seamless Gate can possibly be frightened by Old Man Yuan.
Clearly, then, Old Man Yuan is on passable terms with the Seamless
Gate, while my teacher, Subhuti, is an enemy to them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What if Master
Subhuti and Old Man Yuan are enemies?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If I were to
apprentice myself to Old Man Yuan without getting Master Subhuti’s
permission…then in the future, how could I possibly face Master?”
This was Ning’s concern.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the saying goes, the
Dao is not to be lightly transmitted.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a saying
regarding one who taught the Dao: One day as a teacher, a lifetime as
a father. This meant that one was to revere and honor one’s master
as one would one’s father. Subhuti had transmitted complete
Fiendgod Body Refining techniques, Ki Refining Techniques, sword-arts
manuals, and even supreme divine abilities like the [Eight-Nine
Arcane Art], [Houyi’s Archery], and the [Torch Dragon’s Eye] to
Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For Ning’s sake, he
had even toiled painstakingly to create the [Obscuring Wind of the
Nine Heavens] divine ability and the supreme sword-formation, the
[Greater Thousand Swords Formation].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After Ning had been
exiled into the Nihilum Zone, his master had come to search for him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His master had shown
him benevolence in transmitting the Dao to him and in saving his
life…no matter what, if he was going to take on a new master, he
first had to get the nod from Master Subhuti.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning had expressed
the desire to take part in the Conclave of Immortal Destiny in the
hopes of being able to have a True Immortal or a Daofather as his
master, Immortal Diancai was in full agreement; naturally, he hoped
that Ning would have even higher accomplishments. Before becoming
Subhuti’s apprentice, Ning had first spoken with the giant yellow
bear, who had verified that Subhuti and Daoist Threelives had been
good friends. If they had been enemies, things would’ve been
tricky.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why are you
hesitating and hemming and hawing?” The nearby Old Man Yuan
frowned.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior…” Ning
said, “I need to get my master’s permission, first.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your master?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan suddenly
seemed to have thought of something. Laughing, he waved his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Someone suddenly
appeared out of nowhere. It was Immortal Diancai, a winecup in his
hands and a befuddled look on his face. Immortal Diancai had been
seated atop his mountain, watching the dawn sun rise while drinking
some Immortal wine. Who would’ve thought that he’d suddenly be
teleported here?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciple?”
Immortal Diancai looked at Ning, then he looked at Old Man Yuan by
Ning’s side. Old Man Yuan’s face changed, and his figure changed
as well, becoming a bit thinner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“MASTER!” Immortal
Diancai instantly grew excited upon seeing him. Falling to his knees,
he said excitedly, “Master, I’ve finally met you again!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hey hey hey! Don’t
overstate our relationship,” Old Man Yuan said hurriedly. “All
those years ago, I saw that you were borderline suicidal, and also
saw that you were decently talented, and so I took pity on you and
casually transmitted a set of sword-arts to you. I have plenty of
sword-arts in my possession, and so teaching you one of them didn’t
really mean anything. What’s more, your talent is too mediocre and
your comprehension abilities are too weak; how could you possibly be
qualified to call me ‘Master’? You’d cause this old man to lose
all face!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had first praised
Immortal Diancai as ‘decently talented’, then immediately
described him as ‘mediocre’ and ‘weak’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still, everyone knew
what he meant.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clearly, Immortal
Diancai would be considered decently talented when compared to the
countless cultivators of the Three Realms, but he was far from being
qualified to become Old Man Yuan’s disciple.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although these words
were rather unpleasant, Immortal Diancai didn’t feel the slightest
bit of anger. Kneeling there, he said excitedly, “How could Diancai
possibly forget the grace you have shown me by transmitting the Dao
to me? I knows that my talent is poor, and that I am not qualified to
become your apprentice, but I’ve always viewed you as my master in
my heart.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can think
whatever you want, I guess. This, uh…this Ji Ning has a very close
relationship with you. This old man wants to take him on as a
disciple; help me persuade him,” Old Man Yuan said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciple?”
Immortal Diancai instantly revealed a look of great joy. He
immediately looked towards Ning. “This senior possesses
world-shaking power; even though I am now a Celestial Immortal, the
sword-arts he transmitted to me were so unfathomably profound that I
can tell I have still only scratched the surface of it. He must be a
Daofather. Go ahead and take him on as your master; there are many
people in the Three Realms who have multiple masters.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right, right, right!
I’m a DAOFATHER!” Old Man Yuan looked at Ning, then stared at
him. “I’m taking you on as my disciple! Why haven’t you knelt
down already?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Senior, this junior
feels unspeakably proud that you wish to take me on as your
disciple,” Ning said hurriedly. “But…this junior has already
taken on a Daofather as a master, and many people already know this.
Without his approval, it isn’t appropriate for this junior to
accept you as master as well, senior.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh, you are quite
respectful towards this Daofather master of yours.” Old Man Yuan
laughed. “I guessed long ago that your master had to be a
Daofather, and he’s probably not too shabby either. Who is your
master? Tell me, and I’ll go talk to him about this. This merely
the accepting of a new disciple, and I’m not asking you to betray
him either. It’s a minor matter. What is the name of your Daofather
master?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Godking behind the
Seamless Gate knew the answer, but Old Man Yuan did not. Indeed…the
Seamless Gate’s intelligence mechanisms were truly terrifying.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master’s name is
taboo; this junior does not dare speak it,” Ning said honestly.
Subhuti had ordered long ago that Ning was not permitted to tell
others who his master was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You dumb cucumber!
You can’t even tell me your master’s name? Is your master really
that badass? Who the hell is your master, Nuwa?” Old Man Yuan
stared at him with bulging eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m his master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A calm voice rang out.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The nearby natural
energy began to condense, and a skinny, white-bearded old man dressed
in Daoist robes appeared out of nowhere.

Chapter 22 - A Graceful Departure
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei and Immortal
Diancai suddenly felt spacetime around them began to change and blur.
By the time their surroundings turned solid once more, they were now
within a hallway next to Autumn Leaf. Upon seeing Immortal Diancai
and Yu Wei suddenly appear, Autumn Leaf was quite startled. She
immediately addressed the two: “Madame, Immortal Diancai.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems they don’t
want us to watch,” Immortal Diancai said with a helpless laugh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder who junior
apprentice-brother’s master is.” Yu Wei was curious as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just now, they had only
heard the words, ‘I’m his master’, before they were forcibly
teleported away. They hadn’t seen the man at all, much less learn
who Ji Ning’s master was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What happened?”
Autumn Leaf was intrigued. “You said something about the young
master’s teacher?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing.” Yu Wei
shook her head and smiled. “It’s something good, but it’s not
something for us to know about.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Oh.” Autumn Leaf
nodded, asking no further.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master.” Ning
immediately called out with respect and excitement. The skinny,
white-bearded elder in the Daoist robes smiled and nodded towards
Ning, then looked towards Old Man Yuan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“YOU!” Old Man
Yuan’s eyes bulged. “You cucumber! You friggin’ cucumber! You
ended up snatching away such a wonderful disciple!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the third
time, you know.” Patriarch Subhuti sighed. “Why do you always
come after the disciples that I take in and teach?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning blinked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The third time?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It seemed as though Old
Man Yuan had gone after two of his fellow disciples as well?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ahaha, all I can say
is that you are formidable in teaching students, Subhuti.” Old Man
Yuan laughed, “Since it’s you, Subhuti…that makes everything
easy. We came to an agreement last time, right? Go ahead and tell me
whatever it is that you want. This old man has plenty of treasures,
and I’m willing to spend them. I’m not afraid of any demands that
you might make.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, are you
willing?” Subhuti looked towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ll follow your
orders in all things, Master,” Ning said respectfully. If it didn’t
make things tough for his master, there would be no issues. More
importantly, Master Subhuti had to know more about Old Man Yuan than
Ning did; Ning trusted that Master Subhuti wouldn’t steer him wrong
in this ddecision.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti nodded
slightly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He can be both
considered one of your disciples as well as one of mine,” Subhuti
said calmly. “I’m only going to ask one thing of you…that you
stand with us, on our side.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…” Old Man
Yuan’s face became unsightly to behold.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti frowned. “Are
you still unwilling to make your choice?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s merely a
matter of taking on a new a disciple, and I’m not even asking him
to switch sides! He’ll be our jointly shared disciple. If you want
divine abilities or Protocosmic spirit-treasures, that’s fine…but
why are you trying to force me?” Old Man Yuan scratched his head.
“Didn’t things work out splendidly when little Peacock became my
apprentice? She addresses both of us as ‘master’!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was intrigued.
Were they referring to senior apprentice-sister Peacock?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little Peacock?”
Subhuti shook his head. “That was before the storm came, and before
I knew it was coming. Now that the storm is already here…of course
you have to make your choice. Otherwise, there’s no way I’ll
permit my disciple to become apprenticed to you as well.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can you…you
are absolutely…you old blockhead!” Old Man Yuan was infuriated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hmph.” Subhuti
snorted coldly. “Then let me ask you this; if Ji Ning becomes your
apprentice, and you end up joining the Seamless Gate…what is Ji
Ning supposed to do? Is he supposed to choose to stand with me, or is
he supposed to choose to stand with you? If he stands with the
Seamless Gate, then I’ll definitely strike and annihilate such a
vile disciple! But if he stands with us, then you’ll move to kill
him as well. After all, by then it will be a life-and-death battle;
no one will be able to escape it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan’s face
grew even uglier to behold now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, standing to one
side, now understood everything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Right. If he took on
two masters who ended up in opposing, enemy camps…then no matter
which side Ning was on, he would end up becoming enemies with one of
his masters!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you want him to
become your disciple, then I imagine you don’t want to make things
difficult for him; you don’t want him to eventually be killed by
one of his masters, right? That’s why you have to stand with us;
only by doing so will Ji Ning not suffer such a sad fate,” Subhuti
said. “So long as you agree…Ji Ning can take you on as master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You…” Old Man
Yuan had a complicated look on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just stood there,
watching quietly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Four Ancestors of
the River Source; they were a formidable power within the Three
Realms. Most likely, whichever side Old Man Yuan chose would be the
side the Daofathers who followed him would choose.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why are you forcing
me on this? This isn’t just a personal matter; I have all my
friends and disciples and grand-disciples to worry about.” Old Man
Yuan was truly upset now.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s nothing to
negotiate!” Subhuti shook his head. “Don’t make things
difficult for Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But didn’t things
work out perfectly when I took on little Peacock?” Old Man Yuan
snapped back irritably.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“That’s because you
haven’t made your choice yet. Once you do make your choice in the
future…if you choose to join the Seamless Gate, little Peacock will
have to make her choice as well. Will she follow you, or will she
follow me?” Subhuti sighed. “I’ve already done wrong by little
Peacock; I don’t wish for Ji Ning to face the same tough situation
in the future.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan suddenly
grew angry. “I don’t get it. Why are all of you so damned
stubborn?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I don’t understand
either! All of us were born from the same primordial chaos. We were
like brothers! All of us are standing together now…why is it that
you are roving about on your own? All four of you Four Ancestors of
the River Source act in the exact same manner; you don’t give a
damn about your old friends and friendships.” Subhuti was no longer
calm either; in fact, he was so angry that his eyebrows were
twitching, and as he spoke he pointed angrily at Old Man Yuan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The rest of you are
in Nuwa’s debt, but we aren’t,” Old Man Yuan replied angrily.
“And Pangu’s Primordial World shattered long ago. This is now the
era of the Three Realms. That old, undying bastard just wants to take
over the Three Realms; let him! Do you Daofathers really care who is
in control of the Three Realms? Do you have to risk everyone’s
lives over this question? You say that I don’t care about old
friends and friendships? If I didn’t, I would’ve joined the
Seamless Gate long ago!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti was now truly
enraged. “How can you be so…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Their voices suddenly
turned silent.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The distant figures of
Patriarch Subhuti and Old Man Yuan’s turned blurry as they angrily
but silently yelled at, argued with, and cursed at each other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wasn’t able to
hear a single word of it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems…they
don’t want me to hear this.” Ning mumbled to himself, “They
said something about an ‘old undying bastard’ who ‘wants to
take over the Three Realms’…who? He must be a truly terrifying
major power of the Three Realms.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had no choice but
to just stand there silently and watch. As for the two distant
Daofathers…both of them were awe-inspiringly famous figures of the
Three Realms who stood at the very pinnacle of power amongst
Daofathers. Both had multiple Daofathers amongst their disciples, and
both also had many Daofathers who were their resolute allies. Both
possessed tremendous power in every sense of the word.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, both were
born from the primordial chaos of the universe.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And right now, they
stood there arguing, each trying to convince the other.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A long time passed…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two Daofathers
actually argued for two full hours. Towards the end, Ning noticed
that Patriarch Subhuti was growing increasingly imposing as he
argued, while Old Man Yuan seemed to become increasingly less
self-assured.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! The area around
him suddenly trembled. Now, Ning could once more hear the voices of
the two Daofathers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan charged
over, an ugly look on his face. He snapped angrily, “That master of
yours is like a big hunk of wood. You just can’t talk to him! Those
who walk different paths can’t make plans together. I really can’t
be bothered to talk to him any longer. You are quite talented, kid;
although that rotten blockhead is very skilled in some respects, he’s
complete crap in heartforce. Since we aren’t destined to become
master and disciple…then forget it! This is a technique for
applying heartforce which I developed. Although it’s not a complete
system, it might be of help to you in some way. I’ll give it to you
as a gift!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he spoke, he pointed
a finger towards Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, a streak of
light shot out from his finger into Ning’s forehead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An ocean of information
instantly filled Ning’s mind.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Subhuti!” Old Man
Yuan turned to point at Subhuti, then cursed, “In terms of fleeing
abilities, you are number one in all the Three Realms! You’ll be
able to flee and survive, but how many of our other old friends will
be able to survive? All those years ago, Threelives and the others
all perished. How many more do you want dead?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If we retreat, even
more will die. In fact, all of us might die!” Subhuti said angrily.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Fine. Fine. Fine!
We’ll wait and see!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enraged Old Man
Yuan turned and walked away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After taking two steps
away, the now-ordinary old gardener suddenly slumped supinely to the
ground as a streak of light shot into the skies, disappearing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti waved his hand,
and the old gardener was instantly teleported away. He was nothing
more than an ordinary old man, after all; prior to this, Old Man Yuan
had simply been possessing him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti walked towards
Ning, who was completely filled and preoccupied with the enormous
amount of information regarding the application of heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was awe-inspiring.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was unfathomably
profound.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning viewed the
awe-inspiring collection of information, he couldn’t help but feel
veneration towards Old Man Yuan. Incredible! Old Man Yuan’s true
power, however, most likely didn’t lie in heartforce; after all, in
terms of heartforce, Ning could tell that Old Man Yuan shouldn’t be
as powerful as Houyi had been.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan, however,
was different from Houyi.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Houyi was extremely
focused on his archery, and he had systemized a way to apply
heartforce to archery in a terrifyingly profound and powerful manner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Old Man Yuan, however,
was a jack of all trades. Most likely, he liked analyzing heartforce,
and so had come up with multiple different heartforce techniques,
some meant for the legs, some meant for the entire body, some meant
for the fingers, some meant for the hair, some meant for the sword,
some meant for other treasures…there were all sorts of techniques
here! However, none of them were truly systemized; from the looks of
it, Old Man Yuan had jotted down a few notes whenever inspiration
struck him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His most profound
techniques regarding heartforce actually were in applying heartforce
to the soul! This allowed the soul to control even more magic
treasures. For example, if normally Ning was only able to control the
third level of the [Greater Thousand Swords Formation], if he applied
heartforce to his soul, he would be able to control the sixth level
or even the seventh level. This was a technique which Ning was truly
eager to learn.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartforce was like a
marshal, with the soul being the soldiers; if one used them together
properly, the number of magic treasures one could control would
instantly explode. In addition, the amount of heartforce that was
used up was neglible; after all, it merely served as a commander,
without much of it being actually burned away. The increase in power,
however, was still astonishing! This was definitely a killer
technique for any Ki Refiner.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…none of it
was systemized, which meant that no one could simply ‘learn’ the
technique after reading about it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning wasn’t an
uninformed outsider to this art.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was someone who,
after learning how to apply heartforce through [Houyi’s Archery],
had first come up with a way to apply heartforce to his
sword-fingers, then come up with a way to apply heartforce to his
swords! Ning was capable of creating these techniques himself; now,
after having seen the more profound techniques of Old Man Yuan, he
was of course stimulated by them and had new insights. These insights
would absolutely be enough to allow Ning to come up with a suitable
method for applying heartforce to his legs or to his entire body, or
even to his soul.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Aside from Old Man
Yuan’s own techniques, there were also techniques which other major
powers had devised for the application of heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All these
non-systemized heartforce techniques…this collection was known as
the [Heart Sutra].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Heart Sutra]?
With this [Heart Sutra], I’ll be able to grow dramatically more
powerful in every aspect, whether it be dodging in close combat,
fleeing, or anything else. My Primaltwin will become more powerful as
well.” Ning was unspeakably excited right now. Before this, he was
only formidable in his attacks; he was quite lacking in other
respects. Thus, almost any Empyrean God or True Immortal would
probably be able to capture him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, however, Ning
would be able to improve himself in every area. He would no longer
have any obvious weaknesses, and so capturing him would become far
more difficult in the future.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Wow.” Ning opened
his eyes, a look of delight on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As he did so…he saw
his master, Patriarch Subhuti, standing not too far away from him.
Ning’s face quickly stiffened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master,” Ning
immediately called out.
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 23 - Before The Tribulation
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning’s heart
clenched. He could tell that there were some disagreements between
his master, Subhuti, and Old Man Yuan. Was his master going to forbid
him from training in the [Heart Sutra]?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What did Old Man
Yuan transmit to you?” Subhuti asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The [Heart Sutra].”
Ning didn’t dare to hide this. “It contains his many experiences
with various heartforce application techniques, as well as a mix of
heartforce application techniques from a few other Daofathers.
However, they are all un-systemized…but they will still be of great
benefit to me, especially the one that applies to using heartforce on
the soul. It will be of tremendous help to me in controlling the
[Greater Thousand Swords Formation] as well as in overcoming the
demonheart tribulation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti gave Ning a
glance, then revealed a calm smile. “Your master isn’t the
pedantic, unflexible sort; since Daofather Yuan has gifted you with
this sutra, and since he hasn’t forced you to become his
disciple…go ahead and learn from it! If in the future, Daofather
Yuan decides to stand with us, you shall naturally repay his
kindness. If, however, he stands with the Seamless Gate…then when a
war to the death erupts between our two alliances, you’d have to
fight against him with all your might. This would be true even if he
really was your master, to say nothing of him merely having
transmitted a technique!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s heart
shivered. He immediately said, “Your disciple understands.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a storm!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A storm which no one
would be able to avoid.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope senior Old
Man Yuan decides to stand with us,” Ning mused secretly to himself.
Everyone who he owed a debt of gratitude to, such as the former Lord
of Cui Palace who had been the First Judge of the Dead and who had
transmitted the [Nuwa Painting] to him, belonged to the side of the
Nuwa Alliance. Even the master he had never met, Daoist Threelives,
had also been on the side of Nuwa. The same was true for the seven
Empyrean Gods of the Starseizing world, to say nothing of Patriarch
Subhuti, Daofather Crimsonbright, and the Xia Emperor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was also already
a feud between himself and the Seamless Gate…and Ning had a true
disliking for the way in which the Seamless Gate had acted in seeking
to conquer the universe. Once they took over the Three Realms, not
only would they pay no attention to maintaining any order, they would
instigate countless battles and massacres.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Old Man Yuan
truly is an extremely formidable figure,” Subhuti said to Ning.
“His power is most likely no lower than mine, and he loves to
analyze and research many different types of techniques. He’s a
master in many areas, and in heartforce he is second only to Houyi.
In terms of how many heartforce skills he knows, he’s even superior
to Houyi. Spend some effort on this [Heart Sutra], especially in the
part that shows you how to apply heartforce to your soul. You must
gain insight into it; once you do, your chances of overcoming the
Empyrean Tribulation and shall incrase by quite a bit.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple
understands.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Heartforce as the
general, the soul as the soldiers.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once the general
commanded the soldiers to unleash their power in an organized
fashion, he would be able to control even more magic treasures while
also making it harder for the demonheart tribulation to invade his
mind. Against a weak soul, it was easy to create a terrifying
demonheart illusion, but against one with a powerful soul, it would
be far more difficult. In fact, there were some truly terrifying
souls that were so powerful that the demonheart illusions were
completely unable to take hold against them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once Ning learned the
art of applying heartforce to his soul, his soul would instantly
become more than ten times steadier. This, in turn, would
dramatically lessen the power of the demonheart illusions generated
by the ‘demonheart tribulation’ of his Empyrean Tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple has a
subconscious feeling…if I am able to master this soul heartforce
technique, my Primaltwin will be in virtually no danger during the
Celestial Tribulation,” Ning said. “Should your disciple delay
the tribulation?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need.” Subhuti
shook his head.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at his
master, puzzled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you wait until
you’ve mastered the soul heartforce technique, your Primaltwin’s
tribulation will indeed be very easy.” Subhuti nodded. “But…first
of all, it’s hard to say how long it would take you to come up with
such a technique; after all, there’s a tremendous difference
between applying heartforce to the soul and applying heartforce to
sword-fingers. Second, although your Primaltwin’s tribulation is
indeed a tribulation, it’s also an excellent and rare opportunity
to temper yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Temper myself?”
Ning was intrigued.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“After having
withstood the karmic sinflames, your heartforce improved
dramatically,” Subhuti said. “By the same principle…your
Primaltwin’s demonheart tribulation will be a tempering experience
as well that will allow your heartforce to improve in strength and
your Dao-heart to grow even more resolute. If you wait until you come
up with a soul heartforce technique before you attempt the
tribulation, ending up in an excessively easy tribulation, it won’t
have any tempering effect on you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Remember this.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your Primaltwin’s
tribulation is a minor matter. What really matters for you should be
your true body’s tribulation.” Subhuti looked at Ning. “Your
true body has trained in many divine abilities, and its potential is
far greater than your Primaltwin’s. After all…compared to
Fiendgods, Ki Refiners are always at a significant disadvantage. If
you look at the Three Realms, all of the most supreme of powers of
the Three Realms have powerful divine bodies.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Threelives, for
example; he clearly didn’t master a Heavenly Dao, but was still
able to kill many Daofathers.” Subhuti looked at Ning. “Or for
example, you; even if your Primaltwin becomes a Pure Yang True
Immortal, it will still most likely be merely an average Pure Yang
True Immortal. But once your true body becomes an Empyrean God,
you’ll instantly become one of the most supreme Empyrean Gods or
True Immortals. If you spend a bit of time training, you’ll
probably come extremely close to Lu Dongbin’s level. That’s the
advantage which Fiendgods have! Look at the most famous figures of
the Three Realms; Houyi, Nuwa, Pangu, Old Man Yuan, and yes, myself;
which of them trained solely as Ki Refiners?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The more monstrously
talented you are, the more terrifying your tribulation will be. Even
I can’t be certain as to how powerful your Empyrean Tribulation
shall be. All I know is that it will definitely be shocking.”
Subhuti looked towards Ning. “Thus…the most important thing for
you right now is to focus all of your efforts towards preparing for
your Empyrean Tribulation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple
understands,” Ning said solemnly. “Three days from now, your
disciple’s Primaltwin will undergo the tribulation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Good.” Subhuti
nodded with satisfaction. “If you succeed in this tribulation and
your Primaltwin becomes a Celestial Immortal, your Dao-heart shall be
further strengthened. This would naturally be an ideal outcome.
However, even if you fail and lose your Primaltwin…you’ll have at
least experienced the demonheart tribulation. If you end up failing
it, it’ll have been of even greater help to you in terms of
tempering yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everything was for the
sake of his true body!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Shall I still go to
Daofather Crimsonbright’s place for the tribulation?” Ning asked.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No need.” Subhuti
shook his head. “Undergoing the Celestial Tribulation is a major
matter; naturally, as your master, I will ensure that you won’t
suffer any disturbances during your tribulation. I was always
planning to guard you while you underwent your tribulation. I didn’t
expect that you’d go seek out that kid Xiamang.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not even Subhuti could
keep the [Dream of the Three Realms] up at all times. Subhuti only
found out about Ning speaking to Xiamang after the fact.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You can undergo it
here at Swallow Mountain,” Subhuti said. “Don’t worry about
anything. I won’t show myself, but I definitely won’t let anyone
disturb you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Thank you, Master,”
Ning immediately said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This Celestial
Tribulation is nothing more than a tempering experience for you;
don’t waste it. Your Empyrean Tribulation is what truly matters,”
Subhuti said solemnly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon becoming an
Empyrean God, Ning would have become one of the truly formidable
figures of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Calm yourself and
prepare for your Celestial Tribulation. Although this Celestial
Tribulation isn’t as important as your true body’s Empyrean
Tribulation, it will still be extraordinary.” Subhuti smiled, then
vanished into thin air, no longer anywhere to be seen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning continued his
preparations here at Swallow Mountain. He spent a little bit of time
to pay a visit to the Xia Emperor, informing him that his own
Daofather master was going to protect him, and so there was no need
to trouble Daofather Crimsonbright. The Xia Emperor had nodded; if
there was no need to bother his master, all the better.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During these three days
prior to his tribulation, Ning paid a visit to West Prefecture City,
where he had spent his early childhood days. He visited the Eastmount
Marshes he had once adventured through, went to the mountains where
he had once killed Bei Zishan…and as he retraced his steps, Ning
felt his heart grow calmer and calmer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was a day on the
cusp between spring and summer. The early dawn was very cool and
refreshing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within a solitary
mountain peak in the Swallow Mountain region, Ning’s true body and
his black-robed Primaltwin were seated together in the lotus
position, a hint of dew on their bodies. They had sat here all night,
their minds and hearts as calm as still water. Far away, on a distant
mountain peak, stood Uncle White, Little Qing, Mu Northson, Immortal
Diancai, Autumn Leaf, and the pregnant Yu Wei. They all watched
nervously…because Ji Ning was about to undergo his Celestial
Tribulation.

Chapter 24 - The Tribulation
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Uncle White, Autumn
Leaf, Mu Northson, and the others watching from far away were all
extremely nervous. Immortal Diancai immediately said consolingly to
them, “I was able to successfully overcome my tribulation. This
disciple of mine is more powerful than me, even as I am right now,
and his Primaltwin is merely a Ki Refiner; I trust his Celestial
Tribulation won’t be too powerful. He’ll definitely succeed in
overcoming it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” They all
nodded, including Yu Wei. However, Yu Wei still felt restlessness in
her heart. This was because she had been an apprentice to Patriarch
Lu; she knew very well that Patriarch Lu’s tribulation had been one
with nine nine-sets of thunder tribulation; clearly, Ki Refiners
could also encounter incredibly terrifying Celestial Tribulations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Atop the distant,
solitary mountain peak, Ning’s true body which had been seated in
the lotus position suddenly vanished. He had entered the underwater
estate, leaving behind only the black-robed Primaltwin Ning, who
still continued to sit there.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden-lotus Primal
within the black-robed Ning’s body began to undergo its final
breakthrough. It surged to the peak of the Void-level and began to
actively call out for the Celestial Tribulation to descend…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh. Whoooosh.
Whooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A wind arose.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s begun.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The wind
tribulation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The Celestial
Tribulation has started.” Immortal Diancai and the others all
stared nervously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everything had been
completely calm before this, but suddenly a gale erupted out of
nowhere, forming into wind-blades that grew increasingly small in
size. The wind-blades changed in color, growing increasingly powerful
as they became tiny black knives, each of which was comparable to an
Immortal-ranked magic treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The start to the
wind tribulation is already this powerful…” The looks on the
faces of Immortal Diancai and Yu Wei changed. They had both undergone
tribulations and had past experience to rely on; it was obvious to
them that the Primaltwin Ning’s Celestial Tribulation was starting
off at an excessive level of power. It vastly surpassed theirs, at
least!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seated, black-robed
Ning just watched calmly. In a soft voice, he called out, “Nineleaf,
come out.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Instantly, an enormous,
snowy-white lotus treasure appeared beneath the seated Ning. If one
looked at it carefully, one would see that it had a total of nine
snowy-white lotus petals. This was the most powerful magic treasure
which Celestial Immortal Blackheaven had prepared for the Seamless
Gate’s assault against Brightheart Island…the Protocosmic
spirit-treasure, ‘Nineleaf Snowlotus’.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Nineleaf Snowlotus
was incredibly powerful, and it was best-suited for trapping and
binding foes! Even if it was ownerless, the Nineleaf Snowlotus could
activate the cold elemental energy of the natural world to form tiny
snowlotus petals to wildly assault and constrict its foes. And if it
did have a master who filled it with elemental ki…its power would
be even more astonishing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Blackheaven had been
planning to rely on this Protocosmic spirit-treasure to bind Ning!
From this, one could tell how powerful it was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Old Man Yuan had
wiped out all the forces of the Seamless Gate, he had given Ning all
of the treasures the Seamless Gate had left behind. The Pure Yang
treasures weren’t as important for now, and Ning was in no rush to
parcel them out to Yu Wei or the others; after all, his tribulation
was coming soon, and he had his master to protect him, meaning that
this period of time would be very safe. The parceling out of the
treasures could wait for after the tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the Nineleaf
Snowlotus, Ning had bound it to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This sort of treasure
was tremendously helpful towards Ning, and binding it could also be
quite difficult; it depended on whether or not the Protocosmic
spirit-treasure was willing to accept the new master or not. The
Nineleaf Snowlotus naturally had a spirit of its own, one which took
the form of a white-robed girl. The white-robed girl was persuaded by
the Rahu Bow and the giant bear of the underwater estate…and given
that Ji Ning was indeed a monstrous talent, and that she had seen a
Daofather strike out on behalf of Ning, she quickly accepted and
acknowledged Ning as her master. As a result, Ning was able to easily
bind this Protocosmic spirit-treasure.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the Nineleaf
Snowlotus had been unwilling, binding her would’ve been a true
pain; most likely, only a Pure Yang True Immortal would’ve been
able to bind her forcibly, after spending an enormous amount of time.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, once she
became willing, Ning was able to effortlessly bind her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was now enthroned
on his Nineleaf Snowlotus. Countless snowflakes appeared around him,
each of which had the form of a tiny little snowlotus leaf. In the
thousands and tens of thousands, they completely surrounded Ning and
protected the area around him. Although they were best-suited for
wrapping around and binding a foe en masse, they could also be used
to defend. If they had to protect a large space, their defensive
power would drop a bit, but since the treasure was as a Protocosmic
spirit-treasure, its power was still quite extraordinary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swish! Swish! Swish!
Swish! Swish! Swish!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Countless Immortal
swords appeared around Ning, hovering in the air around him and
ensconcing him within. Although Ning had already activated a
Protocosmic spirit-treasure…to be completely safe, he released all
of his Immortal swords, preparing to defend if necessary.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First came the roaring
gale.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next came all sorts of
terrifying skywinds with astonishing power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…no matter how
powerful the assaults were, the Nineleaf Snowlotus Protocosmic
spirit-treasure was able to endure them all. Ning wasn’t even
needed to use his sword-formations at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The final assault of
the wind tribulation has come, the Celestial Immortal Wind.”
Immortal Diancai and the other distant spectators all felt their
hearts clench.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Immortal
Wind was formless and invisible; no magic treasures or spells could
block it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Celestial Immortal
Wind descended, effortlessly bypassing the defending Nineleaf
Snowlotus. It passed through Ning’s skin, going straight into the
Sole-Ki Pearl of Primalwater within Ning’s Primaltwin. Ordinary
people usually had this wind entering through their head, but since
Ning’s Primaltwin was created from this Sole-Ki Pearl of
Primalwater. Still…in the face of the Celestial Immortal Wind, it
seemed incredibly fragile.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Celestial Immortal Wind
would only ever appear during the Celestial Tribulation. It was a
manifestation of the Dao that flowed through the Three Realms, and no
power or magic treasure could oppose it. If one’s Dao-heart was not
strong enough, the Celestial Immortal Wind would incinerate one’s
body and reduce it to ash.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thus…one’s
Dao-heart had to be firm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had managed to
overcome the karmic sinflames tribulation; how could his Dao-heart be
weak? He could sense the Zifu region within his Sole-Ki Pearl of
Primalwater begin to tremble, then transform. The pearl itself was
being transformed. Once he truly became a Celestial Immortal…the
pearl would completely vanish, and the true core of his Primaltwin
would become a golden pellet, his Jindan.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wind tribulation
ended. The fire tribulation came.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The weather changed
dramatically as an utterly enormous cloud of fire appeared in the
skies, causing the temperature to skyrocket. However, Ning continued
to simply sit there above the Nineleaf Snowlotus. Just by using a
little bit of his elemental energy, he was able to activate a large
amount of energy of the natural world to cause the temperature to
cool once more. For a time, the world was divided between a blazing
sky high above and a world of snow down below. Truly, this was a case
where fire and snow could not coexist.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The fire tribulation
has come. However…since that protective treasure Ning has was able
to easily defend against the wind tribulation, I trust it won’t be
too hard for it to resist the fire tribulation.” Immortal Diancai
smiled.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The power of the
wind tribulation is comparable to the power of the fire tribulation.
Given how formidable junior apprentice-brother’s protective
treasure is, he should be able to easily overcome it without using up
too much energy.” Yu Wei said with concern, “What I’m worried
about is the thunder tribulation.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The power of the
Protocosmic spirit-treasure, the Nineleaf Snowlotus, was truly
astonishing. It didn’t require too much energy to be used up, but
alas, Ning didn’t have a way to apply his heartforce through the
Nineleaf Snowlotus. If he did, not even his swords might be as
powerful as the Nineleaf Snowlotus. This was a Protocosmic
spirit-treasure, after all; although Ning had many hundreds of
Immortal swords, and although the [Greater Thousand Swords Formation]
was incredibly powerful, they were still ‘merely’ top-grade
Immortal swords. But of course…Ning had come up with a way to apply
heartforce through his swords of the [Greater Thousand Swords
Formation], and so at present the [Greater Thousand Swords Formation]
far surpassed the Nineleaf Snowlotus in power.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had passed the wind
tribulation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He now passed the fire
tribulation as well! The Celestial Immortal Fire that came in the end
resulted in the Sole-Ki Pearl of Primalwater evolving yet again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally…the time came
for the thunder tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was a fairly long
period of time that would pass between the end of the fire
tribulation and the start of the thunder tribulation. The Celestial
Tribulation gave the tribulant some time to restore their energy…but
in truth, in this case Ning had primarily relied on the Nineleaf
Snowlotus to defend against the elemental attacks, and had used his
Dao-heart to endure the Celestial Immortal Wind and Celestial
Immortal Fire. Thus, he had used up very little of his energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I wonder how many
sets of thunder tribulation Master will face,” Little Qing said
worriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I underwent six
nine-sets,” Immortal Diancai said with concern. “This disciple of
mine had far more karmic luck than I did, and he also has karmic
sinflames around him; his thunder tribulation shall undoubtedly be
astonishing.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were
worried. What none of them realized…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Was that in truth, Ji
Ning had received supreme transmissions of the Dao from three
Daofather-level figures; Patriarch Subhuti, Daoist Threelives, and
Old Man Yuan. Of the three, Old Man Yuan and Patriarch Subhuti both
stood at the very pinnacle of power amongst the Daofathers of the
Three Realms. While Daoist Threelives had never been able to actually
become a Daofather, remaining a True God of Primordial Chaos, the
[Starseizing Hand] divine ability was awe-inspiringly powerful and
one of the top ten divine abilities of the Three Realms.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had acquired so
many legacies that even his Ki Refiner tribulation wouldn’t be
weak…and he also had mastered heartforce and was covered in karmic
sinflames.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An hour passed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The calm skies suddenly
manifested a pair of enormous black clouds. These enormous black
clouds covered nearly the entire sky, causing the world to turn
pitch-black as they blocked out almost all light.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What just happened?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The sky turned
dark?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ji clansmen within
Swallow Mountain, as well as the other clansmen and monsters present,
all stared towards the sky in confusion.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The entire sky had
turned pitch-black. As for the dark clouds…they had now completely
covered the entire Swallow Mountain area of nearly a hundred thousand
kilometers!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How could this…”
Yu Wei, Immortal Diancai, Mu Northson, Uncle White, Little Qing, and
Autumn Leaf all raised their heads. They had changed looks on their
faces, while Yu Wei’s face was completely bloodless.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two enormous dark
clouds that had blotted out the skies above all of Swallow Mountain
slowly began to move towards each other. Because of how enormous they
were, these two massive clouds semed to fly at a very slow pace. But
as they flew…crack! Crack! A series of cracking sounds could be
heard from the skies as one enormous bolt of lightning after another
began to snake out from within the two massive dark clouds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however, just
watched calmly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He wasn’t surprised
at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, an enormous
vortex of lightning and clouds had formed within the skies. The size
of this vortex still covered the entire Swallow Mountain region; from
its size alone, one could tell how utterly astonishing its power was.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A streak of lightning
lashed out from the lightning-cloud vortex, striking directly down
like the sword of the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had already risen
to his feet. Hundreds of Immortal swords hovered around him, while
the Nineleaf Snowlotus was underneath him. Many hundreds of meters
above Ning, an utterly enormous lotus had formed, generated from
countless tiny snowlotus petals. The enormous lotus was a barrier to
defend against the thunder tribulation. Ning still wanted to use this
Protocosmic spirit-treasure; it consumed very little of his elemental
ki, after all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The first bolt of
lightning wasn’t even able to cause the Protocosmic spirit-treasure
to shake in the slightest.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bolts of lightning
continued to crash down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, they were at the
fourth nine-set of thunderbolts.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thunderbolts continued
to crash down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Five nine-sets. Six
nine-sets…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is the seventh
nine-set.” Autumn Leaf couldn’t help but whisper these words.
Brightheart Island now had quite an extensive library of books, many
of which Ning had acquired after killing other Immortals. Autumn Leaf
had naturally perused them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master is almost at
his limit.” Little Qing was worried as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the
sixty-first bolt of thunder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous lotus
flower formed from the Nineleaf Snowlotus was already beginning to
collapse.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“[Greater Thousand
Swords Formation], go forth!” The black-robed Ning, standing atop
the Nineleaf Snowlotus, pointed towards the skies. Instantly, a
golden sword that had manifested in front of his chest streaked out
into the heavens.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous lotus
above him had already vanished into thin air. However, a series of
layers of lotus flowers appeared around the black-robed Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This strike of the
[Greater Thousand Swords Formation] contained a hint of his
heartforce, allowing him to effortlessly block the celestial thunder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The eighth nine-set
has arrived.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Soon, it was time for
the eighth nine-set. Immortal Diancai and the other spectators all
felt nervous; how was it that a Ki Refiner actually caused an eighth
nine-set to appear? Even though Ning had taken on a Daofather as his
master, his tribulation shouldn’t be this terrifying, right?
</P>

Chapter 25 - A New Life
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seventieth bolt of
thunder.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A violet streak of
lightning crashed down with ice-cold callousness. The black-robed Ji
Ning beneath it pointed with his finger, causing the golden sword of
the [Greater Thousand Swords Formation] to once more soar into the
skies.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It once more blocked
the assault.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I hope it is merely
eight nine-sets. If it grows much stronger…it may put too much
stress on my heartforce.” Ning was a bit worried as well.
Third-level heartforce was very powerful, and it would be easy to use
it against eight nine-sets, but if it became the full nine
nine-sets…the power of the thunder would skyrocket to a new level.
By then, each blow would most likely require Ning to use up quite a
bit of his heartforce. Once it was used up, he would definitely
perish.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had never imagined
that he would have failed during the thunder tribulation of the
Celestial Tribulation, but he was now beginning to worry. The power
of the eighth nine-set was already a bit beyond what he had expected.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The divine thunder grew
increasingly powerful. After these two consecutive blows of divine
thunder…everyone, be it Ning or the distant group of spectators
including Immortal Diancai and Yu Wei, stared upwards nervously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is merely
junior apprentice-brother’s Primaltwin. Eight nine-sets should be
enough; there shouldn’t be nine nine-sets, right?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The legendary nine
nine-sets…generally speaking, only Void-level Fiendgods will
encounter them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all watched
nervously.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thousands of kilometers
away, an old man in Daoist robes was watching from atop a distant
mountain peak. When he saw that the tribulation clouds in the sky did
not disperse, and instead began to gather an even more terrifying
amount of power, his face changed. He murmured softly to himself, “My
disciple’s Primaltwin has actually encountered the ninth nine-set?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s just a
Primaltwin. In terms of fortuitous encounters, it probably isn’t
even up to Lu Dongbin’s standard…can this be due to the karmic
sinflames?” Subhuti began to worry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was a monster, but
that was with regards to his true body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His Primaltwin, by
comparison…although it had control over heartforce, it was far
inferior in all other aspects to the Void-level Lu Dongbin of
countless years ago. Although heartforce was powerful, it had a
glaring weakness: It could only be used to fight for a short period
of time. Once one’s heartforce was used up, one’s power would
drop dramatically.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For Ning’s Primaltwin
to encounter nine nine-sets of thunder tribulation…Subhuti felt
that this was too excessive, even though Ning did have karmic
sinflames covering him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If this is the
case…then my disciple’s true body…?” Subhuti began to worry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If even the Primaltwin
had to undergo nine nine-sets, then the Empyrean Tribulation of the
true body would be…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once he becomes an
Empyrean God, he will quickly reach the pinnacle of power amongst
Empyrean Gods. In fact, after he undergoes a bit more tempering,
he’ll be like Houyi was, capable of rivaling the Daofathers despite
merely being at the Empyrean God level.” Subhuti let out a soft
sigh. “It seems not even the heavens are willing to casually permit
such a monstrous genius like this to exist. The heavens will insist
on unleashing a terrifying tribulation…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">From the era of Pangu’s
World to the modern day, countless monsters had their souls shattered
by their tribulations!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Forget about the
Empyrean Tribulation; even this Celestial Tribulation…” Subhuti
stared off into the distance, a frown on his face.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nine nine-sets!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s more?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“How can this be?!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai, Mu
Northson, Autumn Leaf, Uncle White, Little Qing, and Yu Wei all
revealed frantic looks on their faces. There was no way they could
help Ning; during the Celestial Tribulation, a person could only rely
on himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother, you have to succeed.” Yu Wei gently stroked her
belly, her eyes filled with hope.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Young master.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They were all filled
with hope. Although the fame of the ninth nine-set was terrifying,
Ning had overcome the previous eight nine-sets with utter ease, not
seeming to be taxed by them at all. Thus…they were still filled
with hope.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ninth nine-set of
the thunder tribulation. The seventy-third bolt of thunder was a
streak of violet lightning that was tinged with a white color. This
hint of white caused the thunderbolt to become beautiful, a terrible
beauty to behold. It was as though the lord of all creation had just
taken a look at his universe with a gaze that of ineffable power.
Weaker Void-level Earth Immortals probably wouldn’t even try to
fight back against this thunderbolt…but of course, there was no way
a weak Void-level Earth Immortal would even be able to make it this
far, to the ninth nine-set of the thunder tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In all the Three
Realms, in all of history, every single person who had encountered
nine nine-sets was an extraordinary figure. They wouldn’t easily
admit defeat; even if they had to die, they would die standing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Ning pointed
into the distance, and the golden sword in front of his chest once
more flew out. While flying out, Ning manifested yet another golden
sword in front of himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Clang!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the first golden
sword flew out, it was struck head-on by the violet-white thunderbolt
and broken apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It seems I have to
use one-fiftieth of my total heartforce in order to completely block
these attacks. The power of the divine thunder truly has risen
significantly.” Ning hurriedly commanded his second golden sword to
fly out, blocking the remaining power of the violet-white
thunderbolt. “The power of these thunderbolts are greater than the
full-strength blows of the likes of Celestial Immortal Infatuation.
How could an ordinary Void-level Earth Immortal possibly withstand
them?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only by accurately
predicting the power of each thunderbolt could Ning ensure that he
wasn’t wasting too much of his heartforce with each blow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He blocked the
seventy-third thunderbolt.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He blocked the first
bolt of the ninth nine-set!” Immortal Diancai and the others
revealed looks of excitement and nervousness in their eyes. There was
a huge increasing in power between the last bolt of the eighth
nine-set and the first bolt of the ninth nine-set; for him to be able
to block this first bolt meant that there was hope for him to block
the others.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One bolt of lightning
after another came crashing down.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All the thunderbolts
were violet-white in color, but towards the end, the white grew more
and more dominant, and the power grew increasingly greater. In turn,
Ning was forced to use up more and more of his heartforce.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The seventy-ninth bolt!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The eightieth!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s one more
left.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The last one.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei, Uncle White,
and the others felt as though their hearts were hanging in the air.
The legendary nine nine-sets of thunder tribulation…finally, the
last blow of it was going to reveal its force. Not everyone was lucky
enough to witness such a thing. However, their hearts were only
filled with a dim, vague fear…because the very sight of the
cloud-lightning vortex swirling above them was filling them with
inexplicable terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Even if it was
me…the current me, who has become a Celestial Immortal long ago…I
would probably die beneath this below,” Immortal Diancai mused to
himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stood there at the
very peak of the mountain, like a sharp sword unfurled towards the
heavens. Beneath his feet was the Nineleaf Snowlotus, and lotus
flowers swirled and bloomed all around him. Hundreds of swords
levitated around him, all pointed towards the heavens as Ning raised
his head, staring at the tribulation clouds.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The final thunderbolt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The final bolt of the
ninth nine-set of the thunder tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was a thunderbolt of
pure white, filled with holiness and sanctity. It didn’t have even
the slightest hint of wildness or savagery; all it held was an
exalted, noble aura within it as it came crushing down from the
heavens. This was the true face of the very final thunderbolt of the
ninth nine-set.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” Ning pointed
a finger.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Swoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The golden sword-light
flashed with incomparable brilliance, expanding to become an enormous
sword that instantly shot into the heavens, striking towards that
pure-white thunderbolt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Go.” As fast as
Ning could, Ning manifested and unleashed a second golden sword. By
now, the first golden sword he had sent towards the white thunderbolt
had already been completely blasted apart. The second golden sword
quickly soared upwards. BOOM! The remnants of the pure-white
thunderbolt trembled, and then completely dispersed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The enormous golden
sword continued on its upwards trajectory, stabbing straight into the
heart of the cloud-lightning vortex in the skies, completely
dispersing the entire vortex.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One last streak of
lightning suddenly appeared out of nowhere, crashing into Ning’s
body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s body began to
emit an Immortal aura.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Celestial Immortal
Body.” The distant spectators, including Immortal Diancai, Yu Wei,
and Autumn Leaf, began to call out in excitement.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Success.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nine nine-sets of
thunder tribulation…the legendary nine nine-sets! Master actually
withstood it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So the final bolt
from the ninth nine-set is actually a bolt of completely white
lightning. Why did that white bolt of thunder seem so holy and noble?
I felt the urge to bow towards it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning looked at Uncle
White, Yu Wei, Immortal Diancai, and rest of his distant, celebrating
friends. He revealed a smile…but still felt a hint of lingering
fear in his heart. “The nine nine-sets were simply too terrifying.
I’ve been very stingy with my heartforce, but I still have less
than thirty percent of it left. That final thunderbolt in
particular…even my full-strength sword-strike was unable to
withstand it!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If the thunder
tribulation is already so frightening…then what of the demonheart
tribulation?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had a bad feeling.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although this was
merely his Primaltwin’s tribulation, the power of the Celestial
Tribulation had still exceeded his expectations. The demonheart
tribulation coming up would probably also be as powerful as the most
terrifying ones in the legends.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s a boy! It’s
a boy!” A distorted voice suddenly rang out in Ning’s mind,
summoning his memories.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning opened his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A giant dressed in
white furs was holding him. The white-furred giant ordered, “The
rest of you can leave!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father!” The face
of the giant caused Ning’s heart to tremble. Ning immediately
turned to look towards one side. He immediately saw a body covered
with sweat that lay on an enormous, fur-draped bed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Mother! I…did I
just go back to the moment of my birth?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time passed, one day
after the another.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning once more lived
life in West Prefecture City. Under his father’s protection, he
began to train. Although Ning had all his memories, he still had to
undergo normal training. Still, although the demonheart world had
given him a weak body, it was unable to change Ning’s memories or
his Dao-heart. Thus…Ning knew very well that this was the
demonheart world!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, even though he
knew it, he wasn’t able to do anything about it, because there was
no way for him to leave this world at all. He had to wait for the
demonheart tribulation to come to an end; only then would this
demonheart world come to an end as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning slowly grew up.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because he did possess
all of his memories, Ning was able to train very quickly within this
demonheart world. In addition, he had control over his heartforce;
third level heartforce was simply too powerful! Thus, although he was
a child of less than ten years of age, his power was no weaker than
that of a supreme Celestial Immortal’s. Thus…everything was
changed. In the demonheart world, he had to train normally as a
Fiendgod Body Refiner, but his training speed as a Ki Refiner was
incredibly fast. With the assistance of his powerful heartforce, he
was naturally able to acquire Immortal spirit-pills. He became a
Void-level Earth Immortal by age nine, procuring spirit-pills for his
mother, Yuchi Snow, that would allow her to continue to live.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A nine year old
Void-level Earth Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">What an utter monster.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the demonheart
world, Ning continued to hide his control over heartforce. The fact
that he was a Void-level Earth Immortal, however, could not be
hidden. And so, just like that, a nine year old Void-level Earth
Immortal emerged into the world of the Grand Xia. His status was so
special that even the Northmont clan of Stillwater sent someone over
to recruit him. The Xia Emperor, however, ignored him. This was
because the Xia Emperor believed that this Ji Ning had to be the
disciple of a major power, which was why he possessed all of his
memories immediately after being reincarnated and born again. As
someone who had all of his former memories, to become a Void-level
Earth Immortal at age nine wasn’t that unheard of.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Still…the entire
situation within Stillwater Commandery had changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s status became
more and more transcendent. And yet…out of habit, Ning kept the
form of a youth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son, a
disciple of the Black-White College named Ninelotus has come to pay
you a visit.” Yuchi Snow, already a Zifu Disciple herself, smiled
as she spoke to her son. Now that Ning’s status within Stillwater
Commandery was so transcendent, many people came to pay their
respects to him. As for their enemies such as Snowdragon Mountain,
Ning had wiped them out long ago.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ninelotus?” Ning’s
heart trembled. In the demonheart world, he hadn’t even visited the
Black-White College yet; why had Ninelotus come?
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">

Chapter 26 - Another Life, Thirty Millenia
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the demonheart
world. Out of curiosity, Ninelotus had come to meet Ji Ning. By now,
Ninelotus had already grown up to be a slender, elegant beauty. As
soon as she saw Ning, for some inexplicable reason, she felt close to
him. Ning, however, felt guarded; no matter what, he absolutely could
not allow himself to sink down into this demonheart world. ‘Sinking
down into it’ meant liking this world and accepting it in his
heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To like the demonheart
world so much that he might abandon the real world…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To allow himself to
drown within it, to allow his real self in the real world to perish!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within this demonheart
world, his parents were both alive and well. This was a world without
tragedy for him. In truth, in his heart, Ning did like this world…but
thankfully, he had reached the third level of heartforce, ‘ruler’.
No matter what thoughts, likes, and emotions flashed through his
mind, Ning remained the master of himself. He constantly reminded
himself that these were all nothing more than the illusions of the
demonheart world; these weren’t real.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The feelings I bear
for my parents are already having a tremendous impact on me within
the demonheart world. I absolutely cannot allow my feelings for
Ninelotus and Yu Wei to be added to the mix as well.” Ning knew in
his heart that once he allowed love to enter the fray, this
demonheart tribulation would become truly dangerous.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…Ning wasn’t
able to control the demonheart world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a result of this
visit, Ning’s had been firmly engraved into Ninelotus’ mind.
Thus, she came back repeatedly to visit him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is my senior
apprentice-sister, Yu Wei. She’s a true genius of our Black-White
College,” Ninelotus said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But of course, I
cannot compare to Immortal Darknorth.” Yu Wei smiled as well. As
soon as Yu Wei had seen Ning, she too had felt an inexplicable
attraction towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the demonheart
world, both Yu Wei and Ninelotus found themselves uncontrollably
drawn to Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…Ning’s
heart was filled with misgivings, and so he always moved to prevent a
relationship from blossoming between them.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Time flowed on.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Decades passed in the
blink of an eye.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Very early on, Ning had
acquired the Starseizing Estate. By now, he had already reached the
seventeenth stage of the [Crimsonbright Diagram of the Nine Heavens].
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei and Ninelotus
were as close as real sisters, so close that they didn’t
differentiate between ‘mine’ and ‘yours’. The two of them
settled into a residence within Swallow Mountain, not too far from
where Ning lived. The two of them felt certain that one day, their
sincerity would move Ji Ning. Unlike in the real world, in this
demonheart world, Ninelotus and Yu Wei were both completely devoted
to Ji Ning. In fact, both of them threw away everything for his sake,
and Ninelotus gave up her clan as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now, in the demonheart
world…the storm finally swept through the Three Realms!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the demonheart
world, Ning allowed his Primaltwin to undergo its tribulation. The
tribulation of the demonheart world was completely illusory, and so
the demonheart tribulation lasted for but an instant before it ended,
resulting in his Primaltwin becoming a Celestial Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the entire Three
Realms being shaken by this storm, Ning naturally allied with the
Northmont clan of Stillwater. Although he didn’t truly enter into a
relationship with Yu Wei and Ninelotus, the two of them continued to
wholeheartedly pursue him. The Dongyan clan was on very close terms
with Ning, and the Dongyan Forefather, Ji Ning, Patriarch Unity, and
others all joined together into an alliance to weather this storm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The war began!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One battle after
another began to erupt within the world of the Grand Xia. To protect
his tribe, Ning was forced to go into battle as well. As the war
progressed, however, he found it harder and harder to gain victory in
his battles…and finally, he decided to undergo his Empyrean
Tribulation!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There was one major
problem with the demonheart world; there was no way to gain insights
into the Dao here!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was an illusory
world; every single tribulant knew that in their hearts. As a result,
they couldn’t advance in the Dao in the slightest. Although Ning
had already spent over a hundred years in the demonheart world, he
hadn’t improved in the Dao in the slightest. The only improvement
he had was in terms of his Dao-heart; he was tempering his Dao-heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was also able to
improve his heartforce within this illusory demonheart world, but
alas, Ning remained at the third level, the ‘ruler’ level.
Although he did improve slightly, to reach the fourth level of
‘mortal dust’ was far too difficult. Anyone who could reach that
level would be considered one of the truly most powerful experts of
the Three Realms. The terrifying divine archers of the Three Realms
and Old Man Yuan were all at the fourth level.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the illusory
world, Ning could sense that he was gradually becoming unable to
defend his clan from the storm, and so he decided to undergo his
Empyrean Tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Empyrean
Tribulation was simply far too powerful.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wind tribulation,
the fire tribulation…they nearly caused Ning’s death.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The thunder tribulation
destroyed Ning’s true body by merely the sixty-second thunderbolt.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He had failed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His true body had
failed its tribulation, and so the Starseizing Estate left him,
having gone to search for another successor.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning only had his
Primaltwin left to him. Thus, like many other Celestial Immortals, he
became embroiled into and pushed about by the waves of the storm. Yu
Wei and Ninelotus both became Celestial Immortals over the course of
the storm, but the two continued to follow by Ning’s side. Ning,
however, continued to act guarded, not allowing the relationship
between him and the two of them to deepen.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The deeper their
relationship grew, the easier it would be for Ning to sink into this
world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One battle after
another!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei and Ninelotus
followed Ning at all times, experiencing life-and-death experiences
with him. Finally, after eighteen thousand years, the storm came to
an end. Ninety percent of the Celestial Immortals of the world of the
Grand Xia perished, and even the Xia Emperor had died. As for major
powers, no one knew how many had perished. Ji Ning, Yu Wei, and
Ninelotus, however, had not died. In fact, even the Ji clan of
Swallow Mountain had survived.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the tribulation
having ended, Ning returned once more to Swallow Mountain.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus and Yu Wei
continued to follow him. They, too, took up residence at Swallow
Mountain. As for Yuchi Snow and Ji Yichuan, they successfully
overcome their tribulations and become Celestial Immortals towards
the end of the storm. They, too, urged Ning to accept and wed
Ninelotus and Yu Wei.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Eighteen thousand
years!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They had experienced
life and death together.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It must be understood
that in the real world, Ning had only lived for a mere century. In
this demonheart world, however, he had already lived for eighteen
thousand years. If his Dao-heart had been slightly weaker, he
would’ve long ago confused what was real and what was not. He
would’ve willingly accepted that this demonheart world was the true
world; after all, he had spent far more time in this world, which was
a far more blissful one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…Ning, who had
ruler-class heartforce, only felt an ever-greater amount of terror.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His father and his
mother had actually both become Celestial Immortals? Yu Wei and
Ninelotus had both survived the storm? Clearly, the demonheart world
was doing everything it could to give him an incredibly blissful
life. It had even ensured that Ning failed his Empyrean Tribulation,
so as to clip his wings and lessen his ambitions.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lessened ambitions…a
blissful life…emotions…countless shared life-and-death
experiences…eighteen thousand years…all of these things were
having an impact on Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning…how can
you be so heartless? It’s been eighteen thousand years, but you
still remain this cold-hearted. Alright…alright…alright. I will
never bother you again. I’ll never irritate you again!” Ninelotus
looked at Ning, her tears dripping downwards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Little sister
Ninelotus and I will be leaving now. We’ll never bother you again,
you callous, cold-hearted man.” Yu Wei’s eyes were filled with
pain as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal swords
suddenly appeared in both their hands.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning couldn’t help
it; he instinctively knocked those two Immortal swords away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You won’t even let
us die? Even if you prevent us from dying, we can go to a place where
you can’t find us, then end our lives there.” Ninelotus said with
agony, “My sister and I no longer have anything worth living for,
anyways.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Let’s go, little
sister.” Yu Wei took Ninelotus by the hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning just shut his
eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Was he supposed to just
keep fleeing within this demonheart world? Keep hiding from
everything? Was this right, or was this wrong? Why was it that by
fleeing…these emotions were only causing him even greater agony?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t go,” Ning
suddenly said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei and Ninelotus
had already turned away, but now their bodies both shook. These two
peerless beauties, one dressed in white and the other dressed in
black, both turned to look at Ning. They had an eager look in their
eyes, a look that bespoke of how they had waited for eighteen
thousand years…a look that was about to melt Ning’s heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning, are you
truly…” Ninelotus and Yu Wei both looked at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Don’t go.” Ning
walked to them. “I don’t want you two to go.” He reached out
with his arms, taking Yu Wei and Ninelotus into his embrace.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei and Ninelotus
each clung to one of Ning’s elbows, gently leaning against him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning, however…could
sense that his Dao-heart was wavering and growing blurry.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He understood…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">That he had taken yet
another step towards sinking into this world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When he took the
finally step and completely sank into it…his soul would be
extinguished, and he would die.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning began to live
together with Ninelotus and Yu Wei. They truly were a trio of
Immortal lovers. The Three Realms were in a state of peace, and the
Ji clan had nine Celestial Immortals within it; Ji Ning, Ninelotus,
Yu Wei, Yuchi Snow, Ji Yichuan, Uncle White, Autumn Leaf, Spring
Grass, and Little Qing. Everyone Ning cared about was alive…and in
fact, all of them had become Celestial Immortals.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His life was peaceful
and beautiful. In fact, this was what Ning truly desired in his
heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To be carefree…to do
what he wanted to do…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To be together with his
loved ones…to live a simple, happy life…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both Ninelotus and Yu
Wei bore him children. To teach and rear children could be quite
frustrating, but it was also quite blissful and happy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bliss.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning had never been so
blissful. Not in his previous life, and not in this one. This
demonheart world, however, truly was very blissful and very perfect.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder it is rare
for a single new Celestial Immortal to appear within the world of the
Grand Xia, even after the passage of a million years. No wonder
countless Void-level Earth Immortals have attempted their
tribulations but failed.” Ning felt agony in his heart. He knew
very well that all of this was a lie…but he had spent more than
thirty thousand years here. A hundred years in the real world…thirty
thousand years here…even Ning’s Dao-heart was finding it hard to
extricate itself from this demonheart world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In fact…he was
beginning to feel slightly unwilling to extricate himself. He didn’t
want to let this all be destroyed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The demonheart world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was night.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A little boat was
drifting about in the waters of Serpentwing Lake. Ning was seated in
the lotus position within that boat. He was by himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Am I really…going
to sink?” Ning could already sense that his Dao-heart was growing
blurrier and blurrier. Clearly, it was becoming increasingly
corroded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning stared at the
distant Brightheart Island. That island had all the people he loved
the most; his father, his mother, Ninelotus, Yu Wei, Uncle White,
Little Qing, Autumn Leaf, Spring Grass, and his children. All of
those relationships, all of those emotions…they were like chains
that had dug their way deep inside him. As more time passed, the
chains only dug deeper and deeper. Thirty thousand years of life
here…it was incredibly hard for him to shake them off.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“But…!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning gritted his teeth,
blood becoming to come out from his eyes, ears, nose, and mouth as he
forced the words out. “It’s all fake. FAKE!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When Ning said these
words, he felt as though a knife was scraping against his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s all fake…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Because…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I want all of these
things to become real. I want all of them to come back to life in the
real world!” Ning’s Dao-heart was like a tiny blade of grass that
had become completely trapped by countless metal chains…but that
blade of grass continued to struggle and grow. Although the chains
tried to suffocate it, tried to drag it away, the blade of grass
continued to survive and grow.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I am myself!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I AM THE RULER OF
MYSELF! Nobody and nothing can shake me; not thirty thousand years,
not a hundred thousand years, NOTHING!!!” Ning sat there on his
wooden boat, letting out an enraged roar. This was a roar directed
against the entire demonheart world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Just as Ning called
these words out…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Rumble…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The colors of the world
began to change.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whooooosh.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Space itself broke
apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A towering figure
appeared within the distant, infinite void that was left. Its aura
was incomparably powerful, and it was looking at Ning.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“So you are Ji Ning?
You were the previous successor to the Starseizing Estate, yes? The
[Starseizing Hand] divine ability is not to be learned by outsiders.
I alone can possess it, and so…you can die!” An enormous hand
appeared, instantly covering the entire sky. Carrying awe-inspiring
power, it came crashing down.

Chapter 27 - Becoming Immortal
</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ji Ning just closed his
eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kill him?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Go ahead.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the demonheart
world; killing him here wouldn’t actually have an impact on his
Dao-heart. In addition…Ning had a certain feeling. He had spent
more than thirty thousand years within this demonheart world. He had
allowed himself to sink deeply into this world multiple times before
rousing himself once more. This had only resulted in his Dao-heart
becoming even stronger. This sudden appearance of a ‘new successor
to the Starseizing Estate’ was most likely the last trick the
demonheart tribulation had to play.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM! The giant palm
suddenly came to a halt directly above Ji Ning. It was mere inches
away from Ning. If Ning lifted his head up, he would be able to see
the enormous fingerprints of that massive palm.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why have you
halted…” Ning asked calmly, “…New master of the Starseizing
Estate.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You aren’t afraid
of death?” The towering figure said, slowing pulling back his
enormous, sky-covering hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If you want to kill
me, kill me,” Ning said coldly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I had thought that
killing a previous owner of the Starseizing Estate would be quite an
interesting affair…but you actually aren’t going to fight back at
all? How dull,” the towering figure said. Ning did his best to try
and make out what this new master of the Starseizing Estate looked
like, but he wasn’t able to see anything.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The towering figure
waved his hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Whoosh!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One figure after
another appeared in the air. There was a pair of white-robed Immortal
lovers; Ji Yichuan and Yuchi Snow. There was also a white-robed,
white-haired man who had an aura of calmness and tranquility about
him…an azure-robed maiden…the mature Autumn Leaf…the young
Spring Grass…Ning’s Dao-companions Yu Wei and Ninelotus…and
their three children.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son, have you
just grown more powerful?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why have you brought
us here?” Yuchi Snow and the others all raised their heads to look
towards the massive figure in confusion. They didn’t even give Ning
a glance.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s face instantly
changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning…you
understand now, right? Yes…as you have guessed…I just used the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art] to transform into your appearance,” the
towering figure said. “They believe me to be you! And, thanks to my
power…they are completely unable to see you or hear your voice.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What are you going
to do?” Ning roared.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The towering figure
suddenly stretched out with a single finger. He gave a single flick!
The flick landed on the body of the white-robed, white-haired man.
The man’s eyes were filled with disbelief…and with a boom, he
exploded, transforming into dust.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Uncle White!” Ning
called out in shock, feeling pain in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He bore tremendous love
for Uncle White in the real world, and he had also spent thirty
thousand years loving Uncle White in the demonheart world. Upon
seeing Uncle White be slaughtered…Ning instantly felt utter agony
in his heart, agony so great as to affect even his Dao-heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“There’s plenty
left. Don’t worry,” the towering figure said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What are you going
to do?!” Ning knew that this was just nothing more than another
illusion of the demonheart world…but the emotions he had built up
over thirty thousand years wouldn’t be so easily wiped away.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m going to kill
them, one by one,” the towering figure said. “But of course…if
you accept me as your master and owner, I can spare them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“In your dreams,”
Ning said through gritted teeth.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was no fool. He
knew that the demonheart tribulation was part of the Dao of the
Heavens; if he was to swear an oath to the Dao of the Heavens in the
demonheart world to be a servant, he would truly and forevermore be
lost.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Then I’ll continue
to kill.” The towering figure flicked his finger out again.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son, what are
you doing?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son, stop!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master…you are
going to kill me?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“FATHER!!!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The voices of his loved
ones caused Ning to feel as though his heart was being torn apart.
However…he gritted his teeth, just watching as they died, one by
one.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ning, son…I know
that you must be acting under some sort of duress.” Yuchi Snow
closed her eyes, dying peacefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning! What the
hell are you doing!” Ji Yichuan’s eyes were so wide, his eyelids
were threatening to tear apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Father. FATHER!”
The three children who venerated Ji Ning were all sobbing.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The slaughter
continued.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ninelotus died! Yu Wei
died! Little Qing died! One by one…all of his loved ones died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those emotional chains,
forged and tempered over the course of thirty thousand years, had
long ago wrapped themselves firmly around Ning. When he saw them all
be killed, one after the other…those chains began to tug at him
with greater power than ever before. They were going to pull Ning
down, to drag him under.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning…what a
callous heart you have.” The towering figure roared with anger.
These words pierced deeply into Ning’s inner heart; it was as
though his family members were all pointing at him and saying these
words. “What a callous heart you have.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning shut his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Even if all the people
of the universe were to point at him in such a manner…he didn’t
want for his family to point at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Thirty thousand years…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But in the end…it was
all fabricated.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All fabricated!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BOOM!!!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The world completely
blew apart. Everything blew apart; even that towering figure blew
apart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The real world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning has already
spent three full months within the deomnheart tribulation. This…this
is simply…I’ve never even heard of something like this!”
Immortal Diancai looked nervously at the seated black-robed Ning. “A
three month long demonheart tribulation…I really worry as to if Ji
Ning can withstand it.” His own demonheart tribulation had been far
briefer.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“My master’s
demonheart tribulation also lasted for three months.” Yu Wei
caressed her belly, a look of worry in her eyes. She still remembered
what Lu Dongbin had said to her: “Long ago…I was just a hair away
from truly sinking into the dreams. Even now, I would be unwilling to
undergo the demonheart tribulation a second time.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Hurry and wake up!”
Northson was truly worried as well.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">They all knew that the
longer the demonheart tribulation was, the more terrifying it would
be.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning’s demonheart
tribulation had actually persisted for three months; this was utterly
astonishing!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Why has the
Primaltwin’s demonheart tribulation lasted for so long? Is it due
to the karmic sinflames?” The distant elder in the Daoist robes was
watching quietly as well. All he could do was watch and wait; Ji Ning
would have no one to rely on but himself, if he wanted to wake up
from the demonheart tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Suddenly…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone’s gaze
turned towards Ji Ning…because the black-robed Ning had just opened
his eyes.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“He woke up,” Uncle
White said with surprise and joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master succeeded!
Wahahaha, he overcame his tribulation and became a Celestial
Immortal!” Little Qing seemed to have gone a bit delirious with
joy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother!” Yu Wei was extremely excited.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All of them were.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As for the black-robed
Ning, he just thought there. His thoughts, his mind…everything was
slowly coming back to him from the demonheart world. Only a long
moment later did he realize…that his face was covered with tears.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He loved and longed for
everything he had within the demonheart world. Everyone he cared
about was still alive. It had all been a dream…but that dream had
lasted for thirty thousand years, far longer than the mere century he
had spent in the real world. He wanted to forget it all, but…how?
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m sorry,” Ning
said softly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He knew that those
‘family members’ were all just an illusion…but Ning still said
those words.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No wonder Master
also shed tears after he successfully overcame his tribulation,”
Ning said softly to himself. “This demonheart tribulation really
is…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now, after having
escaped the demonheart world, did Ji Ning truly understand how
terrifying that illusory world had been. In truth, he had danced at
the very edge of truly falling into the abyss and never returning.
Things had grown especially dangerous for him after he accepted and
reciprocated the love of Yu Wei and Ninelotus! After having accepted
their love, he now had even more ties to that world.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However…fortune and
disaster rode together! Accepting their love did indeed make him sink
even deeper into the dream, but precisely because of that, when he
successfully struggled to shake off his chains and take control over
himself once more, his Dao-heart had reaped even more rewards.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If he hadn’t sunk
into the dream, he wouldn’t have been strengthened by the
awakening.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But if he had sunk too
deeply into it…he would have died.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fortunately, his
heartforce had reached the peak of the ‘ruler’ stage; otherwise,
he wouldn’t have been able to withstand the demonheart tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">……
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An Immortal melody rang
out as auspicious clouds descended from the heavens and golden
lotuses began to bloom throughout the area.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A terrifying presence
descended, pouring the energy of the natural world into Ning’s
body. The universe itself began to transform Ning’s Primaltwin.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“This is…?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The black-robed Ning
could clearly sense that the energy of the natural world, with the
invisible help of the Dao of the Heavens, had begun to compress all
of the energy within his body. His soul completely fused with his
golden-lotus Primal; in fact, even his Zifu Region began to merge
into the golden-lotus Primal, as well as the Sole-Ki Pearl of
Primalwater itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Crack!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The lotus seed-head at
the top of the golden lotus gave birth to a tiny little golden lotus
seed. This was the most important thing for Celestial Immortals, True
Immortals, and even Golden Immortals of the Great Firmament…the
golden pellet, the Jindan!
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the Jindan flew out,
the Zifu Region, the Sole-Ki Pearl, and everything else vanished. In
fact, the body of the Primaltwin Ning was changing as well,
transforming into a Celestial Immortal’s body, a body that was
designed and created through Celestial Immortal energy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Jindan?” The
black-robed Ning murmured to himself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This was the very core
of his entire life essence…this tiny little golden pellet.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This Jindan possessed
utterly inconceivable power. It merged all power into it, melting
everything into a dazzling, beautiful golden luster. A perfect Jindan
would contain even the soul and the truesoul within it; there would
never again be any distinction between them! In fact, the Jindan also
contained a dimension within it that held an enormous amount of
Celestial Immortal energy. The energy of the natural world was drawn
into the Jindan, and even magic treasures could be stored within it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Breathe in. Breathe
out. Ning sensed his body transcending, one breath at a time, as
Immortal energy flowed throughout his entire body.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only now did Immortal
Diancai and the others fly over. The black-robed Ning smiled towards
them in welcome.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Ji Ning,
congratulations on your Primaltwin overcoming the tribulation. Nine
nine-sets of thunder tribulation, and a three month demonheart
tribulation…I’ve never even imagined something like this
happening.” Immortal Diancai looked at Ning. “I, Diancai,
actually have a disciple like you…ahahaha, I regret nothing in
life, nothing!”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master, you are
absolutely incredible. I admire you to death!” Little Qing, in the
form of a little azure serpent, immediately coiled herself Ning’s
arm with incomparable friendliness.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’m actually
panicking right now,” Ning said with a laugh. “My Primaltwin’s
tribulation was already as frightening as this…I can’t even
imagine what my true body’s tribulation is going to be like.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It’s just another
tribulation. Nothing is impossible for you, senior
apprentice-brother,” Northson said. “When you went to take part
in the Conclave of Immortal Destiny, how many people tried to
convince you not to go? They all said that you didn’t spend enough
time training, that you’d be at a disadvantage. But not only did
you go, you even became the champion of the Conclave. Afterwards, you
only became more and more incredible. And now, you’ve actually
overcome nine nine-sets of thunder tribulation and a three month
demonheart tribulation. I’m completely convinced that nothing can
possibly stop you.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Me too.” Yu Wei
took Ning by the hand and smiled at him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Everyone present had
watched as Ning had grown up. In their eyes, Ning was an utterly
monstrous talent; he had stunned them time and time again. Thus, they
were convinced that Ning could do anything! After all, just now, they
had personally watched as Ning had overcome nine nine-sets of thunder
tribulation and a ridiculously long demonheart tribulation.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Disciple.” A voice
rang out, and the flow of time around them suddenly changed.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Yu Wei, Immortal
Diancai, and the others simply stood there, maintaining their earlier
postures and poses. Ning, however, didn’t feel as though anything
had happened at all. He watched as an old man in Daoist robes came
walking over towards him.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Master,” Ning said
respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have some things
to say to you,” the old man said. “Your Primaltwin was
successful, but I trust you noticed that your Celestial Tribulation
was incredibly powerful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Yes.” Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His Primaltwin,
logically speaking, should have it much easier than his true body…and
yet, it had still been forced to the brink.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your true body’s
tribulation will undoubtedly be utterly astonishing. There might be
some unexpected variables that will cause it to be many times more
deadly than this Celestial Tribulation,” Subhuti said. “Thus…I
order you to master the Grand Dao of the Sword, master the art of
applying heartforce to your soul, and reach the Sixth Cycle of the
[Eight-Nine Arcane Art] before you can attempt it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple
understands,” Ning said respectfully. “Your disciple shall
definitely work hard and make plentiful preparations.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“It is good that you
understand.” Subhuti nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right…once you
master the Grand Dao of the Sword,” Subhuti said, “Because you
have already condensed the five types of ki within your chest, you’ll
be able to join them together and instantly become a Pure Yang True
Immortal.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Now…the war
between your Grand Xia and the Seamless Gate is about to begin. You
won’t be able to avoid it. The Seamless Gate will definitely try to
come up with another way to kill you,” Subhuti said. “As the
saying goes, know thyself and know thy enemy; only then shall you be
the victor in every battle. You need to conceal your true power. You
absolutely must not let anyone know all of your secrets; once you are
exposed, you’ll be in danger.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple
understands,” Ning said hurriedly.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“No, you don’t.”
Subhuti shook his head. “I am forbidding you from telling anyone in
the future about your full power. That includes both myself and your
Dao-companion.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning was puzzled. “I
can’t even tell you or Yu Wei, Master?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“You cannot.”
Subhuti shook his head. “The intelligence methods the Seamless Gate
have available to them are beyond your imagination. If you hide
everything in your heart, no one but you will know and the Seamless
Gate will not find out either. But if you tell anyone at all…it
might be revealed to them. Thus, for the sake of hiding your power,
you are not to tell anyone at all about it.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt some
amazement in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No wonder…
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No wonder the
intelligence capabilities of the Seamless Gate were so powerful. So
long as he told anyone, there was a chance that it might be leaked to
them? This was utterly inconceivable.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“For example…on the
day that you become a Pure Yang True Immortal, you are not to tell
anyone at all,” Subhuti instructed. “The process of becoming a
Pure Yang True Immortal doesn’t cause much of a disturbance; if you
don’t tell anyone, no one will know.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning nodded.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was different from
when a Void-level Earth Immortal became a Celestial Immortal; a
Celestial Tribulation was involved. There truly wasn’t much of a
disturbance caused when a Celestial Immortal became a Pure Yang True
Immortal.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Once I become a Pure
Yang True Immortal, I won’t be able to hide my Pure Yang energy,”
Ning said.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I have a magic
incantation that you can use to hide your energy signature. So long
as you don’t attack someone, they won’t be able to realize your
true power.” Subhuti handed over a bamboo scroll.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning immediately
accepted it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The storm has come
to the Three Realms.” Subhuti let out a soft sigh. “The more the
enemy knows about your capabilities, the faster you will end up
dying. Your Grand Xia, for example…it holds multiple individuals
who have broken through to become Pure Yang True Immortals, but
they’ve been hiding it all along. Some have been hiding it for
trillions of years. The abilities of the Seamless Gate…there is
far, far too much that you do not know about them.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ning felt astonishment
in his heart.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So the Grand Xia
actually had multiple Pure Yang True Immortals hidden within it?
Still, that made sense; on the surface, the Xia Emperor claimed that
he was the sole Pure Yang True Immortal present. If that was true,
that really was quite pathetically weak.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“I’ve already given
you your instructions. Do not forget them. I won’t be able to
protect you at all times, during this storm; in fact, not even the
seven Empyrean Gods by your side might necessarily be able to emerge
from their Starseizer world to rescue you in time.” Subhuti looked
at Ning. “If you want to stay alive…you will primarily have to
rely on yourself.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“If my guess is
correct…”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Subhuti lifted his
head. “Both sides, the Grand Xia and the Seamless Gate, are already
secretly preparing to launch the war. I expect that it will explode
onto the stage within a month. You have to be careful.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After finishing his
words, Subhuti turned and walked away, departing gracefully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Your disciple shall
remember your words,” Ning said respectfully.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“What’s wrong, Ji
Ning?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Junior
apprentice-brother?”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Immortal Diancai and
the others next to Ning all returned to normal. Just now, the flow of
time had been changed for them, and so although Ning and Subhuti had
spent some time chatting, Immortal Diancai and the others only felt
as though an instant had passed. They didn’t see Patriarch Subhuti
at all; naturally, they had no idea as to what had just happened.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Nothing. My master
was helping to protect me; he just left.” Ning laughed. “Let’s
go. Let’s go back to Brightheart Island.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“Right.” They all
followed Ning in flying back towards Brightheart Island.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As they flew through
the air, they saw the Golden Crow beginning to rise.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">“The wind and the
rain are coming…” Ning mused silently to himself, “Within one
month, eh?”
